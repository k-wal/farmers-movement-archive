In a statement issued on Thursday, the teachers’ body said, “The undue haste with which during the course of the 296th EC meeting, decisions confirming the appointment of 13 chairpersons, 4 deans, 2 associate deans, 16 Statutory and non-statutory officers, 25 members of the academic council, a large number of “experts” and changes in the composition of the executive council were passed, points to an attempt to proxy control the bodies even after the V-C’s term is over.” JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar could not be contacted as calls and a text message sent to him remained unanswered.JNUTA said no criterion or rationale was provided for the appointments that were made and neither was any substantial discussion allowed during the meeting. JNUTA officer bearers also said EC members were not apprised about the relevant court decisions on matters pertaining to appointments. The teacher’s body said the proposal to establish a medical school was also passed by falsifying the minutes of the EC meeting. JNUTA said while a point on the agenda of the EC meeting specifically sought approval for the cancellation of a previous EC resolution (dated 17.8.1998) concerning the establishment of BC Roy Super Specialty Hospital and Medical Centre on the JNU Campus, in the minutes that were later brought out, a further decision was added which sought to approve the transfer of the “land earmarked for the proposed medical school” to the School of Engineering and Atal Bihari Vajpayee School of Management and Entrepreneurship. “JNUTA strongly condemns the devious manner in which earmarked land approved for one project 23 years ago is sought to be transferred to another through a false recording of the minutes,” the teacher’s body said. The body also expressed its disapproval over the renewal of contract with the current security agency in light of the January 5 attack on campus. They said the contract was renewed despite the agency’s failure to prevent incidents of violence and burglaries on campus.Meanwhile, the JNU students’ union on Thursday continued with its indefinite protest outside the dean of students’ office for the fourth consecutive day. Protesting students are demanding that the dean approves the phase-wise return of students to campus, commencement of hostel allotment to first-year students and the batch of 2020, along with issuance of ID cards, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jnu-teachers-body-condemns-hasty-decisions-of-varsity-body-101631212196979.html

On failing to get a sizable amount from India, we would be looking forward to foreign contributions, once we are done with formalities,” said Athar Hussain, spokesperson for IICF.The Dhannipur project has been named after freedom fighter and revolutionary Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah Faizabadi.So far, the board has received around ₹34 lakh in its account that became functional in October 2020. Rohit Srivastava, an employee with the faculty of law at University of Lucknow, was the first to contribute to the project that would cost around ₹800 crore. Srivastava donated ₹21,000 for the Dhannipur project.The board members said ₹300 crore would be utilised in the construction of hospital, while the remaining amount would be spent on construction of the mosque, Indo-Islamic centre and community kitchen. The first phase of the project, the estimated cost of which is ₹100 crore, was expected to take off by the next month, the board members said.“Some approvals from the development authority and some paper work is pending with the development authority. The approval is expected soon,” said Hussain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dhannipur-project-in-ayodhya-trust-formed-by-sunni-board-may-look-for-foreign-contributions-101631211598036.html

It is believed to be the site of a temple built during the rule of the Gupta dynasty. Here we excavated two pillars on which there is an inscription about Kumargupta, the powerful ruler of Gupta dynasty, in ‘sankh lipi’ (conch script or shell script) typical of the fifth century AD,” informed Vasant Swarnkar, superintending archaeologist of Agra circle of ASI on Thursday. ‘”These inscriptions related to Kumargupta are already published and are well-known. At present cleaning work is underway at the site,” he said. “When further excavation was undertaken to know the depth of the two pillars, we traced a well-finished stair and thereafter three more stairs, indicating that they must have been part of the entrance to a temple. In the centre there was a platform but cleaning work was stopped as there was no space. The fourth stair was the biggest and there were inscriptions in ‘sankh lipi’ (conch script or shell script) typical of fifth century,” said Swarnkar. “The inscription was deciphered as ‘Mahendraditya’ which was the title of king Kumargupta who had even conducted ‘ashwamedh yagya’ during his rule. The statue of a horse having similar inscription is at the state museum in Lucknow,” he said. “These excavations and inscription make us believe that they were part of a temple like structure but it is unknown as to which god or deity the temple is dedicated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gupta-period-stairs-pillars-found-in-etah-101631211596907.html

The two have been at large ever since the anticipatory bail was rejected, according to the police.A complaint in the matter was lodged by Amit Dattatray Ghule (42), a resident of Manjri, Haveli. He has two complete projects in rural areas, completed before registration rules changed and the government made it mandatory for old rural constructions to be registered retrospectively, according to Police inspector Jitendra Kadam of Bhosari police station who is investigating the case.The couple met the complainant at the sub-registrar’s office in Dapodi in April when the man was trying to get his registration done.The two offered their services to get 13 of his flats registered. The two forged documents from Rera as well as PMRDA to falsely show successful registration of Ghule’s projects. They managed to forge papers for seven of 13 flats in two projects. They took a total of ₹13,08,000 from the complainant.“The papers were submitted to the sub-registrar’s office where one of them has signed as a lawyer. The sub-registrar found something amiss and upon investigation found that the documents were fake and informed the complainant. Later when the complainant and the accused were called for mediation, the man was trying to tell even the police that he was a lawyer while his wife was not,” said PI Kadam.The police are now on a lookout for the two and will be investigating if they have duped other people by posing as lawyers.The decision was taken by Judge GG Bhalchandra with public prosecutor Premkumar Agarwal.A case under Sections 429 (personation), 420 (cheating), 465 467, 468, 471, and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered at Bhosari police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/anticipatory-bail-for-couple-who-duped-builder-of-13-lakh-denied-101631211054608.html
09-09-2021||Mumbai||Chhagan Bhujbal, son, nephew discharged in Maharashtra Sadan case||A special anti-corruption bureau (ACB) court on Thursday discharged from the Maharashtra Sadan scam Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal, his son Pankaj and nephew Sameer, along with then public works department (PWD) secretary Deodatta Marathe, and employees of Bhujbal’s Mumbai Educational Trust (MET) Tanveer Shaikh, Iram Shaikh, Sanjay Joshi and Geeta Joshi. Earlier, the court had discharged five accused – Arun Deodhar, Krishna Chamankar, Pravina Chamankar, Pranita Chamankar and Prasanna Chamankar. On Thursday, Bhujbal and Sameer were present in the court, when special ACB judge HS Satbhai pronounced its order discharging him and others from the case. Bhujbal, who wore a light blue kurta and a purple shawl, was accompanied by several bodyguards who waited at the court verandah. Bhujbal’s five to six supporters waited outside the courtroom for the leader. Senior counsel Prasad Dhakephalkar, Sajal Yadav and Sudarshan Khawase who had appeared for the Bhujbals and had filed discharge application under section 227 of the Criminal Procedure Code had said that there was no loss to the state exchequer and all allegations made against the applicants were false based on wrong calculations, assumptions and presumptions. Despite filing a charge sheet running into thousands of pages in 2016, the agency has been unable to show sufficient evidence against the accused to frame charges and proceed with the trial. All decisions were taken by the Cabinet Infrastructure Committee (CIC) and the meeting was headed by then chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh wherein several other ministers and senior bureaucrats had also taken part. Developer KS Chamankar Enterprises was not selected by Bhujbal, but appointed by the Slum Dwellers and Slum Rehabilitation Authority, the lawyers said. The lawyers further argued before the judge that there was no material to show that the Bhujbals got any monetary gain in the matter or that he was behind helping the developer get quantum benefits. They had argued that there is no evidence of any irregularities of corruption by Bhujbal as then state minister of the Public Works Department (PWD) and the then deputy chief minister. They had claimed there was no material to support the allegations of cheating, conspiracy and forgery. Special public pleader Ajay Misar for the state ACB had objected to the discharge application and had told the court that the Bhujbals had received kickbacks for giving the work to KS Chamankar Enterprises. There was already a 20,000-page charge sheet filed in the matter against 14 accused. Misar had further argued there were 14 accused in the matter, who despite being minister, bureaucrats, developers and architects had hatched a conspiracy of causing wrongful loss to the state government and wrongful gain to the developer and for that a false status report cum proposal cum feasibility report having an inappropriate calculations of prospective profits to the developer was prepared and submitted to the committee of ministers and got the proposal sanctioned by the committee in its meeting from June 5, 2006 to August 28, 2006. The committee was misled to solicit the sanction to the proposal of the developer. Activist Anjali Damania who was also a whistleblower in the matter had also joined the case as an intervenor and had submitted her written submissions opposing the application of discharge. While discharging the directors of KS Chamankar Enterprises, the court had observed in its previous orders in August that the ACB had registered the FIRs in a hurry. Most of the calculations in the matter were made by Narendra Talegaonkar who was the ACP with ACB; he was neither an architect nor an engineer and he was no expert to do calculations related to said matters. The ACB had registered an FIR against all accused on June 11, 2015, much before the appointment of an architect who is an expert on such matters who was officially appointed on June 30, 2015. The architect had submitted a report on June 9, 2015, but prior to it on June 4 a sanction was asked to register an FIR in the case where points of the report were mentioned. The court had further said that the PWD report came in December 2015, which said that there was no illegality in the contract and the feasibility report was prepared as per prevailing rules and practices followed in PWD however the FIR was already registered by then by the ACB on June 11, 2015. Background The case dates back to 2005 when Bhujbal was the Public Works Department (PWD) minister. The contract for the Maharashtra Sadan was allegedly given out without inviting tenders to KS Chamankar Enterprises. The ACB had registered a case in the matter in 2015 after the Bombay High Court had observed there was prima facie evidence and ACB can register FIR if a case of corruption is made out. The ACB had registered a case against 11 people alleging that a developer was favoured for a project under which an RTO land in Andheri was to be handed over for a project in lieu of construction to the tune of ₹100 crore at Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi and RTO building in Tardeo. The ACB had filed a charge sheet in the matter in 2016 against Bhujbal and others. Bhujbal was arrested in March 2016, by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a case related to money laundering after the Maharashtra Sadan Scam. The ACB arrested Bhujbal the same month and he managed to get bail in June in the ACB case however managed to get bail in the ED case only in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/chhagan-bhujbal-son-nephew-discharged-in-maharashtra-sadan-case-101631210275247.html

09-09-2021||Gurugram||Municipal services to be hit as MCG staff announce indefinite protest in support of suspended engineer||Municipal services in the city are likely to be hit as officials and contractual workers of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) are set to go on an indefinite strike from Friday, demanding the reinstatement of a suspended superintending engineer (SE).MCG officials and contractual workers on Thursday refused to carry out their work in the offices and held a demonstration at the MCG’s Sector 34 office.“Due to the strike, municipal services will take a hit and the public will be inconvenienced. However, it is unavoidable as we want the MCG and the ULB [Urban Local Bodies] to reinstate the SE,” TL Sharma, the MCG’s chief engineer, said.Services such as internal roads and drains, garbage collection and streetlights, among others, are likely to be affected.On Monday, the SE, Ramesh Sharma, and the mayor, Madhu Azad, clashed during a review meeting with regard to clearing a blocked drain in Ward 22. While Azad alleged dereliction of duty and misbehaviour by Sharma, he alleged that the mayor took action as he refused to carry out favours.On Wednesday, Azad and a group of councillors met ULB minister Anil Vij during his visit to the city and demanded action against the SE. On Vij’s direction, the ULB suspended Sharma.However, the ULB’s order evoked strong opposition from MCG employees. The MCG’s engineering wing initially observed a “pen down” protest on Thursday, but they received support from other wings, with most of the civic body’s senior officials and workers from other branches joining them, along with the sanitation workers and their union.Although officials and workers were present at MCG offices, official work was not carried out as they gathered in a garden on the MCG’s Sector 34 office premises.A senior MCG official, requesting anonymity, said that additional commissioner Rohtash Bishnoi, on behalf of MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, requested a group of officials and workers’ union to visit the commissioner at his camp office in Civil Lines to discuss the matter but they refused.“The union and officials wanted the MCG commissioner to come to the Sector 34 office to discuss the matter. However, the commissioner did not visit MCG office,” the official said.Ahuja said, “I met with both the SE and chief engineer today (Thursday), asking them to withdraw the strike. They said they will consult with other workers and their union, and get back to me. I am still awaiting their response on the matter.”Ahuja said that he directed senior MCG officials to pacify the protesting staff by explaining that the SE could register his version of events with higher authorities and that the issue will be investigated.“We have to obey and respect the office-bearers as they are public representatives. Further, I have directed all MCG staff members to discharge their duties as per usual and ensure no public services get affected,” said Ahuja.Sharma, however, declined that he met the MCG commissioner. “Only the chief engineer met the MCG commissioner today (Thursday). My colleagues are aware of my working style, which is transparent and completely honest. In my support, they will be staging an indefinite protest,” Sharma said.Azad said, “I have already given my representation to the ULB and they have, accordingly, taken action against the SE. Although I accept the protest by MCG workers and officials, regardless of their or my stance on the matter, I only request them to not do it at the public’s cost. This is an internal matter and public services should not be affected.”Thursday’s demonstration was the first instance of a protest by MCG officials since its inception in 2008.“The SE’s suspension was incorrect as he did not do anything wrong. He has always worked in a transparent and fair manner. We want him reinstated and from tomorrow (Friday) will carry out an indefinite strike until it is done,” TL Sharma said.On Thursday evening, the MCG commissioner issued an order to all heads of MCG branches to maintain decorum and respect all office-bearers.In a related issue, Ahuja stated in the order that only “members of the meetings” (MCG officials and councillors) can attend meetings about administrative matters and business of the MCG, according to the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994. This was in reference to the presence of relatives of councillors, which has been a common practice.“There is no reason or right that relatives of councillors should be present at MCG meetings. They unnecessarily create ruckus and get into arguments. We support the MCG commissioner’s order on this and hope it paves the way for the civic body to function in a more efficient manner,” TL Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/municipal-services-to-be-hit-as-mcg-staff-announce-indefinite-protest-in-support-of-suspended-engineer-101631209198812.html

Despite this, the two officials rejected the application without any justification. Such kind of arbitrary actions will not be tolerated. Whether it is a domestic consumer or a commercial consumer, DHBVN officials must ensure that decisions are taken on merit,” Meena said.According to details shared by DHBVN, a private industrial firm had applied for a non-domestic (NDS) connection and deposited the requisite amount after a demand notice was issued by the company. An independent feeder was erected by the consumer and the infrastructure was also inspected, following which the application was rejected.Meena directed DHBVN officials to ensure that applications for electricity connections be issued within the stipulated time and better service be provided to consumers. He warned officials against negligence in duty pertaining to consumer services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dhbvn-officials-suspended-for-denying-commercial-power-connection-101631209197653.html

DTCP officials said that since the licence of the colony was cancelled, the registration of the property deeds must be automatically stopped. “We have informed the revenue department regarding the cancellation of the licence of the colony and asked to stop registration of deeds,” RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said. Officials said that despite repeated notices, the developer failed to comply with directions to clear the issues regarding the title deeds of a few plots. The developer, however, said that they had already obtained a stay from the high court in this matter. “We have already obtained a stay in the matter pertaining to the cancellation of licence. What can we do if such an order has been issued?” Anil Hasija, the vice-president of Ardee Infrastructure Private Limited, said. The DTCP’s move was also opposed by the residents. They demanded that instead of a blanket ban, the sale and registration of the properties owned by the developer should be stopped.Pravin Yadav, the president of Ardee City residents’ association, said, “All the residents will suffer due to this decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ardee-city-registrations-to-be-stopped-after-dtcp-cancels-licence-101631209196488.html
09-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram’s sectors 81 to 95 to get roads after several delays||Construction of two major sector dividing roads between sectors 81 and 95, a longstanding demand of residents, is likely to happen soon as the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on Tuesday demarcated land for the same. Officials said that the plots will be transferred to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), which will undertake construction of the roads.Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP, said that they demarcated a 400-metre stretch on which the road between sectors 81 and 82 has to be constructed. “Due to non-availability of this land, this crucial sector road could not be completed. The land will now be transferred to the GMDA whenever they want it. This road will connect National Highway-48 with the Pataudi highway,” he said. GMDA officials, however, said that the structures on the demarcated land must be removed first before the handover. “The demarcation of land is fine but the HSVP must remove the existing structures and hand it over to GMDA. As soon as the land is handed over to us, we will construct the road,” Shweta Sharma, executive engineer, GMDA, said. The other important road will be constructed between sectors 81 and 81A, for which another 400-metre stretch has been demarcated, officials said. These roads have been pending for the past three years, due to which residents have been facing problems in commute, especially during monsoon, due to potholes and waterlogging.Pravin Malik, a resident of Sare Homes in Sector 92, said that completion of these roads will greatly boost connectivity and help residents move with ease. “During monsoon, the problem becomes more acute due to waterlogging in these areas. Also, the value of property has gone down due to lack of access roads, but this will be corrected after these roads are made,” said Malik. However, residents also sought clarity on the status of land litigation and if the court decided in favour of HSVP or if this was a routine exercise.HSVP officials said that encroachments in other pockets are also being removed on priority and a major drive has been planned for next week to eliminate any hindrances to the construction process. “The authority has also planned a large-scale drive next week to clear all encroachments from land which are needed to construct missing roads in these sectors. The patches which are free of litigation have been identified and these will be cleared,” said Lot. Officials also identified encroachments and obstacles on plots needed to construct sector-dividing roads between sectors 81 and 86, 94 and 95, 82 and 82A, 90 and 93, 82A and 82A, and 86 and 90. In July, HSVP formed two committees to expedite the transfer of land to GMDA for construction of roads as well as completion of pending sewage and stormwater projects in developing sectors. The committees were constituted after the chief principal secretary to the chief minister directed officials to complete pending infrastructure works in new sectors on priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrams-sectors-81-to-95-to-get-roads-after-several-delays-101631209195256.html

Door-to-door surveys will be conducted and medicines will also be provided to children,” said health minister Jai Pratap Singh. The minister informed that the government noticed loopholes in the working of officials and that’s the main reason for the viral outbreak in the city.The surge in viral fever cases had been reported amongst children in various hospitals of Lucknow.Speaking on viral fever cases, SK Nanda, chief medical superintendent of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee hospital in Lucknow, said: “Till now, we have around 20 patients admitted due to viral fever and around 80 cases in the outpatient department (OPD).”“The cases are not so severe right now and we are doing the platelet count to check the cases of dengue,” he added.“Dengue mosquitoes breed in clean water, hence people should follow preventive steps including removing sources of mosquito breeding such as stagnant water from the house and its surroundings. Wearing full sleeves shirts and trousers can save people from mosquito bite,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. “In Lucknow, health officials inspected 1,404 houses and found mosquito larvae in 14. Notices were served to all such places where larvae were found,” said Dr Manoj Agrawal, chief medical officer, Lucknow.

09-09-2021||Lucknow||ABA election: Lawyers move SC against HC’s Lucknow bench decision||The Allahabad high court’s Lucknow bench order regarding election of the Awadh Bar Association of the high court has been challenged in the Supreme Court. Earlier this week, lawyers Amit Sachan and Alok Tripathi filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court challenging the high court’s August 24 and 27 order cancelling the election process and imposing some restrictions while conducting election of the Awadh Bar Association afresh. The petitioners have pointed out that once the Bar Council of India and Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh have verified credential of advocates and issued certificate of practice (CoP), how can a lawyer be barred from contesting election or casting vote in the bar association election of which he/she is a member. The Awadh Bar Association elections held on August 14 were cancelled by the returning officer due to the alleged misconduct of lawyers. A division bench of Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh took suo motu cognizance of the incident on August 16. The high court on August 24 cancelled the entire election process of the ABA and issued a set of guidelines for conducting fresh election on September 25. Hearing a recall application on August 27, the court relaxed guidelines issued by it for the ABA election. The court relaxed conditions of becoming a valid voter and issued new guidelines for it. Guidelines for ABA polls-The period of three years to be reduced to two years (for listing of cases) -Minimum cases filed in a year for last two years will be 10 cases for 2019 and five cases for the year 2020 -Lawyers whose houses are on Lucknow-Barabanki road or in colonies on the Lucknow-Barabanki road will be treated as residents of Lucknow -Advocate-Oath Commissioners shall be treated as regular practitioners -All the chamber allottees will be included in the definition of regular practitioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aba-election-lawyers-move-sc-against-hc-s-lucknow-bench-decision-101631208835157.html

In the last one week, private hospitals have seen more vaccinations for second-dose beneficiaries than government hospitals. On Thursday, 61,364 beneficiaries were inoculated in the district, as per the CoWin app. So far, a total of 6,402,749 beneficiaries have received the first dose and 2,513,206 beneficiaries have received their second dose.As per authorities, on September 7, 129,647 beneficiaries received their first dose at government hospitals, whereas only 7,282 beneficiaries took their first jab at private vaccination centres. Whereas 38,387 beneficiaries received their second dose at government hospitals and 15,262 beneficiaries received their second jab at private hospitals in the district. With a regular supply of vaccine doses, Pune district on September 7 inoculated 190,398 beneficiaries. On Tuesday, around 75.4 per cent of beneficiaries were in the age group of 18 to 44 years. And 15.7 per cent beneficiaries were from the age group of 45 to 60 years; 7.3 per cent beneficiaries were 60 years of age and above. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “There is a steady flow of second-dose beneficiaries at the hospital. As many beneficiaries have completed 84 days after their first jab, they are coming to the private centres for the second inoculation. As compared to when we started vaccination at our hospital, the overall daily number is the same, but we can see that the second-dose beneficiaries are more in number now as compared to the first-dose beneficiaries. Many citizens are trying for free vaccines at government centres. However, they are also not delaying their vaccination now and choosing a private centre,” said Dr Kelkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2nddose-beneficiaries-opt-for-pvt-hosps-to-not-delay-vaccinations-101631207394371.html

However, suicide can be prevented in many ways,” Dr Kumar said.On a personal level, getting enough rest, eating regular meals and staying hydrated, connecting with family and friends, discussing problems with someone trustworthy, indulging in relaxing activities and exercising regularly all help in improving one’s mental health, she said. “Also, set short‐term goals and act on them. As a result of keeping the mind and body active and occupied, there is less time to dwell on fears and worries,” she advised.About the need to create more awareness regarding suicide prevention, especially during the pandemic, Arnavaz Damania, founder of Connecting Trust, an NGO working to create awareness against suicide, said that suicide survivors face negatives such as stigma, discrimination and medico-legal inquiries. “During the pandemic, stress, anxiety, depression, and suicide attempts/deaths were on the rise which reflected in calls and emails. Our distress helpline volunteers responded to 2,427 calls and 717 emails between April 2020 and March 2021. Our survivor support programme is actually a field programme where our volunteers, through hospital and community visits, meet suicide survivors and provide them with emotional support. Looking at the situation during the pandemic, we took our survivor support programme telephonically from Sept 2020 to reach out to suicide survivors and managed to reach 69 survivors just within seven months till March 2021,” said Damania.She added that children are also facing stress during the pandemic.“During the pandemic, we took our peer educator programme online with three schools and reached out to 920 students, 178 parents, and 120 teachers through our orientation. During this academic year, 160 students became peer educators ready to support their peers. We reached out to 2,976 people in this manner. All this was possible because of the hard work and dedication of our volunteers towards the cause,” said Damania.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/world-suicide-prevention-day-psychiatrists-say-depression-anxiety-on-the-rise-may-get-worse-101631207094396.html

For the first time, we have given a chance to 15% women in the main executive committee otherwise they were kept busy only in the women’s cell.”“As new areas got merged with the PMC, the city now comes under the jurisdiction of 11 MLAs and 3 MPs. The Pune, Baramati and Khed Lok Sabha constituencies are part of the PMC. We have given representation to all the areas,” Jagtap said.All positions except OBC president, student union president and those in the youth wing have been announced.

The civic body had initiated the project in February 2018 at a cost of ₹2,550 crore but the newly-floated tender has raised total project cost, and activists are now demanding action against the concerned officials for their lackadaisical supervision.Nandkumar Jagtap, superintendent engineer of the water supply department, said, “We have floated a tender for purchasing and laying transmission lines across the city. There are two methods to quantify transmission lines. One is running metres (length) and the other is weight. Earlier, consultants considered transmission lines in running metres. During calculation of the transmission lines, the consultant made an error and calculated a quantity of 7,500 metric tonne instead of 15,000 metric tonne. The contractor purchased a quantity of 7,500 metric tonne of transmission lines as mentioned in the detailed project report prepared by the consultant. We realised this while laying the transmission lines. Therefore, we floated a tender of ₹52 crore for the transmission lines.”“We have saved money on the project while laying the pipelines in redesign. We have also used the existing pipe network which is in good condition and as per our specifications. Therefore, we will utilise the saved money in the transmission line tender,” Jagtap claimed.However, Vivek Velankar, a civic activist, said, “The PMC should take legal action against the consultant and blacklist him. It should also take strict action against the officials responsible. After all, it is the duty of the officials to cross-check information. It has become common for PMC officials to blindly trust consultants and contractors, which must stop. And it will stop only when someone is punished. The corporation is paying hefty salaries out of the taxpayers’ money.”“Even in the closed pipeline project from Khadakwasla to Parvati, the contractor implemented a faulty design and the PMC had to spend additional crores of rupees to lay another closed pipeline to fetch water from the Khadakwasla dam to the Parvati water pumping and purification station,” Velankar said.Work on the transmission lines’ project – which aims at safe and equitable water supply to all areas for the next 30 years – began last December. The PMC originally awarded the project contract to Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) and Jain Irrigation. However, only L&T is now working on the project with PMC having nixed the contract of Jain Irrigation which was supposed to cover the Hadapsar area.When the laying of transmission lines across the city is complete, water will be supplied 24x7; water losses will be reduced; and technological, economic and environmental sustainability of the water supply service will be ensured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/24x7-water-project-pmc-calculation-error-results-in-fresh-52-cr-tender-101631206854326.html
09-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court refuses bail to two accused in fake vaccination scam||The sessions court on Thursday rejected bail applications of two accused arrested for allegedly organising fake vaccination camps at Podar Centre, Parel and other places in Mumbai in May. The accused put several lives at risk by administering fake vaccines and they may threaten witnesses if released on bail, additional sessions judge Chitra Hankare said while rejecting the bail pleas of Shrikhant Mane, a resident of Kalyan, and Seema Ahuja, a resident of Majiwada in Thane. The judge said that as the investigation is ongoing, if granted bail, the accused may tamper with evidence and jump bail. The duo had approached the court for bail in a case registered against them at Bhoiwada police station. They had said they knew one Mahendra Singh, an employee of Malad Medical Association, who had shown his willingness to carry out vaccination drives for corporates, and that the accused agreed to participate in the drive as they believed Singh. Ahuja further claimed that she herself and some of her relatives got vaccinated in one of the camps organised by the group.As per their statement, Singh had told them that vaccination certificates would be generated in 10 days but later when certificates were not generated, he started giving excuses. The accused further claimed that they had also lodged a complaint against Singh at Bhoiwada, Borivli and Nagpada police stations. Thus, the applicants claimed, they were innocent and falsely implicated in the case and had fallen prey to Singh’s scam. They said that they had no mala fide intention in arranging the vaccination camps.The prosecution opposed the bail applications saying the offence was of serious nature and various offences are registered in the city against the accused. It further claimed that the handwriting and signature samples of the accused are yet to be taken, charge sheet is yet to be filed in the case and the investigation is on. The prosecution added that accused may threaten witnesses if released on bail which may hamper the investigations as the main accused is yet to be arrested.Judge Hankare, while rejecting the bail applications, observed that the accused are travel consultants by profession and had arranged trips for Malad Medical Association and that they knew various doctors of Malad Medical Association; hence they should have confirmed all the legal necessities for the vaccination camps.On May 28 and 29, the group had organised a vaccination camp at Podar Centre in Parel in which around 207 staff members of the institute were vaccinated. The duo had coordinated with Singh and four others for the camp and had received ₹244,000 for the same.The vaccination scam came to light after Hiranandani Heritage Society in Kandivli approached the police saying they were duped by Singh and four others who administered fake vaccines to their society members on May 30. The society members claimed they received vaccination certificates which had names of different hospitals and different dates, and the same was not reflected on Co-Win portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-refuses-bail-to-two-accused-in-fake-vaccination-scam-101631206675033.html

The circular was issued on September 3 by the Pune Crime Branch citing that the “co-borrower may leave the country anytime with malafide intention”. The circular was issued after the state government received a letter from the Centre, which was approached by the lending firm. “The agency which had lent money to Rane wrote to centre. They wrote a letter to state government and accordingly it has reached the Maharashtra DG’s office. The DG has the right to take appropriate action and hence, it came to Pune police,” said Maharashtra’s home minister Dilip Walse-Patil on Thursday in Pune. The 1ookout circular was served days after Rane’s father, Union minister Narayan Rane, was arrested by the Raigad police for his “would have slapped the CM” remarks. As per the lookout circular, Airline Properties controlled by Nilam Rane had taken a loan of ₹25 crore from Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL), while Nitesh Rane had taken loan of ₹34 crore for Nilam Hotels. The accounts were later classified as non-performing assets, as loan amounts outstanding. “In the aforesaid circumstances, there is an apprehension and fear that the said co-borrower may leave the country anytime with malafide intension to evade repayment of the loan granted by DHFL and escape legal actions that may be taken against him (civil/criminal) by DHFL,” stated the LOC, signed by deputy commissioner of police (Crime branch) Shrinivas Ghadge. “Both were business loans. Neelam Rane took a loan of ₹27,13,18,931 for Artline Properties Pvt Ltd and Nitesh Rane took ₹34,09,61,771 for Neelam Hotels Pvt Ltd. Both are now non-performing assets,” said Ghadge. Responding to the lookout notice, Nitesh Rane, an MLA from Sindhudurg, said the action is being taken under pressure from the MVA government. “We are in the process of trying to settle the loan and correspondence in this regard is underway with the finance firm. Yet, a lookout notice was issued against us. This is being done under pressure from the state government,” Rane told a TV channel. The circular addressed to assistant director (administration), Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, stated, “Whenever the said co-borrower is intercepted at the airport, please inform the crime branch of his arrival and departure.” The BJP reacted sharply to the lookout notice against Rane saying the MVA government is bringing politics everywhere. “I do not know the technical aspects of this case. However, a lookout notice is served against a person when s/he fails to appear before investigating agencies, despite repeated summons. In this case, police are acting under pressure from their masters in the MVA government,” said BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-police-lookout-notice-for-narayan-rane-s-wife-neelam-and-son-nitesh-101631206555490.html

She will interact with party leaders and get their feedback on the selection of candidates. A list of 40 to 50 (would-be) candidates has been worked out and Priyanka has spoken to some of these leaders in recent weeks. The PEC and the party’s advisory and strategy committees will also take a call on the issue of going it alone or likely alliance for the 2022 polls,” said a senior Congress leader on condition of anonymity.As many probable candidates may include UPCC office bearers, the party could consider making arrangements to run the organisation during the polls. Those whose names are being considered final and are set to figure on the first list for the 2022 polls include Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Aradhana Mishra “Mona”, former MLA Lalitesh Tripathi, former MLA Anugraha Narain Singh and former MLA Pankaj Malik, along with some other UPCC office bearers. After her arrival, Priyanka was closeted with senior party leaders to get feedback on various political and organisational issues. She will preside over a meeting of the Pradesh Election Committee, the UPCC office bearers and the party’s advisory committee on Friday.“Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will attend the first meeting of PEC. The party has received recommendations from the District Congress Committees and City Congress Committees as well. PEC will discuss these lists and may also seek suggestions from leaders, including those from frontal organisations, before sending them to CEC for final approval,” said a party functionary.At a meeting in New Delhi early this week, Priyanka asked the party’s secretaries in charge of various districts to get a report about the functioning of the party organisation at various levels.“Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will meet secretaries and district/city unit presidents who have been asked to come up with a report about the activities of the party organisation in the districts under their charge. She will also review progress of “Har Gaon Congress” (Congress in every village) and the Prashikshan Se Parakram (Training for valour) programmes,” said UPCC organisation secretary Anil Yadav.Priyanka is likely to undertake a visit to Rae Bareli on September 12 and 13. Rae Bareli is the Lok Sabha constituency of Congress president Sonia Gandhi.“We have indications that Priyanka Gandhi will be visiting Rae Bareli and meet the party workers. We are keenly waiting for her visit that has been delayed obviously due to the Covid-19 restrictions,” said a party leader from Rae Bareli.A party leader from Amethi said there was the possibility of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s visit to Amethi as well.“If Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is holding review sessions it may be a bit late. This should have been a constant process and not undertaken only at the time of elections. If this would have been done earlier it could have been more advantageous,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/congress-in-poll-mode-in-uttar-pradesh-priyanka-arrives-in-lucknow-for-feedback-on-candidates-101631206376282.html

Once again, applications for government institutes are higher and this shows in allotment statistics as well. As per information shared by the DVET, there are 417 government-funded and 559 private ITIs in the state. This takes the total intake capacity of the institutes to 1.33 lakh, which includes 92,311 seats in government institutions and 53,948 seats in private institutions. “Government ITIs give students the option of fee reimbursement, as well as provide better internship and job opportunities after the two-year course ends. Such reasons attract more students to government institutions,” said the principal of a government ITI in the city. Nearly 2.86 lakh Class 10 pass-outs registered for admissions this year, of which, 2.62 lakh completed the registration process by paying the necessary fee. In the first round, 75.061 (81.3%) of seats in government institutes have been allotted and 15,480 (37.9%) seats in private institutes have been allotted.“The overall allotment doesn’t necessarily convert into confirmed admissions. DVET will be conducting four rounds of admissions followed by one round of counselling, so several students end up waiting till the last round hoping to bag a seat in a government ITI,” said Yogesh Patil, joint director, DVET. He added that the last date of admissions is October 15 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iti-admissions-underway-68-per-cent-seats-allotted-in-first-round-in-maharashtra-101631206195006.html

MSRTC has additional buses plying several routes. Covid norms like social distancing are being maintained at all the ST stands in the Pune division. “For the last one week we have increased the number of buses on major routes like Kolhapur, Satara, Aurangabad, and Solapur for the Ganpati festival. After the Gauri visarjan day people start travelling. Once the festival ends, the number of passengers coming back to the city will also increase,” said MSRTC Pune divisional controller Ramakant Gaikwad. Prior to the state-wide lockdown, on an average, 850 buses used to run from the Pune MSRTC division daily. A majority of the buses would start from three major ST stands in Pune – Swargate ST stand, the newly started ST stand at Wakdewadi (earlier at Shivajinagar) and the Pune railway station ST stand. Private tourist buses are not seeing the same passenger foot-fall. “There is certainly less business this year and not many passengers are travelling due to the Covid pandemic. Already, a large number of students who were studying in Pune are not there and now even the working people are travelling less,” said Santosh Kadam, owner of Isha travel agency in Swargate. Ashok Shewale, secretary of the ST bus passengers group, Pune, said, “Pune is the city where hundreds of thousands of students come to study and youth come in search of job opportunities. Due to the pandemic all these passengers have gone away. Once people know they are getting an ST bus to their desired destination, the flow of passengers will increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/msrtc-reports-increase-in-passengers-travelling-home-for-ganesh-fest-101631206134339.html

Mumbai-Nagpur high-speed corridorThe National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), which is building the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed train corridor (also called bullet train), has completed its ridership survey for the 753km Mumbai-Nagpur high-speed corridor project.“The detailed project report (DPR) for the Mumbai and Nagpur project will be prepared. Finalisation of alignment is being done and social impact assessment and environment impact assessment are ongoing,” said a senior NHSRCL official.The travel time between the two cities is expected to reduce by 50%. Presently, the fastest travel distance between Mumbai and Nagpur is 11.30 hours.Mumbai-Pune corridorFor the Mumbai-Pune corridor, a feasibility study has been initiated.After conducting the feasibility study, an assessment of land acquisition required for the project will be done, later the project will be sent for approval to the government of Maharashtra and the railway ministry.If the project is approved the travel time between Mumbai and Pune is likely to reduce to nearly 90 minutes. Presently it takes three hours to reach Pune from Mumbai by outstation trains operated by the Central Railway. “The project is at an initial stage and a feasibility study is being conducted. Only after the feasibility study, we will be able to decide a further course of action.” said an MRIDC official.“Justification for the need of a semi high-speed rail corridor between Mumbai-Pune and Mumbai-Nagpur should be taken into consideration. Both Mumbai and Pune are well connected and if a passenger wants to travel to Nagpur in a short amount of time, then they could just travel by an airplane. The pricing of the tickets also needs to be inspected. The projects should be cross-examined to check if they are really necessary.” said urban planner Sulakshana Mahajan. Former railway officers opined that land acquisition in a proper manner was needed and also raised doubts about whether a semi high-speed train corridor between Mumbai and Pune will be feasible due to the Western ghats.“Any high-speed train corridor will require to be operated at 320kmph which will not be feasible between Mumbai and Pune due to the ghat section (mountain pass areas). If the land acquisition is being done for projects, then the railway projects should serve their purpose. There have been instances wherein the landowner has not received the entire compensation, as middlemen are involved. Full compensation should be given,” said Subodh Jain, retired member of the Railway Board and former general manager of Central Railway. However, the passenger associations have welcomed the move and have stated that the reduction in time will help passengers to travel swiftly. “When people travel between both the city by road, they get stuck in traffic and by railways it takes time. A semi high-speed train would help people to travel quickly and swiftly between the cities,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad. Bullet train may miss deadlineSenior Railway ministry officials expect the state government to help acquire land in a short period to get the projects moving. They also think the push to other projects would prompt the Maharashtra government to help complete the Mumbai-Ahmedabad project faster. The project which is touted as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream project is likely to miss its 2023 deadline as only 30% of the required land is acquired in Maharashtra. “All the projects including Mumbai and Ahmedabad bullet trains will be beneficial for the people residing in both the cities. We have acquired 30% land in Maharashtra and are hoping to acquire more land by the end of this year with cooperation from the Maharashtra government. The project will also create jobs in the state,” said a senior railway official, who did not wish to be named. Urban planners have asked the railway authorities to study the requirements of the projects and conduct social and environmental assessments.Meanwhile, the NHSRCL is also planning the Mumbai-Hyderabad high-speed train corridor for which it is undertaking finalisation of designs, operational plans including costing for the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-high-speed-train-corridors-planned-to-connect-mumbai-with-pune-nagpur-101631205955055.html
09-09-2021||Mumbai||Centre recommends final notice on ESZ around Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary||After several months of being in the offing, the Centre has recommended final notification for the delineated eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) around the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS). The decision was taken during the Union environment ministry’s ESZ Expert Committee meeting on August 17, minutes of which were published on September 8. An ESZ is a buffer area created around a wildlife sanctuary or national park to reduce developmental pressures.The draft notification for the declaration of ESZ around Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary was first notified on November 6, 2019 but was subsequently re-notified on April 30 this year after the Maharashtra government revised its proposal to increase the area earmarked for protection by the forest department. It was initially proposed to include 34.06 sq km of adjacent land within the ESZ, but the state government in March this year wrote to the Centre proposing to include an additional 14 sq km of land therein.The proposal also increased the maximum width of the originally proposed buffer area to a maximum of 3.98km, as compared to 3.5km earlier. At its southernmost point near Vashi bridge, the width of ESZ is 0km, while at its northernmost point at Thane-Kalwa bridge, the width is 2km. “Zero extent at few stretches of the eco-sensitive zone for Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary is due to its location being at the intersection of the highly urbanized areas of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai and being close to another major city viz. Thane,” the ministry’s expert committee has noted.Spread across 1,690.5 hectares (ha) across Mulund, Vikhroli, Bhandup, Kanjurmarg and parts of Mandale village, TCFS is home to 12 true mangrove species, 39 mangrove associates, 167 species of birds including flamingos, 45 fish species, 59 species of butterflies, 67 insect species, among other mammals such as jackals. In May 2018, the state had declared it a flamingo sanctuary.About 1,400ha of mangrove forests towards the Navi Mumbai side of ESZ were not originally covered in the ambit of the original ESZ delineation because they were already declared as reserve forests under the Indian Forest Act, forest department officials said. They are also covered under CRZ (coastal regulation zone). However, last February, the ministry recommended their inclusion in ESZ. “The final step in the process now will be when the Government of India’s publishes the notification in their official Gazette, which is expected soon,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell.The ESZ notification does not mitigate developmental pressures entirely, however. HT had reported, on August 28, that the Union environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) for CRZ clearances has given a go-ahead for setting up 47 transmission towers in Mumbai, a portion of which will pass through the TCFS for less than half a kilometre. The EAC has recommended that bird diverters should be installed among the transmission lines “so as to avoid accidental collision of birds ie flamingos”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-recommends-final-notice-on-esz-around-thane-creek-flamingo-sanctuary-101631205655111.html

The high court bench of justice Arvind Sangwan on Thursday reserved the plea for final judgment after hearing arguments from counsels roped in by Saini and Punjab Police. In the October 2018 petition, Saini had demanded that directions be given to the state to get the probe done by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the event of any FIR against him since he feared false implication due to “mala fide and ulterior motives” on the part of the political party in power in Punjab. He had also sought blanket bail. From time to time, the protection given from arrest was modified and the September 23, 2020, order covered any FIR registered by the police for any incident during his entire service period. It was ordered that his arrest could be effected only after a prior notice of seven days. However, Saini was arrested by Punjab vigilance bureau on August 18 in connection with a September 2020 FIR. A day later, high court ordered his release, terming the arrest illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-judgment-on-interim-protection-from-arrest-to-ex-dgp-sumedh-saini-today-101631205596512.html

Nearly 8,200 employees under this category for the Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC), the Punjab Roadways and the Punbus have been protesting for regularisation of service, as they have been working for over 10 years. The protest caused huge inconvenience to commuters. The service, mainly of private operators resumed only after 2pm, with protesters blocking entry and exit since 10am. Responding to the protest, the state government has directed managements of STUs to take immediate steps for resumption of bus services. Protesters, however, claimed they would surround chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s farmhouse in Siswan on Friday. Harkesh Kumar, state secretary, Punjab Roadways, Punbus and PRTC Contract Workers Union, said outsourced employees have received warning letters from the company that PRTC had hired, to resume work or face termination. “Employees are being threatened that their contract will be terminated if they fail to return to their jobs by Friday. Punjab Roadways is also planning to open fresh recruitment, on contract, of over 700 new drivers and conductors,” Kumar added. The other major demands of the staff are checking the transport mafia; streamlining of daily hourly roster; strengthening state transport undertakings, implementation of equal work equal pay and to stop unnecessary harassment of employees on day-to-day reports.Private buses overcrowded; revenue loss of 80%With most state buses staying off road in south Malwa, private buses were overcrowded, leading to the violation of the key Covid-19 guideline of social distancing.

This came after backlash to omission of topis about the two leaders from the new post-graduation syllabus of political science at JP University (JPU) in Chhapra.“These leaders have had profound impact on the masses and a large number of people actively participated in the JP movement. So, the students of Bihar must get to study about them,” he said. Education minister Vijay Kumar. Choudhary, who met the Governor on Monday in this regard, presented the government’s viewpoint before the V-Cs and the sensitivity of the matter. “Honouring the sentiments of the people of the state, it is extremely important to restore the topics in the syllabus,” he added.Choudhary said that thinkers like Lohiya and Loknayak Jai Prakash Narayan we’re role models not only in the state, but the country over and the state’s politics had deep imprint of the ideology of JP. He thanked the Governor for calling a meeting of V-Cs on the issue. “Other courses will also be made more relevant as per modern needs through prescribed norms and vetting from the Bihar state higher education council and the Raj Bhawan,” he added.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is himself a product of the JP movement, had also expressed his surprise and dismay at the removal of topics related to JP in whose name the institution was established in 1990 and asked the education minister to resolve it.RJD chief also expressed his anguish and sought immediate intervention from the matter and had blamed the RSS for the change through his tweets.During the meeting, the discussion also revolved around stepping up efforts for accreditation of state institutions from the NAAC, appointment of principals, implementation of choice-based credit system (CBCS) at the under-graduate level and other issues. Many constituent colleges in Bihar are without full-time principals for a long time and are under additional charge, while CBCS has remained stuck in colleges and NAAC accreditation is very slow in the state despite the deadline of 2022 for all institutions in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-guv-directs-v-cs-to-restore-jp-lohiya-in-syllabus-edu-minister-says-removal-not-right-101631203555550.html

Unlike previous years, this time around, infants less than two months old are also falling prey to viral fever with symptoms of fast breathing and discomfort”.According to him, the patients look very sick with respiratory distress.”We provide supportive care like maintaining oxygenation, hydration and nutritional aspects of treatment and the illness resolves without further complications”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/viral-fever-teams-rushed-as-4-kids-die-in-gopalganj-in-four-days-101631201874778.html
09-09-2021||Patna||Kanhaiya trashes talks of joining Congress||Communist Part of India (CPI) leader and former president of JNU Students’ Union Kanhaiya Kumar has dismissed the speculation that he was planning to join Congress.“There is no truth in it. I am in mainstream politics and a member of a registered national party. When in politics, one interacts with so many people. Currently, I am in Delhi to attend our party’s national executive,” Kanahiya told HT on phone. Congress sources say Kanhaiya had met former party president Rahul Gandhi twice in the recent past. “Prashant Kishor was present during both the meeting. Negotiations are in the final stages,” claimed a Congress leader from Bihar, wishing not to be named. Kanhaiya, however, said there was no such meeting. “What has fuelled the rumours is my photograph with Congress leader Nadeem Jawed with whom I had lunch recently in Delhi. Nadeem is a former president of Congress’s student wing NSUI and a former general secretary of Indian Youth Congress. He posted our photographs on social media. As far as Prashant Kishor is concerned, we have been interacting often after my defeat in Lok Sabha elections in 2019,” said Kanhaiya, who lost to BJP heavyweight and union minister Giriraj Singh from Begusarai in the last parliamentary polls. Speculation about Kanhaiya switching sides became intense after a censure motion was passed against him for indiscipline in the CPI meeting held at Hyderabad in January this year. The censure motion was taken up after Kanhaiya’s supporters allegedly roughed up Indu Bhushan, the office secretary, in the party office at Patna on December 1. Congress leaders with the knowledge of development said Nadeem, a former Congress MLA from Jaunpur, has been given the responsibility of convincing the former JNU Students’ Union president and they have had several rounds of talk. However, asked if he was not getting close to Congress, Kanhaiya said, “When I met Nitish Kumar last year and a JD(U) minister earlier this year, there was a speculation that I was joining JD(U). Why should I when they are in alliance with the BJP,” he said. Earlier this year, two Congress MLAs from Bihar, Shakeel Ahmad Khan and Awadhesh Singh, had shared dais with Kanhaiya at his Jana Gana Mana rally in Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on February 27. Khan, also a former JNU Students’ Union president, had then said their presence there was only to support the cause as the rally was part of a campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the country.Congress’s fortunes have been on a steady decline in Bihar, where it won just 19 assembly seats in the 2020 polls in the state’s 243-member House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/kanhaiya-trashes-talks-of-joining-congress-101631201820032.html
09-09-2021||Patna||NIRF ranking: Bihar institutions fail again, only IIT-P in top 100||There is just one institution from Bihar, IIT-Patna, in the top 100 institutions in overall ranking across the country, the list of which released on Thursday by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) under the ministry of human resource development (MHRD). No state institution figures in the list.Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, has been ranked 51st in the overall ranking. Among engineering institutes, IIT-Patna has been ranked 21st, while NIT-Patna has been ranked 72nd. Among the 50 research institutions of the country, IIT-P is ranked 47th this year.IIT-Patna was ranked 54th in the overall category last year, while it was ranked 26th among the top 100 engineering colleges. In 2016, it was ranked 10th, its best so far. In the top 100 universities, there is none from Bihar, which has 17 state universities and two central universities. The state has drawn a blank in the rankings for colleges and institutions of medical, law, management, architecture, dental and pharmacy.The rankings are a reality check for the Bihar institutions of higher learning and a pointer to the reasons behind continued migration of a large number of students to different parts of the country in search of better education every year.Bihar State Higher Education Council chairman Kameshwar Jha said the state has a lot to catch up to get into the top 100. “Earlier, universities did not even apply for NIRF. This year, two universities and six colleges had applied, but they could not make it. We hope the state institutions understand the importance and gear up for it from next time. The council as well as the state government will provide them all the assistance,” he said.This year two state universities — Patna University and Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU), and a state management institution, Chandragupya Institute of Management (CIMP), had applied for NIRF. Besides, there central institutions — IIT-P, NIT-P and Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) — had applied.Of nearly 250 constituent colleges and 650 aided and private colleges, just six, including Patna Women’s College, AN College, CM College (Darbhanga) and St. Xavier’s College, had applied. However, none could find place in the top 100.Jha said that St Xavier’s College was declared not eligible on some technical grounds. “Variables like outreach and inclusion, research and placement hurt Bihar institutions, which mostly cater to the masses despite scant resources. One cannot compare the resources available at the IIT with a college situated in the remote area of the state. The intake is also different. One is totally merit-based through competition, while Bihar is still grappling with poor gross enrolment ratio (GER) and efforts are being made to improve it,” he said.Magadh University vice chancellor Rajendra Prasad said that apart from the apparent deficiencies, lack of awareness and innovativeness was also a hindrance. “In a country where there are 1,095 universities and over 50,000 colleges, competition ensures that quality is important and hence the ranking. Leadership of institutions has a huge role. Those students who can afford can move to better places, but that number is not very high. A large number of those who stay in the state need quality education which is suited to modern needs. The institutions need support to deliver. This means new areas to study, industry and government support. The council is working on that direction and hopefully things will change,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nirf-ranking-bihar-institutions-fail-again-only-iit-p-in-top-100-101631201818969.html
09-09-2021||Patna||Bihar: Capital city reports its first JE case this year||State capital Patna has reported its first of the total seven cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne flaviviral encephalitis, in the state so far this year, said officials aware of the development. One child has already died of the infection this year. A one-and-a-half-year girl from Mamrakhabad Imli village of Pandarak block in Patna on Wednesday was found JE positive following her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test report from ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences. The girl’s blood serum sample had tested positive in August. She has since been discharged from Patna’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), said health officials, requesting anonymity. The new case comes close on the heels of an 11-year-old JE positive boy getting admitted to Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital in Muzaffarpur recently on September 5. The condition of the boy, who hails from Bettiah in West Champaran district, was said to be critical. Prior to these two recent cases, Bihar, where the disease mostly affects children up to 15 years of age, reported one JE case in January, three in July, and two in August this year. In the last five years, the state has reported a total of 419 JE cases and 78 deaths. It reported 135 JE cases and 27 deaths in 2019, the highest since 2016, when 100 children were infected , of which 25 died, as per government data. Officials monitoring the case said they were taking steps to prevent further spread of infection.“We have issued instructions to respective districts for malathion (an insecticide) fogging in areas where JE cases have been detected. Fogging will be done in around 500 dwellings near the infected house,” said an official. The official added,“We have also asked the districts for house-to-house case detection survey, and to also check for immunisation of children.” The prevention of JE is based largely on two interventions — mosquito control and immunisation. Immunisation of children has been completed in 35 of the 38 districts. In the remaining three districts of Khagaria, Begusarai and Kaimur, immunisation was initiated in August-end. The JE vaccination has been included in the routine immunisation programme of the government, said officials, requesting anonymity. The Bihar government has been struggling to declare JE a notifiable disease despite it being a disease of public health importance because of its epidemic potential and high fatality rate. Government sources said the file concerned to make JE and dengue a notifiable disease has been shuttling from one desk to another for the last three years. When contacted, Bihar’s director-in-chief, disease control, Dr Naveen Chandra Prasad, was not certain about it. “I will find out from my office and let you know. Right now, I am out on an inspection,” he said on Thursday. JE patients present vivid signs of acute encephalitic syndrome. The first signs of infection appear after an incubation period between six and 14 days. It usually begins with onset of fever above 38°C, chills, muscle pain, and meningitis-type headaches accompanied by vomiting. Around 20% to 30% fatality has been reported in cases with signs of acute cerebral edema or severe respiratory distress from pulmonary edema. Recovery usually leaves serious behavioural and neurological disorders, epileptic seizures, and severe mental retardation in children. Most government medical colleges are already facing capacity constraint in the wake of an early spike in viral fever cases among children. Any outbreak would put the state health system under further stress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-capital-city-reports-its-first-je-case-this-year-101631201817707.html

09-09-2021||Chandigarh||SAD panel to hold talks with farm union leaders today||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday constituted a four-member committee for Friday’s talks with farmer union leaders. Party’s top decision-making body — core committee — constituted the committee comprising Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Prem Singh Chandumajra, Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal and Daljit Singh Cheema. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal chaired the meeting. It was decided in the meeting to ask the farmer leaders to hold discussions and not disrupt rallies. “We want them to talk to us and tell us in case we didn’t stand for the peasantry. We will also offer them whatever support they want and eliminate misunderstandings between the organisations and the party,” said Chandumajra, who earlier had written to farm leaders, inviting them for talks. Representatives of 32 farm bodies are expected to come for talks. Last week, farmers tried to disrupt Sukhbir Badal’s ‘Gal Punjab Di’ rally in Moga. There were sporadic protests against the Akalis’ outreach programme that started on August 18, but protest in Moga forced SAD leadership to suspend the programme and initiate talks with the farmer leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-panel-to-hold-talks-with-farm-union-leaders-today-101631200016407.html
09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: BJP battling worst-ever crisis amid stand-off over farm laws||Heading a potent government at the Centre, the BJP in Punjab appears to be on a sticky wicket just months ahead of the assembly polls — thanks to the widespread anger among the agriculturists against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws. With farmer unions picking on party leaders across the state, the party’s activities have been confined to only certain urban pockets that too in the shadow of heavy security. Political thinkers say the BJP is fighting its worst-ever crisis in Punjab. Party insiders say the vehement opposition on the ground has demoralised the cadres to such an extent that many key Sikh faces of the party have quit. The biggest jolt to the state unit came when its firebrand leader from Amritsar, former minister Anil Joshi, along with other Hindu faces of the party, joined the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). Joshi had criticised the BJP Central leadership for mishandling the farm agitation and was expelled. Insiders say murmurs of discontent within the party over the farm laws are still there and local leaders are hoping that the Centre resolves the issue before the polls. As an alliance partner of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for 33 years, the BJP used to contest on 23-Hindu dominated seats in the state. The SAD snapped the association with the BJP over the farm laws. In the 2017 assembly polls, the BJP could win only three seats but it wrested two of the three seats it fought in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Dalit CM strategy Senior state BJP leaders admit that the party has almost given up on support from the Jat-Sikh dominated peasantry and shifted focus on the Dalits who have around 32% vote share. The party picked its Ravidasia face from Dalit-dominated Doaba region, Vijay Sampla, and appointed him as the chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes with the rank of a Union minister. Another Dalit face of the party and Hoshiarpur MP, Som Parkash, is the Union minister of state for commerce and industry in the Modi cabinet. BJP leaders are of the opinion that since the support for the farmer agitation is mainly coming from Sikh pockets, by consolidating on the Dalit-Hindu (urban business community votes, Brahmins and Rajputs) votes, the party can emerge as the game-changer in the results keeping in view the multi-cornered contest on all seats. Also, the party leaders are convinced that the prolonged farm agitation marked by stray incidents of violence has upset a large number of voters from urban pockets, especially Hindus. “There is anguish over the way farmer unions have been given free hand to ‘ghero and maaro’. These pockets are also upset over the way Hindu thoughts have been abused and targeted by certain organisations leading the agitation,” a party general secretary claimed while requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-bjp-battling-worst-ever-crisis-amid-stand-off-over-farm-laws-101631198634683.html

Now, we have decided to gherao Moti Mahal to press for our demands.”“The government which assured Ghar Ghar Rozgar is not paying heed towards the pain of young protesters.

Gradually, she began experiencing the desire to achieve something in life. By the time her son turned two, she was charting her own course. “I wanted to be financially independent and not rely on anybody,” says the 43-year-old. After her son’s birth, the science graduate decided to enroll for a diploma in medical lab technology and start a diagnostic lab. Her husband, Mohammad Aslam, who owns a medicine shop in the Old City’s Rainawari area, and her in-laws were supportive. “Their being from the health sector helped and I started out in 2011. Unlike the past, women are now not confined to their homes. Families are empowering daughters,” says Masrat Jan. Today, she runs the lab independently and conducts all routine tests. “Initially, it appeared impossible, particularly getting back to studies after having two children. But my passion, determination and the family’s support got me here,” she says, donning her apron to collect blood samples from patients. Education a priority to succeed The youngest of four siblings, comprising two brothers and two sisters, Masrat says that her father, a businessman, was particular about educating all of them. Education was a priority at her in-laws’ place, too. “My father-in-law is a retired health officer, and my sister-in-law is a doctor,” she says. Masrat is happy to see that her success is motivating women around her to pursue their passion, too. “When a woman succeeds, she inspires others. There are many who approach me for advice. They think if I could do it after marriage and kids why can’t they,” she says. “I guide young women on how to make their lives meaningful and even counsel them on the career they should choose,” she says. Daughter’s role model Not only friends and relatives, Masrat’s daughter admires her for her independence. “My daughter, Falak, wants to become financially independent, too. She has just turned 20 and is in college, but she started a home-baking venture when she was in Class 12. She took this step without any training. Seeing her follow her heart is heartening,” she says. On path to progress Masrat feels that the Kashmiri society is evolving with education. “I won’t say that our society is 100% perfect and there is unhindered freedom, but a lot has improved. What is important is that we are progressing,” she says. She acknowledges that women still face harassment but says that they now raise their voice against it. “There is still violence against women and harassment at workplaces, but change is happening. Things have changed to the extent that women are now raising their voice against such crimes,” she adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/emblems-of-empowerment-she-inspires-women-to-be-independent-find-purpose-101631197674407.html

The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) has slipped to 11th from last year’s 9th position in the university category. In the overall category, SPPU has dropped from 19th last year, to 20th this year. The College of Engineering Pune (COEP) has slipped to 52nd this year, from last year’s 50th rank in the engineering colleges’ category. In the college category, Fergusson College has gone from 42nd last year, to 96th this year. These rankings are issued by the education ministry based on scores out of 100 on various parameters – research and professional practice, outreach and inclusivity, teaching-learning resources and graduation outcomes. The rankings are announced across several categories, from overall and university, to engineering, pharmacy, and management, among others. From this year, a new category of “research” has been introduced. DY Patil Vidyapeeth’s Dental College in Pune as ranked second this year among dental colleges in the country. Last year it was ranked third.Similarly, the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology Pune scaled up to 58th this year, from last year’s rank of 63. SPPU vice-chancellor Prof Nitin Karmalkar said, “There are two reasons behind the drop of position compared to last year of the SPPU. As the university campus is closed, the number of foreign students has reduced. Then, several programmes like ‘Gyan’ which has the participation of international faculties, could not happen this year and this has the rankings. We are happy with the success and ranking we have got and will work harder to gain top position next year.”Students in the city are not impressed. “It is the time for the SPPU and all the other colleges in Pune who have slipped in their rankings to work to better the education for students. It is going to have a major impact on students taking admission to these universities and colleges from now,” said one post-graduate student in the city, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nirf-rankings-2021-sppu-slips-to-11th-coep-ranked-52nd-101631197373877.html

09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Cong, AAP slam ‘meagre’ hike in MSP for rabi crops||The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday criticised the hike in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA government for a range of rabi crops. Hitting out at the central government, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu that it promised to double the farmer income by 2022, but increased the MSP on wheat by just two per cent and fair and remunerative price (FRP) on sugarcane by 1.75% despite a sharp increase in expenses. “In last one year, diesel rates have increased by 48%, DAP by 140% mustard oil by 174%, sunflower oil by 170% and LPG cylinder by ₹190,” he claimed in a series of tweets. Sidhu said that NDA means “No Data Available” about farmers, labour and small traders. “Govt only knows about its rich corporate friends, whose debt it waives off, whose planes it travels in and who make their policies such as the three farm laws,” he alleged. Congress youth leader Amardeep Singh Cheema also condemned the miniscule raise of ₹40 per quintal in MSP of wheat and accordingly in other 23 rabi crops, calling it “utter failure” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The way cost has been calculated is actually cost of selective inputs while blatantly ignoring the costs of land, tilling, labour, capital cost, supervision and inflation in diesel prices and fertilizers,” he claimed, blaming the “negative attitude” of the central government. Criticising the measly hike in MSP for wheat, AAP MLA and Kisan Wing state chief Kultar Singh Sandhwan said the Modi government was punishing the farmers for agitating against its three farm laws. The MSP for rabi crops was just an announcement with there being guarantee of procurement at the fixed price, he added, asking the central government to clarify the procurement plan for gram, mustard, maize and sunflower. He said the MSP was negligible due to rising inflation and cost of farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-aap-slam-meagre-hike-in-msp-for-rabi-crops-101631196597341.html
09-09-2021||Dehradun||NTCA seeks status report on opening part of Rajaji Tiger Reserve for tourists||National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has written to the Uttarakhand forest department seeking a factual status report on opening a part of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) for tourists. NTCA sought the report after Gaurav Kumar Bansal, a wildlife activist and advocate in Supreme Court, sent a legal notice to the NTCA member secretary on September 6, alleging that “allowing tourism in such a critical tiger habitat for a whole year in Rajaji Tiger Reserve and that too without following the scientific and objective criteria as well as without consulting the expert committee is nothing but illegal” . Bansal said that the chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand, in his letter dated September 3, asked the director of Rajaji Tiger Reserve to open up the area from Satyanarayan to Kansro, a critical tiger habitat in Rajaji Tiger Reserve for the whole year. Rajaji Tiger Reserve is usually open till June 15 after which it is closed for the monsoon season. It reopens on November 15 every year. Bansal, in his legal notice, also pointed out that the chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand, also asked the director of Rajaji Tiger Reserve to open the area from Motichur to Rajaji Rani via the Micro Tower tourism zone from October 1, 2021 instead of November 15, 2021. Bansal said opening these areas is a violation of various provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972. “The said unsustainable use of Rajaji Tiger Reserve landscape is not only capable of damaging the whole ecology of the tiger reserve but it can also cause harm to the pristine biological diversity of the Park. So I sent a legal notice to NTCA so that they take cognisance of this matter and initiate action in accordance with law and more specifically as per the provisions of Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972,” he said. When contacted, JS Suhag, the chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand, said he will look into the matter and then send a detailed factual report to NTCA. Rajaji National Park, spread over 820 sqkm in three districts of Uttarakhand, namely Haridwar, Dehradun and Pauri Garhwal, came into existence in 1983, when three wildlife sanctuaries in the area--Chilla, Motichur and Rajaji sanctuaries--were merged into one. The park is named after C Rajagopalachari (Rajaji), a prominent leader of the freedom struggle and the second and last governor general of independent India. In April 2015, Rajaji was declared a tiger reserve, becoming the second tiger reserve in the state after Corbett Tiger Reserve The park is famous as an elephant habitat and also harbours the mountain goat, goral and other wild animals. The reserve is home to more than 50 species of mammals including tiger, leopard, Himalayan black bear, sloth bear, jackal , hyena, spotted deer, sambhar, barking deer, nilgai, monkeys and over 300 species of birds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/ntca-seeks-status-report-on-opening-part-of-rajaji-tiger-reserve-for-tourists-101631190353667.html

Distribute medicines for fever and diarrhoea. Consult experts’ teams and act according to their instructions. Keep hospital beds and medicines available adequately and treat all such patients free at government hospitals,” he told officers concerned at the Covid-19 review meeting.The CM said there was effective control over the second wave of the pandemic in the state. UP was better off than many other states and as many as 33 districts didn’t have active Covid cases while 66 districts did not report any fresh cases in the last 24 hours. “At present, the state has 199 active Covid cases. In the testing done in the last 24 hours, only 11 fresh cases of Covid were reported,” he said.About Covid vaccination, the chief minister said more than 45% of the population in the state in the targeted age groups received at least one dose of Covid vaccine. Till Wednesday, 8.34 crore doses of Covid vaccine were administered in the state.Don’t install Ganesh idols at public places: YogiChief minister Yogi Adityanath urged people not to install Lord Ganesh idols at public places and instead install them in their homes, considering the Covid pandemic.He said Ganesh Chaturthi (on Friday) should be celebrated in a peaceful and harmonious manner and there should not be any unnecessary crowding anywhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ensure-effective-dengue-viral-infection-vigil-in-districts-up-cm-101631189813892.html
09-09-2021||Delhi||257,000 people evicted during pandemic, shows report by housing rights body||Close to 257,000 people were evicted from their homes in India during the coronavirus pandemic (March 2020-July 2021) by government authorities for various projects and removal of encroachments, according to a report released by the Housing and Land Rights Network on Thursday.The report (Forced Evictions in India in 2020: A Grave Human Rights Crisis During the Pandemic) stated close to 173,000 people were evicted as 36,812 homes were demolished across India between January and December last year. Between March and December 2020, about 88,517 people were evicted.In 2021, 169,000 people were evicted and 24,400 homes demolished across India till July 31.Shivani Chaudhry, executive director, HLRN, said, “It is a cause of great concern that during this public health emergency, when the government should be ensuring a secure home for everyone to stay safe, it has been ruthlessly demolishing homes of low-income communities across India and increasing their risk of exposure to the deadly coronavirus.”She added, “The majority of these evictions take place on grounds that the urban and rural poor are ‘illegal encroachers’ even when they have lived in an area for decades and contributed to its sustainable development.” HLRN members said that the numbers could be much higher, as the report only has data of cases they know of.HLRN, a charitable organisation working on housing and land rights, set up the National Eviction and Displacement Observatory in 2015. According to HLRN, “On average, between 2017 and 2020, state authorities evicted 185,300 people annually in India.”Eviction drives have been carried out for infrastructure and environment projects, encroachment removal and beautification projects, and disaster management. As per the report, 49% of evictions last year were due to environmental reasons (projects and forest and wildlife conservation).Chaudhry said, “In 2020, we documented that 49% of people lost their homes for ostensible ‘environmental’ reasons, including from forestland. But forcibly evicting traditional forest dwellers from their lands not only violates the Forest Rights Act 2006, it is also a recipe for a human rights and ecological disaster. People living in forests know how best to protect them. The government needs to respect their knowledge and uphold their rights.” HLRN reported that 17,888 homes have been demolished for environmental reasons.In 73 eviction drives for encroachment removal and beautification, and 33 infrastructure projects across India, 7,689 and 8,658 families were evicted respectively in 2020.What’s alarming is the fact that a vast majority of evicted people were rendered homeless because the government didn’t plan for their rehabilitation.“An overwhelming majority of evicted people (87%) did not receive any rehabilitation from the government.They have had to find alternative housing or have been rendered homeless. For those who received some form of resettlement from the state, the sites they have been relocated to are remote and devoid of adequate housing and essential civic and social infrastructure facilities,” a statement by HLRN said.HLRN has listed 235 areas in India where there are around 16 million people “currently living under the threat of eviction from their homes and habitats”.Forced eviction results “in an increase in poverty, destitution, homelessness, landlessness, and unemployment; loss of education, health, security and sometimes, lives too; hunger and malnutrition; and, mental, physical, and psychological distress”.The report stated that of the total evictions in 2020, nearly 51% people were evicted during the pandemic due to court orders (Supreme Court, state high courts and the National Green Tribunal).Highlighting the plight of millions of people who lost their homes during the pandemic, HLRN has recommended that there should be an immediate moratorium on eviction, adequate compensation should be provided to those who have been evicted, an eviction impact assessment should be carried out by government agencies etc.HLRN members said that there is a need for the government to adopt the ‘housing first’ approach that prioritises the provision of permanent housing to homeless persons and families.The organisation also recommends that the Centre bring in a law to provide secure land for housing and subsistence livelihoods to urban and rural landless households. “Develop and promulgate laws on the human rights to adequate housing and land, on the lines of the Odisha Land Rights to Slum Dwellers Act 2017, and the Punjab Slum Dwellers (Proprietary Rights) Act 2020,” said the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/257000-people-evicted-during-pandemic-shows-report-by-housing-rights-body-101631189394277.html
09-09-2021||Pune||Taste of life: Poona’s tryst with handling waste all about manure for growth||The disposal of night-soil to the best advantage had been a very important issue since the middle of the 19th century India. When Poona started its journey towards becoming a city, excreta and offal began to be a nuisance and the question of disposal of these substances became important.Since pre-municipal days, sweepers belonging to particular castes collected night-soil from houses every day. They then sold the manure to cultivators.These sweepers and manual scavengers were considered “untouchables”. They were required to collect the excreta, carry it in cane or metal containers on their heads, and empty the contents at a designated site a few miles away from the city. Because the residents did not want the “sweepers” to “pollute” their houses with their touches, or mere presence, toilets were constructed at the entrances of the residential buildings, so that the sweepers would collect the excreta and left without entering their dwellings.The local population of Poona had gotten used to the stench which would greet them upon entering their houses and while walking down the lanes. The Poona City Municipality deliberated over the issue of toilets and foul smells and decided to put the night-soil to better use.Mixing night-soil with earth, ashes, or town sweepings and the application of the mass to the land was one of the simplest methods to utilise the waste. Called “sonkhat” in Marathi, the use of night-soil as manure was not altogether unknown in the Bombay Presidency. Its use in many places was obstructed due to prejudice, and the caste dynamics it brought into play.To overcome these issues, the Agriculture Department at the then College of Science, Poona, (now College of Engineering, Pune), at the request of the Municipality, undertook a series of experiments with the help of the Sanitation Department after 1890. HK Kelkar, an Associate Professor of Agriculture, was put in charge.The Municipality had then already adopted the “Poona method” of making poudrette of manure. In this system, fresh excreta was carted to a depot and covered with ashes and town sweepings in shallow beds. This mixture was exposed to the sun to dry; when properly dried it was heaped away and sold to farmers as manure.Ashes were used primarily to remove the foul odour. They also made the poudrette richer in potash. In the rainy season, the drying had to be done under cover and consequently, the process took about a fortnight, whereas in the winters it took about a week. During summer, the process needed five days to complete.In the Poona Cantonment, a slightly different system was used. Pits were dug about five feet deep and of convenient length and breadth. Into these pits, night-soil and earth were put in alternate layers and in equal proportions. This system was more sanitary than the one adopted by Poona City Municipality, but the poudrette manufactured by this method could not be handled for several months.Several systems of purifying sewage were tried by the Agricultural Department in co-operation with the Poona Municipality and Sanitation Department from 1894 to 1905 on the Poona and Manjari farms in connection with the Poona drainage system.In the first set of experiments carried out in 1894, fresh night-soil was directly applied to the land by the shallow bed system. One month from the date of application, the land was ploughed, harrowed, and sown with Sundhia (a cultivar of Sorghum from Gujarat) for fodder. The yield obtained was 1,133 bundles of fodder per acre, which was “significantly more” than the yield of crop obtained without the use of night-soil as manure.Next year, experiments were conducted on the Manjari Farm owned by the Agriculture Department with poudrette manufactured by the Poona method. The yield of sugarcane per acre was measured and compared with different manures such as cattle dung from “ordinary fed animals”, Safflower cake, Castor cake, Karanji cake, cottonseed cake, and Bassia cake. It was found that the yield obtained with poudrette was “slightly better” than with the other manures.In 1898, a small septic tank was constructed in Mangalwar peth and the effluent from this tank was carted to the Kirkee farm daily and applied to the crops, viz. sugarcane, Guinea-grass, Lucerne, Sundhia, and maize. The effluent was compared with farmyard manure and poudrette at the rate of 20 and 25 tonnes per acre respectively. The outturn of produce per acre was “almost double” for effluent.The next year, the effect of effluent on various garden crops was tested. They were mostly vegetables like onions, potatoes, “knoll-khols”, sweet potatoes, turmeric, and yams.Encouraged by the results obtained at the Kirkee farm, JC Pottinger, sanitary engineer, planned in consultation with the Agricultural Department, a trial of three distinct systems of sewage purification at Manjari. A septic tank, Dib-Dins filter, and a macerating tank were constructed and sewage purification under these three systems was carried out for six years, from 1899.The effluent of these different systems was compared with poudrette, farmyard manure, castor-cake, niger-cake, and safflower-cake respectively. The results were encouraging as before. The success of these experiments was so marked that the government, on the advice of the Sanitary Department, undertook to demonstrate conclusively the agricultural value of the sewage and to furnish a basis for calculation in carrying out the drainage scheme of Poona.A purification plant was set up at the Manjari farm which consisted of a mixing tank, a septic tank, bacteria beds, and sand filters. In the septic tank, the organisms, which thrived well in the absence of air, dissolved the whole of the solid matters of the sewage and simplified the organic compounds. The nitrogenous substances were largely converted into nitrates. Fish lived well in the effluent liquid and it could be passed into the river without causing any kind of nuisance. Various kinds of crops like sugarcane, onions, groundnut, turmeric, yams, and ginger were grown by its aid at Manjari.In 1906, the Poona Municipality discontinued the regular manufacture of poudrette as it did not cover the expenses. The carting of night-soil, urine, and sweepings, etc. from the city was put to auction every year. The contractor manufactured poudrette and sold the same to farmers.The municipality later started encouraging homeowners to construct toilets with septic tanks behind their houses to facilitate proper disposal of the waste. The efforts continued for many decades.The social stigma reinforced by caste-designated occupation of manual scavenging and widespread discrimination perpetuated by untouchability have sadly not yet been eliminated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-poona-s-tryst-with-handling-waste-all-about-manure-for-growth-101631187767112.html

The notification issued September 2 led to a political storm in the state with the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) consistently disrupting proceedings in the House during the ongoing monsoon session, doing Kirtan and chanting Hanuman Chalisa. On Wednesday, police lathicharged BJP workers and leaders protesting outside the assembly when they tried to move ahead by breaking barricades, injuring several of them. The Speaker took the decision on Thursday after senior Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) legislator Sarfaraz Ahmed proposed forming a committee in the House to look into the issue in order to break the deadlock. Other legislators, including Bandhu Tirkey and Pradeep Yadav, supported the proposal. Also Read | Jharkhand: Police use water cannons on BJP protesters amid namaz hall row“Over the past few days, we have seen this issue (namaz room) is pushing the state towards communal tension. You took a decision based on a precedence in the assembly. Such a room was allotted by first speaker Inder Singh Namdhari when Babulal Marandi was the chief minister. However, now this issue has gone into a new direction. So it’s my personal view that you form an assembly committee that looks into it and give it’s report in 7 to 10 days. Based on their report, you can review your decision,” Sarfaraz said. However, Babulal Marandi, currently legislature party leader of the BJP, objected to Sarfaraz’s claims and said no such room was allocated during his tenure as CM. As other legislators supported the proposal, the Speaker announced the formation of an all-party committee. While senior JMM legislator Stephen Marandi will chair the committee, other members include Sarfaraz Ahmed, Pradeep Yadav, Neelkanth Munda, Vinod Singh, Lambodar Mahto and Dipika Pandey Singh. “Though I am fixing a timeframe of 45 days for the committee to submit its report, I would request the panel to ready it at the earliest so that we can end this deadlock. I will abide by its recommendation,” said the Speaker.Bhanu Pratap Shahi, BJP legislator and former minister, who has been one of the most vocal lawmakers on the issue, said it was BJP’s pressure that forced Sarfaraz Ahmed to come up with the proposal. “He could have made this proposal even on the first day. But he is doing it now because of the pressure from the BJP,” said Shahi in an apparent reference to their consistent stand and protest on the issue. BJP delegation meets governorMeanwhile, a BJP delegation led by party general secretary Pradeep Verma met Jharkhand governor Ramesh Bais and requested the cancellation of the notification and action against those responsible for lathicharge on the protesting BJP workers and leaders. A PIL has also been filed against the notification in the Jharkhand high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/namaz-room-row-j-khand-speaker-forms-all-party-assembly-panel-to-review-the-issue-101631187046647.html

Devdutta Maji, a BJP leader, allegedly slapped a home guard when Kolkata Police personnel were managing the entry point to the morgue where the body was kept. “There was some jostling when the police tried to stop us. I did not hit anyone intentionally. If charges are pressed, I will fight it out in court,” said Maji. Ordered by the Calcutta high court to probe allegations of post-poll killings and rapes in Bengal, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing Sarkar’s death along with the other cases. Also Read | BJP using agencies against TMC leaders before bypolls: Bengal CM Mamata BanerjeeThe court had earlier ordered a DNA test on the body since Sarkar’s family could not identify it.Though the Kolkata Police did not comment on the alleged assault by Maji, Trinamool Congress (TMC) general secretary Kunal Ghosh said, “He should be booked immediately. The government made all arrangements to hand over the body but the BJP created trouble.” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh defended Maji and said, “If he slapped a home guard, he did not do anything wrong.” Lawyer Priyanka Tibrewal, who is representing several petitioners, including Sarkar’s family, said, “The government did not preserve the body properly. It was decomposed.” The body was taken to the BJP state headquarters at Muralidhar Sen Lane in central Kolkata. It was later taken to Sarkar’s home. The cremation is scheduled take place in the afternoon. Sarkar was allegedly killed shortly after the poll results were announced. The Kolkata Police has so far arrested seven people. Biswajit Sarkar, the older brother of the victim, has filed petitions to probe his death before the Supreme Court and the Calcutta high court. Abhijit Sarkar was allegedly strangled to death with a television cable. He was the only BJP worker who died in the state capital. The rest of the alleged killings took place in other districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/chaos-as-kolkata-police-hand-over-body-of-bjp-worker-killed-on-may-2-101631186266443.html

The 34-year-old was first taken to Bhubaneswar’s Capital Hospital before being shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, said Bhubaneswar deputy commissioner of police Umashankar Dash.The man met with a road accident in March last year. He alleged that though he had a Biju Krushak Kalyan Yojana (BKKY) card which allowed him treatment in private hospitals up to ₹5 lakh, he could not get any help as the hospital authorities wanted written consent from government officials.He also went to private hospitals with his Biju Swasthya Kalyan Scheme (BSKY) card which entitled him to treatment upto a maximum limit of ₹5 lakh, but was asked to get permission from government officials.The man said his mother too had written to the state government over his treatment, but did not get any help. “Finding no other option, I decided to kill myself,” he said. “I was harassed at SCB Medical College and Hospital while undergoing treatment and the doctors did not provide me with medicines. I was deliberately discharged,” he alleged, soon after he consumed poison before the assembly building on Wednesday. The man had sustained serious injuries on his left leg on March 22 last year after his two-wheeler collided with a truck. He was admitted to SCB Medical College and Hospital where he underwent a surgery the next day. Later, he underwent another operation on June 19, 2020. However, the doctors allegedly discharged him from the hospital on July 15 due to the rise in Covid-19 cases.When he could not walk after his discharge from the hospital, his family members admitted him to a private hospital in Bhubaneswar. “The doctors at the private hospital told me that the surgery at the government medical college was faulty,” the man said. He then wrote to chief minister requesting him for assistance towards his treatment. The emergency officer of SCB Medical College and Hospital Dr Bhubananda Maharana, however, said the treatment at the hospital was done as per set procedure. “There was no negligence in his treatment,” he said.After the incident, Kujang BDO Amiya Kumar Panda rushed to his house and met his family members. He gave ₹1 lakh compensation to his family members. “When he was alive, no one helped him. Now after his death the government woke up from sleep. The government killed my son,” alleged the dead man’s father.Last month, Odisha launched the BSKY smart card scheme, a new version of the Biju Swasthya Kalyan Scheme that was first launched in August 2018 to lessen out of pocket (OOP) expenses. The scheme is convergence of erstwhile Rastriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, Biju Krushak Kalyan Yojana and Odisha State Treatment Fund. Under the scheme the beneficiaries don’t have to pay any premium. They are given identity cards through which they can get treatment in empanelled private hospitals.On Thursday, the issue rocked the state with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers led by ex-minister Bibhu Tarai staging a road blockade on Cuttack-Paradip road demanding ₹20 lakh compensation for the kin of deceased and a government job for his wife. State Congress chief Niranjan Patnaik said the government should have listened to the grievances of the man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-man-who-tried-to-kill-himself-alleging-medical-negligence-dies-101631183806440.html

The report is also expected to contain the impact on Karnataka and following its review, the CM said that “necessary actions” would be taken regarding the virus in his state.“Regarding Nipah virus, I have given directions to the Health Secretary and experts. I will get a report on its behaviour in Kerala and its impact on us by this evening, following which necessary action will be taken,” news agency ANI quoted Bommai as saying earlier in the day.The report is expected by Thursday evening following which, the CM said that measures would be taken in Karnataka on the possible impact of the virus on the state, following an outbreak in Kerala.Also read | Karnataka border district issues alert as 12-yr-old boy dies of Nipah in KeralaEarlier on Wednesday, Bommai had instructed the state health officials, especially in districts located along the Kerala border, to strengthen their measures against the Nipah virus after the infection was reported in neighbouring Kerala on Sunday last week. He also asked for more awareness to be spread among the public and create a surveillance system for identifying clusters of encephalitis disease to detect Nipah outbreaks at the earliest. The CM was on a trip to Delhi on September 7 and 8 to meet with some Union ministers to discuss issues concerning the state.Already, Karnataka has put up several measures to bolster their surveillance on Kerala border and people travelling between the states. Bommai had asked his health officials to check for symptoms such as fever, altered mental status, severe weakness, headache, respiratory distress, cough, vomiting, muscle pain, convulsions and diarrhoea among passengers arriving at Karnataka from Kerala. Already, vigilance at the border between the two states was bolstered, particularly on the Karnataka side, owing to the high number of daily Covid-19 infections in Kerala. Passengers are expected to possess a negative RT-PCR certificate and vaccination certificates before entering the state.The district administration in Dakshina Kannada, one of the districts in Karnataka bordering Kerala, has advised its people to avoid travelling to Kerala in the wake of the Nipah outbreak and also the high Covid-19 caseload there. It asked the people to consider their travel to Kerala only in emergency cases and avoid it until the end of October this year.Meanwhile, Kerala health minister Veena George said that 61 people in her state had tested negative for the Nipah virus after being in close contact with the 12-year-old boy who lost his life to the disease on September 5.

"We have placed tables for 'visarjan' at Girgaon Chowpatty. The sentiments of devotees should not be hurt," said the city’s first citizen. Mumbai has restricted immersion processions to 10 people.Pednekar’s comment comes as the city is gearing up for its biggest festival of the year, Ganesh Chaturthi, which will be celebrated for 11-days starting September 10. Mumbai reported a sudden spike in the daily tally of cases on Wednesday, reporting 532 cases, highest since July 15, marking a jump from the 353 cases it had reported on Tuesday. The number of sealed buildings also increased from 44 to 49 on September 5.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued fresh orders on Wednesday, banning physical darshans for devotees at public pandals and insisted that arrangements for digital darshans should be made instead. For bringing idols to homes or pandals and also for immersing them on ‘visarjan’ day not more than 10 people will be allowed together. For pujas at home only five people will be allowed in one household. Pednekar once again appealed to citizens to celebrate this year’s Ganesh Chaturthi from the comfort of their homes."Considering the potential danger of a third Covid-19 wave, devotees are strictly forbidden from taking darshan. It has been decided that Ganeshotsav mandals should provide darshan facility to devotees through cable network, website, Facebook or (other) social media," BMC said in an official statement."All devotees should wear masks and observe social distancing. Also, the 10 participants should have taken both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine and completed 15 days after taking the second dose," it added.For pujas that take place in a containment zone the concerned committee will have to make arrangements for immersion within their premises or postpone it altogether, the civic body said, adding that the height of Ganpati idols for household celebrations has been restricted to two feet and for public mandals to four feet, for the second year in a row to help curb rising number of coronavirus cases.BMC has warned that any violation of the guidelines will invite strict action under the Indian Penal Code, the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sentiments-of-devotees-shouldn-t-be-hurt-says-mumbai-mayor-as-city-gears-up-to-celebrate-ganesh-chaturthi-under-strict-covid-norms-101631181935888.html

Advocate Payoshi Roy, who represented Uppuganti, submitted that she was arrested in 2019 for her alleged involvement in a bomb attack in Gadchiroli which had resulted in the death of 15 police personnel and one civilian. Uppuganti and her husband were accused of being senior members of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). Roy informed the court that Uppuganti had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018 and had been undergoing chemotherapy when she and her husband were arrested in 2019. Roy had submitted that due to her arrest, Uppuganti had missed her chemotherapy sessions as a result of which her condition deteriorated. Her cancer is now at stage 4 and she has multiple skeletal and lung metastases. The court was also informed that while Uppuganti was being taken to Tata Memorial Hospital for treatment, the cell in Byculla Women’s Prison where she was being held was crowded and she had to sleep on the floor, and did not have access to basic facilities like toilet, hot water, among other things. In light of these submissions, Uppuganti sought urgent relief in the form of palliative care by being shifted to a hospice and also requested that she be allowed to meet her husband, who is lodged in Arthur Road jail as she had no other family member.However, the state opposed the petition stating that Uggupanti was being taken to the Tata memorial Hospital thrice a week to ensure she gets her treatment as directed by her doctors.

Siddiquee had stated that as the procedure laid down under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was not followed, the entire proceedings, orders and summons issued by the magistrate should be quashed. In light of Section 202 of the CrPC, advocate Jay Bharadwaj for Akhtar had submitted that the magistrate had three options--to either conduct the investigation himself; or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer; or direct a third party to conduct investigation. The magistrate had chosen one of the legally available options and hence the petition was liable to be dismissed.Bharadwaj had also stated that apart from considering the allegations and taking the statement of the complainant the magistrate had also summoned the accused but she had not appeared. He added that the magistrate also went through the report of the police and the footage in which Ranaut had made the defamatory comments against Akhtar.After hearing the submissions the bench had reserved its order on September 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-dismisses-kangana-s-plea-for-quashing-defamation-case-by-akhtar-101631181046350.html

Bhujbal had, however, claimed that there were no irregularities in awarding the contract.The court said there was no material prima facie to indicate that there was a meeting of minds of all the public servants and that they hatched a plan to prepare a status report favourable to the developer. In the meeting, several senior bureaucrats were present and it was difficult to accept that they were all misled into causing losses to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sadan-case-court-discharges-chhagan-bhujbal-his-son-nephew-101631179246307.html

Several images of the pothole went viral on social media.A vital link between Dombivli east and west, the bridge was opened on Tuesday to traffic, two years after it was declared unsafe and shut down on September 15, 2019 by the Central Railway.“The bridge developed a small pothole within two days after it was reopened. Now we are concerned if the civic body has done shoddy work. Since it is still raining, more potholes might develop on the bridge,” said Anand Surve, 38, a commuter.The municipal corporation said the bridge was built in a record time of 16 months during the Covid-19 pandemic and reopened before Ganesh Chathurthi to help reduce traffic snarls in the city.“We have taken up the work of filling up the pothole. There is nothing to worry, since the bridge was constructed during the monsoon period, it has not received proper heat to settle, and that is the reason for the pothole to surface. We have not laid the final layer yet which will be done after the monsoon is over,” said Sapna Koli, city engineer, Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation.“We allowed the reopening of the bridge before the festival season because it was the need of the hour. Some minor work on the bridge is still under progress. The final layer of mastic asphalting is still remaining,” added Koli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-days-after-inauguration-by-cm-thackeray-dombivli-bridge-develops-pothole-101631179186284.html

However, the response to the facility has been lukewarm. The EDMC has warned citizens of action if they fail to register their dogs. “We appeal to citizens to get their pet dogs registered within two months, or EDMC will take appropriate action as per DMC Act. The rule applies even to those who have adopted stray dogs as pets,” said a senior EDMC official who did not wish to be named. Also, officials said, that soon the civic body plans to make it mandatory for dogs to wear collars issued by the registration authority so that missing/abandoned pets can be returned to owners.Under the Delhi Municipal Act 1957, it is mandatory to register all pet dogs with the municipal corporation. There is also a provision of fining the owner if a pet dog is not registered with the civic body.The purpose of the exercise is to prepare a database of pet dog owners, control illegal practices like unregistered dog breeding, and monitor pet vaccination schedules, so that they don’t get diseases.The online registration process requires the pet owner to fill a form and attach requisite documents, after which a token registration number will be generated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/east-delhi-civic-body-launches-portal-for-registration-of-pet-dogs-101631170966130.html

The carcasses were found on Tuesday by people involved in animal rescue in Hunasekatte village in Bhadravati taluk in Shivamogga located around 300km from Bengaluru. The police didn’t provide an exact number, but said a preliminary inspection suggested there could be over 100 carcasses.Superintendent of police Shivamogga Laxmi Prasad said that a case has been registered against Kambadal Hosur gram panchayat officials based on a complaint by local animal rights activists. “The complaint says that the killing of the dogs was orderedby the gram panchayat. We have sought a report on the matter from a team of veterinarians on the cause of the deaths and other details. Further action will be taken based on the report,” said Prasad. Officials of Bhadravati Rural police station, where the complaint has been registered, said that local residents who observed some suspicious activity in the area informed a group involved in animal rescue who found the carcasses of dogs. The activists alleged that the gram panchayat officials contracted a private firm to kill dogs and that some dogs were buried alive as well. Police said the allegations are being investigated. The case has been registered under Section 428 of the Indian Penal Code (killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any animal). Police said that the cause of the death could be identified only after the experts’ report, however, preliminary police investigation suggests that the dogs were poisoned. The gram panchayat officials have maintained that they had not ordered the killing of dogs. Talking to local media, the secretary of Kambadal Hosur gram panchayat B Manjunath said that panchayat had not ordered the capture or culling of dogs. He claimed the panchayat would support the police in its investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/case-against-gram-panchayat-after-over-100-dogs-killed-in-shivamogga-101631167485412.html

Stating his demand was in the larger interest of the common people, the one-time MLA, who represented West Champaran’s Sikta assembly, said, “It has left none in doubt that adulteration in automobile fuel has become rampant in Bihar. The plight of common people can be anybody’s guess in a state where a [former] MLA is not spared by the fuel dispensers.” Gupta alleged that the revelation came to fore on Monday when his vehicle, on way to Patna from Sikta, came to a grinding halt. “After very little fuel left in the tank, I got it filled at a fuel near Mehsi (in East Champaran). But it stopped running after moving for hardly 500 metres. A mechanic found water filled in the tank,” MLA told this newspaper. Meanwhile, the Mehsi police in East Champaran district registered a case (220/21) against the petrol pump owner under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code among other relevant sections. Sunil Kumar Singh, station house officer (SHO), Mehsi police station, on Wednesday said a sample of the fuel has been handed over to the authorities for verification. “The report is awaited,” the SHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/politician-demands-fuel-check-in-bihar-2-days-after-his-car-was-filled-with-water-101631167305299.html

09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ indefinite protest in Karnal enters 3rd day||Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) farmers’ indefinite protest outside Karnal’s mini secretariat entered the third day on Thursday.Social activists have made more arrangements for the protesting farmers at the site. They have provided mattresses and fans for the protesters besides food and shelter. Nirmal Kutia Gurdwara, Jat Dharamshala and NGO Khalsa Aid are also proving support to the farmers.While paramilitary forces and police personnel continue to be deployed around the mini secretariat, farmer leaders have appealed to the farmers of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to reach Karnal in good numbers to ensure a huge gathering over the next two days.Since talks with the administration have failed, senior SKM leaders will hold a meeting in Karnal on September 11 to decide the next course of action. “There is a need to increase strength at the protest site for the next two days until the next decision is taken during the September 11 meeting of the leaders of Haryana farmer unions and SKM,” said Suresh Kauth, a farmer leader from Hisar.Also Read | Karnal stir to mirror Delhi agitation: Rakesh TikaitThe number of protesters came down on Wednesday night. But it swelled again in the morning as farmers, especially those from the nearby villages, came to join the protest. The farmers have vacated the parking areas of private business establishments located opposite the mini secretariat.“We do not want to cause any inconvenience to anybody as our protest is for justice to the victims of lathicharge”, said activist Yogendra Yadav.Farmer leaders have slammed the government’s decision to extend suspension of mobile internet for the next 24 hours in Karnal district. “The government is depriving people of their basic rights by banning internet services. The government should restore the internet services immediately,” said BKU (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains.The farm leaders blockading the mini secretariat have made it clear that they will build a protest site mirroring the agitation sites outside Delhi if the government doesn’t meet their demands regarding controversial police action against the farmers last month.The farmers have vowed to not lift the blockade till the government lodged a case of murder against SDM Ayush Sinha, who was caught on tape allegedly telling policemen to “break heads” if protesters crossed the line during a rally on August 28. They also want him suspended. Sinha has since been transferred and posted as additional secretary of Citizen Resources Information Department (CRID), as per a government order.The statement came after talks between Karnal district officials and farmers, who held a massive mahapanchayat on Tuesday afternoon and later marched into town to surround the mini secretariat, broke down for a second consecutive day. “We will start a morcha at Karnal which will be parallel to the ongoing protests at Delhi borders and our leaders will stay here for further discussion,” said farm leader Rakesh Tikait after the meeting, announcing that the talks had failed on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-indefinite-protest-in-karnal-enters-3rd-day-101631165925297.html
09-09-2021||Patna||After 17 years,NIT-Patna campus development set to begin||Almost 17 years after the erstwhile Bihar College of Engineering in Patna was upgraded as the 18th National Institute of Technology (NIT) in the country, construction of its 125-acre campus will begin in Bihta. Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Patna has its own campus in Bihta though it came into being after NIT.According to a senior official, the foundation stone of NIT-Patna campus-- first delayed due to a controversy over the quantum and quality of land required and then due to the hold-up in allotment-- could be laid in October. “The date may be announced once the tender for construction is awarded. It may happen this month only, as the board of directors of NIT-P gave its go ahead on Thursday. All other preparations have been completed,” he added.A fully residential university, NIT-Patna has struggled for space since its inception in 2004, and despite constructing new buildings at the erstwhile Bihar College of Engineering campus, it was not able to provide accommodation to all its students. Former NIT-P director UC Rai had once said that the ministry of Human Resource development had stopped the institute’s capacity expansion plans till the time it got sufficient infrastructure.NIT-P director PK Jain admitted that the institution has over 4,500 students and not enough hostels, and it would pose more difficulty due to social distancing requirements in the midst of Covid-19 pandemic.“But once the campus is ready, all these problems will be over. The Centre has also provided ₹500 crore despite Covid-19 pandemic for the building. It shows the Centre is also keen on getting the campus ready. We hope to complete the campus within two years from the date of foundation laying. At present we have to keep two students in single-seater rooms and this is the reason we are unable to call students right now despite the Covid situation easing,” Jain added.The National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) is the project management consultant for the NIT’s proposed campus. NBCC signed MoU (memorandum of understanding) with NIT-P earlier this year for supervision of construction and development of Institute integrated campus. The detailed project report (DPR) has already been approved.The journey of what is NIT Patna today started in 1886 with the establishment of pleaders survey training school, which was subsequently converted into the Bihar College of Engineering, Patna in 1924. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is also an alumni of the institution.The proposed campus will comply with the Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) requirements, including sewage treatment plant, solar power plant, battery-operated eco-friendly vehicles, waste-to-energy and water bodies. It will have five academic blocks, an academic block, lecture hall complex, hostels, faculty quarters, director’s residence, staff quarter etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/after-17-years-nit-patna-campus-development-set-to-begin-101631165025341.html

While the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had earlier forecast an intense spell for Delhi and surrounding region from September 6-10, officials said that the low-pressure area has shifted further away, and a moderate to heavy spell of rain may occur from September 10-12. According to IMD officials, the low pressure system that has formed over the Bay of Bengal is moving gradually and will reach northwest and central India by September 10 now. “Light rain activity will, however, continue over the next few days. A moderate to heavy spell is likely from September 10 and may last over two days,” said a senior IMD official. Weather experts said that this month, unlike July and August, so far has not seen a completely dry phase. Also, with the rain forecast over the next few days, September is likely to have more rainy days this monsoon in comparison to the past two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-weather-light-rain-likely-today-says-imd-101631159924639.html
09-09-2021||Delhi||Complaint against DMRC for incorrect signage regarding transgender persons||Transgender activist Dr Aqsa Sheikh has filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) against Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) over misrepresentation of the transgender community at DMRC’s new toilets for transgender persons.“We submit that DMRC has violated Section 8(3) of the Act [Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019 ] under which the appropriate government shall formulate welfare schemes and programmes which are transgender sensitive, non-stigmatising and non-discriminatory,” the complaint read.Last month, DMRC had said in a statement that it has made the provision of allowing transgender persons access to separate toilets at its stations, which were hitherto meant for the disabled only.Dr Sheikh welcomed the DMRC’s initiative but also points out four mistakes made by the DMRC in her complaint. First is that the bilingual signages have used the word ‘ubhaylingi’ in Hindi, which means intersex persons, and not transgender persons. “Since the press release mentions that these signages have been installed in 347 toilets across Delhi Metro stations, there is a huge amplification and spread of incorrect terms. While it is known that the Hindi Translation [of the term] in the Transgender Persons Act is ubhaylingi, the community prefers that the word should be used for intersex persons and not transgender persons,” the complaint read. Dr Sheikh requested immediate removal of all such bilingual signages.Second, the symbol used for transgender persons is an image of half male and half female. The complaint said that this will further the wrong assumption that transgender persons are half male and half female. This violates the order released by chief secretary, NCT of Delhi, in February which mandated the usage of the symbol ‘T’ for transgender persons.The complaint further pointed out that the DMRC press releases uses the term ‘transgenders’, instead of transgender persons. “Transgender is not a noun in the English language but an adjective, a term used to describe a person, it is not the person itself. Hence, the right usage of the term is ‘transgender person’ instead of ‘transgender’,” Dr Sheikh said in her complaint.The complaint said that these signages fail to provide a “safe space and prevent the gender discrimination” that DMRC intended. “These actions reinforce stereotypes and assumptions about transgender persons,” it added.Dr Sheikh also highlighted that the DMRC has not appointed a complaint officer to deal with the complaints relating to the violations of the provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019.“They (DMRC) have not consulted anyone from the community. They should involve the community when they are doing something for the community. Now that we have pointed out the mistakes, the good thing to do is bring the change into all the 347 metro stations,” Dr Aqsa Sheikh told HT. She is the first transwoman in India to be appointed as the nodal officer of a Covid-19 vaccination centre.Anuj Dayal, executive director of corporate communication at DMRC, said in a statement that they are open to replacing the problematic signages and issued clarifications for all the complaints raised by Dr Sheikh. “DMRC is always alive and open to such feedback and will continue to improvise upon its services without hurting the sensibilities of anyone-- advertently or inadvertently,” he added.Transgender and human rights activist Vyjayanti Vasanta Mogli said this goes well beyond DMRC. “Languages have been heavily patriarchal, classist, trans-misogynist at so many levels and there is no equivalent word for ‘transgender persons’ in any of the Indian languages,” she said. Vyjayanti asked why the government has not coined a term for the community when they could come up with a Hindi translation for mobile phones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/complaint-against-dmrc-for-incorrect-signage-regarding-transgender-persons-101631157404733.html

09-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The Ghantaghar encyclopedia||This place is like a sheet of paper that has been folded many times over. So that the original page gets balkanised into many little sheets, with each fold becoming an autonomous territory.The Hari Nagar Ghantaghar crossing is exactly as creasy. The west Delhi landmark looks simple. Just a traffic roundabout with a clock tower in the centre. But then the very many establishments that ring the circle start making their presence felt one by one. Each of them, big and small, appears to singularly contain the unique essence of the Ghantaghar. Together they make the Ghantaghar look vastly huger than it truly is. Indeed. reading aloud these place-names is intensely evocative of that section in Iliad in which Homer famously catalogues the ships and warriors of the Achaean army. Try rapping this Ghantaghar ditty yourself in a single breath—Simpy’s, Ram Cold Drink House, Bedi Travel, Karan’s Kitchenette, Munna Mehendi Art, Aryan Pizza House, Singh Sons Fast Food, Mahesh Burger Center, Krishna Juice & Shakes, Lambu Halwaji, Kamni Tailor, Rachna Digital Imaging Studio, Sardarji Kathi Roll, Gupta Properties, Ravi Tea Stall, Renu Tea Stall, Mewar Prem Ice cream, Bohra Pharmacy, Maa Santoshi Burger Center, Aunty Ji’s Thapa Momos, Bhasin Glass House…”Ironically, one of the more popular places here is without a name. Opened in 1984 by late Bhudev Singh, a migrant from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh, the pavement stall serves chai (and chai things like rusk and fen). The business has passed down to his son, Ramsevak, known as pandit ji. The stall regulars, mostly auto-rickshaw drivers and rickshaw pullers, refer to the tea as pandit ji ki chai. This evening some exhausted rickshaw pullers have parked their rickshaws in front of the stall, and are lying on the passenger’s seat with eyes closed. It’s cloudy today but the shade of the stall’s luscious peepal tree must be consoling in the sweltering heat. Gesturing towards the clock tower, a tea drinker informs that the pink tower was renovated some years ago, and the old clock was replaced by digital display screens. The screens are blank this moment.Time however is making its presence felt with the deepening of the evening. More and more street food sellers are walking into the area, dragging their carts, making the Ghantaghar even more dense than it was minutes ago. These eateries serve until 10, when the life around the clock tower starts to wind down for the night. Pandit ji’s stall closes earlier at 9, but do try his chai. Strong and flavoured with freshly ground cardamom, it fills you with instant freshness.Now a horse cart is passing by, the carriage is loaded with smooth rock-sized lumps of salt. The sight is unbelievable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-ghantaghar-encyclopedia-101631139571956.html

All examination and interview schedules have been badly affected as the powers to take all the decisions are vested with the chairman. The post is lying vacant since July 16 when Lt General Surinder Singh (retd) completed his tenure as the commission head. It has been nearly three months since the successful PCS candidates are awaiting their induction into job. The PCS examination results were declared on June 18. Thousands of candidates are waiting for their examinations of junior engineer, veterinary officer, school principal, assistant professor and other posts which the PPSC had advertised for. On Wednesday, some applicants staged a protest in front of the PPSC office in Patiala.“The written examination for sub-divisional officers (SDOs) has already been conducted but interviews are pending. Due to some queries of the state government, the final merit list of the PCS-passed candidates is still being prepared and it will be completed once the new chairman joins,” said a commission official. Also, there are nearly 80,000 applicants for the posts of naib tehsildar. Karamjit SIngh, secretary examination (PPSC), said, “We have planned the dates for examination and are awaiting approval. They will be notified once approved by the commission.”According to information, of the 30 applicants for the post of PPSC chairman, three names have been shortlisted. Now, the CM has to convene a meeting with the leader of opposition and the Vidhan Sabha speaker to finalise the name of the chairman.Admitting that the process of appointment got delayed, Suresh Kumar, chief principal secretary to the CM, said, “The post is likely to be filled by next week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exam-interview-schedules-hit-as-punjab-public-service-commission-functions-without-chairman-for-2-months-101631135743102.html
09-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Technology steps in as cops on duty follow Covid norms||The Covid-19 pandemic changed many things in the capital. Policing was one of them. Over the last year, the traffic police have relied more on technology to enforce the rules due to social distancing norms, but fewer physical interventions have led to a fall in prosecutions for offences such as drink driving or cellphone use while driving.Senior traffic officials said last year, the total number of challans issued for traffic violations increased compared to 2019, but this increase was primarily due to a rise in camera-based prosecutions in offences such as speeding, signal jumping and stop-line violations.“Last year, the department worked under several restrictions because of Covid-19. We had to ensure that all safety precautions were taken and enforcement also did not suffer. Under these restrictions, we worked to increase technology-based policing, which ensures that there is a balance between manual policing and technology interventions,” said a senior traffic official on condition of anonymity.Prosecutions up, but drink driving cases downTraffic police data shows that last year, the department issued 13,802,973 challans as opposed to 10,580,249 in 2019. However, while the total number of fines issued increased, the number of compounding challans, or on-the-spot challans that are usually slapped for offences such as drink driving and driving while using mobile phones or lane violations saw a decline.From 5,274,957 compounding challans issued in 2019, the number fell to 1,322,623 in 2020.Data also shows that prosecution for drink driving saw the sharpest decline due to the pandemic. On March 19, 2020, days before a nationwide lockdown was imposed, the traffic police issued a notification that “temporarily” stopped breathalyser tests for drink driving because of safety concerns.“No drunken (drink) driving checking will be done unless someone is visibly drunk and is driving so recklessly as to endanger his/her or others’ life, and that too with all possible precautions,” the notification read.Officers said this was done because a driver had to blow into an alcometer or breathalyser, increasing the risk of transmission of the virus to the police personnel. Given the high rate of infection in the city, this was a risky option for the enforcement agencies.Data shows that last year, the traffic department issued 3,986 challans for drink driving — a drastic drop from 36,065 issued in 2019.Return to the old waysDelhi traffic police from September 5, resumed breathalyser tests after a break of over a year. On day one, over 90 commuters were prosecuted. Special commissioner of police (traffic), Muktesh Chander said that now that the city is slowly getting back on track, and bars, pubs and restaurants had opened, it was time that drink driving checking resumed.“The breathalysers are sanitised after each use and the pipes are changed every time. All out teams have also been directed to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour at all time, such as using masks, sanitising their hands and maintaining social distancing while conducting these checks,” Chander said.Driving under the influence of alcohol is punishable by a court challan. In case of first offence, a person is liable to pay a fine of ₹10,000 or face imprisonment up to six months or both. For second and subsequent offences, a fine of ₹15,000 or imprisonment up to two years or both are applicable.Before drink driving prosecutions resumed, drivers who were visibly drunk were being sent to nearby government hospitals for blood alcohol tests.“To ensure that prosecutions for drink driving are not completely ignored, we decided that drunk drivers will be prosecuted based on medical tests. They were sent to nearby government hospitals, where the levels of their blood alcohol are tested and based on those results we challaned them,” another senior traffic police officer said.On New Years’ Eve and on Holi this year, when maximum drink driving prosecutions are made every year, the enforcement teams issued only 100 and 26 challans, respectively. Comparatively in 2019, during New Year’s over 1300 people were challaned and during Holi 647 people were fined for drink driving. All of these were based on medical tests.Law’s long arm falls shortOfficials manning checkpoints across the city said the pandemic has also made it easier for violators to escape checks, with several instances of police officials being run over while trying to stop drivers at pickets.“We still set up checkpoints near pubs and bars, but the difference is that now a lot of people blatantly refuse getting checked citing safety concerns because of Covid. Even though we know that they are just trying to escape action, we cannot do much about it. In many cases, we ask the violators to pull over, but they speed away without caring about who comes in the way,” said a traffic constable in central Delhi.Last August, a 51-year-old traffic officer was run over by a car driver in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar. Then in September last year, a traffic sub-inspector was run over by a truck in north Delhi’s Burari.Way forwardTraffic experts said that new policing tactics will have to be adopted in the post-pandemic world to keep people from harm’s way while ensuring that no offender escapes.“We are still figuring out ways to work our way through the pandemic and that is what the traffic department will also have to figure out. If the governments have opened up bars, pubs and restaurants, there will be some revellers and party-goers who will disregard the law and endanger their own lives and that of others on the road. It is all about adapting to the situation,” said Sheetal Sinha from Citizens for Safer Roads, a road safety group active in Delhi and NCR.Cities across the country are also experimenting with measures to strike a balance between traffic policing and keeping their staff and commuters safe from infection.For instance, the Chennai traffic police, which was among the worst hit by Covid-19 and had over nine officials killed by the infection, has started conducting medical checkups for traffic cops on the spot of their duties. The department, for the purpose, tied up with voluntary organisations.During the first wave, April and May, the Mumbai police also started issuing colour-coded stickers for emergency vehicles, to prioritise them on the roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-technology-steps-in-as-cops-on-duty-follow-covid-norms-101631133026744.html

I have given the task of making arrangements of water and langar to SGPC president Jagir Kaur and chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami,” said Sukhbir while interacting with mediapersons outside a Hoshiarpur court.Later, he made a similar claim in a video shared on social media. He said, “The SAD and SGPC are extending complete support to the ongoing dharna at Karnal. We have responded to Gurnam Singh Charuni’s call for arranging langar and other services for protester.”Addressing the gathering at the protest site at Karnal, Charuni ruled out any such call from his side. “The gurdwara managements are serving us langar for which we are grateful to them. But a statement of Sukhbir Badal has surfaced. I don’t know what his intention behind this statement is,” he claimed.“Gurdwara employees are coming out to serve us on their own. Why would we need to call him (Sukhbir)? He is not a thekedar (contractor) of all the gurdwaras that langar will be provided on his instructions. The head of Gurdwara Nada Sahib met me and informed that they had brought the langar from the shrine. I found the utterances of Badal absurd,” he said.He added, “Neither I called him over phone, nor I have any relation with him. I feel he wants to mislead the farmers. Actually, they have earned a very bad reputation in Punjab and the people are not allowing them to enter their areas.” Addressing a press conference in Amritsar, SGPC head Jagir Kaur said, “While the SGPC was approached by the people through Twitter for langar, the SAD chief also called me asking me to serve the protesters. I assured him that we have already made up our mind to do sewa for the farmers and he did not need to worry.”She said the SGPC will also provide other facilities to the protesters. “Our sub-office in Kurukshetra and managers of gurdwaras in Haryana have been instructed to start working in this regard with immediate effect. Also, teams have been deputed from the gurdwaras along the Haryana border. Arrangements of langar, tea, water, bedding and accommodation will be made for the farmers”, she said. The farmers are struggling for their rights and the SGPC, as the foremost body of the Sikh community, is with them, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sgpc-starts-langar-at-karnal-protest-site-bku-leader-charuni-refutes-sukhbir-badal-s-claim-101631135325757.html

09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Former Youth Akali Dal leader, cousin get life term in 2016 abduction, ₹1 crore ransom case||Former Youth Akali Dal (YAD) Malwa region general secretary Kalyan Singh and his cousin Gurpreet Singh were sentenced to life imprisonment in a case of abduction and ransom of ₹1 crore. Mansa additional sessions judge Dinesh Kumar, who pronounced the judgment, also imposed a penalty of ₹50,000 on the convicts. The two were arrested in October 2016. The judge took a lenient view on the conviction of Kalyan’s son and ordered to release him on probation. He was found guilty under the Arms Act as his licensed weapon was in the possession of Kalyan. Kalyan’s father late Sukhchain Singh Dharampura was Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member from Mansa district and considered close to the Badal family. The case relates to the abduction of Chiman Lal Bansal, a factory owner from Mansa’s Budladha town, on August 5, 2016. Bansal, who was held captive for 15 days in a dungeon near a college run by Dharampura’s family at their native village, was released at Rozawala village in Haryana’s adjoining Sirsa district after ransom was paid. Mansa district attorney Harvinder Singh said the police had recovered about ₹79 lakh from the abductors. Court questions investigating officer’s role The additional sessions judge took a strong exception to the investigation and conduct of one of the investigating officers (IO), Balwant Singh, the then Budladha Sadar station house officer. The court asked the Mansa senior superintendent of police (SSP) to conduct a thorough probe into Balwant’s role in the abduction. “He (Balwant) was using his official number on a newly purchased mobile, which was bought in the name of (convict) Kalyan. He was exonerated in the inquiry without giving any concrete reason. The police official failed to give any reason or explanation for using his official number on a mobile phone purchased by third party,” read the 118-page judgment. The court observed that a professional conduct on part of the police may have led to the early release of Bansal. “There is no doubt that IO has made serious lapses by not collecting the call detail records of the SIMs used by Chiman Lal and his family members from August 8 to 20. The call location could have helped the police to locate the victim who could be rescued immediately. The next flaw in the investigation is that (victim’s brother) Surinder Kumar Bansal produced a DVD having recording of the conversation between the abductors and family members of Chiman Lal. But the DVD was not sent for forensic test for ascertaining its authenticity,” it added. Also, the judge expressed surprise over the fact that the police did not initiate proceedings against the abductors under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) even as at a huge amount of foreign currency was seized from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-youth-akali-dal-leader-cousin-get-life-term-in-2016-abduction-rs-1-crore-ransom-case-101631135323004.html
09-09-2021||Chandigarh||BJP appoints Gajendra Sekhawat Punjab affairs in-charge for 2022 assembly polls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday appointed Union cabinet minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat as its Punjab affairs in-charge in the run-up to the assembly elections early next year. Besides Shekhawat, the Jal Shakti minister in the Narendra Modi cabinet, Union ministers Hardip Singh Puri and Meenakshi Lekhi and Lok Sabha MP Vinod Chawra have been appointed co-incharges for the Punjab elections, according to the directions issued by party national president JP Nadda. Shekhawat is second-time MP from the Jodhpur constituency of Rajasthan. He is known as an astute political manager having strong eyes on the ground. He had also convened a meeting of both Haryana and Punjab on the contentious issue of the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) on the directions of the Supreme Court.Puri, Union minister for petroleum and urban development who is the only Sikh face in the Modi cabinet, had unsuccessfully contested from the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 general elections. Lekhi, Union minister of state for external affairs, belongs to the Punjabi community in the national capital and is an MP from New Delhi.In the BJP rank and file, these appointments are being seen as a reflection of the seriousness of the party in contesting the Punjab assembly elections in 2022. Punjab is being counted as the toughest for the BJP from the states going to the polls early next year.The stakes are high for the saffron party this time in Punjab as it has announced to contest all 117 assembly seats amid an unprecedented backlash against its state and central leadership in the state due to the farmers’ protests against the three agriculture laws. Earlier, the BJP used to contest the Punjab elections in 23 constituencies in alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) that snapped ties with it over the three laws. With these appointments, the BJP has sounded a poll bugle in Punjab as the entire command of the state unit will be in the hands of new election incharges. Party leaders claim that this is for the first time that the party has appointed election incharges for Punjab when there are more than five months left for the polls. “The party is fully gearing up for the polls and these appointments show that we will fight in Punjab with full might,” said state BJP chief Ashwani Sharma. The party on Wednesday also started preparations for the constituency-level workers’ meetings starting from September 20 in Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-appoints-gajendra-sekhawat-punjab-affairs-in-charge-for-2022-assembly-polls-101631135263098.html
09-09-2021||Mumbai||In unusual occurrence, woman gives birth to triplets through normal delivery||In an unusual case, a 32-year-old woman from Bhiwandi had triplets through normal delivery early on Tuesday. Doctors said that the case was rare also since the woman was in her 35th week of pregnancy and that the babies were conceived naturally and not with the help of assisted reproductive technology. The woman, a housewife, was in her hometown in Uttar Pradesh due to the pandemic. Despite being pregnant, she did not seek any gynaecological scan till June, when she and her husband, a daily wage labourer, returned to Bhiwandi.“We put her on regular follow-ups after she came to us for a check-up and had planned her Cesarean section,” said gynaecologist Dr Humaira Shaikh, who conducted the delivery at Bhiwandi’s Royal Hospital. “We also gave her blood transfusions during the follow-up as she was anaemic,” she said. On Tuesday at around 12.15 am, the woman experienced pain in her abdomen. By the time she was rushed to the hospital, she was already in labour. “We carried out preliminary investigations and realised that we can go ahead with a normal vaginal delivery as the first baby was in a vertex position,” said Shaikh. Commonly during birth, the baby’s head comes out first and this is known as the vertex position. Shaikh and her team had kept the backup of the C-section ready. An anaesthetist was on standby in case an emergency procedure had to be undertaken. Before the second baby was delivered, the woman was shifted to the operation theatre. However, the second baby was also in the vertex position and could be delivered normally. “The third baby was in a horizontal position, but we got enough space to move the baby and go ahead with the delivery,” said Shaikh adding that the babies- two boys and a girl- weighed 1.7kg, 1.8kg and 1.9 kg. “They are low weight babies but stable with no respiratory issues,” she said. A natural conception of triplets is seen in one in 8,000 cases. “Delivering triplets through a normal delivery at 35 weeks is also rare,” said Mumbai based gynaecologist Dr Jatinder Kaur who practices at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital. Kaur has delivered triplets at 35 weeks only once in her 15-year long practice through a C-section. “In higher-order pregnancies, maternal complications like postpartum haemorrhage are known. Expert neonatal care is also essential. Therefore, it is advisable to plan a C-section in advance,” said Kaur. Dr Ashok Anand, head of the gynaecology department at the state-run JJ Hospital agreed that it was an unusual case. “It is common to see triplets in an In-vitro Fertilisation (IVF) case, but rare in a natural conception. Also, such multiple pregnancies are always delivered via C-section procedures to lower the risk of complications,” he said. Anand said he recalls delivering triplets normally only once at JJ Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-unusual-occurrence-woman-gives-birth-to-triplets-through-normal-delivery-101631135204186.html

An official said there is a total pendency of 4.5 lakh cases in the high court and between March 24, 2020 and August 31, 2021, as many as 1,37,101 cases were filed. Of these, 90,543 cases –nearly 66% --- were disposed of. Courts had to be shut due to Covid-19 outbreak on March 24, 2020. The HC administration has reacted to some reports claiming that pendency in the court has gone up to 7 lakh cases during Covid. The mismatch in data being shown on the national judicial data grid was due to some glitch in two internal case management systems of high court. The synchronisation has now been done. Sharing details about the trial courts, the officer said that between April 1, 2020 and July 31, 2021, as many as 7,23,041 cases were filed in Punjab courts and 4,42,693 were disposed of. In Haryana, 7,37,718 cases were filed and 3,93,831 were disposed of during this period. In Chandigarh, 39,595 cases were instituted and 27,767 were disposed of in the same period.

09-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC orders CBI probe into Ankit Gujjar’s ‘custodial killing’||The Delhi high court on Wednesday transferred the probe in the alleged custodial killing of 29-year-old Ankit Gujjar on August 4 at Tihar jail to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), saying that he lost his life to “custodial violence in violation of his constitutional rights”.“Consequently, this court deems it fit to transfer the investigation of case FIR No.451/2021 under sections 302/323/341/34 IPC registered at PS Hari Nagar, Delhi to CBI. The case file be transferred to CBI immediately by the concerned police station. A status report will be filed by the concerned SP, CBI after carrying out investigation before this court well before the next date of hearing,” justice Mukta Gupta said.The judge said that if the allegations of extortion by Gujjar’s family are correct, “it is a very serious offence which requires in-depth investigation”. She said the injuries on Gujjar’s body indicated that he was “brutally beaten” and “left unattended”.“Walls of prison, howsoever high they may be, the foundation of a prison is laid on the rule of law ensuring the rights to its inmates enshrined in the Constitution of India,” the court said.The judgment comes on a plea by Gujjar’s mother, Geeta, who sought a CBI probe into the alleged murder of her son.In her plea, Gujjar’s family contended that he was being harassed by the jail officials as he was “unable to meet their regularly increasing demands for money”, and was murdered “as a part of pre-planned conspiracy”.In her plea, Geeta said her son was murdered “as part of a pre-planned conspiracy”.The gangster’s family have named Tihar deputy superintendent Narendra Meena, three constables, and an assistant superintendent in the FIR. However, the other accused have not been named in the report. HT has seen the copy of the FIR, in which police have also noted allegations of bribery and extortion by jail officers.According to officials, Meena and three others have been suspended a pending magisterial inquiry and police investigation.Deputy superintendent Meena told the investigating officer that they conducted an inspection inside Gujjar’s cell on April 3 afternoon and found a cell phone, a data cable, and a knife.Meena said Gujjar and two other inmates of the cell number 3 assaulted him and other officials, after which Gujjar was transferred to another cell, and the other two prisoners were sent to a different cell. Jail officers told the investigating officer that between 6am and 6.30am on August 4, when they went to check on Gujjar during the roll-call, he was found unconscious and taken to the jail hospital, where Gujjar was declared “brought dead” by doctors.Justice Mukta Gupta on Wednesday said that even when Ankit got injured and was alive, he was not given proper medical treatment so that his life could have been saved. It said that an investigation needs to be carried out not only to the extent as to who committed the offence of brutally assaulting him, but also the role of jail doctors in not providing proper treatment at the right time is required to be ascertained by a proper inquiry.“Not only did Narender Meena and others assault the deceased mercilessly, the jail doctor on duty also failed to perform his duty when he examined Ankit at 1am in the intervening night of August 3-4 and administered an injection, and he neither informed the senior officers about Ankit’s condition nor referred Ankit to the hospital,” the judge said.CCTV switched offCiting a prison report, HT reported on September 4 that between 9.30am on August 3 and 4.50pm on August 4, when Gujjar allegedly got into a scuffle with jail officers and was found unconscious in another part of the prison, CCTV cameras inside ward 1 and 5A of Tihar jail 3 were switched off for “maintenance work”.The judge said the case calls for immediate remedial actions by the state and director general (prisons) so that unscrupulous officers at the jail do not take advantage of knowledge of the non-working of the CCTVs so that they can get away by doing any illegal act/offences.The court told the director general (prisons) to file a status report indicating the measures taken to streamline the system as regards the CCTV cameras in the jail and what alternative measures can be taken when they are not working. It also asked for accountability to be fixed of the jail officers and doctors, and the mechanism by which immediate entry is provided to the police to the jail on receipt of an information of a cognisable offence.Gujjar’s family, through advocate Mehmood Pracha, argued that the police were not conducting investigation in proper format as the digital video recorder of the CCTV in the jail was yet to be recovered, and the aspect of extortion of money by jail officials through online transactions was not being looked into.The plea also submitted that the jail authorities in Tihar were operating an “organised extortion syndicate” and the police were trying to manipulate the investigation in order to save and shield the culprits.The judge said the DG (Prisons) “failed to notice the connivance/laxity” of the jail deputy superintendent who did not permit the local police to go inside the jail to inquire into the call made to the local police in connection with the incident on the night of August 3.A departmental inquiry, conducted by the DG (Prisons) Sandeep Goel, into Gujjar’s death has found “negligence” on the part of certain prison staffers, officials said on Monday.“Appropriate departmental action will be taken against them (staff),” Goel said.The court will next hear the case on October 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-orders-cbi-probe-into-ankit-gujjar-s-custodial-killing-101631132905892.html

He also sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s immediate intervention to ensure that farmers were not short-changed. At a time when farmers across the country were aggrieved with the BJP-led NDA government over the three new agriculture laws, the Centre has announced the lowest MSP hike in recent years, said the SAD chief. Sukhbir said it was shocking that the government was not taking into account the unprecedented increase in the prices of diesel and fertilisers in the last one year. “It has also failed to calculate the MSP by taking into account all comprehensive costs of farmers, including land rental and interest forgone on owned land and fixed capital assets. A minimum of 50% profit should be ensured to farmers after calculating all comprehensive costs incurred by them,” he added. Sukhbir said the low MSP announced by the Centre would result in a slowdown in agriculture growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-badal-rejects-rs-40-per-quintal-wheat-msp-hike-terms-it-meagre-101631133702986.html
09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Centre’s wheat MSP hike pathetic, says Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday dubbed the wheat MSP hike of ₹40 per quintal by the Centre as “pathetic”. Amarinder Singh slammed the Union government for “rubbing salt into the wounds” of farmers, who have been out on roads agitating against the Centre’s farm laws for the past around 10 months. The Centre on Wednesday hiked the minimum support price (MSP) for wheat by ₹40 to ₹2,015 per quintal and asserted that the system of procuring crops at support prices will continue. At a time when the country’s agriculture sector is passing through a “distress” phase and the farmers are agitating for a remunerative MSP, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government played a “cruel joke” on the “annadaatas”, said the CM in an official statement. He demanded wheat MSP of ₹2,830 per quintal. Singh said farmers should not be forced to subsidise the consumers, which they have been doing since long. “Why is the Centre treating our farmers so obnoxiously,” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centres-wheat-msp-hike-pathetic-says-punjab-cm-capt-amarinder-singh-101631133222924.html

09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ Karnal siege drives Haryana govt to unease||The row At the centre of the latest round of confrontation between the farmers and the government is the 2018-batch IAS officer Ayush Sinha. The farmers’ grouse against Sinha is that he, as per a viral video clip, directed police to ‘crack their heads’ if farmers breached the security cordon during the August 28 meeting of the BJP in Karnal. Another contentious issue is the death of one peasant, Sushil Kajal (45) of Raipur Jattan village of Gharaunda sub-division of Karnal district, allegedly as a result of the lathi charge. “Because we do not have a postmortem report or MLR that is why we are seeking compensation, otherwise we would have demanded FIR under section 302 against cops and other officers,” farmer leader Yogendra Yadav said. However, the BKU (Haryana) leader Gurnam Singh Charuni refused to speak on this issue. Hence, linked to any positive outcome of Karnal standoff are three sticky points: Action against the IAS officer; ₹25 lakh compensation to the kin of farmer who died, and ₹2 lakh each to injured farmers. Farmers’ demand against IAS officer The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers’ outfits spearheading the stir against the farm laws, has been demanding to register a murder case against IAS officer Sinha. Now, apparently realising that the government is unlikely to buckle under such pressures, the SKM leaders are pressing for suspension of the IAS officer while also seeking an inquiry into the the role of Sinha as SDM Karnal in the run up to police baton charge on August 28. Government’s stand Right from the beginning, the government has been stoutly defending the officer and police action. Though chief minister had admitted that Sinha’s choice of words was wrong, he defended the police action. Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, however, had condemned Sinha’s instructions to the police. After transferring Sinha out of Karnal, the state government doesn’t appear in a mood to accept farmers demand about punitive action against him and others. Government sources say, to break the logjam, the government may agree to hold an inquiry into the lathi charge incident. The government is also open for talks on farmers’ demand for compensation.Karnal SP Ganga Ram Punia says there is no evidence to prove that Sushil Kajal had died as result of injuries received during the lathi charge. The government has been questioning the veracity of this (death) claim, saying why the farmer who died was not taken to hospital for first aid if he was injured so severely in police action and why the postmortem was not conducted to ascertain cause of the death?

The lament is that Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) which form a major chunk of the 14,000-odd textile units in the city have been ignored. The announcement has also disappointed Ludhiana’s bicycle industry, which was hoping to be part of the scheme. The PLI scheme is for textiles, for man-made fibres and apparel and 10 segments/products of technical textiles. Sudershan Jain, president, Knitwear Apparel Manufacturers Association of Ludhiana (KAMAL, said, “The scheme is for new investment of ₹100 crore and ₹300 crore, and that too for building, plant and machinery only, while land is excluded.” He added, “Anyone wishing to make such an investment will need to purchase land. Other condition to be fulfilled is to achieve minimum turnover of between ₹200 crore and ₹600 crore that too, only in man-made fibre segment, for getting the incentives under the scheme. How many of us in Ludhiana will go for the scheme?”.Jain added that even as the Centre wanted to compete with China, this was not possible at all by ignoring the MSMEs, which play an important role in textile clusters in various states. “The MSME sector can also bring turnover, provided they are given adequate incentives on similar lines,” he added. Vinod Thapar, president, Knitwear Club, said, “Over 90% of textile units in Ludhiana are small and medium scale, and the scheme has nothing for them. Only corporates and large-scale industries will stand to benefit.” Amit Thapar, vice-chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said scheme was definitely beneficial for bigger players. “The scheme will help contribute to economies of scale. However, the threshold limit for investment could have been lower like ₹50 crore, instead of ₹100 crore. Aspiring MSMEs, wanting to grow can also benefit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/textile-scheme-fails-to-cut-ice-with-ludhiana-industry-101631131846125.html

The chief minister, who prepared the mouth-watering delicacies himself, personally served food to his special guests. “The food always tastes better if served directly from the cooking vessel,” said the chief minister. On the platter were: Mutton khara pishori, laung elachi chicken, aaloo korma, dal masri, murg korma, dugani biryani and zarda rice (sweet dish). “I started at 11 in the morning, and most of it was done by around 5 pm. Then it was time for some final touches. I loved every minute of it,” said the chief minister. “They (sportspersons) have worked so hard to win us glory, what I have done for them is nothing in comparison to it,” Amarinder remarked. Hockey Captain Manpreet Singh said he had heard about the Maharaja’s cooking but what he savoured exceeded his expectations. “It was rich and excellent food,” said Tokyo sensation Neeraj Chopra. The other special guests for the evening included Harmanpreet Singh (Hockey vice-captain) and his teammates Mandeep Singh, Hardik Singh, Rupinder Pal Singh, Shamsher Singh, Dilpreet Singh, Gurjant Singh, Varun Kumar and Simranjit Singh. Women hockey semi-finalist Gurjit Kaur and Reena Khokhar, reserve hockey player Krishan Bahadur Pathak and Olympics finalist discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur, were also among the guests. Olympics race-walker Gurpreet Singh and shooter Angadveer Singh Bajwa also attended the dinner. Amarinder had promised such a meal to the Punjab players who had participated and also won medals at the Tokyo Olympics during a felicitation function last month. It was Kamalpreet Kaur who initiated this request to him during the felicitation function. “The Punjab CM has a big heart. I requested him for such a get-together, and he was kind enough to agree to it. It feels wonderful when a person of his stature values athletes. I will never forget this gesture,” said Kamalpreet, who hails from Kabar Wala, Malout, a village in Muktsar district. She had finished sixth in the discus throw event at Tokyo. Amarinder had said during the function that he was not a foodie but loved cooking for his guests.

After the assessment, we will be able to direct our efforts on such locations and sensitise the locals,” said Mitra, who has also called a meeting of all sanitary inspectors and other officials concerned on September 11 to discuss the issue.The MC had taken over door-to-door garbage collection in December last year, and has deployed around 525 two-bin vehicles to collect segregated waste. The vehicles were brought for around ₹40 crore cost through the Chandigarh Smart City Limited.Nearly 80% localities have been covered with these vehicles, but the civic body is still receiving mixed waste from most areas. Though no exact figure is available, MC officials have earlier estimated that only 60% households are giving segregated wet and dry waste.The collection of mixed waste is also affecting the working of the two material recovery facilities at the Industrial Area. Another facility is planned by December 2021.These facilities have a dedicated space for sorting recoverable dry waste into different categories, including paper, card, recyclable plastic, glass bottles and metal. The leftover dry waste is moved to the compost plant at Dadumajra. “There is no uniformity at material recovery facilities. While garbage collection vehicles from some areas bring segregated waste, others bring mixed waste. For the facility to function properly, we need to have segregated waste at source,” said Mitra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/waste-segregation-chandigarh-mc-to-study-status-across-localities-101631131782789.html
09-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations prohibited over Covid concerns||Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in public places and processions or gatherings related to it have been prohibited in the Capital due to the Covid-19 pandemic for the second consecutive year. An order to notify the ban on festivities was issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday night. Ganesh Chaturthi will be celebrated on Friday, September 10 this year and the 11-day celebration will conclude on September 21.The order, signed by Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, urged devotees to celebrate the festival at home. “Ganesh Chaturthi festival will be celebrated during this month, i.e. in the month of September, 2021 and considering the prevailing restrictions on gatherings and congregations and present situation of Covid-19 pandemic, it has been decided that Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations may not be allowed in public places and people may be advised to celebrate the festival at their home only,” said the order seen by HT.All district magistrates and the Delhi Police have been directed to ensure that no idol of Lord Ganesha is set up in tents, pandals or public places. They also have been asked to disallow any form of procession, and not grant permissions to any committees. Around 100 committees seek permission for community celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi in Delhi every year, but thousands of people celebrate in their homes, and then immerse idols in the Yamuna.Delhi has added an average of 40 fresh Covid-19 cases each day over the past seven days, shows state government data. The city has added just 17 deaths from the viral infection over the past month, as caseloads have dropped to their lowest since the early days of the pandemic in March last year.“All district magistrates and their counterpart district deputy commissioners of police and all authorities concerned shall ensure strict compliance of this order and shall adequately inform and sensitise the field functionaries about these instructions for strict compliance in letter and spirit,” the order said.“It is also directed that the district magistrates and district DCPs shall convene meetings with religious/community leaders/Ganesh Chaturthi festival committees before the festival to get their cooperation to maintain law and order and harmony and also to sensitise public for compliance of guidelines.instructions issued for combating Covid-19 by the government from time to time,” the order added.Ashok Bansal, general secretary of Ganesh Mahotsav Samitee in south Delhi’s Mehrauli said this time almost all the committees voluntarily decided not to organise any public event during the festival because of the pandemic.“Those who want to celebrate can do so at home only. Idol immersion along the river or other such places is not allowed as it leads to congregations or processions. So, people are requested to only get ecofriendly idols for their homes as they get dissolved in a tub of water. We all did that last year and then water our plants with it,” he said.A revenue official said the government is planning to create about a dozen artificial ponds for immersion. “This is because not everyone has adequate space to immerse or dispose of the idol in their homes or localities. So, there will be a few who will turn up for immersions, despite the prohibition. The idea is to get that done under strict surveillance with proper social distancing and ensuring no more than two or three people,” the official said.Naresh Goel, member of the Ganesh Puja Samiti in Nehru Place said some temples will stream the pujas online. “No committee planned anything this time in terms of public ceremony because DDMA orders even before Tuesday’s order were clear that no form of gathering or congregation will be allowed in the city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-ganesh-chaturthi-celebrations-prohibited-over-covid-concerns-101631127726700.html

Pardeep Singh, former assistant secretary-cum-cashier of the society, has accused government employees of perpetuating the crime of embezzlement and misuse of loan amount in the name of the dead members and NRIs. “The society has 1,500 members; of these, 25 members had died without repayment of loan; another 15 fled abroad without repaying the loan of ₹43 lakh. Later, their family members had repaid their loans. A few employees, however, did not deposit the amount into the account of the society, thereby embezzling the money,” Pardeep’s complaint reads. Pardeep has also handed over documents proving this embezzlement to the vigilance. He adds, “Under the rules governing a cooperative society, membership terminates on death or going abroad. A few employees took undue advantage of this clause, as loanees were not there to object it. All the wrongdoing took place between 2002 and 2018. These employees also embezzled fertilizers worth over ₹23 lakh. As soon as I lodged a complaint, some of these employees have started returning the money to the society.” Pardeep alleged that the management of the society re-employed two such employees, accused of corruption, in 2018 and 2019 on contract, without the approval of the department. Sources added that the society did not act against an employee accused of involvement in embezzlement of fertilisers, even after a direction from the assistant registrar. HT has a copy of these directions. DSP Kewal Karishan of vigilance bureau said, “The probe has been registered at the head office of the bureau.

The deceased has been identified as Joga Singh of Dudhana village. The jathedar’s post had fallen vacant after the death of gurdwara’s head priest Gopal Singh three months ago. Locals said a group of people, including Sahab Singh, Kamal Singh, Kulbir Singh, Multan Singh, illegally took control of the gurdwara on Tuesday and intended to appoint Kulbir Singh as the head priest. The devotees, on the other hand, wanted Mahender Singh as the head priest of the shrine. On Wednesday, some devotees reached the gurdwara to clear the illegal occupation. But the accused allegedly opened fire and also attacked them with sharp-edged weapons. Gurdeep Singh, a local resident, said efforts were being made to resolve the issue when the firing took place. One of the injured Ajmer Singh filed a police complaint and named 16 people for the attack. Kaithal police station in-charge Surender Singh said the FIR has been registered against 16 people under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 323-324 (voluntarily causing hurt), 148, 149 (rioting) of the IPC and sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act.

Farmers seem to be ready for a long haul as they have pitched tents, arranged langar, hookahs, medicines, fruits, tea and snacks at the protest site. For entertainment, troupes of Ragini singers are there. Even, CCTV cameras have been installed around the protest site and young volunteers are monitoring the movement of people. Leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), including Rakesh Tikait, Gurnam Singh Charuni, Baldev Singh Sirsa and Yogendra Yadav, are also camping in Karnal to boost the morale of farmers. Hundreds of farmers, including women from different parts of the state, have joined the protest. Tikait accused the government of forcing farmers to open a new front. “Karnal will be another centre of farmer protest and we will stay here until they accept our demands. More farmers from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab will reach Karnal soon,” said Tikait. “We will end this agitation within five minutes if the government accepts our demands. Now, the ball is in government’s court for how long it wants to see this agitation continue,” said Yogendra Yadav. However, the protest didn’t have any major impact on the movement of visitors and employees as the rear gates are open. Only employees whose offices are located opposite to the mini-secretariat faced some hardships as the farmers have pitched tents in the parking area.

Of the 40 students, as many as 10 with severe injuries had to be hospitalised. According to the information, the corporal punishment was given as the students were making noise. The teachers who have been booked were identified as Rajni, Mange Ram and Charanjit Singh. Three students and their parents, who made a joint complaint before Tohana City police station, said a student blew whistle in the classroom when no teacher was present. “Three teachers visited the class and asked us to reveal the name of the student who whistled. The students said they did not know whose act it was. Then teachers started thrashing us brutally and we received injuries on back, legs and other parts of the body. Charanjit Singh made casteist remarks at us and threatened to rusticate us if we revealed this incident to our parents,” the students added. Physical education teacher Rajni also lodged a coounter FIR against three Class 11 students, accusing them of misbehaving with her and hurling abuses. Police have booked three students in this regard. Ram Chander, a parent, said the teachers had given punishment to the entire class instead of identifying the student who misbehaved in the classroom. “My son was brutally thrashed and he is hospitalised. There were injury marks on his body. We have asked the police to arrest these teachers,” he added. Tohana DSP Biram Singh said they have booked three teachers under sections 294 (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 34 (acts done by several persons with furtherance intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 of the SC/ST Act, while three students were also booked on a complaint filed by a woman teacher. Haryana State Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson, Jyoti Bainda, asked Fatehabad superintendent of police to submit a report within five days. “It came to the fore that three teachers had beaten up as many as 40 students with sticks. We have asked the police to conduct a medical examination of the students and take proper action in this matter,” she added. Fatehabad district education officer Dayanand Sihag said he has ordered an inquiry by block education officer and asked him to submit a report at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-govt-teachers-who-beat-up-40-class-11-students-in-tohana-booked-101631130891013.html

(It was) leaked to my prejudice. Despite enquiry, they are not in the position to assist this court,” said the counsel.“I’m not saying Delhi Police leaked it. I’m saying Delhi Police is the custodian and must answer for it. If an official file or register had been missing, there would have been 15 FIRs by now. If I had shared it..I want them to feel the same outrage that I’m feeling right now,” he added.In its status report filed on August 5, the police said that while the enquiry could not establish how the details of investigation were shared with media, no prejudice was caused to Tanha in his exercise of right to free and fair trial. It further claimed that various media personnel, who were examined during the process, “refused to share the details of their source”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/need-independent-probe-into-tanha-s-statement-leaks-lawyer-tells-delhi-hc-101631127926013.html
09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Two Mohali men convicted, fined for lockdown violations||For violating Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, local courts in Mohali have convicted and fined two men who were booked in April last year. While one of cases was registered against a resident of Sector 78, who was caught loitering during the lockdown on April 3, 2020, the other was against a trader who was booked on April 25, 2020, for opening his footwears shop.The nationwide lockdown to contain the virus spread was imposed for the first time in March last year. Mohali has been one of the worst-hit districts in Punjab and has also registered maximum number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the tricity area. In the first case, Mehta, a resident of Sector 78, Mohali, was booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) after lockdown violations in area falling under the Sohana police station. Tarun did not contest the charge and pleaded guilty before the court of judicial magistrate first class, Mohali, Mukesh Kumar Singla. In its order on September 7, the court observed: “There is no dearth of instances when people throw caution to the wind, thereby imperiling the life and property of others... It is an appropriate time to send a clear signal to the persons behaving in such a negligent manner, that their conduct will not be condoned.” Convicting Mehta, the court imposed a fine of ₹1,000 on him.In the other case, Rajan Sharma, 41, who has a footwears shop on Ropar Road in Kurali, was booked under Sections 188 and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life) of the IPC despite a ban on non-essential commercial operations.The prosecution had sought a severe punishment, stating that opening the shop was likely to spread Covid-19, which is a fatal disease. The court of judicial magistrate, first class, Kharar, Sudipa Kaur, held Sharma guilty and imposed a fine of ₹2,000 on him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-mohali-men-convicted-fined-for-lockdown-violations-101631130822769.html

With this decision, a reiteration of the previous verdict delivered in February 2021, 850MW power purchase has been disallowed. The PSERC ruling came on a review petition that the PSPCL had filed against the regulator denying approval to Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), Kolkata; Pragati Power Corporation Limited and Meja Urja Nigam Power Private Limited, aggregating to 885.10 MW. In a strange turn of events, the review petition asked for approval to the PPA with the DVC, but just last month in August, the PPA had taken approval of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to scrap the PPA, citing the high cost. “PSPCL’s proposal of procurement of 885.10 MW on long-term basis from projects Meja, Pragati-III and DVC’s Raghunathpur, Durgapur & Bokaro Stations at the given per unit price of ₹5.53; ₹4.82; ₹4.61; ₹4.44 and ₹4.39 respectively, would not be an economically viable proposition, particularly so, when much cheaper power is available in the market. As such, it would not be in the interest of consumers of Punjab, if procurement from these stations at the indicated rates is approved. The commission does not think it prudent to permit the same at the indicated prices,” read orders of the chairman Vishawjeet Khanna, adding that the PSPCL shall be at liberty to approach it in case, it is able to renegotiate prices to commercially viable levels.The commission noted that a substantial amount of energy is being surrendered by PSPCL from DVC power stations, which belies the claim that power from this source is consistently required throughout the year, and not only in the paddy season. The PSERC said that the PSPCL should buy at up to ₹3 per unit, including fixed and variable cost.To demolish the PSPCL claim that a gas-based power station can be used as a peaking station, the commission observed, “The PSPCL has its own hydro power stations which may be used as and when peaking power station for flexible operation as required. There appears to be no cause to review the order,” the PSERC adds in its latest order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/not-in-consumer-interest-regulator-on-pspcl-plea-to-buy-power-at-above-rs-4-per-unit-101631130764071.html

According to the department, both were beneficiaries of foreign assets maintained and controlled through business entities and also of foreign bank accounts maintained with a bank in Geneva.The department had also alleged that they made false statements and wilfully omitted, giving the required information(does it read ok) to it. The department has accused them of tax evasion and allegedly amassing wealth in other countries. It was in this case, that the ED had moved an application seeking inspection of files.Earlier, the CM’s counsel had argued that there is an agreement with France as per which information on income tax could only be shared with persons or authorities involved in the assessment or collection of taxes. It was also argued that as per the 2011 communication from income tax to the French authorities, it was assured that information would be kept secret and not used for other than taxation purposes, and will be handled strictly as per the rules of confidentiality. “Hence, the trial court order requires a re-look,” the counsel added.The I-T department told the court that these issues were never raised before, also pointed out that they have not put in appearance in the complaint case by IT. Hence, stay order be not passed. The department also brought to notice of the court that probes against legislators are being monitored by Supreme Court and same had to be expedited.The court, however, was of the view that if there was no such bar on sharing information, the ED could have easily obtained the same from I-T department as both are under the control of the Union finance ministry. It also observed that the information was available in court records and there was no such tearing hurry, which would require the ED to get its hands on it immediately.The court has sought response from the ED and the I-T by October 4, clarifying that the petitioners need not appear before the trial court. It has also summoned original record of the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-stays-ludhiana-court-order-on-ed-inspecting-i-t-case-files-of-punjab-cm-101631129744456.html

The police handed over the idol to the archeology department on August 31.“It is 100 percent local workmanship with influence of Gandhara School of Art,” said Mushtaq Ahmad Beigh, in-charge deputy director of the department of archives, archaeology and museums.According to Encyclopedia Britannica, Gandhara Art is the style of Buddhist visual art that developed in what is now northwestern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan between the 1st century BCE and the 7th century CE.“We have different schools of art like Kashmir School of Art, Jammu School of Art, Basohli School of Art, etc. There were Gandhara and Mathura schools of art too,” he said.He said apart from the influence of Gandhara art, Kashmir sculpturing was different from other parts of the world. “Our workmanship is different from others. Our sculptures are ‘finer’ than others. That is why our sculptures are more beautiful and delicate,” he said. Beigh said another proof of its local connect was it being made of black stone.The idol (8”x6” approx) is of Goddess Durga seated on a lion’s throne along with four attendants. We are yet to conduct its exact sizing,” he said.The official said that the idol was a miniature version of mother goddess and a process is underway to shift it to the SPS museum that already has a bigger Durga idol.“We have an idol of 16-armed Durga. Mattan and Anantnag too have similar statues,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/durga-idol-found-last-month-is-local-art-with-gandhara-touch-officials-101631129562762.html
09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: CHB panel to study options for need-based changes||A committee headed by the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) secretary will examine the long-standing demand of allottees for more relaxations in the regularisation policy for need-based changes in its residential units.The decision was taken during a meeting of the CHB board of directors on Wednesday. Among the demands is the adoption of the Delhi model for a one-time settlement policy, which will also be looked into afresh. The issue affects around 4.5 lakh people residing in 65,000-odd CHB houses in the city.“All options, including the one-time policy, are on the table. The committee will examine all these options to decide what further need-based changes can be considered in residential units,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB. Earlier this year, the CHB refused to provide any more relaxations after the CHB Residents’ Welfare Federation took up the matter with the UT administrator’s office. However, with municipal elections round the corner, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been pushing for more relaxations and had even held a protest outside the CHB office. Prem Kaushik, a CHB board member and vice-president of the Chandigarh BJP, said: “During the meeting, officials were not in favour of allowing more relaxations under need-based changes. After a detailed discussion, wherein I suggested six solutions, the board decided to constitute a committee.” The committee also comprises members of other UT departments concerned. It will be consulting nominated members of the board, resident welfare associations and other stakeholders to find some “innovative solutions”. Its report will be placed before the board for final decision.Meanwhile, giving some relief to the allottees, the board on Wednesday decided that in case any allotment has been cancelled due to building violations and an appeal is pending before the board, it will be restored on two conditions: removal of all building violations by December 31, 2021, and payment of applicable revival/restoration charges. What is the regularisation policy The CHB came out with a regularisation policy for the first time in 2017. However, it received only 40 applications. The policy was further relaxed in 2019, allowing regularisation of various additions and alterations in dwelling units, though encroachments were not covered.Despite the relaxations, a survey conducted in 2020 found that 90% of the CHB’s 65,000-odd dwelling units still had massive structural violations. Under the 2019 policy, in case a violation is not removed, at own cost, the allotment may be cancelled and possession resumed. A certificate of structural stability of the building is also to be submitted. In an order issued in April 2021, the CHB deferred the action till December, stating that the allottees who do not deposit penal charges on the basis of self-certified area will be issued notices of demolition or cancellation thereafter.CHB allottees complain that the policy didn’t resolve their problems, and as per the Delhi Model, the covered area should be relaxed.Explaining the model, Nirmal Datt, chairman, CHB residents’ welfare federation, said: “At present, the board tolerates all types of so-called violations by charging an annual penalty. For a complete relief, it can easily take one-time charges for any excess coverage inside or outside the plot area without regularising this excess coverage and denying people any legal right over it. Supporting documents, such as the structural stability certificate, can be made mandatory.” Board to slash reserve price of leasehold properties After getting poor response to the auction of leasehold properties, the Chandigarh Housing Board has decided to cut the reserve prices. The reserve price of commercial units on leasehold property will be cut by 20% and residential units by 10% in the next e-auction of these propertiesThis was decided in the CHB board of directors meeting held on Wednesday. The CHB, in the past four months, has conducted four e-auctions for its 121 freehold residential properties and has been able to sell 87, earning ₹70.59 crore. In the same period, it has been able to sell only two residential and nine commercial leasehold properties, earning ₹1.74 crore and ₹4.73 crore, respectively. “In leasehold properties, the allottee is required to pay a yearly ground rent at the rate of 2.5% of the consideration amount for 33 years, followed by 3.75% for next 33 years and 5% for the subsequent 33 years. Since this is a substantial amount and ownership rights are inferior than in the case of freehold, people prefer to go for the latter properties,” said a CHB official. Also, conversion of leasehold property to freehold is a costly affair. “The conversion charges for residential properties may range from 12% to 15% of the consideration amount. However, the conversion is not permitted in the case of commercial properties,” said the official. IT Park scheme: In-principle nod to ₹643-crore costThe general housing scheme at IT Park will cost the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) ₹643.64 crore.In a meeting of the CHB board of directors, chaired by UT adviser Dharam Pal, the engineering cost estimate of ₹643.64 crore for the project was approved in principle.“Tentative cost of the flats will be worked out after approval of the plan approval committees (upper) for detailed drawings and a separate detailed agenda to be brought before the board, prior to launch of the scheme. Thereafter, a brochure of the scheme will be drafted as per the existing rules/regulations,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB.The general housing scheme, planned at IT park, is spread over 16.6 acre and has 728 dwelling units under different categories: a four-bedroom flat is likely to cost nearly ₹2.75 crore, a three-bedroom flat ₹1.9 crore and a two-bedroom flat ₹1.3 crore. Only after the board approves the cost estimates for the project, the CHB will finalise the rates.Revisit plan for Sector-61 market: UT adviserThe UT adviser, in the meeting, stated that the market in Sector 61 (Kajheri), where all the commercial units are lying vacant, needed to be assessed by some experts for exploring different options.“Since the whole market has been lying unsold for more than 20 years, we need to revisit the whole plan and there may be many options like converting it into a single plot or redeveloping it as an office complex, etc,” said Pal.In other decisions, the CHB will fill 40 vacant posts of clerks through direct recruitment in a fair and transparent manner. The existing ceiling of medical reimbursement to the retired employees of the board will be enhanced from ₹50,000 to ₹1,00,000 per annum. The employee quarters will be renovated on the lines of improvement specifications of the houses of the Chandigarh administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-chb-panel-to-study-options-for-need-based-changes-101631129502830.html

In phase two, the institute will bring 3,000 hectare land under the aromatic crop pan-India, especially in the north-east.Aromatic crops are widely cultivated around the world due to their high-revenue earning essential oil, which is utilised in agrochemical, food, flavouring, perfumery and pharmaceutical industry.Global essential oils market size is valued at USD 10.3 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach a value of USD 16 billion by 2026, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 9.3% during the forecast period.Rakesh Kumar, senior principal scientist-cum-co-nodal officer of Aroma Mission said there is a growing inclination of consumers towards natural and organic products which led to an increased usage of essential oils in cosmetics, food, and beverages.“Kalimpong is suitable for cultivation of high value aromatic crops such as damask rose, mushkbala, mint, wild marigold, scented geranium, lemongrass and chamomile,” he said.The institute will help farmers by providing quality planting material, capacity building, and value addition through processing of aromatic plants and establish market linkages.Subash Mani, chairman of Mani Trust, said the pact will allow them to work with IHBT in cultivating aromatic and floriculture crops in Kalimpong region and maximise benefits to regional farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ihbt-inks-pact-with-kalimpong-trust-for-cultivation-of-aromatic-crop-101631129382798.html

The union has now decided to raise the agitation to the next level and close bus stands across the state on Thursday,” said said Shamsher Singh, district president of the Punjab Roadways and PRTC Contractual Employees Union.Earlier in the day, the staff took out a protest rally on two-wheelers, moving through different parts of the city, including Model Town, Gill Road, Jagraon Bridge and Bharat Nagar Chowk while raising slogans against the state government for not fulfilling its promise made before the 2017 Assembly Elections. Movement of traffic was disturbed at several points as the protesters took to the streets. “The Contractual Employees Union of Haryana Roadways has also extended its support to our union that is protesting at the state level. The protest march was organised to apprise the public of the wrong policies of the government. We will continue the agitation till our genuine demand is fulfilled,” said Singh.Passengers continue to suffer With the strike entering the third day on Wednesday, passengers continued to have a hard time finding a bus to their destination. According to the bus stand authorities, movement of around 200 government-run buses has been hit due to the strike and passengers have to depend on private operators.

They cannot start interfering in the administration or the working of the executive.“It is the administrative heads who are the best judges to decide how the department has to be administered and which employee should be transferred to which place. The politicians cannot don the role of administration.”“The elected representatives cannot have a right to claim that a particular employee should be posted at a particular station. The choice has to be made by executive and not by the legislators,” the court said.The court said whenever transfer order is on recommendation of minister or MLA, views of the administrative department are essentially to be sought in matters of transfer.“What follows is that views of the administrative department should reflect subjective satisfaction and conscious application of mind that the transfer is essential on account of administrative exigency and/or public interest or effective utilisation of his/her services,” said the court.Adverting to the present case, the order of transfer cannot withstand judicial scrutiny as the same does not show that the petitioner has been transferred on account of administrative exigency, public interest or efficient utilisation of the services of the petitioner, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/legislators-cannot-act-as-administrators-himachal-hc-junks-transfer-orders-101631129142519.html

After six months, the user will have to pay both penalty and interest on the pending amount, and the connection will also be disconnected.The property owners with houses with area up to 125 square yards are exempted from water-sewerage charges, but they still have to get the connection regularised. Yet, the city has around 1 lakh illegal connections. According to MC officials, as part of the ward-level camps, pamphlets will be distributed among residents to utilise the opportunity to get their connections regularised and clear the dues without penalty and interest.Under the policy, the illegal connections can be regularised at less than 10% of the regular fee/penalty charged for the process.In Ludhiana, dues owed by legal water connection holders have piled up to ₹200 crore over the past few decades. In many cases, the interest imposed is much higher than the principal amount.Senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra said the decision to distribute pamphlets and organise ward-level camps was taken during a meeting held under the chairmanship of mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu on Tuesday evening. “It is a golden opportunity for the public to get the illegal connections regularised at nominal rates and pay the dues without any penalty,” said Malhotra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/water-bills-ludhiana-mc-turns-to-awareness-camps-to-encourage-clearance-of-dues-101631128842453.html

This initiative, hopefully, will not only strengthen the bond between schools and society but also help connect society with government-run primary and upper-primary schools’ education system,” he added.In the missive marked ‘Top Priority’ and instructing officials to ensure “time-bound” compliance, the headmasters and BEOs have been asked to ensure that alumni councils in each school are formed by September 10 and the names of those passed out students who have bagged top positions or made significant contributions to society along with their posts/achievements too are displayed on the school walls.

The HC clearly stated that the government’s guidelines against public celebrations should not be contravened. The directions were issued by Justice Cheekati Manavendranath Roy after a write petition was filed by a resident of Autonagar in Andhra Pradesh’s Tirupati city. He had sought permission to install an idol in his house with five people from the district Superintendent of Police. Since it was not given, he approached the HC. The petitioner told the court that restrictions on celebrating Ganesh or Vinayaka Chaturhti were only for public places. After seeking a response from the state government as well, Justice Roy allowed him to install an idol at his residence, and said that Covid guidelines must be adhered to. The issue of celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi in AP this year has taken a communal turn, with both the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Telugu Desam PArty (TDP) demanding the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) to allow it.TDP national spokesperson Pattabi Ram on Tuesday said that party MLAs and in-charges of all 175 assembly constituencies have been instructed to organise or celebrate the Ganesh Chaturthi festival in a “huge way” while following Covid-19 protocols. “We feel that it is a part of a larger conspiracy by Jagan Reddy to attack one religion,” he alleged.The AP government decided that Ganesh idols cannot be installed in public places and that immersions this year, along with processions, should be avoided. Prior to this, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on August 28 issued guidelines to chief secretaries of all states and union territories, informing them that Covid-19 guidelines have been extended till September 30.AP chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy held a review meeting on September 2, wherein it was decided to continue the night curfew in AP from 11pm to 6am, keeping in mind the festival season. Based on suggestions from health department officials, it was decided to limit Ganesh (or Vinayaka) Chaturthi celebrations within homes, instead of holding them in public places.However, a day earlier on September 7, the TDP announced that it would celebrate the festival in all 175 assembly seats and would defy government orders. Prior to that, the BJP also held a protest on September 6 demanding the same thing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/andhra-pradesh-high-court-allows-petitioner-to-install-ganesh-idol-at-home-101631128362852.html

Among 1,71, 295 samples that were tested, 30,196 turned positive taking the test positivity rate (TPR) to 17.63%. The spike happened a couple of days after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said cases were on decline and the situation will stabilise by the second week of September. The state government had lifted night curfew and Sunday lockdown on Tuesday after cases dipped. The weekend lockdown was in force for more than three months. A look at the statistics show a sharp increase in tests as the main reason behind the present tally. Total fatalities also crossed 22,000 with 181 deaths on Wednesday and active cases stood at 238,480. Last week average cases were around 22,000 and TPR was below 15%. “It is natural that cases will go up once tests are increased. The state should have increased the tests a couple of months back,” said public health expert Dr SS Lal. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the state is still conducting more antigen tests. “More than half of the total tests are still antigen,” said party leader S Suresh. When asked about this, a senior health ministry official refused to comment. Three districts reported more than 3,000 cases - Thrissur 3,832, Ernakulam 3,611 and Kozhikode 3,058. Two districts reported less than 1000 - Wayanad 894 and Kasaragod 510 cases. In one of the worst affected districts, Malappuram, cases came down to 2,580 but in Thiruvananthapuram district cases went up to 2,900, according to data. In last 24 hours, the country reported 35,875 new cases with TPR below 2%. It also reported 369 deaths. Going by the present statistics, the state’s share of Covid cases is more than 70%.A day after Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced the phased reopening of higher educational institutions from October 4, health minister Veena George on Wednesday said that vaccination facilities would be available for final year students to get inoculated before they enter their respective colleges.The health minister, in a press release, said that all final year students should take at least one dose of the COVID vaccine before entering college.Meanwhile, Kerala Minister for Higher Education and Social Justice R Bindu, while speaking to reporters here, said that similar to last year, classes would be held either in two shifts or on alternate days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-a-week-long-gap-kerala-logs-30k-plus-covid-cases-again-101631128186588.html

Incessant rain and the resulting floods have not only created favourable conditions for a huge produce of the aroma-rich Kala Namak rice, but also saved the farmers money, which would have otherwise been spent on regular irrigation, experts said.They shared data of a record 50,000 hectare land being cultivated this year with Kala Namak in 11 districts of East UP, an unprecedented increase of 1,000 acres in Kala Namak cultivation, after decades.Anil Tiwari, Heritage Foundation Trustee, said, “The major increase in cultivated area of Kala Namak can be attributed to the government’s initiative to encourage farmers to produce this variety, under several state and central schemes including, ODOP (one district one product), FPO (Farmer Producer Organization) and CFC (Common Facility Centres).“This year, the farmers are expecting a bumper harvest, despite floods. The incessant rain and flood have provided favourable conditions and crop production is likely to see a never-before boost. The best thing is that the paddy crop, if not completely inundated (part containing grain remains out of water), can survive and grow in water-logged fields. The crop sown in June-July will be ready for harvest by October-end or first week of November.”He said that 10,000 hectares of land has been cultivated with Kala Namak crop in Siddharthnagar, followed by Gorakhpur (9,000), Maharajganj (8,000) Basti (3,000), Bahraich (3,000), Deoria (3,000) and Shravasti (1,000), among other districts.Elated by the good yield in his five acre farm, progressive farmer Chandrika Prasad of Siddharthnagar, said, “Since the last few years, I have not seen such a good crop. And this comes to us at zero cost of irrigation.”Dr Ram Chet Chaudhary, agriculture scientist who is connected with the Participatory Rural Development Foundation, said, “In 1960, the total cultivation of Kala Namak stood at 50,000 hectares, which reduced to just 2,000 hectares in 2000. After getting a GI tag in 2010-11 and introduction of its variety KN-3, its cultivation went up to 10,000 hectares, and shot up further to 20,000 in 2016. After the formation of the Yogi Government, its cultivation reached a record high again at 50,000 hectares.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-floods-kala-namak-bumper-harvest-makes-east-up-farmers-smile-101631128183842.html

Called, ‘Medicine From The Sky’, the latest initiative is a joint project through a consortium that has been formed by Telangana government with Indian drone delivery start-up firm Skye Air Mobility. The latter has joined hands with courier service BlueDart Express to provide drone-based delivery and drone flights to conduct these trials. With this new project, Telangana will become the first state to start trials of ‘Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS)’ drone flights for the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, said a government statement on Wednesday. Skye Air Mobility focuses on an end-to-end ecosystem for drone-based logistic transportation.“While the nation is focusing on achieving 100% vaccination, the current situation calls for a deeper supply of vaccines, especially in the remote areas. Delivery of vaccination through drones would be a stepping stone to achieve this goal,” said Balfour Manuel, managing director, BlueDart, according to the release. The project will have two certified remote pilots who have been specifically trained for the BVLOS trials during the project. The project’s first two days of the trials will involve drones flying between 500 to 700 metres from the base, wherein they can be seen with the naked eye.From September 11 onwards, the BVLOS drone flights will take place for about 9 to 10 kilometres of distances. These flights will be with consignments of vaccine, medical samples and other healthcare items, the release stated.Swapnik Jakkampundi, co-founder, Skye Air Mobility, said, “The key elements that were deterrents in the sector for a long period are now in favour of this development. This move is in sync with our endeavours at transformational change in rural and remote areas by helping make instant access to vital medical supplies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/telangana-to-start-vaccine-supply-by-drone-on-a-trial-basis-101631128182613.html

This is the second consecutive year that Tamil Nadu has banned celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi in public due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Previously the AIADMK regime had banned it last year which its ally the BJP had disapproved of. The row over cancellation of public installation of idols and procession for Ganesh Chaturthi spilled over to the assembly on Tuesday with chief minister MK Stalin not entertaining BJP’s demand to reverse the decision but he announced a cash aid to idol makers of Ganesha. Acknowledging that potters who make Ganesha idols would lose their business this year too, Stalin announced ₹5,000 as a relief to 3,000 potters who specialise in making the idols during the festival season. On Tuesday BJP’s floor leader Nainar Nagendran insisted that celebrations be allowed like it has been in Maharashtra and Puducherry but Stalin cited the pandemic for restricting it. “The Union Government sent a circular asking all state governments to take steps to ensure that people don’t crowd at public places till September 30, 2021,” Stalin said. “The courts have also stressed the same point. Kerala relaxed rules for Onam and Bakrid and that led to a spike in fresh cases. Cases are being reported at isolated places every day. Considering the public safety and welfare in mind, a ban on all religious festivals was imposed till September 15. It will also apply to Vinayaka Chathurthi.” Stalin added that people can continue to celebrate it at home. On Monday, BJP state president K Annamalai criticised the DMK government as interfering in an individual’s rights and announced that BJP cadres will keep one-lakh Ganesha idols in front of their homes and urged the public to do that too.

09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala: Residents protest against garbage collection site in Jandali||Several residents of Jandali and nearby areas have been protesting against a garbage collection and segregation point on a major road adjoining Sector 9 of Ambala City for the last five days, demanding a solution.There are complaints of foul smell emanating throughout the day from the area that also has a cremation ground and a religious place.A shopkeeper here, Amrit Shergil, said that it was almost impossible to cross the road, which is a shortcut for many to travel between HUDA sectors and Jandali.“Garbage from all 20 wards is collected here before it is taken to a plant on Naraingarh road. The residents had protested in March this year too, but we stopped after an assurance of a solution. Nothing happened, however, and we were forced to protest again,” he said. The protesters are demanding collection of waste only from their area instead of all wards or shifting of the centre to some other location. They had also locked the gate of the land, due to which the process was affected. Advocate Puneet, a Congress leader who is among those leading the protest, said, “Several vehicles and a JCB machine dominate the road leading to traffic congestion and more waste on the road during shifting of garbage.”In the meantime, the matter also reached the municipal officials, who held talks with the residents twice. Sources said that MC commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata also chaired a meeting to review the process and a decision will be taken soon.“The agitation might be lifted in a day or two, as they might be booked for locking MC land and hampering the collection process. The matter has become political with the involvement of many parties and change in demands,” officials said.Meanwhile, sanitary inspector (city zone) Mandeep said it was difficult to meet with the residents’ demands that included overall closure of the land, but Khadgata said, “We are planning to initiate ward-wise or cluster-wise collection and segregation, and later shifting to the plant in Patvi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/residents-protest-against-garbage-collection-site-in-ambala-s-jandali-101631127703209.html
09-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC reopens Ghatkopar to Mankhurd flyover for traffic in Mumbai, bikers banned||One week after partially shutting the 2.9-km-long Ghatkopar-Mankhurd flyover for repair works owing to frequent accidents, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday reopened the flyover for four-wheelers and light commercial vehicles. However, the flyover will remain shut for two-wheelers and heavy vehicles. BMC had, on September 1, partially shut the lane towards Mankhurd for maintenance work after an uproar among motorists over several accidents. Yusuf Khan, 34, was injured severely on Monday after his bike slipped, and he died before being admitted to hospital. After this accident, BMC shut one lane of the flyover saying that it would make the surface rough and install at least 10 speed breakers to ensure vehicles follow the speed limit and that there are no accidents. The civic body also announced that they would install CCTV cameras and rumbler strips. Satish Thosar, chief engineer of BMC’s bridges department, said, “We opened the lane towards Mankhurd and the lane towards Ghatkopar also was reopened on Wednesday.”He added, “We have installed around five speed breakers each on one side to ensure vehicles follow speed limit. Along with this, we have also made the surface rough on both sides.”Kishore Shinde, senior inspector of Mankhurd traffic police, said, “We have kept the flyover shut for two-wheelers as a precautionary measure for a period of one month. The flyover will remain shut for heavy vehicles too as a high-tension wire above the flyover is yet to be removed. Currently, movement of light vehicles and light commercial vehicles is allowed.”The flyover was inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on August 1, three years after its deadline. Thackeray had, on the day of the inauguration, asked BMC officials to work on the surface of the flyover. The 2.9-km flyover was constructed at a cost of ₹713 crore. Following this, on August 4, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wrote a letter to mayor Kishori Pednekar and municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal pointing at the poor quality of construction work by the contractor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-reopens-ghatkopar-to-mankhurd-flyover-for-traffic-in-mumbai-bikers-banned-101631127463339.html
09-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC signs deal with Cambridge Board, aims to start school in Mumbai by June next year||After affiliating with ICSE and CBSE boards, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Cambridge Board to start schools with the board’s curriculum in the city. Mumbai guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray said the civic body will hold meetings with the board and look at starting at least one school by June next year.BMC aims to have one school affiliated with the Cambridge Board in each of the 24 administrative wards in the city, Thackeray said. Mumbai currently has 12 schools with CBSE and ICSE board curriculum. The civic body is expected to hold discussions with the board on how to set up a school in the next two months, outlining the course and other details, BMC officials said.Thackeray, while speaking at the event at Sahyadri guesthouse, said as Cambridge Board is a renowned and quality medium of education, it would provide a great educational opportunity for students of Mumbai. He added that the state government would also look into providing such curriculum for students elsewhere in Maharashtra. “Every Mumbaiite can come to Mumbai public school without worrying about how much fees they can pay. We have ICSE and CBSE board, and today we have joined hands with Cambridge Board. In the next two months, we will hold meetings with them and work out how many schools we will be able to start [in Mumbai], even if it is one to begin with. Efforts will be on starting one such school in each ward of Mumbai so that students can take advantage of international standard of education,” he said.Thackeray held a meeting with BMC officials and board representatives including Mahesh Srivastava, regional director, South Asia for Cambridge Assessment International Education, and Ajay Pratap Singh, head of Cambridge University Press India Ltd on starting a school by the next academic year. Following the meeting, he said, “We hope to initiate the academic year 2022 with the Cambridge chapter of Mumbai public school that will pave the way to make international education accessible to students, free of cost, regardless of their economic background, thus promoting a strong culture of teaching and learning.”He further added that due to the quality education in these schools, more than 10,000 applications were received for 4,000 seats in the current academic year. He also said that in addition to the curriculum in its schools, BMC is focusing on upgrading school buildings and other infrastructure.Principals, parents welcome moveThe decision to introduce Cambridge Board for Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) school students has been accepted as a positive move by principals as they feel that bright students who are not financially stable can afford quality education through this move. Parents said while it is a good initiative, BMC needs to focus on the current infrastructure and quality of education.A principal of a popular SSC board school in the city on condition of anonymity said, “SSC board syllabus and Cambridge Board syllabus have vast differences. The teaching method itself is such that the student becomes independent and creative. Making such a syllabus available to students from all sections of the society is a boon. However, it is also important to have teachers who are capable of handling such a syllabus. Many aided SSC board schools that have converted to other boards have the same teachers with the old teaching pattern which does not serve the purpose.” Avnita Bir, director principal of Podar Education Network, said, “With the new education policy in place, people have become eager to try new things. This is the right time to take a step further. While every board is trying various means to adopt new practices, such a decision by BMC will be a boon for students. Bright students will get an opportunity to open their minds and focus on learning creatively, independently will be adopted. The focus for the administration will be on how to include the various boards along with the existing schools.”“The condition of SSC schools is pathetic. BMC should focus on maintaining quality education and improving the infrastructure. They should focus on existing schools or invest money in providing means to gain digital education for existing students in the current scenario. Introducing Cambridge Board is a good initiative, but it will take years to come on track and will include a lot of planning as well. Without a detailed plan, the students will suffer,” said Anubha Sahai, president of India wide Parents Association.(Inputs from Ankita G Menon)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-signs-deal-with-cambridge-board-aims-to-start-school-in-mumbai-by-june-next-year-101631127342499.html
09-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s natural carbon sinks inadequate to offset greenhouse emissions||The city’s mangroves, wetlands and urban greenery outside of protected areas forest are estimated to have a combined carbon sequestration potential of about 64,000 metric tonnes (MT) per year, according to data revealed during the fifth round of public consultations for the civic body’s upcoming climate action plan (CAP) for Mumbai. The public consultation, which dealt with the topic of urban greening & biodiversity, was hosted by the World Resources Institute (India).This is, however, only a fraction of the city’s annual carbon footprint. The annual carbon footprint for 2019 was estimated to be 34.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2Eq) emissions, as per a greenhouse gas inventory prepared by WRI (India) last month. HT had, on August 27, reported that a staggering 71% of the city’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be attributed to the energy sector, followed by the transport sector which contributes 24% of Mumbai’s total GHG emissions.“Even if you take into account the added carbon sequestration potential of the Arabian Sea, Thane Creek and protected areas such as Sanjay Gandhi National Park and Aarey, the city is still ill-equipped to offset the majority of its emissions. One hopes that the upcoming climate action plan will be able to address this to a degree; but so far there has been no indication as to what the reduction targets will be and how they will achieve this insurmountable task,” said Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti, and one of the invitees who spoke at Wednesday’s public consultation.A presentation shared by WRI (India) during Wednesday’s webinar revealed that the Mumbai’s mangroves and wetlands sequester about 42,139MT carbon annually, followed by urban greenery across the city’s 24 wards, which is estimated to sequester about 22,490MT carbon annually. “These are just estimates. The actual sequestration potential is likely to differ. To calculate the offset potential for urban greenery, we have used remote sensing data as we did not have the civic body’s tree census numbers available to us,” said Lubaina Rangwala, associate director, WRI (India) Ross Center for Sustainable Cities.Of the 24 broad localities in the city that were analysed as part of WRI (India)’s assessment, Borivli was found to have the highest carbon sequestration potential by virtue of being the most densely green area with over 2,000 acres of land covered by trees — each acre is estimated to capture about 1.35MT carbon per year. This is followed by Goregaon and Chembur, which have 1,500 to 2,000 acres of land covered in trees. Southern localities including Byculla, Grant Road, Marine Lines, Colaba and Sandhurst Road fared most poorly on this index and were found to have the least tree cover in the city. Debi Goenka, executive trustee of the Conservation Action Trust and another invitee who spoke at the public consultation, however, criticised these numbers, saying, “The entire approach to the way these projections are being made is questionable because they are entirely theoretical and not rooted in any real ground truthing exercise. They have not been correlated with any verifiable information. For example, why has the civic body’s tree census not been shared with WRI for conducting the urban greenery assessment? A remote sensing exercise can be done with just a laptop, internet and working knowledge of GIS software. Where is the real world application in all this?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-natural-carbon-sinks-inadequate-to-offset-greenhouse-emissions-101631127222430.html

We have also written to home minister Amit Shah to mark a CBI inquiry in this matter,” he said.“If the authorities fail to lodge an FIR against the chairman, we will move the Punjab and Haryana high court,” said Sidhu. Party’s district president Pushpinder Singal also announced to lock down the office of LIT in Feroze Gandhi market on Thursday.Will file defamation case: Congress Former district president of the Congress, Ashwani Sharma said the BJP had lost its ground due to the farmer agitation and was levelling baseless allegations against Congress leaders. “LIT chairman has already clarified that everything was done as per norms and the reserve price was fixed by the committee led by DC. There might have been some misunderstanding when DC denied fixing the rate. E-auction was held and four bidders participated in it. The minister is not at all involved in the matter. There is no chance of any fraud. BJP leaders should submit a draft if they have a buyer to purchase the said land for ₹350 crore and the government will allot the land to their name,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/row-over-sale-of-prime-land-bjp-cries-scam-seeks-fir-against-lit-chairman-101631127164018.html

The patient’s liver was in such bad shape that it was affecting his brain, lungs and kidney. The transplant took about 16 to 17 hours. After the transplant, both the patient and the donor, who was his son, are kept under observation.”Dr Ashish Mishra, consultant, liver transplant and HPB surgery at Apollomedics said that the patient’s brain was getting affected due to his liver failure, his kidney was deteriorating, and the lungs were also affected. He had jaundice and his condition was very serious. About 60 to 65% of the donor’s liver lobe was taken. The patient’s transplant lasted 16 to 17 hours while the donor’s surgery lasted 6 to 7 hours.Dr Mishra also said that due to increased alcohol consumption, bad eating habits, diabetes, and obesity, liver disorders are on a rise. Every year around 40 to 50 thousand people require liver transplant, but due to the unavailability of a healthy liver only 10% of them get an organ for transplant.Liver transplant is done by two techniques. The first technique is cadaver donor transplantation, in which organs are donated by a dying person. Second is living donor transplant where 60 to 65 percent of the liver of a relative of the patient is taken and transplanted by removing the old liver of the patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-hospital-conducts-successful-living-donor-liver-transplant-101631127102303.html

According to the proposal, the work will be carried out at Lady Jehangir Marg from St Joseph Circle near Wadala station to Ruia College; Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati Marg from Diamond Garden to Chembur railway station; Sant Gyaneshwar Mandir Road and RKP Road in Bandra (East); and MG Road at Goregaon.However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has questioned the proposal. Prabhakar Shinde, BJP corporator and group leader in BMC, said, “Why do we need to spend crores of rupees on beautification of footpaths? This does not make sense at all, especially when BMC has halted several road works citing fund crunch. We have opposed this proposal in the standing committee but it was still passed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-passes-rs69-crore-proposal-to-beautify-footpaths-in-mumbai-bjp-opposes-101631126983814.html

However, for the same duration between April 2017 and March 2020, the zoo earned a total of ₹14.23 crore. Meanwhile, BMC has spent a total of ₹11.46 crore for the upkeep of penguins till September this year.The zoo generates income from charging entry fees to visitors which is set at ₹25 for children, ₹50 for adults and ₹100 for a family of four. The earlier entry fee, before the arrival of the penguins, was ₹5. In addition, the zoo also facilitated a monthly pass of ₹150 per person for regular morning walkers. However, since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in March 2020, the zoo has been closed for visitors. The income generated from monthly passes has not been added to the gross income of the zoo mentioned above.For three years between April 2014 and March 2017, the zoo saw a total footfall of 3,880,948 people while that between April 2017 and March 2020 stood at 4,094,366.Earlier this week, the Congress had criticised BMC for floating tenders worth ₹15 crore for the upkeep of penguins over the next three years.A senior civic official said, “We floated tenders for ₹15 crore considering an escalation in cost. It is around the same amount of money required for upkeep of penguins since 2017. We only estimated an increase and floated bids for ₹15 crore.”In a statement on Wednesday, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “The total value of the tender for upkeep of penguins was ₹11.46 crore. It is amply clear that increase in the income of the zoo after arrival of penguins is more than the expenditure on maintenance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/byculla-zoo-saw-584-per-cent-rise-in-income-after-arrival-of-penguins-in-mumbai-101631126502398.html

Identification of eligible households is in progress and new ration cards will be issued to all eligible households in due process. New Ration Card will be issued on a First In First Out basis,” said the government in a press statement. Under the National Foods Security Act, states are alloted periodic quotas for issuing new ration cards which is ascertained by the centres depending on Census reports -- that are issued in every 10 days, often leading to long list of applications in districts which witnessed mass migration from other states. “Ration cardholders who are unable to authenticate their biometrics to receive their monthly quota of free ration in Delhi can now nominate any other person to collect it on their behalf. Direction has been issued to ensure that no public distribution system beneficiary is deprived of ration due to biometric failures, especially since ration shops in Delhi have implemented the electronic point of sale system,” said the statement.In July, Delhi resumed the biometric-based electronic point of sales (e-PoS) system for distribution of ration. The Capital currently has 1.78 million ration card holder households which translates to around 7.2 million beneficiaries, who are delivered ration through a network of around 2,000 fair price shops under the public distribution system.The total population of the city is an estimated 20 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-food-minister-imran-hussain-chairs-review-meet-on-issuing-new-ration-cards-in-city-101631126382643.html

The AIMIM leaders believe that Shaista Parveen would prove to be a strong candidate from Allahabad (west) seat, which has been a stronghold of Atiq who is presently lodged at Ahmedabad Jail. AIMIM leaders feel Atiq Ahmad has considerable influence on Muslim voters not only in Prayagraj but even in Kanpur and many other seats in adjoining districts of Prayagraj. AIMIM district spokesperson Afsar Mehmood said, “Former MP Atiq Ahmad may contest from Kanpur cantonment seat while his wife Shaista Parveen may contest from Allahabad West constituency.” However, other party leaders said that some of Atiq’s family members may also contest from Fatehpur Sadar seat and Allahabad South constituency. Atiq has been looking for a political platform after his separation from Samajwadi Party some years back. Atiq is believed to have asked for tickets on five seats in the upcoming elections. However, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has taken him and his wife in the party with a promise of three seats, they claim. In a letter addressed to media persons written from jail, Atiq Ahmad said that he was influenced by AIMIM national president Asaduddin Owaisi’s dedication towards the country, his belief in the constitution and his continuous struggle for the rights of Muslims and dalits. “To support him in his mission, I am joining the party,” Atiq said in the letter. On Monday, AIMIM chief declared that Atiq Ahmad, his wife Shaista Parveen and some other kin have joined the party at a press meet in Lucknow. Atiq, his kin and close aides have been facing a massive crackdown since the BJP government came to power in the state. Besides other properties, Atiq’s ancestral home was razed by administration and many of his aides were arrested and sent to jail on different charges. Moreover, a reward of ₹2 lakh was declared on his son Umar who is still at large while dozens of houses of his aides were brought down in the series of crackdown. Atiq’s younger brother Khalid Azeem was also arrested around a year ago and is presently lodged at Bareilly Jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exmp-atiq-wife-s-entry-in-aimim-creates-new-political-equations-in-prayagraj-101631126142326.html
09-09-2021||Delhi||Supreme Court seeks status report from ED, Delhi Police in probe against Unitech||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Enforcement Directorate and Delhi Police to submit a status report by the end of this month on their probe into the alleged irregularities by realty firm Unitech Limited, and the recoveries made so far that could help the construction of the pending projects affecting 15,000 homebuyers.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah said: “Prior to the hearing fixed on September 30, the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) shall file a status report indicating the progress of investigation. A report shall also be filed by the investigating officer of the Delhi Police.”Last month, ED filed a status report in a sealed cover indicating that property worth ₹600 crore belonging to the former Unitech management and its directors Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra, who are currently in jail, was provisionally attached. It also found that an amount of ₹1,400 crore was laundered through various shell companies in undisclosed tax havens.A forensic audit ordered by the Supreme Court in 2018 revealed that the Chandra brothers siphoned off ₹1,749 crore to foreign countries including Cyprus, where an amount of ₹290 crore was traced. The auditor Samir Paranjpe working with Forensic and Investigation Service of M/s Grant Thornton India concluded that Chandra brothers collected more than ₹14,200 crore from nearly 30,000 homebuyers as investment in their 74 projects.Last year, the court approved a seven-member board of management to take over Unitech Limited and spearhead the construction of projects by assessing receivables and settling liabilities incurred by the former management.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) N Venkatraman, appearing for the new board, informed the court that two sub-committees will pursue dues payable to asset reconstruction companies (ARC) and banks on one hand, and the land-owning authorities of Haryana, Noida and Greater Noida on the other.Of the 15,000 flats to be constructed, Venkatraman said 8,008 units have been assigned to two ARCs – JM Financial and Suraksha.

09-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: ‘Fake doctor’ who fled custody held four years later||A 58-year-old man, who was arrested in 2014 over suspicion of practising as a doctor without an MBBS degree, was arrested once again from southwest Delhi’s Mohan Garden near Uttam Nagar for his alleged involvement in seven cases of cheating and forgery.Police said the suspect, Mohammad Shabir Khan, who was living in a rented house and ran a small clinic, was evading arrest since 2017 for allegedly trying to usurp shops belonging to an old woman in Khanpur and was also wanted in two prior cases as well.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said Khan claimed to be holding a degree in Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) from Delhi University. “We are verifying his claims,” she said.DCP Rangnani said that the district’s special staff team had received information that a proclaimed offender (PO) had been living in Mohan Garden area, following which he was caught from his rented home.During interrogation, he revealed that on November 30, 2014, Delhi Medical Council officials raided his clinic at Devli Khanpur, following which he was arrested for the first time and remained in jail for nearly a fortnight.After securing bail, the DCP said, he stopped attending court proceedings and was declared a PO.Later in 2015, he allegedly cheated a foreign national then living in south Delhi of USD 8,000 on the pretext of converting the foreign currency into Indian currency. As surety, he leased a house he had rented to the woman allegedly using forged documents and posing as its owner.“Khan was arrested in that case as well but jumped the bail and never joined the court proceedings,” said DCP Rangnani.In 2017, Khan was again booked for cheating and forgery after he allegedly tried to usurp the property of an elderly woman in Khanpur who had rented out her shop to him for running his clinic. Khan allegedly prepared forged documents of the shop and stopped paying the rent.“When the elderly woman filed a police complaint, Khan allegedly broke locks of two more shops of the woman and began claiming to be their owners. When the police started looking for him, Khan fled and was never arrested. There were four more cases that were filed against him on the directions of different courts,” added the DCP.Police said that Khan’s wife and two children live in a rented house in Lajpat Nagar while he changed his mobile number and began living in Mohan Garden to avoid his arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhifake-doctor-who-fled-custody-held-four-years-later-101631125903634.html
09-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai unlikely to get heavy rain next week, says IMD||The city received heavy showers early on Wednesday, recording 78.7mm of rainfall in the 24 hours ending at 8.30am. Most of the rainfall was recorded after 9pm on Tuesday, owing to the passage of a low-pressure zone originating from the Bay of Bengal over the Konkan coast. Heavy rains are unlikely to return to Mumbai for at least another week, with India Meteorological Department (IMD) having placed the city under a green category weather alert till September 12, indicating only moderate rain.Despite predictions of heavy rains during the day, Mumbai saw only light to moderate rains, recording only 1.8mm of rain at the IMD’s Santacruz observatory.“Rains which began late Tuesday were the result of easterly winds, the low-pressure area passing almost directly over northern Mumbai. As a result, the suburbs got more rain than south Mumbai. The low-pressure area travelled quite fast, and since it moved beyond the city toward Gujarat by morning, there was no waterlogging or very heavy downpour in the city,” said a meteorologist with the IMD’s regional centre in Mumbai.A popular independent weather forecaster, who goes by the name Weatherman of Mumbai on social media, said Mumbai had “a narrow miss” on Wednesday morning after initially speculating that the city may receive over 300mm of rain between September 7 and 8. Doppler radar images from Wednesday morning showed rain-bearing clouds dumping moisture a few kilometres off the coast, after being pushed seaward by easterly winds. Mumbai received few isolated showers again in the evening as westerly winds resumed.Meanwhile, Palghar and Thane have been placed under a yellow alert for Thursday, indicating chances of heavy rain at isolated locations. Ratnagiri and Raigad districts, however, are expected to see continuous rains till September 15, and have been placed under an orange alert on September 11 and 12, indicating widespread heavy rain with very heavy rain at isolated locations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-unlikely-to-get-heavy-rain-next-week-says-imd-101631125902396.html
09-09-2021||Delhi||Elevated taxiway at Delhi airport to be completed by December 2022||New Delhi: An elevated cross taxiway that will help cut taxiing time and save fuel at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport will be ready by December 2022, the airport operator said on Wednesday.Desribing it as India’s first ever elevated taxiway, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said 60% work on the facility has been completed. Once the new corridor is commissioned, the taxiing distance for aircrafts at Delhi airport will go down from the current 9km to 2km as the facility will allow planes to go straight towards Terminal 1 from the runway or vice-versa instead of going around runway 11/29.Currently, after landing at runway 29/11 or to take-off from there, an aircraft has to cover a distance of about 9km.DIAL officials said cutting taxiing time for aircraft will also help smoothen the movement of flights and reduce inconvenience to the passengers who had to remain seated inside the plans and wait at least 15 minutes to reach the terminal.Earlier, the project was to be completed by March 2022, however, due to the several interruptions, including the Covid-19 lockdowns last year, the deadline was pushed to December 2022. The new taxiway is part of the ₹9,000-crore phase 3 expansion of the Delhi airport, DIAL officials said.There are three runways at IGI airport. Runway 09/27, 10/28 and 11/29. Runway 09/27 and 10/28 are on northern side of Terminal 3, close to Terminal 1. Runway 11/29 is near Terminal 3 on southern side. The elevated taxiway will provide quick access to planes landing on Runway 11/29, especially those that land from Dwarka side, and have to go to Terminal 1.They said by reducing the travel time, the taxiway will also help airlines save 350kg of fuel for each journey and cut 55,000 tonnes of carbon-di-oxide emissions annually, officials said.The elevated taxiway will allow aircrafts to move between two runways on either side of the main access road to terminal 3, so as to enhance the airside capacity. DIAL officials said that at present, after landing at runway 29/11 or to take off from this runway of IGI airport, an aircraft has to cover a distance of approximately nine Kilometres.DIAL officials said often flights are delayed as they prefer using the terminal closer to where they are parked. But with the new taxiway, an aircraft at T3 will have to travel only two kilometres to take-off from the other runway. Not just this, using this taxiway, planes will now be able to vacate the runway sooner for the other flights to land, which would make the process smother and faster, they said.The officials said the new facility will be broad enough to accommodate a wide-body aircraft such as the A-380.As part of the IGI airport expansion plan, DIAL is carrying out integration of the departure and arrival terminals at T-1, construction of new apron (area where aircraft are parked, refueled and boarded) at T- 1, 2.1-kilometre-long elevated taxiway and modifications at T3. A fourth runway parallel to runway 11/29 on the south side, with a length of 4400 metres, will also be constructed to increase air traffic capacity, DIAL officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-taxiway-at-delhi-airport-to-help-cut-waiting-time-before-deboarding-save-airlines-fuel-101631125842420.html
09-09-2021||Delhi||Week after reopening, attendance picks up in Delhi schools||A week after schools across the national capital restarted in-person sessions for students from classes 9-12, school authorities said attendance has started picking up in private and government institutions even as many parents and teachers also said that lack of bus services deterred many from sending their children to schools.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said while her school had been conducting practical classes till last week, theory classes started this week saw a good turnout. “The attendance has definitely gone up since last week when we were only holding practical classes. There has been a steady increase in attendance and we expect the trend to continue,” said Joshi.She said that both teachers and students were enjoying physical classroom sessions, adding that it is, in turn, nudging more parents to send their children to schools.“We have been getting late-night calls from parents enquiring if they can send their children to school the next morning. They are gaining confidence seeing other children turn up for school,” said Joshi, adding that the number of children attending sessions rose from 30 on Monday to 45 on Wednesday.“Physical classes also allow us to assess how students are receiving the lessons... In an online class, students who are a little shy might not raise queries but in a physical class, I can see the body language and expressions of students and reach out to them if I feel that they are unable to understand something,” said Joshi. The institute does not have a school bus service currently, and parents are required to pick up and drop students. In some cases, senior students are also opting for public transport facilities. At Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 21, Rohini, principal Sukhbir Singh Yadav said that around 70% of students from classes 9-12 attended school until last week, adding that it rose to 81% this week. “We have stopped online sessions for classes 10 and 12 since around 80% of students have started coming to school,” said Yadav, adding that 333 students out of 421 students in class 11 attended school on Wednesday.Malini Narayanan, principal of Army Public School in Shankar Vihar and chairperson of National Progressive Schools’ Conference, which has 122 schools under it, too said the attendance had steadily picked up over the week. “We started sessions for students in classes 10 and 12, and later added Class 11. Children are quite excited about coming to school due to which the attendance is increasing. Hopefully, we will also start regular classes for students in Class 9 soon,” said Narayanan.She said that the school had been receiving requests from parents to restart bus services, adding that it will be resumed from Thursday.“We wanted to help the parents out since they shared that it was difficult to pick up and drop children on a work day. The bus service will start tomorrow (Thursday) on select routes since the school is only partially open,” said Narayanan.At DPS Mathura Road, principal Deeksha Khera said classes are continuing in the online mode as well. “In Class 12, we are seeing full attendance for the physical practical sessions. As far as other classes are concerned, we are hoping that the attendance will gradually increase in the coming days,” said Khera. A few schools said that they were expecting the attendance to increase after ongoing exams.Divya Bhatia, principal of Amity International School, Saket, said, “We also have our first term exams right now. We expect that more children will start coming to school for offline classes after that.”Meanwhile, parents’ associations said that the lack of school bus service prevented many students from attending physical classes. Aprajita Gautam, president of the Delhi Parents’ Association, said that picking and dropping children was not convenient for parents, especially for those who lived far off from the school. “Even though 20-30% students are going for physical classes in private schools, those who want to send their children are unable to do so in the absence of bus service,” said Gautam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/week-after-reopening-attendance-picks-up-in-delhi-schools-101631125244286.html

09-09-2021||Pune||PMC accused of inaction on conservation of Bavdhan spring||PUNE Even as various agencies have directed the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to conserve the natural springs in Bavdhan, the civic body has not acted, allege local residents and environmentalists.The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) had in December 2020 directed the PMC to not allow any construction in the vicinity of the spring. Ramnath Sonawane, secretary, MWRRA said, “Following the Section 20 of Groundwater Act (2009), and after a visit to the site, we requested the district SDO to declare the Bavdhan natural spring as a protective stream. This visit was done upon the complaint from Shailendra Patel, and we called the PMC officials for a meeting in December 2020. The authority has taken cognizance and issued directives six months ago to PMC. The authority will look into the matter if PMC does not take adequate steps and will intervene if required.”Anirudha Pawaskar, head, Water department PMC. “The tehsildar has already put out the notification and declared the area as protected area. We have informed the building department to not give any permissions for any kind of development and following the notification, we are deliberating on retaining the spring as it, or putting the water to use depending on its potability as a tanker point, or using it for gardens.”Hindustan Times had highlighted the issue of the natural springs in 2018. In its notification dated December 17, 2020, MWRRA asked for a committee of five members to prepare an action plan within 15 days on ways to conserve the spring. According to Bavdhan resident and member of Jal-Devata Seva Abhiyan, Shailendra Patel, citizens were trying to persuade the municipal officials to preserve this “heritage site”. “If the PMC does not reserve the area around spring in the development plan and conserve it, we will go to NGT,” said Patel, who was joined by Sunil Joshi (Samagra Nadi Parivar), Virendra Chitrav (Ramnadi restoration mission), Sachin Punekar (BioSpehere), Pushar Kulkarni (Vasundhara Abhiyan) and others during a press conference on Wednesday. The activists said that despite repeated follow up with PMC, there has been no response. “In absence of any action, we plan to move to NGT,” said the members. For the past five years, Patel corresponded with several authorities, officials, ecologists, geologists, historians to help protect the natural spring from destruction. Patel claimed that from its origin in Bhukum till Someshwarwadi, there are 147 ‘live’ streams feeding water to the Ramnadi throughout the year. Earlier, in a letter written to PMC Commissioner Vikram Kumar on July 6, 2021, GSDA deputy director Milind Deshpande said, “The Bavdhan spring needs to be conserved as per sections 21-24 of Maharashtra Groundwater (development and Management) Act.” Deshpande’s letter was in response to submissions made by Patel. The PMC development plan showed this area under a Yellow Zone or residential zone and as privately owned. According to a paper released by the Deccan College Post graduate and Research Institute, “This is a spring formed between two hard rock flows of upper vesicular (porous) and lower compact Basalt (non-porous). Occurrence of water-yielding contact spring in Deccan traps is a rare phenomenon. This is an endangered natural feature in Pune city. The spring currently yields water enough to run a 5hp motor continuously. This can be an important drinking water source for the community and reduce the burden on the corporation. Bavdhan spring must be protected and conserved. Water can be stored in a storage tank and supplied for drinking.” In a report from the Central Groundwater Board, official Dr Upendra Dhonde said, “The yield of Bavdhan spring monitored during May 2017 was 90 lpm i.e. more than 0.1 million litres per day, but shows a declining trend due to land use change and excessive pumping. The region needs urgent protection.” The Ecological Society, a Pune-based ecological restoration NGO created a detailed inventory of the flora and fauna of the spring region as well as a restoration plan Under the Groundwater Act (2009), MWRRA is the Groundwater Authority of Maharashtra, and visited the site in December 2018, and immediately directed the sub-divisional officer (Revenue) as the district authority under the Groundwater Act 2009, to notify the spring as a public drinking water source.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-accused-of-inaction-on-conservation-of-bavdhan-spring-101631124944225.html
09-09-2021||Pune||Pune Metro work at Sambhaji bridge on hold as mandals demand increase in viaduct height||PUNE After Ganesh mandals raised an objection to the height of a viaduct which is part of the Pune Metro work on Sambhaji bridge, originally known as Lakdi Pul, the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation (Maha-Metro) has decided to hold work temporarily. This can further delay the Metro work. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol has also instructed Maha- Metro to hold discussions with Ganesh mandals to find a solution. Maha-Metro, which is executing the Pune Metro project, started work to install a 50m long steel girder across Sambhaji bridge on Monday night. However, Ganesh mandal workers gathered at the spot to oppose work, stating that the height of the girder citing will obstruct the Ganesh immersion procession.The girder is 20m in height and is the longest on the Vanaz-Civil court metro Stretch. Mandal workers want to increase the height of the girder from 20 feet to 28 feet. The Ganesh procession uses this route for immersions, a tradition in the city for decades. “I have given instruction to Maha-Metro to stop work. We will call a meeting of mandal workers to resolve the issue,” said Mohol. Maha-Metro has already invoked traffic diversions due to closure of Lakdi Pul for the past two weeks - from August 24 to September 12. Atul Gadgil, director of Maha-Metro said, “We have got letters from mandals based in the peth areas to keep the height of the girder at 28 feet. They have given a letter to us on September 3, 2021. As per guidelines, we have kept the height at 20 feet. We are examining what could be the alternative. At present, we have stopped the work.” “We have decided to measure the height of idols along with the chariot. We have examined and measured the height of idols of two mandals -Tulshibaug and Ganpati chowk Mitra Manadal so far. The Ganesh idol height is 16 feet, but along with other decorations and chariot it goes to 24 feet. We will take a decision after completing the process to redesign or find some other alternative.” Maha-Metro has announced that it will start passenger service by December on both corridors - Vanaz to Ramwadi and PCMC to Swargate. Hemant Sonawane, general manager of Maha-Metro said, “We have started preliminary work on Sambhaji bridge. We have already conducted two meetings with office bearers of Ganesh mandals.” The Vanaz to Garware college metro stretch is six-km long and it is a priority stretch on the Vanaz-Ramwadi metro corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/metro-work-at-sambhaji-bridge-on-hold-as-mandals-demand-increase-in-viaduct-height-101631124886729.html
09-09-2021||Pune||Restore Shaniwarwada to its past glory: Patil’s request to Amit Shah||PUNE: City-based Thorle Bajirao Pratishthan has requested the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and union home minister Amit Shah through BJP MLA Chandrakant Patil to restore the crumbling Shaniwarwada back to its past glory and revive interest in the rich history and legacy of the Peshwas.Pratishthan president Air Marshal (retired) Bhushan Gokhale; secretary Kundan Sathe; trustee Srikant Nagarkar; and BJP spokesperson Sandeep Khardekar met Patil to draw his attention to the need for restoration of this historic monument, citing the Peshwas’ timeless historic and cultural contributions to the nation.Patil in a separate letter to Shah sought immediate refurbishment of the monument. “Shrimant Bajirao Peshwa laid the foundation and constructed this monument in 1731 from where he ruled the entire country and region for the next 85 years. The British, in 1818, with the sinister intention of tarnishing the image of the monument, converted the historic site into a vegetable market and mental asylum. In 1828, the monument caught fire and sustained the onslaught for the next seven days because of which it was damaged to a great extent. At one point of time, there were 1,000 fountains inside with water tanks, the remnants of which are visible till today. With the passage of time, the historic remnants of Shaniwarwada such as its 300-year-old doors, walls and wall paintings depicting Maratha art, are getting worn out. If proper attention is not given, the rich history of the Maratha kingdom will disappear into oblivion. The house of Bajirao Peshwa was the centre of governance and rule at that time and this precious heritage has to be conserved and protected at all costs,” Patil wrote in his letter to the union home minister.On the occasion of the 288th anniversary of Shaniwarwada on January 22, 2020, the descendants of the Peshwas visited the monument like every year and issues regarding maintenance cropped up during the celebrations, much to the embarrassment of the civic authorities. Today, a rickety edifice complete with worn-out iron-and-wood décor and water seepages greets tourists who land at the Shaniwarwada . It comes as no surprise that historians and conservationists have been demanding its immediate restoration for the longest time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/restore-shaniwarwada-to-its-past-glory-patil-s-request-to-amit-shah-101631124886177.html
09-09-2021||Delhi||Centre sets up panel to assess environmental impacts of projects in Delhi||The Union environment ministry has constituted a State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority to evaluate projects in the city, a move that Delhi ministers said will make it easier to handle applications in the city.The authority was defunct for almost three years, till the September 6 gazette order.The authority will be headed by former Delhi Public Works Department engineer-in-chief Sarvagya Srivastava, who also served as the agency’s principal secretary for a brief duration. Reena Gupta, advisor to the Delhi government, will be a member of the panel, and the state’s special secretary (environment)has been named member secretary.Srivastava was with the Delhi PWD for 11 years and has been involved in the planning of crucial road infrastructure projects in the city.Each of the authority’s members will have three-year tenures.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said that the authority will be tasked with protecting the environment and added that the new committee will make it easier to handle applications.The ministry has also constituted a 13-member State Level Expert Appraisal Committee with experts from various fields. The committee will have a three-year tenure.In absence of the SEIAA and SECA, all Delhi related projects were referred to the Union ministry’s Expert Appraisal Committee for clearance.In 2020, the Delhi government had sent a proposal for reconstitution of SEIAA and SEAC along with names of experts to the central government, said Rai.Rai said, “Category ‘B’ projects requiring environmental clearance will not have to wait for the central government’s approval and approval will now be given in a fast-tracked manner by the Delhi government itself. As much as fast tracking will be a sought after solution, we will also make the system more robust and transparent. Environment protection is one of the prime responsibilities of the Delhi Government and we will not compromise upon it.”According to the Environment Protection Rules, all category ‘A’ projects (mega projects) are approved by an Expert Appraisal Committee of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. All category ‘B’ projects (large projects) are approved by the SEIAA.The authority, which will hold monthly meetings, can order regular inspection of project sites that have been given environment clearance to ensure that all norms are being followed. Citizens can also approach the authority to report violations or raise issues.Reena Gupta, Member, SEIAA said, “We are very happy that Delhi SEIAA has been reconstituted by the Central Government. Now approval and monitoring decisions can be taken at the State Level. We look forward to making the EIA process more robust and transparent as envisaged under the law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-sets-up-panel-to-assess-environmental-impacts-of-projects-in-delhi-101631124762896.html
09-09-2021||Delhi||Court takes cognisance of ED chargesheet against journalist Rajeev Sharma||A city court on Tuesday took cognizance of the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) charge sheet alleging money laundering by journalist Rajeev Sharma, who was arrested for allegedly leaking classified information to Chinese intelligence agencies, a Chinese national Qing Shi and a Nepal national Sher Singh.The court said it prima facie found a case under sections of 3 and 4 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after hearing the submission of the public prosecutor and noting the available material on record. The two sections are related to money laundering and involvement in laundering proceeds of crime directly or indirectly.On September 14, 2020, Sharma, a freelance journalist, was arrested by the Delhi Police’s special cell for allegedly passing on classified information to Chinese intelligence agencies. Police also arrested Shi and Nepal national, Sher Singh alias Sher Bahadur, for allegedly running shell companies through which they received money from Chinese agencies. In July 2021, ED filed a case against the three on the basis of the Delhi Police’s charge sheet filed in December 2020.The court has fixed October 4 as the next date of hearing.The three accused are currently in judicial custody in the alleged money laundering case.In the police’s charge sheet, seen by HT, investigators claimed that Sharma received money from his handler, identified as George, through two shell companies based in Mahipalpur. The charge sheet names the two companies, MZ Mall and MZ Pharmacy, which were allegedly run by Shi and two other Chinese nationals, Zhang Zeng and Zhang Lixia. According to the charge sheet, Zeng and Lixia could not be arrested as they had left for China and could not return to India because of the Covid-19 lockdown.The charge sheet says that though Singh was also shown as a co-director in MZ Pharmacy along with Shi, adding that in reality, he was only a driver. A bank statement submitted to the ED, which was also mentioned in the charge sheet, shows that there were cash transfers of around ₹2 crore in the account of MZ Pharmacy.The charge sheet also has the statement of the landlord of the Mahipalpur property and his bank statements, to show that the two office spaces were rented for ₹70,000 per month since September 2019.Meanwhile, Sharma’s counsel, Amish Aggarwala, denied the charges.“We will approach high court to quash the charge sheet. Merely saying that my client routed money through shell companies is not enough. The ED filed the charge sheet on the basis of the one filed by the police which claimed laundering through shell companies. However, police and ED have not been able to produce any evidence that the so called companies were shell companies. They have no evidence against my client. They have also alleged that my client was in contact with a woman who was an agent of Chinese intelligence agencies. But the ED and police has brought no evidence to support the claim that she is an agent of China. There is no evidence from officers of the Defence Ministry or the Indian Army that the alleged seized document was a secret file,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/espionage-case-court-takes-cognisance-of-ed-chargesheet-against-journalist-two-others-for-money-laundering-101631124402423.html
09-09-2021||Delhi||149 cement mixer trucks fined by traffic police for dirt-covered number plates||The Delhi traffic police has fined 149 cement mixer trucks for plying with dirty or obscured number plates to avoid prosecution for traffic violations, senior officers said on Wednesday. The fines came during a special drive that is being carried out across the city since the past 10 days, especially in areas where construction work in on-going, the officers said.They said the owners and drivers of the concrete mixer trucks “deliberately” kept the number plates dirty so that the registration number is not captured on cameras installed across the city to detect violations such as red light jumping or speeding. Dirty plates also helped them evade identification in case of any hit-and-run accident, the officers said.Special commissioner of police (traffic) Muktesh Chander said there have been several accidents involving concrete mixer trucks. Data on the exact number of accidents caused by such trucks is not immediately available, Chander said. On December 27, 2020, a 55-year-old man was killed and six others injured when a mini truck in which they were travelling, rammed a parked cement mixer truck at Nehru Place flyover in south-east Delhi.The special drive to prosecute cement mixer trucks having obscure or dirty number plates began on August 28 after Chander spotted one such vehicle violating traffic rules while he was on field duty near Ashram Chowk.“When the truck was stopped, its rear registration plate was not visible. It took us at least 10 minutes to remove the concrete residue from the plate. As more such violations were found, we decided to launch a special drive to prosecute such trucks,” said the special commissioner.According to traffic rules, a vehicle is fined ₹5,000 for faulty or dirty registration plates in the first instance. A second violation will entail a fine of ₹10,000, he said.A traffic police officer said for the first two-three days of the drive, 20 to 30 such vehicles were fined but the number started decreasing as the drive progressed. “The prosecutions have had a marked effect as we now come across cement mixer trucks with the entire body crusted over concrete residue, but shiny number plates,” the officer said, asking not to be named.Chander used his Twitter handle to post photographs of the impact the drive has had. He said soon, the drive will cover other vehicles too that carry building construction material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/149-cement-mixer-trucks-fined-by-traffic-police-for-dirt-covered-number-plates-101631123022740.html

09-09-2021||Pune||More than 6 mn await second vaccine dose, 2 mn first dose in Pune district||Pune: As per the Co-WIN dashboard, Pune has seen over 8.85 million vaccinations in the district of which 6.36 million have got their first dose and 2.48 million have got both doses. As per the district’s estimated population, more than 8.53 million people are eligible to get the vaccine in Pune. So, 6.05 million still await their second dose and are yet to be fully vaccinated and 2.17 million are yet to get their first dose. As of Wednesday evening, Pune has reported more than 95,000 vaccinations on the day which took the total count to 8,851,036 of which 6,365,663 have got their first shot and 2,485,373 have been fully vaccinated. Of these, 8,070,838 were Covishield shots, 732,883 have got Covaxin and 47,315 have got Sputnik shots. The highest vaccination was conducted in the age group of 18-45 years where 4,727,597 vaccines were administered, 2,408,598 vaccines were administered in the age group of 45-60 years and above 60 years 1,714,841 beneficiaries got the shot. In the past few days due to a large supply of vaccines to the district, Pune has been able to vaccinate a large number of people in a day which made Pune as the first and only district in the state to vaccinate more than 0.2 million doses in a day on August 31 when a private company donated a large number of vaccines. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director (health) for Pune region, said, “As of now, it would be difficult to give an exact timeline as to when the district could be fully vaccinated since it depends on the supply of vaccine. For the past 15 days the supply has been much better than the past 2-3 months. If the current supply continues then we would be able to vaccinate the entire population in the next three to three and a half months.” Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospitals, said, “We have now very few patients who are on the ventilator or ICU due to Covid-19. In the past few months, we have observed that these patients who get critical due to Covid are those who live in the periphery of the city and are not vaccinated. So, in the past four months, as more people are being fully vaccinated the number of ICU patients has gone down.” In an ideal situation when about 0.1 million doses are administered daily it would still take more than two months for the entire district’s eligible population, aged more than 18 years to be fully vaccinated considering the absolute numbers, according to medical experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/more-than-6-mn-await-second-vaccine-dose-2-mn-first-dose-in-pune-district-101631115761204.html

LIP president Simarjeet Singh Bains also met Kholsa and sought action against the officials. Accompanied by a number of residents and industrialists, the LIP members accused the officials of demanding bribe and harassing residents who refused to pay. LIP in-charge of Gill constituency, Sunny Kainth, said, “The SDO and JE have employed a private person, who accepts bribe on their behalf. Recently, the SDO also facilitated laying down of power supply lines at an illegal colony in Khanpur village. Despite repeated complaints, no action has been taken against them. A complaint against the officials has also been sent to the chief minister’s office.”“We had to sit on the floor of the chief engineer’s office, as no action was taken against the corrupt officials and no official came to meet us while we were protesting,” said Kainth. Meanwhile, Khosla stated that an inquiry has been marked in this case to two superintending engineers and required action will be taken if any anomalies are found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lip-seeks-fir-against-2-pspcl-staffers-over-corrupt-practices-101631113960979.html

09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Athletes in Ludhiana await reopening of messes for proper diet||With messes at sports stadiums and academies in Ludhiana closed since the Covid lockdown was imposed in March last year, budding athletes from the district are struggling to even meet their basic dietary requirements .The closing of these messes, which were funded through government grants, is largely affecting players from economically weaker backgrounds, including those who brought laurels to the state at national level.One such mess is located at Guru Nanak Stadium, which has also been closed since the lockdown was imposed. The players earlier used to get nutritious food from here, which according to them was among the key factors for their performance at the state and national levels.Rohit Kumar, 16, the son of a labourer from Kotkapura in Faridkot, is a national NBA player in junior category and trains at District Basketball Academy here. “My father works really hard to feed the family and is the sole bread earner. Protein is essential for any athlete and we used to get eggs, milk, pulses and fruits at our mess pre-lockdown. Now, my father also bears the baggage of my food expenses, along with the sports equipment and school fees. I can’t even think of eating a non-vegetarian diet anymore,” he said.Rohit’s father Ramesh Kumar said that he doesn’t expect anything from the government. “I am sure that despite the odds, my son who bagged medals at state and national level, will make India proud. But, the government has turned a blind eye. I feel helpless at times,” he said. Indian NBA sensation Princepal Singh, who also trains at DBA, said that a player cannot excel without a proper diet. “It is disturbing to see how our young players are being neglected by the government here. They should open all the messes and support the players, so that they can bring laurels to the country at international level”, averred Prince.The situation is no different for football and badminton players. Mohinder Singh Grewal, president of the District Badminton Association Ludhiana (DBAL), said that there has been minimal help from the government in helping the athletes. “It is great to see governments honouring our Olympic heroes after they bagged medals for the country. But, it is very important for officials to understand that players need proper care from the beginning. Only then, will we be able to surpass China or USA in the medal tally”, said Grewal.Meanwhile, Ravinder Singh, district sports officer, said that the government is waiting for things to get back normal as the third covid wave is suspected. “Not many players are turning back to the grounds for now and third wave is expected too, so the government is yet to take decision on reopening messes”, said Singh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/players-struggling-for-proper-diet-amid-closed-messed-101631107224112.html

It was attended by farmers, farm women and rural youths. The theme of the mela was: “efficient paddy straw management keeps mother earth exultant.”Inaugurating the mela, Anirudh Tewari, additional chief secretary (development), Punjab, and vice-chancellor of PAU, said, the prosperity of the farmers is one of the thrust areas of the state government. Expressing concern over soil health and groundwater situation in Kandi area, he urged the farmers to adopt PAU recommended crop system for the region. He stressed upon promoting maize cultivation and organic farming in the area. PAU’s College of Agriculture has been established at Ballowal Saunkhri to conduct research and provide solutions to agriculture-related problems of the Kandi region and motivate youngsters to adopt agriculture as a profession. Tewari called upon the farmers to say no to paddy straw burning and adopt technologies such as happy seeder and super seeder for its management. Highlighting the latest research recommendations made by PAU, Dr Navtej Singh Bains, director of research, said the university has developed new varieties such as PBW 803, PBW 824 and PBW 869 of wheat; BL 44 of berseem and OL 15 of oats for general cultivation in Punjab.He said that PAU has developed a new machine, “PAU smart seeder”, for the management of paddy straw. It manages paddy residues by incorporation and surface mulching and retains benefits of happy seeder and super seeder in a single machine, he added.Dr Jaskarn Singh Mahal, director of extension education, said the virtual melas will provide in-depth knowledge about agriculture and allied occupations to the farmers and farm women and help boost their earnings. During the mela, panel discussions were held on judicious water use for crop production and agricultural diversification opportunities in Kandi region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/adopt-maize-cultivation-organic-farming-in-kandi-pau-vc-101631106684031.html
09-09-2021||Kolkata||Bombs hurled at BJP MP Arjun Singh’s house in West Bengal, probe on||At least three crude bombs were hurled by miscreants outside the residence of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Arjun Singh in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district on Wednesday, police said, adding that two persons were detained in connection with the matter. The legislator from Barrackpore was not at home and no one was injured in the incident. According to the police, around six to seven people came out of Mazdoor Bhavan, Singh’s residence-cum-office in Bhatpara, early on Wednesday and allegedly assaulted a man sitting at a tea stall nearby. The man left the spot but returned a few minutes later with his associates who hurled bombs at the MP’s residence, they added.“We received information that around 6:30 am, three crude bombs were hurled outside Mazdoor Bhavan. We have received a complaint. An investigation is underway. Two persons have been detained,” a senior police officer in Barrackpore said on condition of anonymity. Eyewitnesses said that two crude bombs hit the main gate of Singh’s residence and the third landed within the premises. Reacting to the explosions, Singh told reporters: “My house was attacked soon after the party made me the observer for the Bhabanipur by-polls from where chief minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting. It was to scare me so that I would remain inside the house. Around a month ago, I had already informed the governor in a confidential report that attempts were being made to murder me.” The BJP leader was referring to the bypolls slated for September 30 which Banerjee has to win to become a member of the assembly in order to continue in the chair. Banerjee had lost her seat to BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari with a narrow margin from Nandigram seat in the April elections. While she took oath on May 5, she has to get elected within six months to continue as chief minister. “I want an NIA probe into the incident as I do not have faith in the state police,” the BJP legislator was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Extending support to his party colleague, Adhikari tweeted: “Hurling bombs at MP @ArjunsinghWB’s residence validates our allegation that the perpetrators have been assured of impunity by their handlers within WB Administration. Otherwise they won’t dare to execute such act. “However, @ArjunsinghWB is made of steel, won’t be intimidated.” The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) denied any involvement in the act and hinted that it could be the result of infighting among BJP leaders. “Gandhivadi, peaceful and non-violent Arjun Singh has a long relation with bombs and bullets. The police will see which faction hurled the bombs and who is trying to seek popularity to stay afloat in the BJP. There are several equations,” TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said.Urging the police to take prompt action in the matter, Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar tweeted: “Wanton violence in WB shows no sign of abating. Bomb explosions as this morning outside residence of Member Parliament @ArjunsinghWB is worrisome on law and order. Expect prompt action @WBPolice. As regards his security the issue has been earlier been flagged @MamataOfficial.” Several allegations of post-poll violence had surfaced across the state after the election results were declared on May 2 and the TMC returned to power with a sweeping victory. On August 19, the Calcutta high court had ordered a court-monitored CBI probe into the allegations of murder, attempt to murder and rape while it directed a Special Investigation Team to probe allegations of loot and arson during the period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bombs-hurled-outside-bjp-mp-s-residence-in-bengal-101631082980885.html
09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh horror: Woman molested, robbed at knifepoint||Three men with covered faces held a woman captive for around an hour, molested her and robbed her of ₹6.5 lakh at knifepoint at her rented accommodation in Sector 27, Chandigarh, on Tuesday afternoon.The 27-year-old victim is a model and actor and had shifted to Chandigarh around a month back for some professional assignment. She suspects that one of the delivery men who helped move furniture to her second-floor accommodation is behind the robbery, said police. The incident has been captured by CCTV cameras, and police are checking the footage to nail the culprits.The woman was alone in the house when the incident took place around 12:30 pm. Police said the domestic help had left the door open after completing the work, and the three men managed to sneak in after climbing the stairs. Holding the woman captive at knifepoint, they took ₹6 lakh cash kept in the house. They even took her ATM card and forced her to give the PIN number, following which one of the men went to a nearby market and withdrew ₹50,000, said police. They allegedly even tried to molest her.Somehow, the woman managed to lock herself up in a bathroom, and the trio left after remaining in the house for about an hour. As the house is near the sector’s boundary wall, they jumped on to the cycle track and escaped.Police received a call about some disturbance in the area around 2:40 pm. “The knife was recovered from the house, and we have been able to confirm that the accused had gone to an ATM booth to withdraw money. We have obtained CCTV footage and have got some leads. The accused will be arrested soon,” said superintendent of police (SP, City) Ketan Bansal, who was present at the spot. A case has been registered under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) and 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 26 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-horror-woman-molested-robbed-at-knifepoint-101631044435941.html
09-09-2021||World||Taliban was 'businesslike and professional' in new evacuation: White House||The Taliban was businesslike, "professional" and cooperative in facilitating the latest evacuation of US nationals from Afghanistan, the White House said Thursday.The departure from Kabul to Doha on a chartered Qatar Airways flight Thursday marked "a positive first step," National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said."The Taliban have been cooperative in facilitating the departure of American citizens and lawful permanent residents on charter flights from HKIA," she said in a statement."They have shown flexibility, and they have been businesslike and professional in our dealings with them in this effort."The White House's chief spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, declined to tell reporters at a press conference precisely how many Americans were aboard the flight, saying it had only just landed and that Washington did not yet have all the details.President Joe Biden's administration had said earlier that there were about 100 Americans still in Afghanistan and wishing to leave following the conclusion of the massive airlift set up by the US military in August amid the Taliban takeover.The evacuation operation shuttled more than 123,000 out of the country over two weeks.According to Horne, the White House thanked Qatar for its role and said the United States "facilitated" Thursday's departure of Americans from Afghanistan."We have been working intensely" to ensure the safe departure, and the flight is the result of "careful and hard diplomacy and engagement," she said.Biden and his administration have come under fierce criticism for having left Americans at the mercy of the Taliban and to comply with the conditions of the new Islamist rulers in Kabul.Horne stressed however that efforts to facilitate such evacuations of Americans and Afghans who worked with the US mission would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-was-businesslike-and-professional-in-new-evacuation-white-house-101631210772878.html
09-09-2021||World||97% of Afghanistan's population could plunge into poverty by mid-2022, says UN||As much as 97 per cent of Afghanistan's population is at risk of sinking below the poverty line unless a response to the country's political and economic crises is urgently launched, according to a rapid appraisal released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on Thursday.The study, which analysed four potential scenarios of escalating intensity and isolation, indicated that real GDP could contract by as much as 13.2 per cent, leading to an increase in the poverty rate of up to 25 percentage points, the UNDP said."We are facing a full-on development collapse on top of humanitarian and economic crises," said Kanni Wignaraja, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director of the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific."Half of the population is already in need of humanitarian support. This analysis suggests that we are on course for rapid, catastrophic deterioration in the lives of Afghanistan's most vulnerable people."The appraisal used a computable general equilibrium model for Afghanistan to simulate scenarios based on the latest available data (2018). The modelling identified a worst-case scenario defined by a two-month interruption to trade with all major partners, a four per cent decrease in capital spending efficiency, and disruptions in connectivity, the statement added.According to the appraisal, this combination of factors could cause the baseline poverty rate, now at 72 per cent, to balloon.In addition to a prolonged drought and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, Afghanistan is contending with the upheaval caused by the current political transition: frozen foreign reserves, collapsing public finances, increasing pressure on the banking system, and rising poverty.In response, UNDP is proposing a package of interventions designed to help improve the immediate living conditions of the most vulnerable people and communities, prioritising safeguarding women and girls' rights.The package focuses on essential services, local livelihoods, basic income and small infrastructure and aims to support close to nine million vulnerable people through a 24-month community development programme.Under the plan, the most vulnerable would benefit from cash-for-work schemes, grants for small and medium enterprises, especially women-run businesses. Children, people with disabilities and elderly citizens would receive temporary basic income through monthly cash transfers.The proposed Local Area-Based Programme will be implemented directly with local networks of community groups, NGOs and small businesses. Speaking at a press conference, UN Assistant Secretary-General Wignaraja called on the international community to launch a response commensurate with the scale of the crisis in Afghanistan."A transition to new authorities, a pandemic, a drought, an oncoming winter season - each of these on their own would already pose a major challenge. Taken together, they form a crisis that demands urgent action," she said. "This program aims to contribute to improving the lives of the most vulnerable, while also reducing displacement that could further compound the situation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/97-of-afghanistan-s-population-could-plunge-into-poverty-by-mid-2022-says-un-101631210004058.html

Xi Jinping said the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries must strengthen public health cooperation and international cooperation on sharing vaccines.“We need to promote global solidarity against Covid-19, join forces to tackle the pandemic, uphold a science-based approach to tracing its origins, and oppose the politicisation and stigmatisation,” Xi Jinping said, adding that the BRICS need to boost the research, production and equitable distribution of vaccines as a global public good.Xi Jinping said the member countries should facilitate the “early launch of the BRICS Vaccine R&D Centre in a virtual format”.On the issue of terrorism and security, Xi Jinping said the BRICS countries need to support each other on “issues concerning our respective core interests and jointly safeguard our sovereignty, security and development interests”.Xi Jinping stressed on the need for the BRICS to have a “bigger, collective voice” to better coordinate positions on major international and regional issues. “The BRICS Counter Terrorism Action Plan adopted earlier this year should be implemented in real earnest.”Xi Jinping said the five BRICS countries have become an important force on the international stage to reckon with, adding that the countries have expanded strategic communication among them.Announcing that China will take over as the BRICS chair in 2022, Xi Jinping said the country looks forward to building a more closer and result-oriented partnership.“Over the past 15 years, our five nations have enhanced strategic communication and political trust in the spirit of openness, inclusiveness and equality, respected each other’s social system and explored a sound way for nations to interact with each other,” Xi Jinping said. “The five countries have also conducted practical cooperation in various fields. BRICS countries have become an important force on the international stage to be reckoned with.”“While seeking synergy between their development policies and drawing on their complementarities, the five countries have made solid progress in various areas of cooperation in the spirit of pragmatism, innovation and win-win cooperation, and have forged ahead on the common journey of development,” Xi Jinping said.The five countries have supported multilateralism and taken part in global governance in the spirit of equity, justice, and mutual assistance, he said. “What has happened shows that come what may, we can make smooth, solid and sustained progress in BRICS cooperation as long as we pull our minds and our efforts,” Xi Jinping added.“China looks forward to working with BRICS partners to deepen cooperation in all areas and build a closer and more results-oriented partnership to meet common challenges and create a better future,” Xi Jinping said.Xi Jinping echoed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who, in his opening remarks, said BRICS is an influential voice for emerging economies of the world and the countries must ensure that it becomes more productive in the next 15 years.Besides Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping, the summit was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Brazil’s Jair Bolsanaro.Xi said that in order to promote BRICS practical cooperation, China proposes to hold multiple forums including the BRICS Industrial Internet and Digital Manufacturing Development Forum, the BRICS High-level Meeting on Climate Change, the BRICS Sustainable Development Big Data Forum, and online training courses for media from five countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-provide-100mn-more-covid-vaccines-to-developing-nations-xi-jinping-101631209495289.html
09-09-2021||World||Shouldn’t become sanctuary for terror groups to attack others: Brics on Afghanistan||The Brics grouping on Thursday asserted Afghanistan’s territory shouldn’t become a sanctuary for terror groups to mount attacks on other nations and called for an inclusive intra-Afghan dialogue to ensure stability and peace in the war-torn country following the Taliban takeover. The Delhi Declaration issued after a virtual summit of Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) expressed concern at developments in Afghanistan and made a call for “refraining from violence and settling the situation by peaceful means”. The grouping highlighted the importance of fighting terror and upholding human rights, including those of women and minorities. The strongly worded joint statement came two days after the Taliban unveiled an interim setup in Kabul led by Mohammad Hasan Akhund and dominated by 17 leaders sanctioned by the UN Security Council. Despite recent remarks by Taliban leaders that they would form an inclusive government, the new regime comprised mainly members of the group’s old guard and top military commanders such as Sirajuddin Haqqani. The Delhi Declaration, issued at the conclusion of the summit, said: “We underscore the priority of fighting terrorism, including preventing attempts by terrorist organisations to use Afghan territory as terrorist sanctuary and to carry out attacks against other countries, as well as drug trade within Afghanistan.” While calling on all parties to refrain from violence and to settle the situation through peaceful means, the declaration added, “We stress the need to contribute to fostering an inclusive intra-Afghan dialogue so as to ensure stability, civil peace, law and order in the country.” The Brics members condemned the terrorist attacks near Kabul airport on August 26 that resulted in the death of more than 180 people, mostly Afghans and 13 US military personnel. They also emphasised the need to address the humanitarian situation and to “uphold human rights, including those of women, children and minorities”, the declaration said. Russian President Vladimir Putin was the only one of the five leaders to raise the situation in Afghanistan in the televised opening remarks, saying all members of Brics do not want Afghanistan to remain a threat to its neighbours, or Afghan soil to be a source of drug trafficking and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted in his opening remarks that the grouping had adopted the Brics Counter-Terrorism Action Plan. The plan is aimed at implementing the Brics counter-terrorism strategy adopted by the national security advisors and defines the approach for cooperation in this field, including joint efforts to identify and respond to “persistent and emerging terror threats”. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the situation in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil figured extensively in the closed deliberations between the five leaders. Putin highlighted the dangers posed by terrorism while Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro pointed to the problem of narcotics originating from Afghanistan, the people said. “The Russian position, as outlined by President Putin and Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s security council, during his visit this week, is very similar to India’s position and we have similar concerns regarding Afghanistan,” one of the people cited above said. Briefing the media after the summit, secretary Sanjay Bhattacharyya, who is the Sherpa to Brics, said a key outcome of the meeting was a “very strong sense of consensus” on Afghanistan, which supports India’s perspective on developments in the war-torn country and the region. “There was a very strong condemnation of terrorism and that Afghan territory should not be used either for terrorism or for drug trafficking, and that it should not become a reason for problems in the neighbourhood,” he said. The role of the UN Security Council in addressing the humanitarian aspects of the situation was highlighted, he said. Putin, in his opening remarks, said close partnership between the Brics states is required because the situation across the world remains turbulent and long-standing regional conflicts were flaring up with renewed vigour. “The withdrawal of the US and its allies from Afghanistan has led to a new crisis and it’s still unclear how this will affect regional and global security,” he said. Russia and its Brics partners have “consistently advocated the establishment of long-awaited peace and stability on Afghan soil”, and the people of the country have “fought for many decades and earned the right to independently determine what their state will be like”, Putin added. “We are all interested in Afghanistan ceasing to be a threat to the neighbours, so that terrorism and illegal drug trafficking threaten us from Afghan territory. We are interested in stopping migration flows. We stand for Afghans to be able to live peacefully and with dignity in their homeland,” he said. Putin also said that the current crisis in Afghanistan stems directly from “irresponsible attempts to impose alien values from the outside and the desire to build so-called democratic structures using methods of socio-political engineering without taking into account either the historical or national characteristics of other peoples and ignoring their traditions”. “All this results in destabilisation and chaos, after which the authors of these experiments back down, abandoning their charges to their fate. The entire international community will have to clear up the mess as a result,” Putin said, without naming the US. Bhattacharyya said all the leaders focused on post-Covid-19 recovery and vaccines during their deliberations in light of the widespread disruption caused by the pandemic. Modi noted that the post-pandemic agenda of Brics should focus on building back, resilience, innovation, credibility and sustainability. The leaders discussed the need for extensive vaccination and the development of vaccines. A vaccine R&D centre is now being proposed as a virtual network to facilitate the development and distribution of vaccines. The Delhi Declaration regretted the “glaring inequity in access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, especially for the world’s poorest and most vulnerable populations” and highlighted the “importance of safe, efficacious, accessible and affordable vaccines”. The leaders also discussed the reforms of multilateral bodies such as the UN Security Council in view of a long-standing feeling that the existing systems need to respond to the needs of global governance and be more responsive. There were also discussions on the New Development Bank (NDB), which has emerged as a flagship project in economic and financial cooperation between Brics members. The bank has provided funding worth $29 billion to 73 infrastructure projects, including $7 billion for 18 projects in India. The Delhi Declaration further said the world community has a “collective responsibility to work together against the Covid-19 pandemic” within existing international frameworks such as the WHO, and noted that cooperation on the “origins of the SARS-COV-2 is an important aspect of the fight”. It added, “We support science-based, inclusive of broad expertise, transparent, and timely processes, free from politicisation or interference, to strengthen international capabilities to better understand the emergence of novel pathogens and to help prevent future pandemics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shouldnt-become-sanctuary-for-terror-groups-to-attack-others-brics-on-afghanistan-101631209255185.html

The crew turned on a filter to eliminate possible smoke pollution and went back to sleep, the Russian space agency said. The incident is the latest in the string of problems related to the Zvezda service module, the Russian segment of the space station."A smoke detector was triggered in the Zvezda service module of the Russian segment of the International Space Station during automatic battery charging, and an alarm went off," Roscosmos said in a statement.Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Novitsky and Pyotr Dubrov today went on a spacewalk as per the schedule to continue the integration of the Nauka multipurpose laboratory module into the Russian segment of the ISS through extravehicular activities. Nauka is designed to build up the technical and operational capabilities of the Russian segment of the International Space Station."All systems are operating normally," Roscosmos said.In July, a “short-term software failure” threw the space station out of control for a brief period after a research module was docked. An unplanned firing of jet thrusters of the Russian research module Nauka resulted in a “loss of attitudinal control” that lasted for a little more than 45 minutes.Nasa later assured that ground teams regained attitude control and orientation of the space station by activating thrusters on another module attached to it. The US space agency, however, stressed that the seven crew aboard the ISS were never in any immediate danger.In the past, Russia has indicated to leave the space station after 2025 and launch its own orbital station given the frequent issues with the ISS. A space official even warned last month that out of date software could lead to "irreparable failures".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/smoke-at-international-space-station-latest-in-series-of-issues-in-russian-module-101631204664493.html
09-09-2021||World||Pakistan minister says they can send people to Kabul. To help in various affairs||Pakistan finance minister Shaukat Tarin on Thursday said people could be sent from Pakistan to run various affairs in Afghanistan as he was addressing a session of the Senate Standing Committee in which he also talked about the future framework of trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan, several Pakistani media, including Geo TV, reported.The comment comes amid several Pakistani ministers speaking in favour of the Taliban. While countries are buying time to decide on whether to recognise the interim Taliban government in Afghanistan, Pakistan ministers are pressing for continued co-operation with Afghanistan. Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said on Thursday that Afghanistan's assets should be unfrozen so that they can be used, Reuters reported.Taliban open fire to disperse anti-Pakistan march in Kabul: ReportsWhile Shaukat Tarin's comment on sending people to Afghanistan has drawn sharp reaction on social media, especially after the recent visit of the ISI chief Faiz Hameed to Kabul underlined the Pakistan hand behind the Taliban, many claimed that it was an offer from the finance minister to help the Taliban government to fill the technical positions left vacant due to the recent evacuations by the western countries.The Pakistan minister also said that Pakistan will trade with Afghanistan in the Pakistani currency as Kabul is facing a shortage of dollars.Afghanistan's acting Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund has appealed to ex-officials to return to Afghanistan and that they have no security threat in the country as the Taliban will guarantee their security and safety. We have suffered huge losses in money and lives for this historical moment in the history of Afghanistan. The stage of bloodshed, killing and contempt for people in Afghanistan has ended, and we have paid dearly for this. No one will be able to prove that he was subjected to revenge. And in such tense circumstances, it is easy to do what you want. But the movement is disciplined and controls its gunmen. And, we have not harmed anyone because of his previous actions," he said in an interview to Al Jazeera.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-minister-says-they-can-send-people-to-kabul-to-run-various-affairs-101631204545514.html
09-09-2021||World||Zebulon Simentov, Afghanistan's last Jew, leaves after Taliban takeover||The last member of Afghanistan's Jewish community has left the country following the Taliban takeover, an Israeli-American businessman who organized his evacuation told AFP Thursday.Zebulon Simentov began his journey out of Afghanistan on Friday and arrived in a "neighboring country" Wednesday, said Moti Kahana, who runs a US-based private security firm.For decades, Simentov refused to leave Afghanistan -- surviving a Soviet invasion, deadly civil war, brutal rule by the Taliban and the US-led occupation of his homeland.Having already endured the Taliban's regime from 1996 to 2001, Simentov was reluctant to go when Kahana's security team arrived 10 days before his departure."At that time, he did not want to come out," said Kahana, who explained to Simentov that he was at risk of being killed by Islamic State-Khorasan militants."But he listened and I think he came to the conclusion himself," Kahana recalled.Simentov asked Kahana if they could also take his "best friend" and their kids, so 29 neighbors joined him on the journey out.Kahana said that Simentov has family in New York and plans to join them there soon, hopefully around the Yom Kippur holiday next week."He's definitely coming," Kahana added.Born in the 1950s in the western city of Herat, Simentov moved to Kabul during the Soviet invasion in the early 1980s for the capital's then relative stability.Over the decades, all Simentov's relatives left -- including his wife and two daughters.But Simentov stayed put, despite the Taliban trying to convert him to Islam and imprisoning him four times.He continued to mark Jewish new year Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur at Kabul's only synagogue."I have resisted. I have made the religion of Moses proud here," he told AFP during an interview earlier this year.Jews lived in Afghanistan for more than 2,500 years, with tens of thousands once residing in Herat, where four synagogues still stand -- testimony to the community's ancient presence.But they have steadily left the country since the 19th century, with many now living in Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zebulon-simentov-afghanistan-s-last-jew-leaves-after-taliban-takeover-101631203976603.html

But he waived, smiled and gave a thumbs up as thousands of goose-stepping paramilitary and public security forces marched for more than an hour through central Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang, fixing their gazes to the balcony where the leader was watching as they passed.Kim -- overweight and a smoker -- has been the subject of health speculation for years and his public appearances are closely tracked for insights about the autocratic and secretive regime in Pyongyang, especially since his family has a history of heart disease.The North Korean leader may have dropped at least 20 kilograms (44 pounds) over the past several months, according to a South Korean lawmaker briefed by a spy agency official in July. He looked even thinner at the parade. At the parade, Kim also appeared to paying homage to his grandfather with a haircut similar to one sported by Kim Il Sung about 70 years ago. In June, state media cited a citizen as saying North Koreans broke down in tears over seeing a dramatically thinner Kim Jong Un. The  37-year-old leader returned to the public eye cutting a much thinner figure after being absent for most of May, which raised questions about his health.Kim has been looking to rally support as North Korea is facing one of its worst food shortage in years. He is struggling to build an economy hit by sanctions to punish the country for its testing of nuclear weapons and missiles that can deliver warheads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-is-trim-tanned-and-loving-a-parade-101631194284669.html
09-09-2021||World||200 passengers leave Kabul in first evacuation airlift after US pullout from Afghanistan||Some 200 passengers, including US citizens, left Kabul airport on Thursday, on the first flight carrying foreigners out of the Afghan capital since a US-led evacuation ended on August 30.The flight to Doha comes as the Taliban continue their transition from insurgents to governing power, less than a month after they marched into Kabul and ousted former president Ashraf Ghani.Thursday afternoon's Qatar Airways flight took some 200 people from Kabul's airport -- the first since a mammoth, chaotic airlift of more than 120,000 people came to a dramatic close with the US pullout.An Afghan-American dual citizen, waiting to board the flight with his family, said the US State Department had called him in the morning and told him to go to the airport."We got in contact with the State Department, they gave me a call this morning and said to go to the airport," the father, who asked not to be named, told AFP.In the days that followed the Taliban's blitz, the airport had become a tragic symbol of desperation among Afghans terrified of the militants' return to power -- with thousands of people crowding around its gates daily, and some even clinging to jets as they took off.More than 100 people were killed, including 13 US troops, in a suicide attack on August 26 near the airport that was claimed by the Islamic State group's local chapter.Waiting with suitcasesFootage broadcast by Al Jazeera TV on Thursday showed families including women, children and elderly people waiting with suitcases at the airport for their turn to leave.It was not immediately clear whether any countries other than Qatar had played a role in organising the airlift.Qatar has acted as the central intermediary between the Taliban and the international community in recent years, and numerous countries, including the United States, have relocated their embassies from Kabul to Doha in the aftermath of the Taliban takeover."We are very appreciative of the Qataris," one man told the channel, giving his nationality as Canadian.Away from the airport, there was a noticeably stronger Taliban presence on the streets of Kabul as armed fighters -- including special forces in military fatigues -- stood guard on street corners and manned checkpoints, according to AFP journalists.Protest banQatar's special envoy to Afghanistan, Mutlaq al-Qahtani, called it a "historic day" for the airport.He also said it marked a major step on the road to "reopening ... the airport to international flights, but it may be gradual".Most of the early Afghan evacuees were desperate to flee fearing Taliban reprisals for having worked with foreign powers during the 20-year, US-led occupation.The United States has repeatedly pledged to continue working to evacuate any American citizens still in Afghanistan after last month's airlift ended.Earlier Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said only around 100 Americans remained in Afghanistan."It's right around 100 right now and we're working to get those American citizens who want to depart out of the country, as well as legal permanent residents and other key partners," Psaki told MSNBC.The Taliban have said they will not prevent anyone who wishes to from leaving the country, even as they have urged skilled Afghans, such as doctors and engineers, to remain.The Islamist hardliners have pledged a more moderate brand of rule than in their notoriously oppressive 1996-2001 reign. However, they have shown clear signs that they will not tolerate opposition.Earlier this week armed Taliban militants dispersed hundreds of protesters in cities across Afghanistan, including Kabul, Faizabad in the northeast and in Herat in the west, where two people were shot dead.Late Wednesday, they moved to snuff out any further civil unrest, saying protests would need prior authorisation from the justice ministry, adding that no demonstrations were allowed "for the time being".One protest organiser told AFP rallies in Kabul had been cancelled because of the overnight ban.Promises of inclusionA Taliban interim government, drawn exclusively from loyalist ranks, formally began work this week with established hardliners in all key posts and no women -- despite previous promises of an inclusive administration for all Afghans.All the top positions have been handed to key leaders from the movement and in particular the Haqqani network -- the most violent Taliban faction, known for devastating attacks.The dreaded Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice -- previously responsible for arresting and punishing people for failing to follow the movement's restrictive interpretation of sharia -- is being reinstated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/200-passengers-leave-kabul-in-first-evacuation-airlift-after-us-pullout-from-afghanistan-101631197653108.html

This comes at a time when the countries are reiterating that they are in no hurry to recognise the Taliban government in Afghanistan.After postponing it twice, the Taliban announced its interim Cabinet on Tuesday, under the leadership of Taliban's supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada. The composition of the government, mostly prominent Taliban and Haqqani leaders, has raised international concern as the United States also said it is watching the new government closely. Several Cabinet members are on the sanction list of the United States and the Taliban on Thursday took objection to this stance and urged for the removal of these names from theUS sanction list."The family of honourable Haqqani Sahib is part of Islamic Emirate and does not have a separate name or organisational setup. Similarly, in Doha Agreement all officials of the Islamic Emirate without any exception were part of interaction with the US and should have been removed from the UN and US blacklists, a demand which still remains valid," the Taliban said.Mullah Mohammad Hasan Akhund, the caretaker Prime Minister, invited all former officials to return to the country and the Taliban will guarantee their security and safety, he said. “We have suffered huge losses in money and lives for this historical moment in the history of Afghanistan. The stage of bloodshed, killing and contempt for people in Afghanistan has ended, and we have paid dearly for this," Akhund said.Ceremony on September 11?A ceremony is being planned in Kabul though the date has not been finalised. It is also not confirmed whether the Taliban want 9/11 to be the date to embarrass the United States. After capturing Afghanistan, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had said that there was no proof that Osama bin Laden was involved in the September 11 attack. “When Osama bin Laden became an issue for the Americans, he was in Afghanistan. Although there was no proof he was involved," he had said to NBC News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-may-hold-oath-taking-ceremony-on-9-11-anniversary-reports-101631197309249.html
09-09-2021||World||German finance ministry raided in money laundering probe||German prosecutors raided the finance and justice ministries on Thursday as part of an investigation into possible obstruction of justice by the government’s anti-money laundering agency.The probe into the Financial Intelligence Unit, an agency of the finance ministry under SPD chancellor candidate Olaf Scholz, is looking at whether the division failed to act on warnings from banks of possible money laundering.The raids come at a pivotal moment for Scholz, who opinion polls suggest has a good chance of becoming German chancellor in national elections on Sept 26.The FIU along with the Germany's financial regulator, Bafin, both units of the finance ministry, have previously been criticised for failing to detect problems at payments company Wirecard, which collapsed in the country's biggest post-war fraud scandal.A spokesman for the public prosecutors said they launched the inquiry after receiving complaints that the FIU had not acted on millions of euros of suspect transactions, including to Africa, between 2018 and 2020.He said they had searched the ministries to see whether the agency had been told to ignore the suspect money flows.Prosecutors said the agency was alerted by banks because of concerns the money was linked to trafficking of arms and drugs and terrorism financing, saying that the FIU took note of the report but did not forward it to law enforcement agencies.Prosecutors said they were also looking into the fact that since the FIU took over control of money laundering in 2017, reports of suspicious activity have dropped drastically.They said that previous searches of the FIU had revealed that there had been extensive communication with the ministries that were searched on Thursday.The finance ministry said in a statement that it supported the investigation and noted that suspicion was not directed at the ministry's employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-finance-ministry-raided-in-money-laundering-probe-101631186317647.html

Reports suggest that the foreigners allowed to leave Afghanistan include 30 Americans in the first airlift since the final US withdrawal and the first international flights to take off since the Taliban took control of Kabul in mid-August."Not all 200 are US citizens. There are American citizens amongst the group departing Kabul to Doha," news agency AFP quoted a person in Doha, who was briefed on the operation, as saying.The Taliban have allowed the departure of charter flights carrying non-Afghans two days after the Islamist hardliners announced an interim government headed by Mullah Hassan Akhund. A US official claimed that the Taliban were pressed by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to allow the departures, Reuters reported.Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV broadcasted the visuals from Hamid Karzai International Airport which showed women, children, and the elderly waiting there with suitcases.Earlier this week, a Qatari technical team landed at Kabul airport aboard the country's flagship carrier Qatar Airways to discuss reopening the airport. Qatar's foreign minister had said that the Gulf nation was working with the Taliban to reopen the airport as soon as possible and urged the insurgents to allow Afghans to leave.While the Taliban have shown interest in engaging with regional and Western governments, most of the democratic countries are apprehensive about the assurance given by the insurgents regarding inclusivity and human rights. The all-male members of the newly-announced Taliban-led government, with almost no ethnic diversity, have done little to address the concerns of democratic countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-the-first-airlift-since-us-withdrawal-200-non-afghans-set-to-leave-taliban-controlled-kabul-101631186471647.html

"Women's rights must be the litmus test for our collective engagement with the Taliban," Naciri said, according to local media reports."The decisions that are made in the coming days on how the international community will engage with the Taliban will have long-term implications," Naciri added.The Taliban, known for its radical way of ruling, returned to power in Afghanistan last month following the withdrawal of the US military from the war-torn country. Designated as a terrorist organisation by the United States, the group ruled over the country from 1996 to 2001, when the American forces ousted them in anti-terror operations.Since then the women in Afghanistan have been reclaiming the public space, by joining workforces and enlisting themselves in police forces. They also competed in Olympics, became engineers, doctors and diplomats over the past few years and pushed the Islamic country to become more progressive. However, with the Taliban returning to power after 20 years, the same women are facing an uncertain future and fear that the group will reintroduce their regressive policies.The Taliban's position, in turn, is equally unclear - whether they will seek international legitimacy, turn to their established friends for support or turn inward.On Tuesday, the group announced their appointments of key ministers of the caretaking cabinet. However, the group made no mention of women as part of any governance structure. According to local media reports, the Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid has recommended women stay at home, "for their own protection."Women have also started disappearing from the media landscape, the group banned women's voices from the radio. Reports are also emerging from across the country claiming forced marriage of young girls, women being sent home from their workplaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibans-engagement-with-global-bodies-to-depend-on-safety-of-women-s-rights-in-afghanistan-un-101631186594003.html
09-09-2021||World||China: New airports, routes for PLA to transport personnel to Tibet, Xinjiang||The remote Chinese regions of Xinjiang and Tibet bordering India will soon have 30 airports at the disposal of the Western Theatre Command (WTC) to facilitate the movement of army personnel, a state media report said this week.The WTC is the largest military command of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and oversees the disputed border with India. While some of these airports have been built and are functional, the remaining are under construction.Among the three new airports to be built in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) are those at Lhunze county, Tingri county and Burang county, close to the border with India, official media had reported earlier this year.Another strategic airport to be opened by the middle of 2022 is the Tashkurgan, the first super-high plateau airport in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) on the Pamir plateau, close to China’s border with Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Afghanistan.Tiny Tashkurgan is the last important town in China close to PoK and located in the Tajik Autonomous County of the Kashgar prefecture in XUAR.Once completed, the new airport will be strategically located close to the Wakhan Corridor, the narrow pass which separates PoK and Tajikistan besides China and Afghanistan.Nearly two dozen new air routes have also been inaugurated connecting TAR and XUAR with cities across China this year, the report said.The opening of new routes and rapid construction of new airports come in the backdrop of the ongoing Sino-India border tension in eastern Ladakh.China is bolstering its presence all along the border with India, fortifying the remote regions by building critical civil-military dual use infrastructure like airports and railway routes.The report published by the official military portal of the Chinese military this week said the development of the airports in border areas is making transportation more convenient.“A chartered flight carrying 115 veterans took off from the Shigatse Heping Airport in Tibet and headed for Chengdu, Sichuan province, on the morning of September 1, marking the official opening of 23 air routes for transporting new recruits and veterans into and out of Xinjiang and Tibet in the second half of this year,” the report said.The report quoted an officer in charge of a military transportation centre under the PLA Western Theatre Command as saying that there are “…currently nearly 30 civil airports built or under construction in Xinjiang and Tibet. The rapid development of civil aviation in the border areas has provided convenience for the air transportation of recruits and veterans”.“It is learnt that after coordinating with airports in Urumqi, Kashgar, Lhasa, Shigatse and other places, the dispatch centre has opened up 23 routes to transport recruits and veterans into and out of Xinjiang and Tibet this year, and temporarily opened three routes from Yinchuan, Jiayuguan, and Zhangye to Ngari,” the report said.While Yinchuan is in the northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, both Jiayuguan and Zhangye are in Gansu province, also in the northwest of China; Ngari is in TAR.“It is also learnt that, in addition, some airlines help to reserve tickets of regular flights to Ngari in response to the troops’ emergency needs. And some urgently needed military supplies could also be delivered free of charge or at preferential rates by the civil airliners,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-airports-routes-for-pla-to-transport-personnel-to-tibet-xinjiang-101631186326565.html

The report suggests that a Chinese business representatives group in Afghanistan named “China Town in Kabul” is working to establish a so-called Afghan Institute.China has been warming up to the Taliban even as they are wary of Uyghurs separatists getting support from the Islamic fundamentalists. In an interview aired Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin termed the formation of the provisional Taliban government a “necessary step” for the restoration of “domestic order” and in pursuing the post-war reconstruction.A member of the Chinese business group in Kabul said that they have already made agreements with domestic enterprises and other organisations to jointly build the “platform,” reported Global Times. A rough framework for the industry platform has reportedly been formed and may be launched next week. The business representatives group in Kabul will provide services like personnel safety, government liaisoning, and bank exchange, tax and logistical services to the Afghan Insitute, according to Global Times."Various Chinese enterprises in the sectors of infrastructure construction and mining have contacted us for discussion since the release of the platform plan," the state media quoted the member as saying.Also Read | China says it will maintain communication with Taliban-led Afghanistan govtThe interim Taliban government includes several UN- and US-designated terrorists which could work as an impediment to global humanitarian aid.

The insurgents have also been appreciative of China’s aid and projects in the region, which is reflected in the Taliban spokesperson’s statement calling Beijing their most important partner.“China has decided to urgently provide 200 million yuan ($30.96 million) worth of grains, winter supplies, vaccines, and medicines to Afghanistan according to the needs of the Afghan people,” State councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi said at a meeting, according to the official news agency, Xinhua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-eyes-investment-opportunity-in-taliban-controlled-afghanistan-to-set-up-industry-platform-101631180993928.html

"Pentagon officials have remarked that some cabinet members of the Islamic Emirate or family members of late Haqqani Sahib - may Allah be pleased with him - are on the US blacklists and still targets. The Islamic Emirate considers this position a clear violation of the Doha Agreement which is neither in the interest of the United States nor Afghanistan," the group said in a statement.Haqqani network chief Jalaluddin Haqqani's son Sirajudin Haqqani is a global terrorist who carries a reward of USD 10 million bounty on his head. In the recently announced Cabinet, he has been given the post of acting interior minister. While this makes the Taliban-Haqqani link clear, raising concern of many countries, the Taliban in its statement said: "The family of honourable Haqqani Sahib is part of Islamic Emirate and does not have a separate name or organisational setup. Similarly, in Doha Agreement all officials of the Islamic Emirate without any exception were part of interaction with the US and should have been removed from the UN and US blacklists, a demand which still remains valid."Such positions are detrimental for America, the Taliban said terming these as a repetition of past failed experiments.Also Read | Not only PM; at least 14 members of Taliban govt are blacklisted by UN: ReportA day after the Taliban announced their interim cabinet, the state department of the United States said that many of them have questionable track records. "We note the announced list of names consists exclusively of individuals who are members of the Taliban or their close associates and no women. We also are concerned by the affiliations and track records of some of the individuals," the statement issued by the US state department said.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States is closely watching the new government in Afghanistan and they will have to earn legitimacy and support.Haqqanis are Afghanistan's most feared militants, part of a group fomred by anti-Soviet Jihadist Jalaluddin Haqqani. The Haqqanis have also hugely contributed to the Taliban's fighting ranks, and are the group's "most combat-ready forces", UN monitors said in a June report. Two Haqqani members, Sirajuddin Haqqani and his uncle Khalil Haqqani have been inducted in Afghanistan's new Cabinet. While both are listed as wanted by the United States, the Cabinet has 12 other sanctioned members including Akhundzada, leader of the Taliban and the head of the new Cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/family-of-haqqani-sahib-part-of-islamic-emirate-taliban-oppose-us-blacklist-101631177645269.html

NRF leader Ali Nazary said in an interview that 60 per cent of Panjshir is still under the NRF control.Nazary also told CNN that the Taliban have suffered heavy casualties."The current situation in Pajshir is a hit more complex than what is being reported. The Taliban haven't taken the province, they have only taken the main road and the provincial centre is located near the main road. So this is why they were able to hoist their flag," Nazary said on CNN Connect.He further said that the topography of Panjshir valley is very complex, which doesn't allow an invader to take over the entire area, adding that it has many sub-valleys. "60 to 65% of these sub-valleys and strategic positions are under our control."Nazary said the NRF forces made a "tactical withdrawal" from the main road and will soon return.Meanwhile, ousted Afghan government's ambassador to Tajikistan has said that Panjshiri leader Ahmad Shah Massoud and former Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh have not fled Afghanistan."Ahmad Massoud and Amrullah Saleh have not fled to Tajikistan. The news that Ahmad Massoud has left Panjshir is not true; he is inside Afghanistan," Zahir Aghbar said at a press conference.Aghbar added that he is in regular contact with Saleh and that the resistance leaders were out of general communication for security reasons.The Taliban swept to power last month and the militant group has said they have captured the Panjshir valley, a last holdout province, though the resistance has not conceded defeat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/made-tactical-withdrawal-nrf-leader-says-60-of-panjshir-still-under-control-101631166194644.html

But, the Indian high commission has asked Canadian authorities to protect Indians from “racially motivated crimes”.One person of interest was arrested and later released by Truro Police.Following an emergency call on Sunday, police arrived at the apartment building where the deceased lived and found him with life-threatening injuries. He was taken to a hospital but succumbed to the injuries sustained.India’s consulate in Toronto is in touch with his family members and has promised to provide all support in the repatriation of the mortal remains to India. “We have taken up the matter with federal and local Canadian authorities, who have assured us of quick and transparent investigations into the matter,” a statement from the Indian high commission said. It also warned Indian nationals, especially students, “to exercise caution, avoid moving alone in desolate and lonely areas, especially at night, and report to local police any suspicious or hateful activities they may encounter”.A candlelight vigil in memory of Katri will be held in Truro on Friday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-asks-canada-to-ensure-safety-of-its-nationals-after-murder-of-student-101631166465238.html
09-09-2021||World||Can the Taliban govern Afghanistan?||By announcing a caretaker government, the Taliban have temporarily unified their bickering factions. The interim setup, however, remains problematic and poses several domestic and international challenges to the group.The Taliban leadership took a long time to announce their interim government — three weeks after taking control of Kabul.Analysts say the fight for Panjshir province kept them busy all this while, and once the last resistance stronghold fell to the group, their spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, unveiled the caretaker government on Tuesday.Even though it is just a caretaker government, and what the Taliban's actual government will look like remains unclear, Afghanistan's Islamist rulers face a tough task running the country.Internal riftsThere had been reports of a tug-of-war among Taliban factions over the allocation of key posts in the new government. The transitional setup suggests that Afghanistan's new rulers have been able to unify their ranks, at least for now.Mullah Hasan Akhund has been nominated as acting prime minister, while Sirajuddin Haqqani will serve as acting interior minister. The decision to delegate a senior position to Haqqani is proof that the Taliban did not want to irk the powerful Haqqani Network, which is believed to have become a suborganization of the Taliban in its own right.Mullah Yaqoob, the son of the Taliban founder Mohammed Omar, will be acting defense minister and Amir Khan Muttaqi will be acting foreign minister in the new setup.In his column for Pakistan's Dawn newspaper, Zahid Hussain, a senior political analyst, wrote that "the most serious challenge for the Afghan Taliban is to maintain the unity within their ranks.""Some fear that the formation of an interim government will further widen the cleavage. The struggle between the moderates who would want to take a break from some of the harshest legacies of the previous dispensation and the hardliners who are not willing to reform could sharpen," he wrote."While the Taliban may have appeared as a monolith during the war, the differences over military tactics and other policy matters kept surfacing. Yet the disagreement didn't affect the resistance. The end of the war has widened the fault lines," Hussain added.Not inclusiveTaliban officials had claimed that their new government would include different political and ethnic groups, but the interim setup is dominated by their old guard."The Taliban do not see the need for an inclusive government anymore. For them it is more important that powerful figures are leading their government so that they can crush potential resistance movements," Sami Yousufzai, an Afghan journalist, told DW."They have appointed ministers on the basis of their loyalties to the group," he added.The European Union on Wednesday said that the Taliban-appointed caretaker government "does not look like the inclusive and representative formation in terms of the rich ethnic and religious diversity of Afghanistan we hoped to see and that the Taliban were promising over the past weeks."The 27-nation bloc said the formation of an "inclusive and representative" transitional government is vital for its engagement with the Taliban.The Taliban also reportedly disbanded the Ministry for Women's Affairs, days after violently clamping down on women-led protests against curbs to their freedoms under Taliban rule.There are also no women in the new power structure, something protesters in Kabul had been calling for as women fear losing their hard-won rights.Faiz Mohammad Zalan, a lecturer at the University of Kabul, said that although the Taliban are predominantly Pashtun, they do not believe in appointing people on the basis of their ethnic affiliations."Basically, the Taliban wanted to put their most powerful leaders in charge of ministries to control the situation in Afghanistan," Zalan told DW.Dependence on international aidBut it won't be an easy task to "control" a multiethnic, war-torn, and impoverished country like Afghanistan.Protests have already erupted across the country, with anti-Taliban groups defying the new regime.The new Afghan rulers also need international aid, but certain prominent figures in the caretaker government have already angered Western countries.Some of the interim Cabinet members are accused of carrying out attacks on US forces over the last two decades.Akhund, the acting premier, is on a UN blacklist, while Haqqani, the acting interior minister, is wanted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.But Afghan journalist Yousufzai said the international community has no other option but to engage with the Taliban."I think the Western countries don't care who heads an Afghan ministry," Yousufzai said. "They will, however, keep a close eye on the government's policies."Even if the Taliban managed to keep their ranks united and avoid international sanctions, running the country will still prove to be a difficult task for them, said Ahmad Saidi, a former Afghan diplomat."Most Taliban ministers are uneducated and are not familiar with government affairs. Some interim ministers are still facing UN sanctions and won't be able to travel abroad," he told DW. "They still don't have a minister for health and a minister for commerce. We don't know what will happen to these government posts."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-the-taliban-govern-afghanistan-101631165506550.html
09-09-2021||World||Canada polls debate: Rivals target Justin Trudeau over Afghanistan policy||Foreign policy made its presence felt in the first official debate of the 2021 Canadian Federal elections as incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced attacks over Ottawa’s evacuation efforts in Afghanistan and its position on China. The French-language debate on Wednesday also witnessed Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole currently leading in surveys, assert a government led by his party will impose sanctions upon Chinese officials complicit in human rights violations in the Xinjiang province.Justin Trudeau came under criticism from each of the other party leaders over calling an election on August 15 just as the crisis in Kabul was developing. Erin O’Toole said that Canadian veterans of the country’s mission in Afghanistan had asked the government “months ago” for an action plan for evacuation of interpreters and other Afghans who had worked with Canadian units. “He ignored the problem and called an election,” Erin O’Toole said.New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh said that Canada’s “allies were simply left behind”, describing that outcome as “unacceptable”.Green Party leader Annamie Paul said her party had called for an emergency debate on Afghanistan in parliament but that never happened as Federal polls were declared.Justin Trudeau defended his government’s actions, saying it had acted “quickly” and evacuated 3,700 from Afghanistan and will continue to “be there” for those who were associated with the Canadian mission.China also figured in the debate, particularly in the context of the Uighur “genocide” in the Xinjiang province. Erin O’Toole promised that Magnitsky sanctions would be imposed upon Chinese officials found complicit in such human rights violations. Those sanctions, also enshrined in Canadian law, are named after Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky who was murdered in that country. “We need to have a more serious approach when it comes to China. Mr Trudeau has always mishandled this file,” the Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole said. Justin Trudeau was not asked to react to the China factor but was instead quizzed on why current American President Joe Biden had virtually ignored Ottawa since assuming office, a charge the PM denied.Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchett accused the Trudeau government of creating a situation where Canada’s “credibility has deteriorated” internationally.Much of the debate, held in the Canadian city of Gatineau in Quebec, focused upon domestic issues including the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and mandatory vaccinations, Indigenous issues, childcare and Quebec-focused themes.The debate was held as the ruling Liberal Party led by Justin Trudeau continues to trail the opposition Conservatives ahead of the Federal elections. The second official debate, in English, will be held on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-debate-rivals-target-justin-trudeau-over-afghanistan-policy-101631164125025.html

The Rodong Sinmun newspaper published a photo of Kim, wearing a cream suit, waving from a balcony toward the assembled troops and spectators. The reports didn't say if Kim made a speech during the event.North Korea often celebrates major state anniversaries by displaying thousands of goose-stepping troops and its most advanced military hardware in parades at Kim Il Sung Square. State television hasn't broadcast footage of the parade as of Thursday morning and it wasn't immediately clear what kinds of weapons systems were displayed. Previous night time parades were not aired live but a taped broadcast was shown on state TV hours later.KCNA's report came hours after South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it was closely monitoring the North after detecting signs of a military parade.Amid a stalemate in diplomacy with the U.S., Kim and his powerful sister have emphasized North Korea will boost its nuclear deterrent and preemptive strike capabilities while demanding that Washington abandon its “hostile” policies — a reference to the US maintaining sanctions and refusing to accept North Korea as a nuclear power.The military parade likely is a measured attempt at pressuring the Biden administration over the diplomatic freeze after Kim failed to leverage his arsenal for economic benefits during the Trump presidency.But experts say Kim is facing perhaps his toughest moment as he approaches a decade in rule, with North Korea maintaining a border lockdown indefinitely to keep out the coronavirus and with no prospect in sight to end international sanctions.Last month, Kim Yo Jong berated the United States and South Korea for continuing their combined military exercises, which she said were the “most vivid expression of the U.S. hostile policy.”She and another senior North Korean official threatened unspecified countermeasures that would leave the allies facing a “security crisis.”The allies say the drills are defensive in nature, but they have canceled or downsized them in recent years to create space for diplomacy or in response to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-parades-goose-stepping-troops-military-hardware-to-mark-nation-s-73rd-anniversary-101631162916867.html

It has independently supplied millions of doses of vaccines from its stockpile to countries around the world either directly or through the WHO-led Covax programme.“We are still planning the president’s schedule around UN General Assembly High Level week, but it is safe to assume we are actively looking at Covid-19 and public-health-centered options,” a senior administration official told The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity. “I would anticipate there will be an opportunity for the president to engage with his counterparts on this issue during the UNGA week.”The Joe Biden administration is trying to get a grip on the response to the pandemic, which has come unstuck in recent weeks belying the president’s key election promise of doing a better job of it than his predecessor. New infections and hospitalisation cases are surging, due mostly to the highly contagious Delta variant and people who have refused to be vaccinated because of political reasons or over suspicions about the efficacy of vaccines and their long-term side-effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-call-for-global-summit-on-covid-19-around-narendra-modi-visit-101631162685120.html

According to American news channel CNN, videos and images received from a protest site in Kabul on Wednesday showed the Taliban militants ferociously whipping women to break up a protest against the hardline all-male cabinet announced a day prior.Afghan women came together in capital Kabul on Wednesday to mark a bold challenge to the Taliban rule. This was the largest such protest since the militants assumed power, and experts believe the brutal crackdown was about sending a message about how things will be under the new regime.Also Read | Afghan woman stands face to face against Taliban armed man, image called ‘iconic’“They [the Taliban] hit with whips and they tell us to go to our homes and recognise and accept the Emirate,” a woman present at Wednesday's protest was quoted as saying in the video and reported by CNN. “Why should we accept the Emirate while no inclusion or rights have been given to us?”Multiple journalists covering the protests were also reported to have been assaulted in a similar manner.Marcus Yam, a journalist with the Los Angeles Times covering the protest, also confirmed that Taliban fighters were ready to strike protesters with whips. He said on Twitter: “While some tried to put their hands on me, there was one fighter that kept interfering and at one point muttered ‘foreigner’. There were others standing around with their whips ready.”They tried yanking my cameras off me, pushed me around, and out their hands on my lens. They asked me to delete photos and footage, I said no. I tried to make an audio recording of the encounter and they wanted to confiscate my phone. I said no.While some tried to put their hands on me, there was one fighter that kept interfering and at one point muttered “foreigner.” There were others standing around with their whips ready.Notably, the Taliban had promised to put on a more “moderate” face this time, with the new rulers vowing to respect women's rights in accordance with Islamic law. However, with the announcement of a new hardline regime, reports suggest that the Taliban have gone back to their usual ways.Also Read | To escape Taliban, here is what Afghan women were forced into doingA video shared by Afghan journalist Zahra Rahimi, a correspondent for Tolo News, on Twitter also showed a Taliban fighter ferociously cracking a whip against a woman present at the protest. The clip was shared multiple times on the social media platform by public personalities, who pointed out that the new Taliban regime was just as “barbaric” as the previous one and that all the promises of a ‘moderate’ regime were just a sham.This is Taliban 2.0, as barbaric as 1.0.

The world is with you @ZahraSRahimi💓 https://t.co/sm85b34oecNotably, the United Nations warned on Wednesday that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and the subsequent position of the new rulers on women's rights have generated an “incredible fear” across the country. “The lack of clarity of the Taliban's position on women's rights has generated incredible fear,” said Alison Davidian, a senior UN official. “And this fear is palpable across the country.”Pointing out that there were daily reports of the Taliban imposing restrictions on the rights of women, she said that the new rule is reminiscent of the previous Taliban regime in the 1990s when the Islamist rulers forbade women from working jobs or receiving education.The UN official said that women are being prevented from leaving their homes without a male relative, and in many other provinces, they are being forced to stop working. Protection centers for women fleeing violence and safe houses for women's rights activists, already at a full capacity, are also being targeted, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-used-whips-against-afghan-women-protesting-new-regime-report-101631155928305.html

Canada-based WestJet and United Airlines in the US have said employees who fail to get themselves vaccinated will face termination of employment.WestJet has asked all employees to get their vaccination status attested by September 24, or get fully vaccinated by October 30. The Onex Corp-owned airline said a full vaccination status would be mandatory for all future employees hired by the airline."As part of its vaccine mandate, the airline will not provide testing as an alternative to vaccination," the company said in a statement.United, on the other hand, has set September 27 as the deadline for its employees to get vaccinated. However, those whose bids for exemptions based on medical reasons or religious beliefs are denied will get five more weeks to get vaccinated, the airline said.After that, it added, they will face termination or unpaid leave.United said requests for medical exemptions will be judged by medical staffers including nurses, while requests for waivers based on religious beliefs will be handled by personnel-office employees.Workers who routinely come in contact with passengers, such as flight attendants, gate agents and pilots, and whose exemptions are approved will face indefinite unpaid leave starting October 2. They won't be allowed back on the job until the pandemic “meaningfully recedes,” according to one of the memos circulated by the Chicago-based company.United has taken the strongest pro-vaccination stance among US airlines. Delta Air Lines says it will levy a $200 monthly surcharge on unvaccinated employees who are covered by the company’s health plan. Others, including American Airlines, say they will cut off paid leave for unvaccinated workers who contract Covid-19.According to US government data, new infections are at their highest level since March and likely to rise into the fall as more people are hospitalised.The resurgence in Covid-19 cases has been spurred by the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant, prompting many companies to come out with mask mandates and change their vaccination policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unvaccinated-employees-to-face-unpaid-leave-or-termination-warn-2-airlines-101631157293670.html

These 18 officers from the Air Force Academy, the Military Academy, and the Naval Academy were considered to be allies of Trump, all of who had been named to the US military academy boards in the final months of the Republican president's term in office. The White House, however, insists that the move is not political and was instead taken on the basis of the ‘qualifications’ of the aforementioned personnel.Among those Biden removed are high-profile Trump advisors — like former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway (Air Force Academy) and former press secretary Sean Spicer (Naval Academy) — both of who were appointed just before the former president left office. Other officials include former national security adviser H R McMaster on the West Point board (US Military Academy), Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought (Naval Academy), and former White House liaison to the Justice Department Heidi Stirrup.These officials received a letter on Wednesday from Cathy Russell, director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, calling on them to resign by close of business on Wednesday or they would be terminated.White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the development and told reporters that the officials were forced out of their posts based on President Biden's “qualification requirements”.“I will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified, or not political, to serve on these boards,” Psaki said. “But the president's qualification requirements are not your party registration. They are whether you're qualified to serve and whether you are aligned with the values of this administration.”Meanwhile, several of those officials who were ousted from their posts pushed back against the decision.Conway, the former advisor to the president, said that it is in fact Biden who should resign. She went on in a statement to call it a “disappointing but understandable” effort to distract from the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, a rise in Covid-19 cases, and a ‘disappointing’ August jobs report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-ousts-trump-appointed-officials-from-military-academy-advisory-boards-101631152974606.html

Another former western intelligence official, who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity, said Jawad directed suicide networks and was “tight with Pakistan’s security establishment”.Rahmatullah Nabil, who served as head of Afghanistan’s spy agency, the National Directorate of Security (NDS), had in 2018 blamed Jawad, also known as Maulvi Zabiullah, of supervising the Al-Hamza Martyrdom Brigade, a training centre for suicide bombers. Nabil had said at the time that the suicide attacker who killed Abdul Raziq Achakzai, a police chief, was trained by the Al-Hamza outfit.Jawad was largely based in Peshawar at the time and had planned the killing of Raziq with Mullah Shireen, a member of the Taliban’s Quetta council, named after the Pakistani city where it is based.The Long War Journal, a website that tracks jihadi groups, had reported as far back as 2013 that Jawad was also a senior commander in the dreaded Haqqani Network and jointly led what was referred to as the “Kabul Attack Network” with another Taliban commander named Dawood, who was the shadow governor for Kabul.“The Kabul Attack Network operates in the capital and in the surrounding provinces of Wardak, Logar, Nangarhar, Laghman, Kapisa, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika.

Pointing out that there were daily reports of the Taliban imposing restrictions on the rights of women, she said that the new rule is reminiscent of the previous Taliban regime in the 1990s when the Islamist rulers forbade women from working jobs or receiving education.Also Read | To escape Taliban, here is what Afghan women were forced into doing“Memories are vivid of the Taliban's rule in the 1990s when there were severe restrictions on women's rights, and women and girls are understandably afraid,” Davidian said.Elaborating on the current reports of Taliban crackdown on women's rights, the UN official said that women are being prevented from leaving their homes without a male relative, and in many other provinces, they are being forced to stop working. Protection centers for women fleeing violence and safe houses for women's rights activists, already at a full capacity, are also being targeted, she said.Notably, the Taliban have promised to put on a more “moderate” face this time, with the new rulers vowing to respect women's rights in accordance with Islamic law. However, with the announcement of a new hardline regime, reports suggest that the Taliban have gone back to their usual ways. In an interview with Australia's SBS News, a senior Taliban official said women would not be allowed to play cricket - a popular sport in Afghanistan - or possibly any other sport because it was "not necessary" and their bodies might be exposed.Also Read | ‘Iconic’: Afghan woman stands face to face against Taliban armed manThe new Taliban cabinet, which was once promised to be formed in an inclusive manner, draws almost entirely from the ranks of the militants. It also does not include a single woman, and nor is there any mention of a ministry for women.In Kabul, dozens of women took to the streets again to demand representation and for their rights to be protected. In the Balkh province, too, a group of women held a protest earlier this week calling to preserve the achievements of the past 20 years and demanding women's representation in the future government in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-of-incredible-fear-among-afghan-women-as-taliban-rule-returns-101631149297414.html

Just like last year’s event, the current edition, too, will take place virtually due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, making it the second straight BRICS meeting to be held via videoconferencing.Also Read | Taliban takeover in Afghanistan to figure at BRICS meet chaired by PM ModiThe theme for this year’s programme is “BRICS@15: Intra BRICS Cooperation for Continuity, Consolidation and Consensus.” India’s chairmanship of this year’s summit coincides with the 15th anniversary of the grouping which initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India and China. South Africa became a member in 2010.This year's summit comes amid the prevailing situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban seized power last month. The situation in the war-torn nation is, therefore, likely to be among key global and regional issues which are taken up for discussion. “Leaders are likely to underscore the priority of fighting terrorism, including preventing attempts by terror groups to use Afghanistan as sanctuary to carry out attacks against other countries. The participating countries are also likely to emphasise the need to address the humanitarian situation and to uphold human rights, including those of women, children and minorities,” officials told news agency ANI.India has highlighted four priority areas for its presidency of BRICS: reform of the multilateral system, counter-terrorism cooperation, using digital and technological tools to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and enhancing people-to-people exchanges. “In addition to these areas, the leaders will exchange views on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global and regional issues,” the ministry of external affairs said in a statement.Also Read | BRICS Countries adopt counter-terrorism action plan ahead of summitAt the summit, PM Modi will be joined by Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, Russian president Vladimir Putin, Chinese president Xi Jinping and South African president Cyril Ramaphosa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-to-chair-13th-brics-meet-today-101631146560669.html

Labour force participation rate for all ages in urban areas also saw an increase, as per the survey. It was at 7.3 per cent in the October-December quarter of 2020, up from 37.2 per cent in the same period a year ago.The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force, while labour force refers to the part of the population which supplies or offers to supply labour for pursuing economic activities for the production of goods and services and therefore, includes both employed and unemployed persons.The periodic labour force survey was launched in 2017. The quarterly survey gives an insight into labour force indicators namely unemployment rate, worker population ratio, labour force participation rate, distribution of workers by broad status in employment and industry of work in current weekly status etc.Eight bulletins of the periodic survey corresponding to quarters ended December 2018, March 2019, June 2019, September 2019, December 2019, March 2020, June 2020 and September 2020 have already been released.

Chief minister MK Stalin announced the extension of the ban, which has been imposed on top of the existing Covid-19 restrictions in the state until September 15."கொரோனா நோய்த் தடுப்பு நடவடிக்கைகளை தீவிரப்படுத்த, திருவிழாக்கள், அரசியல், சமூகம் மற்றும் மதம் சார்ந்த கூட்டங்களுக்கு ஏற்கனவே விதிக்கப்பட்டுள்ள தடை அக்டோபர் 31-வரை நீட்டிப்பு" என மாண்புமிகு தமிழ்நாடு முதலமைச்சர் @mkstalinஅவர்கள் அறிவித்துள்ளார் pic.twitter.com/F5yDWznXDHIn its order, the TN government expressed concerns that such events (festivals, political, social and cultural gatherings) could become potential super spreaders of Covid-19. The high caseload in neighbouring Kerala and the advent of Nipah virus have also been factored in making the decision, the order showed. The state referred to a report by the Union ministry of home affairs which had warned that a third wave is highly possible during the months of September and October.The order assumes significance as the Ganesh Chaturthi festival is set to be celebrated on September 10. While the DMK government has banned public installation of idols and celebrations across the state, K Annamalai, leader of the state’s BJP unit, has said that the party would celebrate the festival by placing deities outside the gates of 100,000 homes.

However, in view of the pandemic, the government had denied permission for any processions and allowed individuals to take the deities from their homes and dissolve them in nearby water bodies. The people were also advised to place them in nearby temples, after which the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HRCE) department in the state would arrange for dissolving them methodically.In the state capital Chennai, the shore has been completely locked down for immersing the idols, especially in the stretch between Santhome and Napier Bridge.With reference to the spread of Covid-19 and the recent Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, the TN government said that surveillance has been bolstered in bordering districts and buses to Kerala have also been suspended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-extends-ban-on-festivals-till-oct-31-says-events-could-become-covid-super-spreaders-101631205103622.html
09-09-2021||India||Vaccine inequality across districts is high, but it is decreasing||Is there vaccine inequality across districts? This analysis has been constrained by the non-availability of population data by districts. Such numbers are only available in census figures, which are now ten years old. The first part of this two-part data journalism series built alternative estimates of India’s adult population across districts by using the 2019 electoral roll. The second and concluding part will track vaccine inequality as a dynamic variable across districts and try and understand how it has evolved over the course of India’s Covid-19 vaccination programme. It will also try and chart out the possible trajectory going forward. Inequality was increasing across districts until June, but it is coming down now The best way to measure inter-district vaccine inequality is by looking at the gap between districts which have performed well and those which have not. Individual comparisons, such as the gap between best and worst districts, can be misleading here. This is because such districts can be outliers. HT has looked the share of vaccinated population by classifying all districts into quartiles (from bottom 25% to top 25%) for each day of vaccination. The comparison shows that inter-district vaccine inequality in terms of share of vaccinated population with at least one dose has almost continuously decreased. This comparison starts from April 1, which is when India opened vaccination for everyone over the age of 45. First dose coverage in the bottom three quartiles has almost consistently caught up with the coverage in the top 25% districts. The coverage in bottom 25% districts was 26% of the coverage in top 25% districts on April 1 and is now 43% of the coverage in the top 25% districts. Chart 1: First dose vaccination coverage quartile-wise The inequality in second doses has decreased less consistently than for first doses. On April 1, coverage in the bottom three quartiles was at 25.76%, 40.53%, and 59.82% of the coverage in the top quartile. This gap increased for the bottom three quartiles at different rates initially. From July 2, inter-district vaccine inequality started coming down for all three bottom quartiles for the population which has received both doses as well. Chart 2: Second dose vaccination coverage quartile-wise Weight for laggard districts in overall population is higherWhile declining inequality is a welcome development, it is still quite high. What makes the challenge even more important is the fact that laggard districts have a bigger share of population than their top-performing counterparts. For example, the bottom 25% of districts (in terms of first dose coverage as on September 5) had a share of 32.5% of the total adult population. This number was just 17.3% in the top 25% of districts. The same trend holds as far as median vaccination coverage is concerned. Districts below the median mark have 59% of the country’s adult population. See Chart 3: Weight of population in each quartile by vaccination coverage Have districts pulled up or slipped down drastically? Have districts performing badly in the initial phase of vaccination shown a drastic improvement and vice versa? This is a possibility, theoretically speaking. Our analysis shows that this not very likely. Of the 157 districts which have been in the bottom quartile (by share of population which has received at least one dose), only two (Morigaon and Lakhimpur in Assam) have managed to make it to the top quartile so far. The reverse also holds true. Only two districts (Janjgir Champa and Koriya in Chhattisgarh) among the 157 districts which have been in the top quartile have fallen to the bottom quartile. In coverage of first doses, 336 of 628 districts were in the same quartile on September 5 as they were on April 30 (a month after vaccination was opened up for all adults). Among the rest of the districts, 232 have jumped only one quartile (112 going up; and 120 going down). Only 56 districts have jumped two quartiles (30 up, 26 down). Projecting inter-district inequality in vaccinations, going forwardHow will vaccine inequality look like if the current pace of vaccination in districts holds? Exact projections for the first two charts shown above would have been possible if the breakup of first doses by manufacturer was available. This is because the two major vaccines, Covidshield and Covaxin, have different waiting periods between the first and second dose. However, the number of total doses administered per 100 adults can tell us about the pace of vaccine administration in different districts. Here too the gap is decreasing currently. The bottom quartile has (adjusted for population) administered doses amounting to 40.3% of top quartile. If the pace in all districts remains the same as the pace in past 15 days, this will increase to 42.3% in the next 15 days and to 43.1% in the next 30 days. This is the concluding part of a two-part data journalism series on district-wise vaccination coverage in India. The first part built district-wise adult population estimates and used them to look at district-wise and rural-urban inequality in vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-inequality-across-districts-is-high-but-it-is-decreasing-101631204574281.html
09-09-2021||India||DRDO to develop new early warning jets for IAF under ₹11,000 crore project||India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on Wednesday cleared a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) proposal to develop new airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft for the Indian Air Force using Airbus jets bought from Air India, people familiar with the developments said on Thursday. The project is estimated to be worth around ₹11,000 crore, said one of the officials cited above. It was cleared along with the much-delayed purchase of 56 C-295 medium transport aircraft to replace the IAF’s ageing fleet of Avro-748 planes. The C-295 project is estimated to be worth ₹22,000 crore. The IAF inducted its first indigenously developed AEW&C system, mounted on a Brazilian Embraer-145 jet, in February 2017, beefing up its capability to detect enemy aircraft and missiles. The Netra AEW&C system was developed by the DRDO and has a range of around 200 km. The new AEW&C system, most likely to be mounted on the Airbus A321 aircraft, is expected to be more advanced than the Netra system, the official said. Currently, two Netra systems are in service. The IAF also operates three Israeli Phalcon airborne warning and control system (AWACS) mounted on Russian IL-76 heavy-lift planes. The system has a range of 400 km. The IAF needs more such systems to cover the eastern and western sectors during offensive operations, experts have said. The approval for the new AEW&C jets comes at a time when government has sharpened its focus on promoting self-reliance in the defence manufacturing sector and positioning itself as an exporter of military hardware. Airbus Defence and Space and Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) will jointly execute the C-295 project to equip the air force with the new transport aircraft under the Make-in-India initiative in the aerospace sector. Airbus will supply the first 16 aircraft in flyaway condition while the remaining 40 will be assembled in India by TASL. In the last one year, the government has imposed a ban on the import of 209 defence items that will be implemented progressively from 2021 to 2025. AEW&C systems are covered under that ban. From raising foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence manufacturing to creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware and notifying two lists of weapons/equipment that cannot be imported, the government has taken a raft of measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector over the last two years. Other than AEW&C systems, the 209 weapons and systems that cannot be imported include artillery guns, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, light combat aircraft, long-range land attack cruise missiles, basic trainer aircraft, specified types of helicopters and next-generation corvettes. India has set aside ₹70,221 crore this year for domestic defence procurement, accounting for 63% of the military’s capital budget. Last year, the ministry spent over ₹51,000 crore, or 58% of the capital budget, on domestic purchases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-to-develop-new-early-warning-jets-for-iaf-under-rs-11000-crore-project-101631202114793.html

It received regulatory approvals to conduct the second and third phase trials of the intranasal vaccine, BBV154, in August. Bharat Biotech's nasal vaccine clinical trial's principal investigator is Dr Sanjay Rai.The Phase 1 medial trial was conducted on health groups volunteers in the age group of 18-60. In a statement earlier, the ministry of science and technology said the vaccine was "well-tolerated" by the volunteers. The vaccine is being developed with support from the department of biotechnology (DBT) and Biotechnology Industry Research Associate Council (BIRAC).According to Bharat Biotech's website, the nasal route for the vaccine has "excellent potential for vaccination due to the organised immune systems of the nasal mucosa." It will also be easier to administer and will not require trained health care workers. The nasal vaccine will also eliminate needle-associated risks such as injuries and infections. "It is ideally suited for children’s and adults," the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/initial-findings-from-biotech-s-nasal-vaccine-show-promising-results-govt-101631200941143.html

No steel will be used in the construction, the report said.The temple campus will include a museum, a research centre a gaushala and a yagya shala. Special focus will be on the conservation and development of heritage structures like Kuber Tila and Sita Koop. The entire temple complex has been designed on zero discharge concept and green building features, the report said.As of now, the excavated area is being filled with 'Engineered Fill' in 48 layers to ensure the structural longevity of the temple. The construction will be based on the zero discharge concept and green building features. "About four lakh cubic feet of stone (Bansi Paharpur) will be used in the construction of the temple. No steel will be used in the construction of the temple. It has been decided to use Jodhpur stone for the Parkota (complex) of the temple. The plan to enable devotees to have darshan of Lord Shri Ram by the year 2023 seems within reach," an insider told PTI.The design of the structure is in full compliance with Central Building Research Institute norms. It was developed by the institute only after a computerised simulation for any earthquake track of 2,500 years, the report said.VHP national general secretary Milind Parande earlier said that the foundation of the temple will be completed by the end of this month and the first week of October this year.

09-09-2021||India||BRICS leaders adopt resolution, calling for peace in Afghanistan||Amid the escalating crisis in Afghanistan, leaders of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries adopted a "New Delhi Declaration" on the war-torn country, calling for refraining from violence and settling the situation by peaceful means. The leaders also called for an inclusive intra-Afghan dialogue to ensure stability, civil peace, law and order in Afghanistan. The summit was chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and saw participation from his counterparts -- Vladimir Putin of Russia, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro. The meeting was also attended by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.This comes in the backdrop of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan after the US and its NATO allies withdrew from the country, leading to the collapse of the government. "The withdrawal of the US forces and its allies from Afghanistan has led to a new crisis in Afghanistan," said the Russian President, while noting, "it is still unclear how this will affect global and regional security."Speaking at the virtual summit, Putin also said, "It is for good reason that our countries have paid special attention to this issue."Advocating for Afghanistan which has been ravaged by the years of war that has killed thousands of locals and plunged the country into a major humanitarian crisis, Putin also said that he wants the "world stay away from their internal affairs and respect their sovereignty". "The citizens of this country have fought for decades and deserve to exercise the right of defining what their state will look like on their own," he noted.Meanwhile, PM Modi in his opening remarks said the BRICS platform has been useful for focussing attention on the priorities of the developing countries. "Today we are an influential voice for emerging economies of the world. This platform has also been useful for focussing attention on the priories of the developing nations as well," he said.The theme for the Summit is 'BRICS@15: Intra-BRICS cooperation for continuity, consolidation and consensus'. The summit this year coincides with the 15th anniversary of the BRICS.The BRICS brings together five of the largest developing countries of the world, representing 41 per cent of the global population, 24 per cent of the global GDP and 16 per cent of the global trade. This was the second time Prime Minister Modi chaired the BRICS summit. Earlier, he had chaired the Goa summit in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brics-leaders-adopt-resolution-calling-for-peace-in-afghanistan-101631198584408.html

Defence minister Rajnath Singh described the capability as a “game changer” in air defence.India and Israel have jointly developed MRSAM or the Barak 8 air defence system that includes advanced radar, command and control systems, and mobile launchers. The missile is powered by a locally-developed rocket motor and control system for high manoeuvrability in the terminal phase.“With the handing over of the MRSAM system to IAF, we have taken a giant leap towards achieving ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India). The MRSAM will prove to be a game changer in air defence,” Singh said at the induction ceremony in Jaisalmer.The system has been developed jointly by the Israel Aerospace Industries and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Other firms involved in the project include Israeli firm Rafael, Bharat Electronics Limited, Bharat Dynamics Limited and Larsen & Toubro.DRDO chief G Satheesh Reddy handed over the first firing unit of the system to IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria in Singh’s presence.“The system is capable of hitting multiple targets simultaneously up to a range of 70 km, even in bad weather. Its success in a string of stringent tests is a proof of its reliability,” the defence minister said.A naval version of the MRSAM is already deployed on a few Indian warships to boost their anti-air warfare capabilities. The army too has placed orders for the MRSAM but it has not yet inducted the system. India and Israel have inked separate deals worth around $3 billion over the last four years for advanced surface-to-air missile systems for the three services.“The MRSAM system was long-awaited. Its induction now will boost the IAF’s air defence capability significantly. The impending arrival of the S-400 missile defence systems from Russia will make those capabilities even more formidable,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), former additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.India is set to soon begin induction of the S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems ordered from Russia in October 2018. New Delhi has placed orders for five such missile systems capable of destroying a variety of aerial threats, including enemy fighter jets and missiles, at a range of 400 km, and expects the first deliveries by the year-end.Singh said MRSAM was one of the best missile systems available globally and the project highlighted the close partnership between Indian and Israel in the defence sector. The minister said the MRSAM project strengthened the defence industrial bases of both India and Israel, and was “a win-win situation” for both countries. It has also led to the creation of new test facilities and other infrastructure in the country, he said.Israel has been among India’s top three arms suppliers during the last five years, according to a report published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) in March 2021. India’s top three arms suppliers during 2016-20 were Russia (accounting for 49% of India’s imports), France (18%) and Israel (13%).Singh said geo-political changes impacted trade, economy, power politics and the security scenario. “In such a situation, strengthening our security and self-reliance has become a necessity, not an achievement.”The minister said the global scenario was transforming very fast. “Equations between countries are also changing rapidly according to their interests. Whether it is the South China Sea, Indian Ocean Region, Indo-Pacific or Central Asia, uncertainty can be seen everywhere,” Singh said.The MRSAM induction ceremony took place after Singh and minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari jointly inaugurated an emergency landing facility for the IAF on the Satta-Gandhav stretch of NH-925A near Barmer. The two ministers also witnessed aircraft operations on the new landing facility, which supports landing of all aircraft in the air force’s fighter and transport fleets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-inducts-barak-8-air-defence-system-that-can-hit-multiple-targets-70km-away-101631198455089.html

Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma ordered the move following a spot inspection of Wednesday’s accident site between Nematighat in Jorhat district and Kamalabari in Majuli district. “All single engine private boats are banned from plying immediately. Those who want to switch to marine engine will be provided with ₹10 lakh each or 75% subsidy by Majuli district administration,” he said. “From now four ferries of inland water transport department will operate between both banks of the river. Ro-pax (roll on-roll off passenger ferries) ferries would also serve passengers and we are bringing two more passenger vehicles from Guwahati,” Sarma added. The accident took place around 4 pm on Wednesday when the smaller boat on way from Nematighat to Kamalabari hit the bigger one operated by inland water transport department coming from the other side. The private boat, which was carrying 92 passengers, capsized within minutes killing a 28-year old college lecturer. While 89 passengers were rescued and accounted for two are still missing. There was no major damage to the bigger boat and none of its passengers were injured. Sarma directed the Jorhat administration to file a criminal case on the accident. He said a high level inquiry would also be ordered. On Wednesday, three officials of inland water transport department were suspended following the accident. The CM ordered rescheduling of boat timings and directed regular monitoring by magistrates. A new set of guidelines on operating passenger boats would be issued soon. “Construction of the proposed bridge connecting Nematighat and Majuli will begin from November this year and would be completed within four years,” Sarma informed. Search operations continued on Thursday to trace the two missing passengers of the capsized boat. “We resumed our rescue operations from 6:00 am on Thursday. On Wednesday night, we had located the capsized boat, which had flowed several kilometres downstream. Our team cut a portion of the overturned boat to look for missing persons, but no one was found there,” informed Hari Ram Yadav, assistant commandant, 1st battalion, NDRF-Assam. The opposition Congress on Thursday targeted the BJP-led-government in the state for failing to take adequate preventive and safety measures that resulted in the boat accident. The party accused the BJP of laying the foundation stone of the Jorhat-Majuli bridge twice (once in 2016 and again in 2021) without even starting work. “We’ve had enough of ‘bhumi pujans’ and foundation stone laying ceremonies. Instead of focussing on such steps, the BJP governments at the Centre and Assam should concentrate on development and making lives of people safer,” Assam Congress president Bhupen Borah said in Guwahati while addressing a press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-bans-single-engine-pvt-boats-after-brahmaputra-accident-search-on-for-missing-101631197254484.html

Singh made the remarks during his address at the event to induct the Medium Range Surface to Air Missile (MRSAM) system into the Indian Air Force (IAF).“Today the global scenario is changing very fast, and in an unexpected way. In this, the mutual equations of countries are also changing rapidly according to their interests. Whether it is South China Sea, IOR or Indo-Pacific or Central Asia, uncertainty can be seen everywhere,” Singh said. He cited the recent changes in Afghanistan, where the Taliban rapidly seized power, as one such example to the fast-changing global scenario.Also read | Rajnath Singh inaugurates emergency landing strip for IAFThe minister further said that such conditions made self-reliance in India’s security measures a necessity and not a mere achievement. “The impact of changing geo-politics can also be seen on trade, economy, power politics and in turn the security scenario. In such a situation, the strength and self-reliance of our security becomes a necessity, not an achievement,” he said.Further stressing on the need for self-reliance, the minister said that defence modernisation is the government’s priority with the changing times. “Our defence modernisation is our priority with the changing times, we are continuously moving forward towards that. You will be aware that many such policy decisions have been taken in the recent few years, which take us towards not only modernization but also towards self-reliance in the long term,” he said.Calling the MRSAM "one of the best state-of-the-art missile systems available in the world today,” Singh handed it over to the IAF at the Air Force Station in Jaisalmer. He hailed the day as “very special” for the air force and also the entire defence sector. He further said that the missile is capable of hitting multiple targets simultaneously up to a range of 70 kilometres even in bad weather. “Its success in many stringent tests is a testament to its reliability,” he added.During his address, Singh also said that he believed that the missile system would be a game changer in the country’s air defence system and also called its induction a great example of the steps towards self-reliance in the defence sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/selfreliance-in-defence-necessity-due-to-fast-changing-global-scenario-rajnath-singh-at-mrsam-induction-101631192455175.html

In a press meet in Delhi, Niti Aayog member for health, Dr VK Paul informed that 18% of the adult population have been administered both doses of the jab, while 58% have received the first dose. "It should be 100%. No one should be left behind... those left should get administered to develop herd immunity," said Paul. The Niti Aayog official also informed that the first dose of vaccine is “96.6 per cent effective in preventing death" and two shots are 97.5 per cent effective. The government cited data between April and August to support the statistics, as they urged people to get vaccinated. Meanwhile, the cumulative number of total Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country so far has crossed 72 crore on Thursday, the official also mentioned.The Centre also said that the country is still going through the second wave of Covid-19 and "it is not over yet.""As many as 35 districts in the country are still reporting a weekly Covid positivity rate of over 10% while in 30 districts it is between five-to-ten per cent," the officials informed.About resuming physical classes in schools, the government officials said no scientific body or evidence suggests that vaccination of children should be a condition for reopening schools. "This criterion is not acceptable anywhere in the world, no scientific body, epidemiological evidence suggests it as a condition...However, vaccination of staff is desirable," Paul also said.India rolled out its vaccination drive in January, since then the country has been inoculating beneficiaries at a record pace. "The pace of vaccination and coverage is rapidly increasing," said Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary, adding, "The average per-day dose administered has increased from 20 lakhs in May to 78 lakhs in September."Bhushan also said that the number is expected to climb even higher in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18-of-adult-population-have-received-both-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-centre-101631190915150.html

Bhushan also cautioned that the country is still in the throes of the second wave, and it is not over yet.“43,263 reported in the past 24 hours, over 32,000 from Kerala. Almost 68% of total cases in last week were from Kerala. We're still witnessing the second surge, it's not over,” Bhushan said at a media briefing.In terms of fatalities, Kerala reported 181 deaths on Thursday against India’s single day death toll of 338. However, till date the highest number of fatalities has been recorded by Maharashtra.Also Read: What Kerala learnt from third outbreak of Nipah virusThe southern state’s latest jump in Covid-19 cases comes after a week-long decline in the daily tally of cases.

A total of 1,71, 295 tests were conducted in the previous 24 hours, of which 30,196 turned out to be positive, bringing the test positivity rate (TPR) to 17.63%.“It is natural that cases will go up once tests are increased. The state should have increased tests a couple of months back,” public health expert Dr SS Lal told Hindustan Times.The Kerala unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that more than half the tests conducted were antigen tests instead of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, which was once considered to be the ‘gold standard’ of Covid-tests by the health ministry.In cities like Delhi, which witnessed a brutal second wave, 70% of the total tests conducted to identify infected patients in the last five months were RT-PCR tests, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-accounts-for-68-59-of-india-s-covid-19-cases-says-health-ministry-cautions-second-wave-not-over-101631191319953.html

This strain is deadlier and often cause haemorrhage. It also impacts the platelet count. "The only prevention is to stop the breeding of mosquitos. Dengue is also a deadly disease," ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargava said. This dengue outbreak was reported from Ferozabad, Mathura and Agra in Uttar Pradesh, while mosquito-borne diseases overall are on the rise across the country, the health ministry said."We must have adequate preparation to fight dengue and malaria, apart from Covid as these cases are on the rise and also because of the monsoon season. We must cover ourselves and use mosquito repellant, mosquito nets and should not allow mosquitos to breed," Niti Aayog chairman Dr VK Paul said."Do not take any fever lightly. Be it malaria, dengue or Covid. Our focus should not move from Covid, but dengue can be deadly too and there is no vaccination. It is also difficult to tell who is more susceptible to dengue. And then there is no vaccination," Dr Paul added.After Uttar Pradesh, dengue and viral fever cases rose in Delhi as well. As per the data released by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, 73 cases of dengue were reported in August. The number of dengue cases recorded this year (125) is the highest since 2018. Around 27 cases of the other mosquito-borne disease, malaria and 32 of chikungunya, have also been reported in Delhi so far this year. "1,100-1,200 patients are coming in the medicine department, while 400-500 patients are coming to the children's OPD every day. Some viral cases are also coming from the NCR area; patients from areas like Ghaziabad, Noida are also coming to LNJP after being referred here," Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Loknayak Jaiprakash Hospital said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-districts-saw-outbreak-of-d2-dengue-says-health-ministry-urges-caution-101631190677176.html

Under this 100-day target, we have three main foundations — infrastructure, policy targets and reforms initiative,” Scindia said at the meeting.The minister announced that four airports would be made operation or developed optimally under the 100-day plan. The Centre has allocated ₹255 crore to make Kushinagar airport in Uttar Pradesh operational and landing and take-off of Airbus 321 Boeing 737 flights.“Kushinagar is not only important for Uttar Pradesh but also the entire country, as it is the hub for the Buddhist tourism circuit,” Scindia said. The minister said a new terminal will come up at Dehradun airport in Uttarakhand, to facilitate passenger capacity from the existing 250 to 1,800 after the Centre pumped in ₹457 crore for its revamp.He also said that Agartala airport will also be upgraded to increase its capacity from 500 passengers per hour to 1,200 per hour at an estimated cost of ₹490 crore.The civil aviation minister said a new airport at Jewar in Uttar Pradesh will come up and the government has earmarked ₹30,000 crore for it. The airport is expected to have a capacity of two crore passengers every year.“In the first phase, ₹9000 crore will be invested and capacity will be increased to 1.2 crore passengers every year. By the fourth phase, the passenger capacity will be expanded up to seven crore,” he said, adding that, “Jewar and Delhi airports will emerge as the country's futuristic transit hubs.”Last week, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority inked a pact with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to prepare a feasibility report of a metro rail corridor to link Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport and the proposed airport at Jewar In Noida.The minister said the six new heliports would be developed in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand under the regional air connectivity scheme Udan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100day-plan-for-india-s-aviation-sector-know-what-it-has-to-offer-101631186670576.html
09-09-2021||India||Kanhaiya Kumar denies joining Congress, meets party leaders||CPI leader and former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar has denied rumours that suggest he is planning to switch over to Congress following his meeting with a few Congress leaders. “There is no truth in it. I am in mainstream politics and am a member of a registered national party. When in politics, one interacts with so many people. Currently, I am in Delhi to attend the party’s national executive,” said Kanhaiya, while talking to HT.People aware of the development within the Congress say that Kanhaiya had met Rahul Gandhi twice in the recent past. “Prashant Kishor was present during both the meetings. Negotiations are in the final stages,” claimed a Congress leader from Bihar, wishing not to be named. Kanhaiya however, denied any such meeting. “What has fanned the rumours is my photograph with Congress leader Nadeem Jawed with whom I had lunch recently in Delhi. Nadeem Jawed is a former National President of NSUI, former General Secretary of Indian Youth Congress, former National President of Congress Minority Cell and Media Panelist. He posted our photographs on social media. As far as Prashant Kishore is concerned, we have been interacting often after my defeat in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019,” said Kanhaiya. There has been speculation in political circles about Kanhaiya switching sides after a censure motion was passed against him in the CPI meeting held at Hyderabad in the last week of January for indiscipline. The censure motion was taken up after Kanhaiya’s supporters had roughed up Indu Bhushan, the office secretary, in the party office at Patna on December 1. Local leaders said Bhushan was attacked because the Begusarai district council meeting had been postponed and Kanhaiya had not been informed about the change.Congress leaders in the know said that Nadeem, former Congress MLA from Jaunpur has been given the responsibility of convincing the former JNU Students’ Union president and they had had several rounds of conversation. Congress, which is losing ground in Bihar, is now desperately looking for leaders who can instill confidence in the party fold. Congress got 10 seats in the February 2005 assembly elections, which came down to 9 in October 2005. In the 2010 assembly elections, the Congress had to be content with just four seats. In the 2015 assembly elections, when the Congress became a part of the grand alliance with RJD and JD-U, the party won 27 seats. However, their tally again came down to 19 in the 2020 assembly polls. At the same time, in the Lok Sabha elections 2019, Congress got just one seat in Bihar. The Congress has been eyeing Kanhaiya since last year when the CPI leader organized his Jana Gana Mana rally in Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on February 27. What surprised people was the presence of two Congress leaders -- MLAs Shakeel Ahmad Khan and Awadhesh Singh--- who shared the dais with him. Khan, a former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Students’ Union president like Kanhaiya, insisted later that their presence there was only to support the cause as the rally was part of a campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed-then-denied National Register of Citizens (NRC.To drive home his point that he was not getting close to Congress, the former JNU president cited the example of his meeting with the Bihar CM earlier this year. “When I met Nitish Kumar and a JD(U) minister earlier this year, there was speculation that I was joining JD(U). Why should I when they are in alliance with the BJP,” he reasoned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-jnu-president-kanhaiya-kumar-denies-joining-congress-101631187527240.html

09-09-2021||India||Supreme Court refuses change of centre for NEET-PG exam||The Supreme Court on Thursday turned down a plea by nine doctors for a change of examination centres for the upcoming National Eligibility Entrance Test- Post Graduate (NEET-PG) test on Saturday on account of Covid-19 restrictions and the fact that some of them were required to visit states where Covid-19 cases were still on the rise.Convincing the doctors to shed their fears, the bench of justices UU Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi said, “Today people are travelling everywhere. You go to the airport, every flight is completely booked.”Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, appearing for the doctors, said that one of the petitioners was posted at Varanasi for Covid-19 duty where Covid-19 situation is largely under control and had to appear for the NEET-PG test in Kerala. “At this time there won’t be too many people travelling to Kerala which is recording a surge in Covid-19 cases on a daily basis,” Arora said. Other petitioners too were required to travel inter-state between Delhi, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.The bench said, “With so many people being vaccinated, the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic is not as it was earlier. Life is going on as usual.”Arora pointed out that these are young doctors on Covid-19 duty who had exercised the option of their centres before March 15 based on the nearest centre to the area of their posting. The exam was scheduled for April 18 and was postponed to September 11 by a notification dated July 13.Four out of the nine petitioners had to travel either inside or outside of Kerala. The petition filed through advocate Charu Mathur said, “Those currently located in the state of Kerala and travelling long distances to reach the centre will not only expose themselves to the virus but will also be a health hazard for thousands of others. Further, most of the candidates will travel along with their parents to the examination centre and thus their parents will be severely exposed to the deadly virus.”Arora further stated that considering the Covid-19 surge in Kerala, the top court had recently put off the Class 11 physical examinations scheduled to start from September 6. She pointed out that the window for registration and opting centre was opened from August 16 to 25 for those candidates who became eligible under the Government decision to provide 27% quota for other backward classes (OBC) and 10% quota to economically weaker sections (EWS) in 50% of all India quota PG medical/dental seats. “See the absurdity of providing the option to those who registered in August but not for us,” Arora submitted.The bench said, “We had made an exception a week back for two doctors who were in their seventh and eighth month of pregnancy, allowing them a change of examination centre in view of their difficulty to travel. But in your case, you were well aware of the examination being held. We will dismiss your petition.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-change-of-centre-for-neet-pg-exam-101631184826426.html
09-09-2021||India||Will 3rd wave of Covid-19 hit India: Top expert answers||The chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) Dr NK Arora on Thursday elaborated on a range of issues concerning the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in India.The chief of the Covid-19 working group said that the country is witnessing around 30,000-45000 cases of coronavirus infection every day for the past several weeks, especially from Kerala and some northeastern states and a few districts of Maharashtra. “If we follow the genomic analysis of SARS-COV-2 viruses circulating during June, July and August, no new variants have emerged and on the basis of sero-survey conducted during July, the ongoing Covid-19 cases represent the susceptible individuals who are not yet immunised. They are affected as part of the last phase of second wave,” Dr Arora said.In the last serosurvey conducted in July, between 66% and 70% of the people were found to be infected with the Covid-19 virus, signalling that around 30% of the people are still prone to infection. The health expert said these set of people can get infected at any time, if they are unvaccinated. “Hence any complacency on the part of any of us throughout the country will cost hugely since the 30% people can be infected and many of them can develop severe diseases, like we witnessed during April and May this year,” Dr Arora said.He stressed that following Covid-appropriate behaviour is both essential and critical, especially during the upcoming festive season. He cautioned that the emergence of new mutation around this time can contribute to the arrival of the third wave of Covid-19.Efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines against Delta variantThe effectiveness values we see in media mostly refer to the effectiveness against symptomatic disease, Dr Arora said, highlighting that it is “generally 60-90% for different vaccines.”“Most of the vaccines are not adequately effective in preventing Covid-19 infection and, therefore, it is repeatedly emphasised that even after vaccination, the person can spread the infection,” the expert said. He stressed the need for maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour.The most important value of the Covid-19 vaccines is their effectiveness to prevent severe disease, need for hospitalisation and death. All the vaccines currently available in India and elsewhere are over 90-95% effective for protecting the beneficiary from severe disease and death. Can an affected person donate plasma?Dr Aroraa said research by ICMR revealed that plasma therapy was not useful for most patients with severe Covid-19 infection requiring hospitalisation.Similar studies from other parts of the world have failed to prevent death or reduction in hospital stay. It for these reasons, the ICMR has removed plasma therapy as part of the treatment guidelines for severe Covid-19 infection, Dr Arora said.“Having said that, if someone is infected, there will be generation of antibodies in their body along with cell-based immunity. Antibodies are measurable and can also be called as visible immunity. The cell-based immunity can also be termed as invisible immunity and as important as antibodies. These immunity components prevent disease and severity when such person gets re-infection with Covid-19,” Dr Arora said.Recently an antibody mixture was introduced in the market by a company, but that did not show much benefit, he said. This antibody mixture also was based on the principle of plasma therapy. It was observed that if plasma or antibody is given to the patient in first week or early part of infection, then there can be some benefit.A paper published recently mentions that if someone has got natural COVID infection and has recovered, then the immunity of that person will protect him for long duration and in case if such person also takes vaccine, then the individual has a double barrelled protection against infection and the disease.What about booster dose?The requirement of booster dose in our country cannot be decided on the basis of the situation and decisions taken in western countries, the NTAGI chief said.“Local evidence based on the studies done in different parts of the country will guide the need for our people. This will be considered in the context when 70% to 80% of the population in our country is already infected. Overall a considerate decision will be taken based on the best available scientific evidence with the overall objective to provide optimal protection to our people,” Dr Arora said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-3rd-wave-of-covid-19-hit-india-top-expert-answers-101631175710269.html

Cant point fingers since most countries that claim to uphold Sharia have failed to imbibe its true values. They are only fixated with restricting women through do’s & dont’s, dress codes etc,” Mehbooba Mufti tweeted.On Wednesday, Mufti said the Islamist militant group must follow the ‘real’ Sharia law, which comprises women’s and children’s rights.“If they follow [the real Sharia law] and govern Afghanistan accordingly, then they will be able to share business relations with other countries of the world,” she was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The PDP president said Thursday that in the history of Islam there have been examples of empowered women.“Hazrat Khadija Tul Kubra, Prophet SWA first wife was an independent & successful business woman. Hazrat Ayesha Siddique led the Battle of Camel & headed a force of 13000 soldiers. Islamic history is full of such examples of emancipated & empowered women,” Mufti said.Mehbooba Mufi said that India has become polarised. “But at a time when India has become so polarised, there is increasing Islamphobia & Afghanistan crisis has only worsened it.Muslims are always expected to prove that they don’t stand for violence.

09-09-2021||India||What Kerala learnt from third outbreak of Nipah virus||Kerala health officials hit a blind alley in 2018 when Nipah virus first broke out in Kerala since there was no known treatment for the disease, but three years later they were better prepared when the zoonotic virus revisited for the third time. Though it claimed the life of a 12-year-old boy last Sunday, reports from ground zero suggest its threat is receding fast.“We are really relieved that other than the index case, no other infection has been reported so far. We will strengthen our surveillance and speed up efforts to pinpoint the source of infection,” said state health minister Veena George, adding that the lessons from the 2018 outbreak helped the administration contain it quickly.But the origin of the virus and its carrier are still unknown as was the case in the earlier two outbreaks-- 2018 in Kozhikode when 17 lives were lost and 2019 in Ernakulam when a youth was saved after long hospitalisation.Experts say the state will have to formulate a proactive strategy to face the increasing threat of recurring zoonotic diseases and not wait for the outbreak to act. The state needs to strengthen its surveillance system backed by enough scientific studies, they say.They point to the initial confusion to buttress their point. When the Nipah-infected boy was rushed to the government medical college hospital in Kozhikode on Aug 30, he was diverted to a private hospital without conducting any tests or diagnosis, merely on the pretext that there was no ventilator to spare.As was the case during the 2018 outbreak of the virus, a private hospital, Malabar Institute of Medical Sciences, sent the boy’s samples to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for testing, which helped in the virus’ early detection. Now, state health minister Veena George has ordered a probe into alleged lapses on the part of the medical college hospital.“Yes, we have learnt many lessons on the curative side, but are yet to learn enough surveillance lessons. The boy was in four different hospitals before he was admitted to the MIMS. In an epidemic, surveillance is the key, but we become alert only after the onset,” said Dr SS Lal, a public health expert who worked with the World Health Organization.He said that while 70% of the health sector is in the hands of the private sector in the state, the government still keeps it in the dark and attempts to hijack all credits for political reasons.Unlike 2018, when the virus was diagnosed after four deaths, this time the boy’s status as Nipah positive was confirmed hours before his death, allowing for quick contact tracing, route mapping and sealing of the area around his residence. “I was unconscious for more than 10 days and heard about Nipah for the first time in life when I was about to be discharged. We have a robust health system and committed workers. And this really helped contain the scourge this time,” said M Ajanya, a nurse, first Nipah patient to be cured in 2018.After the first outbreak, many promises such as setting up of a high-end animal testing lab, virology institute, a scientific study on bats (chiropterology) and a treatment protocol for separate zoonotic diseases, were made. Experts say most of these were yet to be met.“The most important is to find out how the boy got infected and whether it is the index case. Since zoonotic diseases recur frequently, we need an integrated team of experts from all fields to study it,” said Dr NM Arun, an internal medicine expert.Experts add that though the fruit bats are considered to be the main carriers of Nipah virus, a clear link or interface between bats and human beings is yet to be established.Experts said that Covid containment protocols such as masking, physical distancing and no overcrowding also helped the state blunt the impact of Nipah. “Covid-19 protocol and its prevention techniques came in handy for containing Nipah also.Unlike earlier incidents, we have to identify the source of the virus to check its further outbreak,” said another public health expert Dr Padmanabha Shenoy. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, at least 70% of Nipah infections can be fatal.“Zoonotic diseases are here to stay. We need a permanent single window mechanism for early detection and warning to prevent outbreak of such diseases. More research is also needed in the area,” said Dr Prejit Nambiar, a teacher at the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, who specialises in zoonoses and food safety. He said a close interaction is necessary between medical experts, veterinary professionals, environmental scientists and wildlife professionals to tackle this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-kerala-learned-from-3rd-outbreak-of-nipah-virus-101631175945802.html

Despite COVID,we constructed 38 kms road per day,highest in the world. 2nd is construction of 2.5-km 4 lane road in 24 hrs on Mumbai-Delhi express highway. 3rd refers to construction of 26-km single lane road from Bijapur to Solapur in a day:Nitin Gadkari pic.twitter.com/pR2AUeHzrmSpeaking about three world records, Gadkari said, “Despite (the prevalence of) Covid-19, we constructed 38km of road per day -- highest in the world. Second is the construction of a 2.5-km 4-lane road in 24 hours on the Mumbai-Delhi express highway. The third refers to construction of a 26-km single lane road from Bijapur to Solapur in a day,” the Union minister said.Also read | Rajnath Singh in Rajasthan; IAF to get MRSAM missile, landing strip on highwayGadkari  further said the defence ministry had his department’s full support in building an airport in the area. “There's no airport here in an area of around 350km. I told CDS Bipin Rawat that we can give land to build a defence airport and a civil airport nearby. They have our full support and will take guidance from Air Force authority,” he added.The Union minister said three helipads have been constructed in Kundan Pura, Singhaniya and Bakasar villages of Rajasthan according to the requirement of the forces.Earlier, a Hercules C-130J plane of the IAF, carrying Gadkari, defence minister Rajnath Singh and Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat, conducted a mock emergency landing on the national highway. NH-925 is India's first national highway to be used for emergency landing of IAF aircraft.The defence minister said a total of 20 emergency landing strips, similar to the one in Barmer, were being developed across the country. The strips would also help in relief operations during natural disasters, he added."Many helipads are also being built with the help of the Union Roads Ministry. This is an important step to strengthen our security infrastructure," he added.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has developed the 3-km section of Satta-Gandhav stretch of NH-925 as an ELF for the IAF.Singh said, "By creating a strip so near the international border, we have given a message that we will stand up for unity, diversity and sovereignty of our country at whatever the cost."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-s-promise-to-iaf-chief-airstrip-in-15-days-instead-of-1-5-years-101631174667787.html

Except for Puducherry, the polling exercise in states will constitute bypolls as members of Parliament (MP) from four states resigned for various reasons while the representative from Maharashtra, Rajeev Satav, passed away in May due to post-Covid complications.Also Read | Congress MP Rajeev Satav dies of post-Covid complications in PuneAs per the schedule announced by the poll panel, votes for all five states and Puducherry will be cast on October 4. The counting of votes will take place on the same day. The elections were necessitated as the term of N Gokulakrishnan, who represents Puducherry in the Council of States, will end on October 6, while MPs from Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu (two members) and West Bengal stepped down from their posts.Among those who resigned, Bengal’s Manas Ranjan Bhunia joined chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet, while Biswajit Daimary from Assam, who was elected to the House earlier this year, became Speaker of the Assam legislative assembly. In Tamil Nadu, KP Munusamy and R Vaithilingam, were elected as members of the Tamil Nadu assembly. Finally, from Madhya Pradesh, former Union minister Thawarchand Gehlot was appointed as the governor of Karnataka by president Ram Nath Kovind.Also Read | Union minister Thaawarchand Gehlot appointed Karnataka Governor, says will live up to expectationsThe detailed schedule for the elections can be accessed on the Election Commission’s website or by clicking here and here.

They serve a term of six years each. The Upper House is different from the Lok Sabha in that MPs are not elected directly by voters, but by elected members of state legislative assemblies. Also, unlike the Lower House, the Rajya Sabha is never dissolved as one-third members retire after every two years and polling is held to fill up the vacancies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-polls-in-puducherry-6-states-on-october-4-101631173910045.html

He stressed that several careers in the near future would require a holistic knowledge of diverse fields.In his address at the event, Naidu remarked, “My appeal to parents is to encourage and infuse in children curiosity for arts, literature and social sciences from a young age. In a race to make it to the top national institutions of science and engineering, we are ignoring essential subjects in school such as languages and social sciences. In addition, rote learning practices will ruin the creative abilities of a child. We must rather produce engineers, doctors and scientists, who come up with innovative solutions to the challenges faced by humanity.”Naidu called for a revival of the liberal arts and their integration with the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) curriculum. He added that exposure to arts and social sciences nurtures creativity, critical thinking, and social awareness and leads to better teamwork and communication skills among students. These qualities are in high demand in the 21st century where no sector of the economy works in a silo, he mentioned. Naidu highlighted that India has had a culture of holistic education since ancient times, and noted that the National Education Policy 2020 further strengthens holistic education. The Vice President lauded the efforts of colleges like IIT Bombay, which has recently introduced an interdisciplinary undergraduate course that includes liberal arts, science and engineering in one programme. He suggested that other institutions must explore providing such multidisciplinary courses.Furthermore, Naidu emphasised the importance of updating students from the humanities background with the latest technological developments, so that they are able to effectively apply this knowledge in their research studies. “While technical institutions should integrate arts into their curriculum, students from the arts and humanities background should be given options to gain exposure to scientific disciplines such as computing, artificial intelligence and other such frontier areas. They must be abreast with the latest technological developments and skillfully apply these advances in their own research work,” he said. Naidu suggested that such centres should encourage innovative research in social sciences by encouraging and enabling diverse voices. He suggested that scholars in the social sciences should work closely with the practitioners and policy-makers to get a better understanding of social issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-should-be-greater-multidisciplinarity-in-higher-education-vice-prez-naidu-101631163525091.html

The university said employees should “abstain from giving any type of provocative lectures or statements that are anti-national and will be against the interests of the nation” failing which strict action would be initiated against the individuals concerned.The circular, signed by registrar Rajendra Pilankatta of the Kasargod-based university, was issued on September 2, a report in The Indian Express said.The move came in the wake of the suspension of an assistant professor whose comment on the Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) created a controversy earlier this year.The professor Gilbert Sebastian had allegedly described saffron outfits and the Narendra Modi government at the Centre as proto-fascist during a lecture for first-year post-graduate students on “Fascism and Nazism” on April 19. The report said the professor of the Department of International Relations and Politics was also allegedly critical of the Union government’s decision to export Covid-19 vaccines and called the move unpatriotic.Vice chancellor H Venkateshwarlu has said the latest directive was brought in considering previous controversies that had led to unnecessary resentment on the campus.“We expect the faculty members to stick to their curriculum. To deviate from it and express their views or political opinions will create unnecessary resentment or friction among the students and workers,” he was quoted as saying in an article in The Hindu.He further said students may continue to express their views and opinions on issues during open debates or seminars, but faculty members need to refrain from such acts and stick to their curriculum in classes.Meanwhile, Gilbert, whose suspension was revoked after he offered an explanation, has reportedly written to the VC against an executive council meeting that said he had “given a letter of regret, withdrawal of the utterances he made in the class; and future assurance of not repeating.’’Stating that the minutes on withdrawal of his suspension was unacceptable to him, the professor said, “What I had expressed in the letter was clearly a non-admission (of) regret since my views in the class have been misconstrued by others. What I withdrew was any incidental remarks. EC’s observation that my ‘statement in the class was anti-national’, (was) uncalled for and regrettable as it is an unfounded allegation.”The executive council had earlier also expressed concern over the VC’s decision to withdraw Gilbert’s suspension order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stick-to-curriculum-no-provocative-lectures-kerala-varsity-to-faculty-members-101631161137350.html

The court’s observation came while hearing a plea filed by an environmental NGO, the Goa Foundation, challenging the decision of the Goa Public Works Department (PWD) to pursue the construction of a paved road leading up to the falls. The bench, comprising justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar, said that besides regular annual repairs, all other works proposed by the PWD “ought not to proceed until the final disposal of this petition or until the respondents obtain necessary approval from NBWL (National Board for Wildlife), whichever is earlier.”“From the material placed on record, at least prima facie, the CWW (Chief Wildlife Warden) has not considered whether such a project is necessary for the purpose of PA (protected area). Rather, the material on record, prima facie, suggests that the project is mostly to cater to almost 4.5 lakhs tourists that visit the Dudhsagar Waterfalls by using the existing kutcha road,” the order read. The Goa government had embarked on the project to upgrade the existing kutcha road into an all-weather road usable throughout the year, in the second week of August. The project involves replacing the kutcha road surface with lateritic soiling with murram duly compacted and laying interlocking pavers over a 15 cms bed of cement and concrete. The project also involves providing cross drains, ramps, parking bay, retaining walls, culverts, crash barriers and random rubble masonry. Besides these, the project involves providing a toilet block and guard room among others at a cost of ₹31 crore or thereabouts, covering a stretch of approximately 12 kms. “This can hardly be regarded as routine repair or maintenance works on the existing kutcha road. For an integrated project of this nature, at least prima facie, approval from NBWL is necessary,” the high court observed. “In such matters, the precautionary principle will have to be applied because the damage to the eco-sensitive PA (protected area) will be much greater if the proposed works proceed without any approval from NBWL. Since there is no bar to undertaking routine repair and maintenance works to the kutcha road as are undertaken every year, even the balance of convenience is not in favour of the respondents,” the bench noted. In its affidavit, the state forest department claimed that since the road was being repaired and is not a fresh project, it does not have to go through the normal procedures laid down by the Supreme Court and to have the project approved by the State Board for Wildlife and thereafter, by the standing committee of NBWL.The present route to Dudhsagar is closed between June and October as it becomes non-motorable during the monsoons which, the Goa Foundation argued, offers “the wildlife and forest a much needed breather of at least five months due to the monsoon and the turbulent nature of the Dudhsagar River.” That, the petitioner added, will be lost if the all-weather road is allowed to be completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-stays-road-project-leading-to-goa-waterfall-until-wildlife-board-s-nod-101631151816170.html

He will review the operations, attend the MRSAM induction ceremony and also interact with the IAF personnel stationed in Jaisalmer.This is the first time that a national highway (NH-925) will be used for emergency landing of IAF aircraft.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has developed a 3-km section of Satta-Gandhav stretch of NH-925A, as an emergency landing facility (ELF) for the IAF. It is part of a newly developed two lane paved shoulder of Gagariya-Bakhasar and Satta-Gandhav section having a total length of 196.97 km. The project will cost ₹765.52 crore under the Bharatmala Pariyojana.In October 2017, fighter jets and transport planes of the IAF had conducted mock landings on the Lucknow-Agra Expressway to show that such highways can be used by the IAF planes for landing in case of an emergency.The Lucknow-Agra Expressway is a state highway and comes under the Uttar Pradesh government.Apart from the Emergency Landing Strip, 3 helipads (size 100 x 30 metres each) have been constructed in Kundanpura, Singhania and Bakhasar villages in this project, according to the requirements of the Air Force/Indian Army, which will be the basis for strengthening the Indian Army and security network on the western international border of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-1st-emergency-landing-strip-on-highway-to-be-inaugurated-in-barmer-today-101631151180602.html

Announcing on Sunday that the Prime Minister will be hosting the Paralympians this week, Union minister for youth affairs and sports Anurag Thakur said that Modi has always had a “vision” for inclusive participation in sports, so creating more opportunities for specially-abled athletes was a part of that idea.“He [the Prime Minister] had hosted the Olympians when they arrived in India, and now he is going to host the Paralympians as well,” the sports minister later told reporters, adding a congratulatory word for all the medallists this year. He pointed out that in 2016, the contingent for the Paralympics was 19 and now in 2021, the country's para-athletes managed to win 19 medals.The 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo was held from August 24 to September 5 this year entirely behind closed doors due to the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation. Just like the Olympics, the multi-sports event was branded as Tokyo 2020 despite being delayed a year due to the pandemic.Although India's athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Paralympics since 1984, the event this year proved to be the most successful Paralympic season for the country yet, with the athletes securing a total of 19 medals - five gold, eight silver, and six bronze. Before this edition, India had won 12 medals (4 medals of each colour) in all previous Paralympics appearances combined.India at the 2020 Summer Paralympics saw several firsts - archer Harvinder Singh became the first Indian to win a medal in Archery, and Avani Lekhara scripted history by becoming the first Indian to win a medal in Shooting. She also became the first woman from the country to win a gold medal and become a multiple medalist at the Paralympics. Para-athlete Sumit Antil also set a new world record with a 68.55-metre Javelin throw this year, also winning a gold medal in the process.“It clearly shows that India has done well,” minister Anurag Thakur said. “Our medal tally has increased by about five times. It is a big achievement.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi has personally spoken to every Paralympian who won a medal for the country. He said on Sunday that India’s historic medal haul in the Tokyo Paralympic games would remain etched in the memory of every Indian and motivate generations of athletes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-host-india-s-paralympics-stars-today-mark-most-successful-season-yet-101631144469995.html

It is a part of state government's ambitious 'Medicine From The Sky' project.In a statement, the K Chandrashekhar Rao government said that the trial flights will be conducted from September 9 to October 10 at Vikarabad (Hyderabad).On the first two days, the drones will be flying in the visual line of sight - between 500 and 700 metres from the base - and people present in the area will be able to see them with the naked eye, the government said in the statement.From September 11 onwards, drone flights will take place Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) - for 9-10 km distances. These flights will be with consignments of vaccines, medical samples and other healthcare items, the statement further said.BVLOS drone flights are those that go beyond 500-700 metres from the eye's vision or beyond the visual line of sight.This will make Telangana the first state in the country to start trials of Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone flights for delivery of Covid-19 vaccines, the state government said.The Centre too had recently taken initial steps towards delovering Covid-19 vaccines through drones. In June, HLL Infra Tech Services Limited, on behalf of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), invited expression of interest for delivery of medical supplies (vaccines/drugs) by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) at select locations in India.The company said that ICMR will engage UAV operators to operate BVLOS in fixed pre-defined or pre-approved flight paths and deliver Covid-19 vaccine.Earlier this year, the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) and directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) granted conditional exemption to ICMR for conducting feasibility study of Covid-19 vaccine delivery using drones. The ICMR chose IIT-Kanpur as its partner for the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trial-run-of-delivering-vaccines-by-drones-to-begin-in-telangana-from-today-101631147307228.html

According to an official, the programme will be launched by Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and his deputy Prahlad Singh Patel. An expert agency has been hired to carry out the Swachh Survekshan Grameen, 2021, which will be launched under phase two of the Swachh Bharat Mission. The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation had commissioned the 'Swachh Survekshan Grameen' in 2018 and 2019.The ministry said 17,475 villages in 698 districts of the country will be covered by the Swachh Survekshan Grameen. Around 87,250 public places, such as schools, Anganwadi centres, public health centres, markets, religious places will be visited for the survey, it said.Around 1,74,750 households will be interviewed for their feedback on Swachh Bharat Mission-related issues.

The protesters are pressing for the repeal of three controversial central laws on agriculture.Three rounds of talks between farmers and the government had failed on Tuesday, after which thousands of protesters pitched tents and sat down outside the mini secretariat building. They remained there on Wednesday.The district administration invited the farm leaders for talks at 2 pm to end the standoff. “We are demanding both FIR against the IAS officer and his suspension,” Rakesh Bains, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Haryana) spokesperson, who was part of the 11-member farmers team, said.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said the talks that lasted three hours remained inconclusive but added that negotiations will continue.“Farmers were demanding action against the former Karnal SDM (Ayush Sinha), but how can action be taken without holding an inquiry?” he asked, urging the farmers to keep their protest peaceful.But the farm leaders blamed the administration. “The talks completely failed because the government is adopting an adamant attitude,” said Yogendra Yadav, a member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, after the three-hour meeting. He said the government was not ready to suspend the IAS officer, let alone register a case against him.The farmers have vowed to not lift the blockade till the government lodged a case of murder against SDM Ayush Sinha, who was caught on tape allegedly telling policemen to “break heads” if protesters crossed the line during a rally on August 28. They also want him suspended. Sinha has since been transferred and posted as additional secretary of Citizen Resources Information Department (CRID), as per a government order.Karnal is the home constituency of Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, who defended the August 28 police action that left some farmers injured and allegedly caused the death of one protester – a charge denied by the administration.The farm leaders alleged that the government was shielding Sinha. “It seems that the IAS officer posted in the CM’s city was obeying some special directions,” Yadav said.On August 28, around 10 protesters were hurt in clashes with police in Karnal as farmers tried to march towards the venue of a BJP meeting, in which the chief minister and other senior state leaders were present. Farm leaders claimed that a protester died later, an allegation rejected by the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnal-stir-to-mirror-delhi-agitation-rakesh-tikait-101631143359436.html
09-09-2021||India||In Kerala, 46 suspected samples found negative for Nipah||Forty six people with symptoms of Nipah were found negative on Wednesday; said Kerala health minister Veena George in Kozhikode adding the north Kerala district was almost out of danger of a serious outbreak. The minister said samples of all close contacts of the dead boy, including his parents and health workers, turned negative but the government will maintain a strict vigil for three more weeks. Since a majority of immediate contacts are negative for the infection she feels the worst is over. “It is a great relief that all samples turned negative so far. But we will not lower our guard. All restrictions will be in force till the window period of the virus (3 weeks) is over,” she said.She said going by the preliminary reports bats are suspected to be the main carrier but more studies needed to pinpoint the triggering agent. Many experts said the affected areas are also infested with wild boars and their samples will also be taken for testing. A team from the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory from Bhopal which arrived in the city will co-ordinate more such studies, she said. Forest Minister A K Saseendran, also camping in the north Kerala city, said special permission will be granted to capture boars and other wild animals for testing. Samples of domestic animals and pets were also taken to weed out suspicion, he said. Experts said strict protocol in place due to Covid-19, like masking, physical distancing and no overcrowding, helped the state to blunt the impact of the zoonotic disease again. “Due to Covid-19 protocol this time Nipah transmission will be limited. Prevention technique of Covid-19 really helped in fighting Nipah also,” said immunologist and public health expert D Padmanabha Shenoy. Many experts like him said the main source of the virus should be identified at any cost to check its further outbreak. This is the third time the state is witnessing the onset of the virus in four years. In 2018 it claimed 17 lives in Kozhikode, in 2019 a youth was infected in Ernakulam but was later cured and in 2021 it claimed the life of a 12-year-old boy in Kozhikode. Zoonotic diseases on the rise Amid the third onset of Nipah, recurring zoonotic diseases at regular intervals continues to worry people in Kerala. Several cases of Kyasnur forest disease, avian influenza, swine flu, anthrax and Nipah were reported from the state in recent years. Besides taking lives, such outbreaks affect social and economic mobility of people and cripple their lives_ culling of poultry, ducks and other domestic animals are regular to check their transmission. Experts have asked the government to formulate a multi-disciplinary approach to tackle such diseases and establish high-end labs for early diagnosis. They said zoonotic diseases will stay here as human activities continue to disturb natural habitat and the state needs a single window approach to tackle such maladies. “It is a fact zoonotic diseases appear at regular intervals in Kerala. Human and animal dependence, directly or indirectly, is more these days. We need a permanent single window mechanism for early detection of such diseases and early warning to the people. More research is also needed in the area,” said Dr Prejit Nambiar, a teacher at the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, who specialised in zoonoses and food safety. He said a close interaction is necessary between medical experts, veterinary professionals, environmental scientists and wildlife professionals to tackle this. Many wildlife experts feel that such diseases can be checked by putting in place an effective surveillance mechanism and scientific disease management plans. In Kerala there are enough wetland and water bodies, a favourite habitat of avian guests and they can easily transmit diseases to domestic birds. “Animals like civet cats have almost turned urban as their natural habitat shrunk. Once found in forests only, peacocks are found in countryside in large numbers. Loss of habitats force monkeys, civets, bats and boars to human habitat so it is natural such diseases arise,” said wildlife expert Dr P S Esa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kerala-46-suspected-samples-found-negative-for-nipah-101631139407506.html

This is the first time that a National Highway will be used for emergency landing of aircrafts of IAF, according to an official release. NHAI had developed a 3.0 km section of the Satta-Gandhav stretch of NH-925A as an Emergency Landing Facility (ELF) for the Indian Air Force, which is part of a newly developed two lane paved shoulder of Gagariya-Bakhasar and Satta-Gandhav section having a total length of 196.97 km. The project will cost ₹765.52 crore under the Bharatmala Pariyojana. This project will improve connectivity between villages of Barmer and Jalore districts located on the international border. The stretch being located in the western border area will facilitate the vigilance of the Indian Army.Apart from this Emergency Landing Strip, three helipads (size 100 x 30 metres each) have been constructed in Kundanpura, Singhania and Bakhasar villages in this project according to the requirements of the Air Force/Indian Army, which will be the basis for strengthening the Indian Army and security network on the western international border of the country. The ELF was constructed in a time span of 19 months. The work for this ELF commenced in July 2019 and was completed in January 2021. At normal times, the ELF will be used for smooth flow of road traffic. But during the operations of ELF for Indian Air Force, the service road will be used for flow of road traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthans-barmer-gets-emergency-landing-facility-on-satta-gandhav-stretch-101631136523028.html
09-09-2021||India||Spike in viral fever cases triggers fear in Bihar||An early spike in viral infection in children has triggered panic among parents, who are rushing to hospitals with their wards, after two recent child deaths at a village in Saran sparked fears of a possible onset of the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, said officials monitoring the situation. Government medical teams, comprising doctors, including microbiologists and phlebotomists to collect blood samples were dispatched to Gopalganj and Siwan on Wednesday. Doctors from the integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) unit on Tuesday visited Muzaffarpur, which has witnessed a spike in admission of children with viral fever. The state surveillance officer took stock of the situation at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) and the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), both in Patna, on Wednesday. The state health department has directed all medical colleges and hospitals to prepare a list of viral infection cases at their facilities on a daily basis, said officials quoted above. Officials were also on the lookout for a quack who administered an injection to two children, suffering from fever and abdominal pain, leading to their death at Sirsha village in Amanaur block of Saran district on Monday. “We have around 50-60 cases of respiratory diseases due to viral infection out of the 90-95 children admitted in our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), which has a capacity of 102 beds, said Dr Gopal Shankar Sahni, professor and head, department of paediatrics at the Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur. On Tuesday, 10-15 neonates were adjusted in the PICU, instead of keeping them in the “warmer” or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which resulted in having more number of patients than beds available in the PICU, said another senior paediatrician at the SKMCH. All 84 beds in the paediatric unit of Patna’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) were full on Wednesday. These included 22 beds of NICU, 15 of PICU and eight in the paediatric emergency. A day before, 87 children were admitted as against 84 beds available. “We have an additional 42 beds for paediatric Covid-19 patients in the maternal child health building, where total 106 beds are dedicated for Covid-19 patients. We may shift some children there in case of a surge in cases of viral fever. We do not have any Covid-19 patients for the last five days,” said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, professor and head of paediatrics and also the medical superintendent of the NMCH. There was an increase of 21% in admission of patients to the paediatric ward through the outdoor patient department (OPD) on Wednesday, as compared to admissions on August 31, said Dr IS Thakur, medical superintendent, PMCH, the oldest medical college in the state. The PMCH paediatric ward was almost full. “As many as 165 of our 190 beds in paediatrics department are occupied. The remaining 20-25 beds are reserved for clinical viva-voce of MBBS medicos, whose examinations are underway,” added Dr Thakur. Around 80% beds in the paediatric unit were occupied at AIIMS-Patna, said its professor and head, Dr Lokesh Tiwari. “As many as 42 of the 48 beds in wards; 10 of the 12 beds in PICU and two of the eight beds for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are occupied. However, this is nothing unusual, as 70%-80% bed occupancy is the usual norm at our institute throughout the year. We have all kinds of patients, including 4-5 of respiratory illness,” said Dr Tiwari. As many as 24 cases of acute respiratory illness cases were reported at the Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) at Bettiah. “We have 30 beds and are making arrangements for another 39 beds,” said Dr Pramod Tiwari, medical superintendent of the GMCH. Two similar cases have also been reported at Motihari, said Dr Anjani Kumar, civil surgeon of East Champaran district. The 76-bed pediatric ward of the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) was overcrowded with children admitted during last four days with suspected viral infections. A surveillance team has collected samples for testing. The doctors, however, unequivocally said there was nothing to worry and that the manifestation of viral fever in children was an annual feature. “The onset of viral fever in children has been slightly early this year, but it has nothing to do with Covid-19. It normally begins before the onset of winter. The viral infection is acute bronchiolitis, which is associated with wheezing and cough and in a few cases fever and dengue. The infection is not at all fatal, but the fear of an anticipated third wave of Covid-19 is making parents panic and rush to doctors,” said Dr Nigam Prakash Narain, a retired professor and head, paediatrics, PMCH and former vice-president of the national Indian Academy of Paediatricians. “The infections are of four types — bronchiolitis, which affects children less than two years of age, and is caused either by respiratory syncytial virus or para-influenza virus; flu-like illness, dengue and adenovirus (2-3 weeks of severe cough with vomiting),” added Dr Nigam. First JE case in 2 years The state reported its first case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in the last two years when 11-year-old Prahlad Kumar, son of Lalji Ram of Ramnagar village in West Champaran was admitted to the SKMCH on Tuesday. The condition of the patient was said to be serious.

09-09-2021||India||India, EU to start formal talks on FTA this month, says EAM S Jaishankar||Progress has been made on the resumption of the India-EU free trade agreement negotiations and the formal talks would start this month, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday.Addressing the Annual Meeting of Romanian Diplomacy, Jaishankar stressed that the strategic convergence between India and the EU is reflected in their positions on key regional and global issues, including on Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific. There was a landmark summit this May between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the 27 leaders of the European Union in Portugal and one of its important outcomes is the resumption of FTA negotiations that have remained stalled since 2013 from the time of the previous government, he said."Not just that there has already been some progress in that regard and actually the formal talks start this month," Jaishankar said.India and the European Union had announced in May the resumption of talks for a free trade agreement, eight years after its suspension, and agreed to launch negotiations for two key pacts on investment protection and geographical indications."We have also agreed to conclude early an investment agreement, and one on geographical indicators. The India-EU connectivity partnership is also important for its bilateral implications, its quality connotations and its third country possibilities," Jaishankar said.Asserting that India's economic weight and political influence has already grown substantially, he pointed out that India is a member of the G20, a non-permanent member of the Security Council, of the EAS, BRICS, SCO, QUAD, SAARC, BIMSTEC and IORA ."So there is a long list out there. In our own vicinity, the Neighborhood-first policy pursued since 2014 has strengthened connectivity, contacts, and commerce. India's growth is a tide lifting the larger region in the quest for prosperity," he said.Jaishankar said that towards South East Asia and beyond, the 'Act East' policy has added security, connectivity in greater societal context to a robust economic partnership.This has now further developed into what has become known as an Indo-Pacific Vision that contemplates opportunities much more seamlessly, he said."To the west, a link-West outlook has actually transformed our ties with the Gulf states and fashioned a strategic construct that goes beyond energy, trade and the diaspora. To the South, the 'SAGAR Maritime initiative' has taken an integrated view of cooperation with various islands, and littoral states, with Africa an ambitious development partnership and a larger footprint," Jaishankar said."I'm sure that this will be duly noted by Romanian diplomats. Between our national and EU engagements, there is every reason to be optimistic about our continued cooperation," he said.The Covid-19 pandemic has clearly made all nations of the world much more aware of external risks and vulnerabilities and it has raised questions about the centralised aspects of globalisation, and highlighted the importance of trust and transparency, Jaishankar said.An issue that has emerged strongly on the global agenda, is the requirement for resilient and reliable supply chains, he noted.India and Romania have a significant convergence in our outlook of the world and of its contemporary challenges, the external affairs minister asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-to-start-formal-talks-on-fta-this-month-says-eam-s-jaishankar-101631127711528.html
09-09-2021||India||BJD MLA Prasanta Jagdev accused of assaulting BJP leader in Odisha; suspended||BHUBANESWAR: The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) on Wednesday suspended its Chilika legislator Prasant Jagdev from the party hours after he allegedly beat up a BJP leader over the distribution of assistance for building houses and ration cards near Chilika lake.Jagdev, who has courted controversies over his strong-arm tactics, allegedly thrashed BJP’s Niranjan Sethi when he protested delays in the distribution of cards under the National Food Security Act and assistance for construction of houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in Balugaon area of Khurda district. Jagdev also attacked a photojournalist and snatched his mobile. A video clip of the incident was circulated widely on social media platforms.A one-line announcement from the BJD president Naveen Patnaik followed.“Shri Prashanta Kumar Jagdev, MLA, Chilika Assembly Constituency is hereby suspended from Biju Janata Dal with immediate effect,” Patnaik’s order said.Later Prasanta Jagdev was also removed from the post of president of Khurda district’s planninng committee.“Prasanta Jagdev pounced on me like a goonda (ruffian),” Sethi told reporters. Following the incident, scores of BJP workers staged a dharna in front of the Balugaon police station demanding the arrest of the BJD legislator.In August last year, Jagdev was accused of misbehaviour with a junior engineer with the Chilika Development Authority when he stayed at the authority’s Scientist Hostel. The MLA was allegedly inebriated when he threatened engineer Jagabandhu Sahu after an altercation.In December 2018, Prasanta Jagdev allegedly threatened former Begunia sarpanch Naba Swain at the block office in the presence of district officials. The protesters alleged that though Swain lodged a complaint against Jagdev on January 4, no action was taken against the MLA.Earlier in November 2016, he allegedly flung a kerosene lantern at the woman tehsildar of Bolgad when she was mapping a plot of land. In July 2016, Prasanta Jagdev and his supporters were accused of assaulting BJP activists over showing black flags to the then food supply minister Sanjay Kumar Das Burma in Boudh district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjd-mla-prasanta-jagdev-accused-of-assaulting-bjp-leader-in-odisha-suspended-101631130702610.html
09-09-2021||India||Inter-caste marriage: SC grants protection from arrest to man||New Delhi: The Supreme Court Wednesday granted protection from arrest to a man accused of kidnapping a woman who married him against the wishes of her parents.A bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S Oka noted that the application filed by the man seeking pre-arrest bail was pending before the Calcutta High Court since April, 2021 and despite his best efforts the plea could not have been taken up for hearing.The top court said that ordinarily, if an application is pending before the High Court for seeking pre-arrest bail, there was no occasion for this Court to interfere in the instant petition under Article 32 of Constitution.“But looking in the facts brought to our notice that the petitioner nos.1 and 2 have solemnised their marriage and documentary evidence is on record, petitioner no.1 is on family way and the FIR which has been registered under Section 365 (kidnapping or abduction with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person) of Indian Penal Code on December 12, 2020, the apprehension of the petitioner no.2 (man) certainly cannot be doubted,” the bench said.The apex court said that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case and taking note of the material on record, it was of the considered view that the man, at this stage, needed indulgence of this court.“Accordingly, we direct that petitioner no 2 (man) shall not be arrested in reference to the FIR registered under Section 365 of IPC for a period of three months and we request the High Court to consider the application for pre-arrest bail filed at his insistence for early hearing,” the bench said.The apex court granted liberty to the man to file an application for further extension of time before the High Court in pending.The top court was hearing a joint petition filed by a woman and her husband contending that they both are major and have solemnised their marriage on December 8, 2020.Since it is an inter-caste marriage it is not acceptable by the parents, they said adding that due to this reason, an FIR under Section 365 of IPC has been registered at the behest of the father of the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intercaste-marriage-sc-grants-protection-to-man-101631130223742.html
09-09-2021||India||States to take call on door-to-door Covid vaccination: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday left it to the states to decide on implementing door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination, saying that a general order cannot be issued for the entire country considering the diversity of conditions across states.The court was hearing public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Youth Bar Association of India seeking door-to-door Covid vaccination for all citizens, particularly the elderly, special persons with disabilities, the less privileged and weaker sections of society, and those who were unable to register online.While directing the petitioner to approach the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) with their suggestions, the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli said, “The vaccination programme is already underway and has progressed considerably. At this stage, it is difficult for us to issue general directions having regard to the diversity of conditions existing in the country. Any direction by us should not impinge upon the administrative power of the state governments to take any decision, including door-to-door vaccination.”In July, the Bombay high court asked the Maharashtra government to consider providing door-to-door vaccination for the elderly and those bedridden or wheelchair-bound.The top court said it was aware of the Bombay high court order but reminded the petitioner, “These are not matters where with one brush you can pass a direction for the entire country. Can you say the same conditions exist in Ladakh as in Uttar Pradesh or any urban area has the same conditions as prevailing in rural areas?”The court also asked the petitioner organisation, comprising mostly lawyers, whether they had checked the feasibility of carrying out such an exercise.“These are matters of research and for you to just come to court and seek directions is not enough. You have just picked up an issue and want door-to-door vaccination. Nobody has applied their mind if this is feasible. When you ask for such relief, you do not understand the diversity of this country and the complexity of the problem.”The petition had relied on the fact that vulnerable sections of the population should be first attended to through a door-to-door vaccination policy. This way, the petition argued, there will be a minimum risk of getting infected by avoiding a visit to the vaccination centres. The petition also sought directions for drawing out a standard operating procedure (SOP) on a door-to-door vaccination facility and a toll-free 24X7 portal for this purpose.The vaccination policy is being monitored by the court in a separate suo motu proceeding wherein a National Task Force has been constituted as part of measures to contain the spread of Covid-19. The court clarified that its present order will not have any bearing on the suo motu proceedings. When the petitioner’s lawyer Bably Singh sought a time-bound order for the government to consider their suggestions, the bench replied, “We will not pass such order as you cannot imagine how pressurised the officials of the ministry of health and family welfare are. You can make concrete suggestions that may be considered at the appropriate level. They will certainly make a decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-to-take-call-on-door-to-door-covid-vaccination-supreme-court-101631129384069.html
09-09-2021||India||46 more test negative for Nipah virus, Kerala minister says worst is over||As many as 46 people with symptoms of Nipah tested negative on Wednesday in Kozikode, said Kerala health minister Veena George, adding the north Kerala district is almost out of a serious outbreak.The minister said samples of all close contacts of a boy who died due to Nipah on Sunday, including his parents and health workers, turned negative, adding that the government would maintain strict vigil for three more weeks. Since majority of immediate contacts are out of infection, George said the worst was over.“It is a great relief all samples turned negative so far. But we will not lower our guard. All restrictions will be in force till the window period of the virus (3 weeks) is over,” the minister said, adding 21 more results will be expected any time while 50 people with symptoms are still in the hospital and another 190 under observation.She said that going by the preliminary reports, bats are suspected to be the main carrier, but more studies needed to pinpoint the triggering agent. Many experts said the affected areas are also infested with wild boars and their samples will also be taken for testing.A team from the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory from Bhopal, which has arrived in Kozikode city, will co-ordinate more such studies, George said.Forest minister AK Saseendran, also camping in the north Kerala city, said special permission will be granted to capture boars and other wild animals for testing. Samples of domestic animals and pet were also taken to weed out suspicion, Saseendran said.Expert said strict protocol in place due to Covid-19, like masking, physical distancing and no overcrowding, really helped the state to blunt the impact of zoonotic disease again.“Due to Covid-19 protocol this time, Nipah transmission will be limited. Prevention technique of Covid-19 really helped in fighting Nipah also,” said immunologist and public health expert D Padmanabha Shenoy.Like Shenoy, many experts said the main source of the virus should be identified at any cost to check its further outbreak. This is the third time the state is witnessing the onset of virus in four years. In 2018, the viral infection claimed 17 lives in Kozhikode; in 2019, a youth was infected in Ernakulam but later cured; and in 2021, a 12-year-old boy died due to Nipah virus in Kozhikode.Zoonotic diseases on riseAmid third onset of Niaph, recurring zoonotic diseases at regular intervals continues to worry the state. Several cases of Kyasnur forest disease, avian influenza, swine flu, anthrax and Nipah have been reported from the state in recent years.Besides loss of human lives, such outbreaks also affect social and economic mobility of people and cripple their lives. Culling of poultry, ducks and other domestic animals has also become regular to check their transmission. Experts have asked the state government to formulate a multi-disciplinary approach to tackle such diseases and establish high-end labs for early diagnosis. They said zoonotic diseases are here to stay as human activities continue to disturb natural habitat and the state needs a single-window approach to tackle such maladies.“It is a fact that zoonotic diseases appear at regular intervals in Kerala. Human and animal dependence, directly or indirectly, is more these days. We need a permanent single-window mechanism for early detection of such diseases and early warning to the people. More research is also needed in the area,” said Dr Prejit Nambiar, a teacher at the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, who specialised in zoonoses and food safety.He added that a close interaction is necessary among medical experts, veterinary professionals, environmental scientists and wildlife professionals to tackle the situation.Many wildlife experts feel that such diseases can be checked by putting in place an effective surveillance mechanism and scientific disease management plans. In Kerala, there are enough wetland and water bodies, a preferred habitat for avian guests, which can easily transmit diseases to domestic birds.“Animals like civet cats have almost turned urban as their natural habitat shrunk. Once found in forests only, peacocks are found in countryside in large numbers. Loss of habitats force monkeys, civets, bats and boars to human habitat. So, it is natural such diseases arise,” said wildlife expert Dr P S Esa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/46-more-test-negative-for-nipah-virus-kerala-minister-says-worst-is-over-101631128604590.html

The journalists were later taken to Kothibagh police station, where their laptops and mobile phones were seized for technical evaluation before being released, the officials said. People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that the raids were part of investigation into a blog post that allegedly instigates people against the country.Condemning the police action, Reporters Sans Frontières tweeted: “@RSF_inter firmly condemns as crude intimidation this morning’s police raids at the residence of 4 journalists .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-police-seize-laptop-phones-of-4-journalists-101631128128886.html
09-09-2021||India||I-T attaches Sasikala assets worth ₹100 crores||The Income Tax department on Wednesday attached a property worth ₹100 crore of expelled All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) interim general secretary VK Sasikala at Payyanur village on the outskirts of Chennai in a disproportionate assets case.“This is a routine follow up action under the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988,” said an I-T department official on the condition of anonymity.According to officials, a bungalow and its adjacent land totalling about 49 acre, which was purchased in 1994, has now been taken over by the I-T department. A government notice to this effect was pasted by officials on the entrance walls and gate of the property.The department continues to seize properties belonging to Sasikala based on a 2014 court judgment on the disproportionate assets case where former Karnataka special court Judge John Michael Cunha listed properties as disproportionate assets of former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, Sasikala and her family members - Ilavarasi and Sudhakaran.Last September, the I-T department attached an under-construction bungalow owned by Sasikala and located opposite to Jayalalithaa’s sprawling residence in Chennai’s Poes Garden. The bungalow on 22,000 square feet land was being constructed for Sasikala to live in once she was back from prison. So far, more than 60 properties belonging to Sasikala have been attached by the I-T department.After Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016, the Supreme Court upheld Cunha’s order and Sasikala and her two relatives were jailed for four years in a Bengaluru prison in February 2017.At the time when I-T officials were at her property, Sasikala, who lives in the heart of Chennai, was visiting the home of a loyalist and former AIADMK MLA P Vetrivel, who died last year due to Covid-19. On Wednesday, Sasikala released an audio clip, condoling the death of former presidium chairman Pulamailpithan, who recently supported her, and passed earlier in the day. Pulamailpithan also wrote songs when AIADMK leaders M G Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa were celebrated actors in Tamil films. “He had a lot of affection for Thalaivar (MGR) and Amma Jayalalithaa. He spread Dravidian messages to the common people through his songs. His songs were a boost for the AIADMK cadre,” Saiskala could be purportedly heard saying in the audio clip.Since her release from prison, Sasikala has been trying to reclaim her position in the AIADMK, which is now under the dual leadership of her former loyalists - O Panneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-attaches-sasikala-assets-worth-100-cr-under-benami-transactions-prohibition-act-101631127943681.html
09-09-2021||India||Madras high court sets aside order allowing 16-year-old girl to write NEET this year||The Madras high court has set aside a single-judge order that permitted a 16-year-old student to write the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for medical admissions this year, for which a candidate’s minimum age should be 17 years as of December.The National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts the NEET opposed Sree Harini’s plea to write early. The high court, which had earlier permitted the student, later rejected her request upon the NTA’s plea challenging the first order. The court stated that it would be unfair to other students and courts across the country which will be flooded with such applications. NEET is scheduled for September 12.The CBSE student, who hails from Tamil Nadu’s Kumbakonam in Thanjavur district, had topped her school in Class 10 and this year she scored 487/500 in her Class 12 board exams. As per NeuroPsychological reports, she also had an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of 143.“We tested her first at age two because her speech stuttered and the doctors said that she had the maturity of a 4-year-old that was affecting her speech,” said the petitioner’s father G Saravana Kumar, a paddy farmer. Again, in Class 10, she received a certificate of ‘superior intelligence’. In 2019, on her behalf, her father submitted a representation to the NTA seeking permission to participate in NEET 2021, which was rejected.But only this year, they filed a writ petition seeking to quash the rejection order. A single-judge bench permitted her to appear for NEET subject to her IQ results tested at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru. With a certificate from NIMHANS and the court order, the father and daughter went to Delhi and approached NTA in August as she could not apply online due to her age. The NTA then filed a writ appeal challenging the single judge’s direction.The petitioner’s counsel ARL Sundaresan argued that she has been assessed to have a high-performance IQ, Verbal IQ and had performed intellectually superior range and her overall memory functioning was also in a superior range and has been certified as eligible for educational service for the cognitively gifted. But she would attain the minimum age of 17 to appear for NEET only next May.A division bench of Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana and Justice Krishnan Ramasamy on Tuesday declined to grant the student permission to write the exam this year, citing several reasons, including “instant proceedings cannot alter the minimum age, even though this aspect wasn’t in the prayer.” “The prayer of the writ petitioner to permit her to write the examination would tantamount to exempting her of the age prescribed. When there is no such exemption clause available in the Regulations, we cannot traverse beyond the age prescribed,” the court said in its orders.However, the court said that concerned authorities might consider age relaxation by giving advance notice in a phased manner for the benefit of candidates, saying that a judicial review to reduce the age limit or exempt a student should be refrained.The court also noted the distinction made by the counsel for the National Medical Commission (NMC) between intelligence and maturity. While ‘intelligence’ is having or showing the ability to understand, learn and think, ‘maturity’ means the ability to respond to a situation in an age-appropriate.The judges also drew in the status of medical aspirants from rural and poor backgrounds, who do not have access to coaching classes, the latest textbooks and the internet to prepare for NEET. “Many of the students clear the NEET only on a second or subsequent attempt, including those meritorious ones, as they need more time to cover the larger syllabus,” the court said. “While so, if the candidates like the petitioner, who has not fulfilled the age criteria are allowed to write the examination, in the event of her success, it may deprive a seat to another meritorious student, who may not have the age and ability to write the NEET for the second time or third time.”That NEET puts these students at a disadvantage while competing with urban and affluent students is also a raging political issue in Tamil Nadu, based on which the state government plans to introduce legislation seeking exemption from the examination. Harini has been preparing herself for the NEET and hoped to be the first doctor in her family. “She aims to study in AIIMS or JIPMER,” her father said.After the court, the father and daughter left Chennai to their home on Wednesday morning. “She is upset. Such an intelligent girl has to wait for an entire year to write an entrance exam because she is underage,” said the father.Justice Krishnakumar, who said he concurred with “every word” written in the lead judgement (by Pushpa Sathyanarayana), but went into the student’s plight pointing out that the she became ineligible to write the exam this year because she was given a double promotion from Class 7 to 9 and now she lacks 4 months and 5 days to complete the age of 17 years as on December 2021. He added that there was no objection by the CBSE all along.“Thus, while permitting the first respondent to clear 12th board of examination even before age of 16 by CBSE, which is controlled and managed by the Union of India, considering her intelligence and maturity, the MCI, which is also controlled and managed by the Union of India, cannot take away the legitimate expectation of the respondent by denying her the opportunity to appear for NEET 2021 examination, which will hit by ‘doctrine of legitimate expectation’ and amounts to a denial of the right guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution of India,” the justice said.However, he concurred that since an age bar is in force, the student cannot be permitted to write NEET early and that the Medical Council of India has to look at the concern of such students and come up with some solution.The father said with just a few days to go for NEET he wouldn’t be able to go for a further appeal. “I wish I can take this to the Supreme Court for an urgent hearing, but we don’t have the means for more expenditure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-sets-aside-order-allowing-16-year-old-girl-to-write-neet-this-year-101631127942547.html
09-09-2021||India||J&K arms licence racket under lens again after 24 arrested in Kerala||The Kerala police’s arrest of 23 men, all from Rajouri district of Jammu & Kashmir, for carrying fake arms licences has once again focused attention on a large arms licence racket in the erstwhile state that is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation. It wasn’t immediately clear whether any of the licences were issued by the deputy magistrates accused of issuing hundreds of thousands of permits to people outside J&K, usually on the basis of fake documents, and in exchange for money.The 24 arrested, 19 in Kochi and five in Trivandrum, all work as security guards for various security agencies, and all are on ATM duty. Deputy commissioner of police, law and order, Trivandrum, Vaibhav Saxena said: “A week ago five men were arrested in Thiruvananthapuram for carrying invalid arms licences; 19 others, who also hailed from Rajouri, have been arrested in Kochi after we gave a list to the Kochi police commissioner. Their licences were also found to be fake”. “We have got a report from Rajouri ADC which says that these licenses do not exist in their records/data base,” he added. The fake licences, the police officer said, were issued by a Rajouri man, who also sold them guns. “He was the one who gave a fake licence to these men for ₹6000 per license. He had also charged ₹13000-14,000 for single barrel and double barrel guns,” said the DCP, who added that this person’s identify can’t be divulged “at this stage.” None of the men have a criminal record, the officer said. “It seems to be a recruitment scam. To get the jobs , these men obtained licences.”The men were all hired by a private security agency SISCO. The DCP said SISCO actually had outsourced the human resource part to some other agency. He said that while the banks and the security firm have to check, the primary responsibility is that of the licence holders who have to inform local law enforcement authorities that they had just moved into the area, and carried arms licences. It is understandable that the guards did not do this; they knew the licences were fake and would not stand scrutiny. Out of the five men arrested in Trivandrum, four are under judicial custody and one under police custody. They have been arrested under arms act and for forgery of documents. The deputy commissioner of police, law and order, Kochi, Aishwarya Dongre, said, “We have arrested 19 men in Kochi and they are also from Rajouri. They also carried fake arms licences. We have seized their weapons and a probe is on”. “During investigation we found that Maharashtra-based agency recruited people from highly- sensitive areas without checking their antecedents. We have also shared some of the seized documents with central agencies,” said a police officer requesting anonymity, adding that after the incident, credentials of all such agencies will be checked. He said earlier there were some complaints against the security firm for using stars and insignia resembling the ranks of police and armed forces officers..“A police team has been sent to Rajouri,” Dongre said. Rajouri district police chief, SSP Sheema Nabi Qasba said she doesn’t have “in depth knowledge of the case because, primarily Kerala police is investigating it” “Their police team, I think, has come but I am not privy to the investigation or names of the accused,” she said. Rajouri district commissioner Rajesh Kumar Shawan didn’t respond to repeated calls and messages seeking comment. The Kerala police acted on the basis of a tip off by central agencies. On July 24, CBI conducted searches in multiple locations in Jammu and Kashmir and Delhi in connection with investigation in the illegal arms licence case. Between 2012 and 2016, deputy commissioners of various districts in Jammu and Kashmir fraudulently and illegally issued bulk arms licences in lieu of monetary consideration.

09-09-2021||India||Want ‘healthy relations’ with all neighbours of Afghanistan, say Taliban||The new Taliban setup in Kabul has said it desires healthy relations with all neighbours of Afghanistan based on mutual respect, even while assuring that Afghan soil will not be used against the security of any nation.A statement of the Taliban’s leadership office outlining the policies of the new so-called cabinet announced on Tuesday further said the new regime is “committed to all international laws and treaties, resolutions and commitments that are not in conflict with Islamic law” and Afghanistan’s national values.The statement was signed by the Taliban’s reclusive chief, Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has been named the supreme leader with the final control over religious, political and security affairs.“We want strong and healthy relations with our neighbours and all other countries based on mutual respect and interaction. Our relations with those countries will be based on the highest interests and benefits of Afghanistan,” the statement said.“Our message to our neighbours, the region and the world is that Afghanistan’s soil will not be used against the security of any other country. We assure all that there is no concern from Afghanistan and we expect from them the same,” it added.The statement further assured foreign diplomats, embassies, consulates, humanitarian organisations and investors in Afghanistan that they “will not face any problem”, and that the Taliban was “doing its best for their complete security and safety”.“Their presence is [the] need of our country, so they should carry out their work with a peace of mind,” the statement said.The Taliban setup said it is “committed to all international laws and treaties, resolutions and commitments that are not in conflict with Islamic law and the country’s national values”. It also called on all countries to “value building strong and cordial political, diplomatic and good relations with us and to also cooperate with us”.“We do not want enmity with anyone. Afghanistan is the common home of all. We will respect all their rights and legitimate aspirations and use their potential to rebuild the country,” the statement said.Experts, however, noted the statement was silent on an important condition from the peace deal signed by the Taliban and the US in February 2020 – the need for the group to sever its ties with al-Qaeda and other foreign terrorist groups. Many of the 33 members of the interim setup, including Akhund, Abdul Ghani Baradar and Sirajuddin Haqqani, are subject to UN sanctions for their links to terrorism.The experts also noted that the statement was largely silent on protecting the rights of women and children and preserving the gains of the past two decades –key demands of the international community.The statement only said the Taliban “will take serious and effective steps towards protecting human rights, the rights of minorities as well as the rights of the underprivileged groups within the framework of the demands of the sacred religion of Islam”.Describing the media as an “important element of the country”, the statement said the Taliban will “work for the freedom, functioning and improvement of the media quality”. It added, “We consider it our duty to take into account the sacred precepts of Islam, the national interests of the country and impartiality in our broadcasts.”The caretaker cabinet will work to uphold Islamic rules and Sharia law while securing Afghanistan’s borders and ensuring lasting peace and development. The statement described education as “one of the most important requirements of the country”, and said the setup will “provide a healthy and safe environment for religious and modem sciences to all countrymen within the framework of Sharia”.In the economic field, the Taliban said it will manage domestic revenues transparently, provide special opportunities to international investment and different sectors of trade, and fight unemployment effectively.The statement said the Taliban values all talented and professional people, such as scholars, doctors, scientists and engineers, and called on people not to leave the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-healthy-relations-with-all-neighbours-of-afghanistan-say-taliban-101631127762593.html
09-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: SEPT 9, 1951 Nehru chosen Congress President||New Delhi: The month-old Congress crisis over the resignation of Mr. Nehru from the party executive, which had been swelling like a tide, was resolved today by the A.-I.C.C. asking Mr. Nehru to become Congress President. The Prime Minister has agreed to shoulder the responsibility of this new office, even though for a temporary period. From tomorrow he becomes Congress President as well in succession to Mr. Tandon.The A.-I.C.C., which met in camera today for an emergency session at 5 p.m. at Constitution Club for two hours, passed a resolution by a huge majority-only four members out of the 295 present voting against-requesting Mr. Nehru “to undertake the responsibility of Presidentship and continue to guide the Congress in these critical days." Pandit Pant moved the resolution and Mr. S. K. Patil seconded it. The A.-I.C.C. passed another resolution accepting the resignation of Mr. Tandon from the Congress Presidentship. “While regretfully accepting the resignation," said the resolution, "the A.-I.C.C. places on record its deep appreciation of his great services to the Congress as its President." The resolution which was also passed by a big majority-only eight or nine members voting against-was moved by Pandit Pant and seconded by Mr. Atulya Ghosh. Both the retiring and incoming Presidents spoke to the A.-I.C.C. Mr Tandon placed his resignation before the A.-I.C.C. and asked for its acceptance. He made a brief statement dwelling on the situation leading to his resignation; how he could not see his way to reconstituting the Working Committee as demanded, holding the demand as "neither constitutional nor proper." I cannot accept Mr. Nehru's resignation because at present he is the symbol of our nation," he said with his customary dignity, and added: "At the same time, from the point of view of the constitution and propriety I cannot fulfil his desire.”After his speech, Mr Tandon stepped aside from the presidential chair, but on Mr Nebru's insistence that Mr Tandon continue to preside over the A.-I.C.C. deliberations both today and tomorrow, he consented to do so. Mr Nehru, it is understood, in a calm and conciliatory manner, addressed the A.-I.C.C. for about 45 minutes. The address was more in the nature of self-introspection, not only for himself but for every Congressman: To put the Congress house in order and to brace up the organization for grappling with the pressing problems of the day. Mr Nehru, it is learned, said the Congress should be transformed into a live organization again. The prestige of the Congress which successfully struggled for freedom had been declining and a wall was rising between the people and the Congress. Young men were tending to turn away from it, he said. Mr Nehru, it is understood, told the A.-I.C.C. that even at the Nasik Congress he wanted to keep out of the Working Committee and that he wanted to give a " shock " to the Congress. He disclosed that at the very first meeting of the Working Committee after the Ahmedabad session he had stated that the Committee should be reconstituted. There was no question of giving offence to anybody nor of bringing pressure on anyone. Mr Nehru referred to the "shock " he had given to the Congress since he resigned from the executive a month ago, and said: " The shock seems to have worked well for the past three weeks, so much so that everybody has been discussing the Congress only. They had even forgotten to talk about a war between Pakistan and India." He wanted to know, he said, how the people reacted to his resignation and he thought no harm had been done by it. Rather some good had resulted. The resignation, he thought, had served the Congress If there were any apprehensions in my mind about the propriety of the shock, these have now vanished completely. In America, he pointed out, millions and millions of dollars were spent on publicity, but the Congress did not have to spend a pie and had received tremendous publicity these days through this "shock." Both Congressmen and non-Congressmen had talked of Congress and foreigners too. It all  showed the Congress was not a dead body. Mr Nehru expressed it as his belief that the Congress had to fulfil an important role in the country and that it would remain a powerful organization. AWAKE He is believed to have asked Congressmen to awake to the realities of the day. He instanced how Mr Churchill won the war for England but was thrown out of office  when the war was over. Perhaps it was an easier thing to win a war than to solve the problems of the day. "If we are not alive to the realities and have a proper grasp of them, the organization will fade away. We won, a great battle and we cannot afford to be lost in trivialities." Mr Nehru is reported to have said it was not good to combine the Congress Presidentship with the Prime Ministership, but as he was also one of those who created a hiatus he could not run away from it. "One should not be bashful in this matter. When you direct me to shoulder a responsibility I cannot be a coward and refuse. You must trust me and I must trust you and we must come to deliberate decisions, he added. Mr Nehru spoke of Mr Tandon. He said: '' Our friendship is spread over 39 years. Though we did not agree always we have mutual affection and, therefore, there is no question of personality in this controversy. I have been feeling that the Congress is slipping away from the common man and, therefore, it is necessary to revitalize it." TANDON'S STATEMENT The following is the text of Mr Tandon's opening statement at the A.-I.C.C.: " I am placing this my resignation from the Congress Presidentship before you and I request you to accept it. "To put it briefly, the reason for my resignation is that by a letter dated August 6, Mr Nehru tendered his resignation from the Working Committee and in spite of my efforts and those of the Working Committee he has not agreed to withdraw the same. His demand has been that the whole Working Committee should be dissolved and a new Committee constituted. I have not been able to agree to this, since to my mind this demand is neither constitutional nor proper. “More than a half of the members of the Working Committee were selected after consultation among five senior Congressmen, namely, Mr Nehru, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Mr Rajagopalachari and myself, on September 27. The rest of the names were selected on October 16. Mr Nehru was not present on that date, but the other four took full part in the consultation. The Working Committee has, to my knowledge, done nothing which might raise the question of its reconstitution. "Mr Nehru seems to believe that by giving a shock to the Congress and bringing about a change in the Working Committee he will create a psychological effect in favour of the Congress. I am not able to accept this view. I believe that the work done by the Working Committee during the last ten months has helped in raising the moral standard of the Congress. The situation that has been created by the resignation of Mr Nehru is, I think, definitely detrimental to the interests of the Congress.SYMBOL OF NATION "I cannot accept the resignation of Mr Nehru because at present he is the symbol of our nation. At the same time from the point of view of the constitution and of propriety I cannot fulfil his desire. Out of this dilemma I have no other way out but to place my resignation before you and I request you to relieve me of the responsibility of Presidentship. 'I have to inform you that Maulana Azad resigned from the Working Committee on August 15 and that the other members of the Committee have tendered their resignations within the last two days." The A.-I.C.C. is meeting again tomorrow at 2-30 p.m. This session, unlike today's, will be open to the Press but not to visitors. Congress circles believe in Mr Nehru's Working Committee would be included not less than half the members of the outgoing Committee. It is learned that he will invite Mr Tandon to join the Committee. Earlier in the day, the Committee met informally for nearly an hour when the mediators in the crisis, Pandit Pant, Dr B. C. Roy and Mr Lal Bahadur Shastri, reported failure of their efforts. The Nebru-Tandon correspondence relating to the crisis is expected to be released tomorrow. Mr Nehru will be ' at home ' to members of the A.-I.C.C. at his residence tomorrow at 6 p.m.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-sept-9-1951-nehru-chosen-congress-president-101631127600331.html
09-09-2021||India||Theatre commands to be functional in 2 to 3 years: Officials||The creation of theatre commands to best utilise the military’s resources could take two to three years, with senior officers from the three services being assigned key responsibilities to finalise the joint structures, people familiar with the developments said on Wednesday. “The three services have nominated C-in-C ranked officers (senior three-star officers) to finalise the organisational structure and other aspects of theatre commands. These officers will submit a detailed report with their proposals in a year, after which the creation of theatre commands will begin,” said a senior official, one of the people cited above. “The officers will then start raising theatres. That will take two to three years. Right now, they are dual tasked --holding their current C-in-C appointments and laying the groundwork for setting up theatre commands. We are making good progress,” the official added. This indicates a slight revision in timelines. HT reported in February that India was set to begin the initial roll-out of its long-awaited theaterisation plan, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command likely to be launched by May this year, though the commands would take two years to be fully operational. Theaterisation has the full backing of the government. Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said discussions on the creation of joint commands and their implementation were progressing well and fast, indicating that differences between stakeholders on the theaterisation model are being addressed, and India is on course to set up theatre commands. “Whenever a change takes place, everyone wants to understand the change and its effects,” the official said. In June, the government formed an eight-member panel under Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat to fine-tune the theaterisation plans and bring all stakeholders on board, especially the Indian Air Force, for speedy roll-out of the new joint structures. The Indian military’s theaterisation model, a long-awaited reform, will have inbuilt flexibility to fall back on the current command and control structures to deal with any contingency during the transition phase, the official said. Stabilisation of theatre commands could take up to five years, and it is critical to ensure that there is a mechanism to swiftly return to the pre-theaterisation status quo if a crisis unfolds when the restructuring is underway. The armed forces currently have 17 single-service commands spread across the country. The Indian Army and the Indian Air Force have seven commands each, while the Indian Navy has three. Creating theatres would involve merging the existing commands (except the Udhampur-based Northern Command). In July, Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria flagged concerns about the theaterisation model, arguing that it was critical to first get the structure right, even as General Rawat gave out details of the plan to achieve jointness and brushed aside the reservations. The current theaterisation model under consideration seeks to set up four new integrated commands for synergy in operations --- two land-centric theatres, the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command. The Indian Army’s Northern Command is the only single-service command that will stay outside the scope of the military’s theaterisation drive because of its critical role. The Udhampur-based Northern Command is responsible for guarding the country’s borders with Pakistan and China in the north, and is the nerve centre of counterterrorism operations in Jammu & Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/theatre-commands-to-be-functional-in-2-to-3-years-officials-101631127582549.html
09-09-2021||India||Govt approves purchase of 56 C-295 transport aircraft||India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on Wednesday cleared the much-delayed purchase of 56 C-295 medium transport aircraft to replace the Indian Air Force’s ageing fleet of Avro-748 planes, the defence ministry announced on Wednesday.The deal is expected to be worth $2.5 billion.Airbus Defence and Space and Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) will jointly execute the project to equip the air force with the new transport aircraft under the Make-in-India initiative in the aerospace sector. Airbus will supply the first 16 aircraft in flyaway condition while the remaining 40 will be assembled in India by TASL.The Avro replacement project was in the works for almost a decade.“Sixteen aircraft will be delivered in flyaway condition from Spain within 48 months of signing of the contract, and 40 aircraft will be manufactured in India by Tata consortium within ten years of signing of the contract. This is the first project of its kind in which a military aircraft will be manufactured in India by a private company,” the ministry said in a statement.While the C-295s are meant to replace the Avro-748 transport planes, the new aircraft will also be suitable for demanding roles that the AN-32 currently undertakes. The aircraft can operate from short, unprepared airstrips and carry out a variety of missions in all-weather conditions.“We have made good progress with the light combat aircraft and a variety of helicopters. But transport aircraft is one area where a lot needs to be done. The C-295 project will help create an ecosystem for building transport aircraft in India,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.The defence acquisition council accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) to replace the Avro planes with 56 new aircraft in 2012. Under India’s defence procurement rules, an AoN by the council is the first step towards buying military hardware. The Avro-748 entered service in the early 1960s and has been long due for replacement.“All 56 aircraft will be installed with indigenous electronic warfare suite. The project will give a boost to aerospace ecosystem in India wherein several MSMEs spread over the country will be involved in manufacturing parts of the aircraft,” the statement said.The programme will allow the Indian private sector to enter into the technology intensive and highly competitive aviation industry and will augment domestic aviation manufacturing resulting in reduced imports and expected increase in exports, it said.“The programme will act as a catalyst in employment generation and is expected to generate 600 highly skilled jobs directly, over 3,000 indirect jobs and an additional 3,000 medium skill employment opportunities…It will involve development of specialised infrastructure in the form of hangars, buildings, aprons and taxiway,” it said.The project will involve setting up servicing facilities for the C-295 in India. “It is expected that this facility will act as a regional MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) hub for various variants of C-295 aircraft,” it added.The contract will also have an offset clause. India’s offset policy stipulates that in all big-ticket capital purchases, the foreign vendor has to invest at least 30% of the value of the purchase in the country to boost indigenous capabilities.“The original equipment manufacturer (Airbus) will also discharge its offset obligations through direct purchase of eligible products and services from Indian offset partners giving further boost to economy,” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-approves-purchase-of-56-c-295-transport-aircraft-101631127461846.html
09-09-2021||India||Last infra project inaugurated by BSY in shambles||Redeveloped at a cost of ₹5.5 crores, (Cobblestone road ) at Commercial street was the last infrastructure project BS Yediyurappa inaugurated in July while he was the chief minister. Redeveloped under the Smart City Project, Commercial Street began showing signs of the damage just a day after the inauguration, and close to two months later the entire footpath of one of the busiest streets in the city is in shambles. Commercial Street is one of the prominent shopping destinations in the city. On Tuesday, large gaps were found on cobblestone pavements. Merchants on the road claim that the large gaps on the footpath have become a hazard for the walkers. “A day after the road was reopened, rainwater started entering into the stores. The entire road was dug up for work, which was delayed over six months. We were okay with it because it would help up, but the work is very bad. Now just months after that the pavement has been dug up again,” said Rajesh Jain, one of the shopkeepers on the Commercial Street. Another shopkeeper said that just days after the road was inaugurated, the civic agencies began digging up the road. “We were told that since the quality of the tiles was not good, they were replacing them. But in the days that we followed, they were undertaking piping work on the streets. If the work was not completed what was the hurry to reopen it?” asked the shopkeeper who didn’t want to be named. Sreejith Nambiar, a shopper said that the pavement was not just in a bad shape but was dangerous for pedestrians. “They have removed sections of tiles across the pavement, and they are deep. If someone is not paying attention, they could easily twist their ankle or even fall. This is dangerous,” said Nambiar, who works with an e-learning firm in the city. According to BBMP officials, the cobblestones were replaced after revenue and city-in charge minister R. Ashok during an inspection on August 14 ordered the contractor to replace tiles due to bad quality. Rajendra Cholan, managing director at Bengaluru Smart City Limited said that the tiles on the pavements are being removed as part of the repair works. The official said that work of removing faulty tiles on the pavements began on Tuesday. “All pipe laying and other works have been completed. This will take care of the flooding problems and we have cleared drains on the streets as well. As soon as we finish repairing the tiles, the tiles on the main road as well will be repaired,” he said. However, a trader said the pace of work is slow. “They have just left the removed tiles by the road, and it has been there for a while now. We have just restarted our businesses and we were hoping that the authorities will finish the work during the lockdown, but we are back to square one where they are digging up the road again,” said Mohammad Haneef, who runs a bag shop. Mayank Rohatgi, secretary of Bangalore Commercial Associations said authorities should find a permanent solution to the problem. “We have raised the matter since the day after we saw damage on the road. We are glad that they have taken up the work, we hope it will be done at the earliest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/last-infra-project-inaugurated-by-bsy-in-shambles-101631127403793.html

Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner KV Rajendra issued an alert and appealed to the people to exercise caution and has directed the health department officials to take all precautionary measures. “A 12-year-old boy died of Nipah virus infection in Kozhikode district of Kerala on September 3. Since Dakshina Kannada district shares its border with Kerala and a large number of people commute for health and education purposes, a Nipah alert has been announced,” he said in a statement. According to the city administration, apart from the ongoing Covid-19 testing at the checkpoints between Kerala and Karnataka, health department officials have been asked to conduct checks for Nipah as well. District officials said that body temperature is being checked using thermal scanners and those with any symptoms will be sent back at various checkpoints. Nipah is a zoonotic virus that spreads from animals to humans and is also transmitted directly between people. It can cause acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis besides fever, headache, cough, and throat pain, the DC said and asked people to inform the health department immediately if any person is found experiencing the symptoms. The officials also said that the police are keeping a tab on the supply of fruits to the district from Kerala. Even though three districts in Karnataka share a border with Kerala, Dakshina Kannada has been a point of concern due to frequent travel between the Kasaragod in Karnataka and Dakshina Kannada. For the residents of Kasaragod, Mangaluru city in Dakshina Kannada is a lifeline. Even though Mangaluru and Kasaragod are on either side of a map, they are closely knit, say local residents. From anywhere in Kasaragod, Mangaluru is just 10-50 km away and the closest city in Kerala, Kannur, is more than 100 km away. “We have been keeping a close vigil on the checkpoints because of the Covid-19. Even though there were some problems earlier, now the system (checking passengers coming to Karnataka) is in place. We will continue to monitor the system, especially after the new developments (detection of Nipah). We are in constant touch with our counterparts in Kerala,” said Rajendra. Dakshina Kannada district on Wednesday reported 200 new Covid-19 cases. The district is recorded the second-highest number of cases after Bengaluru city, which recorded 338 new cases. The district also recorded 3 Covid-19 related deaths and the active cases in the district is at 2,131.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-border-district-issues-alert-as-12-yr-old-boy-dies-of-nipah-in-kerala-101631127402486.html
09-09-2021||India||Ex-Infosys exec slams article criticising firm||A day after general secretary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) defended a controversial article published in its affiliate Hindi magazine Panchajanya on September 5, in which it alleged that Infosys supported ‘anti-national’ forces, a former senior executive at the I-T giant on Wednesday hit back at the statements saying that those who were earlier issuing nationalist certificates to individuals are now extending the same to companies. “Earlier they were giving nationalist certificates to individuals, now they are giving it to companies. It is bad when a lot of capital is coming into the country. When we are celebrating entrepreneurs in the ecosystem, creating unicorns. You cannot discredit unicorns and companies which have put the company in the global map . It is a sad thing,” V Balakrishnan, the former chief financial officer (CFO) of Infosys told Hindustan Times on Wednesday.Manmohan Vaidya, the general secretary of the RSS on Tuesday defended a controversial article in Panchajanya, calling the magazine as the “herald of a Dharam Yudh” or righteous war.In his comments, Vaidya said that Panchajanya heralds the “Dharam Yudh” and when you have good people on the wrong side, then you will have to shoot arrows against them as well.Despite a section of the RSS distancing itself from the magazine’s article, the comments by Vaidya have raised apprehensions within corporate India and their periodical targeting.The four-page article, which appeared as the cover story in the current edition of the weekly magazine with the headline ‘Saakh Aur Aaghaat’ (‘reputation and affront’), accused Infosys of trying to destabilise the Indian economy and also accused it of helping “naxals, leftists and the tukde tukde gang”.The article comes in the backdrop of glitches in the new Income Tax e-filing portal developed by Infosys. Last month, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman summoned the firm’s CEO, Salil Parekh, and asked him to fix the glitches in the I-T portal by September 15.RSS spokesperson Sunil Ambekar on Monday tried to distance the organization from the magazine, earlier believed to be a mouthpiece of the Sangh. “As an Indian company, Infosys has made seminal contribution in progress of the country. There might be certain issues with a portal run by Infosys, but the article published by Panchjanya in this context only reflects individual opinion of the author,” Ambekar said in a post on Twitter.A mail sent to Infosys seeking comment went unanswered.“I don’t think that this person who made the comments understands that Infosys is a 100% Indian company and one of the top companies of India,” TV Mohandas Pai, another former top executive of Infosys said. “He should talk to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to understand what companies like Infosys have done for the country,” he added.Pai said that he was not clear what was driving such statements against the company.The controversial episode has put the BJP in a tight spot where it cannot publicly defend the company or its ideological parent. The Karnataka government, which has used the success of Infosys and Wipro to put Bengaluru on the global map and attract new investments, has also maintained a stoic silence.“BCIC (Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce) strongly condemns the use of phrase anti national against Infosys. Infosys is a crown jewel of India and is a pride of India in IT sector. The company that stood for governance values and technology which made India proud can never ever be “Anti National.”” KR Sekar, the president of the industry body said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exinfosys-exec-slams-article-criticising-firm-101631127343702.html

After that the ministers’ in-charge of the concerned districts will sit with the DMs to give it final shape,” he added.He also asked for an assessment of those districts, which have received less rainfall. Though technically none of the Bihar districts has so far been declared drought-hit this year, the impact of floods has been unprecedented, with crops on over five-lakh hectares damaged.The CM also pointed to the extensive damage due to floods, which has affected nearly 70-lakh population spread across 26 districts, and asked the water resources department for a comprehensive long-term plan for a permanent solution to the problem, which hits Bihar every year.The Bihar chief minister also directed the animal husbandry and fisheries department to do their assessment so that assistance could reached those affected by the floods in the state. All the DMs of the flood-affected districts, the ministers and officials of different departments were present at the meeting, which went on for over five hours.The review meeting was called after a central team’s visit to take stock of the flood situation and damage caused. The team, which visited the state on Monday, returned on Tuesday evening after doing an aerial survey of Darbhanga, Bhagalpur and adjoining areas and holding talks with government officials.During the meeting, a power point presentation was also made to throw light on the situation, relief and rehabilitation measures initiated and how the state had to face floods in three phases this year, starting from June 13. The government claimed to have distributed relief worth ₹477.32-crore among 795538 families, while the remaining would receive it by September 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-holds-meet-to-assess-floods-asks-for-quick-survey-of-crop-loss-101631126802734.html

I want to lead a delegation of all parties to present our views on caste census. I want members from both treasury and opposition benches to join us,” said Soren.Reacting to the CM’s statement, senior BJP legislator and former minister Neelkanth Singh Munda said while his party was ready to cooperate on caste census, the CM should also take up the issue of “dwindling population of tribals in the state”.Sudesh Mahto, former deputy CM and president of AJSU Party, an ally of the BJP, asked Soren to also inform the House about his electoral promise of expanding other backward classes (OBC) reservation in the state to 27% (from existing 14%). AJSU Party too has taken a clear stand in favour of caste census.“It’s is good that you have sought time on caste census, let us know what happened to the 27% OBC reservation. That should not be an issue now as the Centre has already delegated the power of deciding on list of OBCs to the states,” Mahto said.To this, the CM said the state government was working on it and he was in favour that a unanimous resolution on OBC reservation should also go to the Centre from the state assembly.The development comes weeks after an all-party delegation from neighbouring Bihar, led by chief minister Nitish Kumar, met PM Modi on August 23 to demand a caste census in the country. While speaking to the press after the meeting, Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Tejashwi Yadav, leader of opposition in the Bihar assembly, suggested the caste census could be a part of the normal decadal census, which anyway counts religious groups and Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) separately.The last caste-based census was conducted and released in 1931, while in 1941, the data was collected but not made public. In 2011, a socio-economic caste census was carried out but the data was again not made public on grounds of “discrepancies”.Holding a caste-based census is a sensitive issue for the government in view of the assembly elections due in seven states next year. Many political parties have come together demanding a caste-based census.BJP allies such as the JD(U), Apna Dal and Republican Party of India-Athawale have raised the demand for holding a caste-based census. Many opposition parties such as the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Samajwadi Party are also demanding that the exercise should be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-cm-seeks-to-meet-modi-to-discuss-caste-census-101631126682758.html
09-09-2021||India||10 injured in CPM, BJP clashes across Tripura||At least 10 people were injured in fresh clashes between BJP and CPM workers which erupted in different parts of Tripura on Wednesday, police said, adding that two persons were arrested so far in connection with the matter.Besides, two CPM party offices and nearly six vehicles were set on fire while offices were ransacked at Bishalgarh in Sepahijala district, Udaipur in Gomati district and, Agartala and Hapania in West District. “A case has been registered at Udaipur after one Mafiz Miah was injured. Two persons have been arrested so far,” a senior police official in Agartala said on condition of anonymity. The two sides had earlier clashed on Monday at Sonamura in Sepahijala district of the state, police said. Trouble began in Udaipur town after CPM’s youth wing Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) took out a procession and a few activists from the rally allegedly attacked a BJP activist, news agency PTI reported. A group of BJP activists retaliated by attacking the DYFI procession. The CPM alleged that the BJP cadres later broke the gate of the former’s party office at Bishalgarh with the help of a bulldozer before setting the premises ablaze. The BJP cadre also ransacked CPM’s Sadar office and party headquarters at Melarmath in Agartala, the party said. “I was inside the party headquarters when the BJP workers came and destroyed our party documents, threatening us to stop all political programmes. Few vehicles in front of our office were also set on fire. It is an attack on democracy,” Left convener Bijan Dhar said. Later in the evening, the BJP alleged that seven of their activists were injured after they were attacked by CPM cadres in Agartala and Udaipur. “We noticed that CPM leaders, especially former chief minister Manik Sarkar, have been involved in instigation of violence for a few days. We have organised protest rallies throughout the state against their attack on our activists two days back,” a BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-injured-in-cpm-bjp-clashes-across-tripura-101631126503396.html
09-09-2021||India||SC upholds extension of ED chief’s term, says exceptions only in rare cases||The Supreme Court on Wednesday signed off on the extension granted to Enforcement Directorate chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra , saying that the government has power to appoint the Director of Enforcement for a term beyond two years but that extensions beyond the date of the individual’s superannuation should be rare, in exceptional cases, and for a reasonably short period of time.Mishra’s term comes to an end in November 2021 and the court has said he should not be granted any further extension. Mishra superannuated in May 2020.The decision of the Court came on a petition filed by NGO Common Cause which challenged the Government’ decision of November 13, 2020 to retrospectively grant an extension to Mishra by converting his original tenure of two years beginning November 19, 2018 into a three-year one. The decision met the approval of the High-Powered Committee chaired by Central Vigilance Commissioner in the interest of supervising some important investigations handled by ED that were at a crucial stage.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said, “We do not intend to interfere with the extension of tenure of the second respondent (Mishra) in the instant case for the reason that his tenure is coming to an end in November, 2021. We make it clear that no further extension shall be granted to the second respondent .”The Court upheld the power of the Central government India to extend the tenure of Director of Enforcement beyond the period of two years. But ”we should make it clear that extension of tenure granted to officers who have attained the age of superannuation should be done only in rare and exceptional cases,” it added . The Court said that a reasonable period of extension could be granted to facilitate the completion of ongoing investigations but “any extension of tenure granted to persons holding the post of Director of Enforcement after attaining the age of superannuation should be for a short period.” The High-Powered Committee entrusted with appointment of ED Director under the CVC Act has to record reasons for granting such extension, the Court held.The Government argued in Court that Section 25(d) of CVC Act laying down the tenure of Director Enforcement to be “not less than two years” gave discretion to the Government to fix a tenure beyond two years notwithstanding the retirement age of 60 years applicable under Rule 56 of All India Service Rules. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that the Enforcement Director occupies an important post , probing money laundering crimes having cross-border and trans-national ramifications and that under the present Director, the agency managed to recover a sum of nearly ₹9000 crore in the investigation of three cases involving Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. The NGO’s petition, argued by senior advocate Dushyant Dave, submitted that this decision of the Government would play havoc with the system and give the government a free hand to keep officers of their choice beyond retirement for an unreasonable period.The bench held, “There is no proscription on the government to appoint a Director of Enforcement beyond a period of two years.” On the words ‘not less than two years’ occurring in Section 25(d) of the CVC Act, the bench said, “There is no scope for reading the words to mean not more than two years” and said that a Director of Enforcement can be appointed for a period of more than two years by following the procedure prescribed under Section 25 of the CVC Act.To this extent, the present incumbent Mishra’s extension order was held to be justified as he was holding the rank of an Additional Secretary to the Government of India on the date when the extension order was issued. Further, there was no allegation made by the petitioner stating that the extension of tenure was exercised for any unauthorized purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-upholds-extension-of-ed-chief-s-term-says-exceptions-only-in-rare-cases-101631126143815.html
09-09-2021||India||Dharmendra Pradhan BJP’s poll incharge in UP, Gajendra Shekhawat in Punjab||The Bharatiya Janata Party kicked off its preparations for elections in five states to be held in 2022 by appointing four Union ministers and a former chief minister in charge of the party’s election efforts in these. Three other Union ministers, several ministers of state, and senior partly leaders and parliamentarians will assist them. The BJP is in power in four of the five states. Union minister for education and skill development, Dharmendra Pradhan, has been given charge of the politically significant state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends the largest number of members to the Lok Sabha. According to senior party leaders, his nomination to the position is an indication of the party projecting him as an OBC (Other Backward Classes) face. “He is an OBC himself and has a good understanding of the caste matrix. He also has the advantage of having worked as an election in-charge in Bihar. Since this election will see mobilisation of the OBC castes, his appointment is crucial,” said a party functionary who asked not to named. Pradhan was most recently in charge of Nandigram in West Bengal during the assembly elections. The party’s Suvendu Adhikari won the election defeating his mentor and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. The “co-incharges” are Union minister for information and broadcasting, Anurag Thakur, the minister of state for parliamentary affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal, MoS for agriculture Shobha Karanjdale, MoS education Annupurna Devi, former national general secretary Saroj Pandey, MP Vivek Thakur and former minister in Haryana Capt Abhimanyu. Thakur was appointed as in-charge of the District Development Council (DDC) elections held in Jammu and Kashmir in 2020. “His performance in the DDC elections was appreciated in the party. He is also is a young leader who has a good connect with the youth,” said a second party functionary who asked not to be named. Union minister for parliamentary affairs, Pralhad Joshi has been given charge of Uttarakhand. BJP MP from West Bengal Locket Chatterjee and BJP spokesperson RP Singh will be the co-incharges for the state where the BJP changed three chief ministers within a year. “In Uttarakhand the intra-party issues have now been settled, but Joshi will have to strike a balance between the aspirations of the people from the hill and the plains,” said the second leader. In Uttarakhand the party faces challenges on account of governance issues that in turn led to the frequent change in leadership. “The issue of frequent changes (of CMs) is an issues, but the party is hopeful that with new CM (Pushkar Dhami) in the seat it will come back to power,” said a BJP leader from Uttarakhand who asked not to be named. Union minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Shekhawat has been given charge of Punjab where the party will be contesting on its own for the first time after breaking away from its ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal. The party faces a daunting task in the state, as farmers in Punjab have been in the forefront of the ongoing stir against the farm laws. “Shekhawat’s familiarity with issues pertaining to agriculture and his friendly demeanour are seen as advantages,” said the second leader. Union minister for urban development Hardeep Singh Puri, MoS for external affairs Meenakshi Lekhi and Lok Sabha MP Vionod Chawda will be co-incharges in Punjab. Bhupendra Yadav, Union minister for labour and environment will be in-charge of Manipur. MoS, social justice, Pratima Bhaumik and Assam minister Ashok Singhal have been named the co-incharges for Manipur, where the BJP is also in power. Yadav, is also the party’s prominent OBC face. Also in-charge of Gujarat and Bihar, he is considered a confidant of the party brass. “Both Yadav and Pradhan have a deep understanding of the organisational matters. They understand the dynamics of electoral politics,” said the first functionary. Former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis has been given charge of Goa where the party faces a slew of challenges including the anger over the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Union minister for culture and tourism G Kishen Reddy and MoS, railways, Darshana Jardosh will be the co-incharges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pradhan-bjp-s-poll-incharge-in-up-shekhawat-in-punjab-101631125904128.html
09-09-2021||India||Focus on terror in United States, Russia talks with India||India has conveyed to top security and intelligence officials of the UK, the US and Russia its concerns over Pakistan’s links with the Taliban and foreign terrorist groups operating in Afghanistan, and the need for steps to prevent instability spilling over into the wider region, including India.The officials of the three countries made a beeline for India to discuss the situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover and its implications for regional security -- an indication, also, of the understanding among the world’s powers that India is an important stakeholder in the issue.Richard Moore, the head of the UK Secret Intelligence Service or MI6, was the first of the visitors over the past week, and he was followed on Tuesday by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director William Burns. Both spy chiefs and their teams met national security adviser Ajit Doval and top members of the National Security Council Secretariat, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.On Wednesday, Doval met Nikolay Patrushev, secretary of Russia’s security council. Patrushev visited India at Doval’s invitation for high-level bilateral consultations on Afghanistan, the external affairs ministry said.At these meetings, the Indian side pointed to Pakistan’s long-standing links with the Taliban and other foreign terror groups operating in Afghanistan, and also raised the special responsibility that Islamabad has in ensuring that Afghan soil is not used to spread terrorism, the people cited above said.The Indian side also highlighted the links between Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) that are active in Afghanistan.The visits came against the backdrop of the old guard of the Taliban tightening its grip on power in Afghanistan a little more than two weeks after the group marched into Kabul on August 15, following the chaotic collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. Just three days after a visit to Kabul by the ISI chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the Taliban on Tuesday announced a 33-member interim setup led by veteran political leader Mohammad Hasan Akhund, a close aide of the group’s founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, who died in 2013.The people cited above said the meetings with the MI6 and CIA chiefs and the Russian security official looked at the way forward on Afghanistan, especially at a time when Russia and China appear to be veering towards the possible recognition of the Taliban dispensation.Burns and his team interacted with Doval and key members of the National Security Council Secretariat, including deputy national security adviser Rajinder Khanna and Lt Gen (retired) VG Khandare, the secretariat’s military adviser, the people said.While the external affairs ministry announced Patrushev’s visit, there was no official word from any side on the trips by the British and American spy chiefs. A spokesperson for the British high commission said: “We do not comment on intelligence matters.”The high-level India-Russia consultations on Afghanistan were the first such review of the situation after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, and involved officials from the external affairs and defence ministries and security agencies. Both sides expressed deep concern at developments in Afghanistan and there was convergence on major issues, such as the need for Taliban to adhere to their commitments and the threat posed by foreign terrorists in Afghanistan to Central Asia and India, the people said.There was also convergence on the threat posed by the flow of weapons to terror groups and smuggling across Afghanistan’s borders and the high chances of the war-torn country becoming a hub for opium production and trafficking.India and Russia also discussed concrete forms of bilateral cooperation among their security agencies, including upgrading consultations and exchange of information, the people said.A statement issued by the Russian embassy noted the importance of letting Afghans define the “parameters of the future state structure of Afghanistan”, and the need to prevent any escalation of violence. The two sides also discussed humanitarian and migration problems in Afghanistan, and the prospects for joint efforts by India and Russia to create conditions for “launching a peaceful settlement process on the basis of an intra-Afghan dialogue”, the statement said.The meeting between Doval and Patrushev was a follow-up to the phone conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin on August 24, during which the two leaders agreed to remain in close touch on the Afghanistan issue.Patrushev later met Modi and discussed cooperation on a wide range of issues, and ways to develop the bilateral special and privileged strategic partnership. Patrushev also meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar and exchanged views on international and regional problems, including the situation in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-terror-in-us-russia-talks-with-india-101631125783460.html
09-09-2021||India||Centre opens NDA to women after SC push||Nudged by the Supreme Court, the Union government has taken a decision to throw open the doors of the National Defence Academy (NDA) to women cadets -- although it has also sought an exemption for this year’s admission, exams for which are to be held in November. The development came weeks after the top court directed that women can also sit for the upcoming NDA examination while holding that the policy that restricts their entry into the elite institution is based on “gender discrimination”. The Centre on Wednesday informed the top court that the decision to allow women in the joint defence service training institute of the Indian armed forces was made on Tuesday evening, in consultation with the three chiefs of the armed forces and the competent authority in the government. A bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, appreciated the government’s decision and asked for a detailed affidavit by September 20on the manner in which the policy is going to be implemented and the timeline for execution. “We do hope defence forces value the important role women are performing. You may go at a comfortable pace, but redressal must take place...The armed forces play an important role in the system, for forming an immensely essential function. We would not easily interfere in their roles and would rather want them to take a proactive approach towards gender equality, instead of the court stepping in,” said the bench, which also included justice MM Sundresh. The court observed that the armed forces are respected but, “they need to do more towards gender equality. A dynamic approach needs to be adopted”. Breaking the glass ceiling that endured for 65 years, the top court on August 18 rejected the government’s argument that the restriction against women from training at the Pune-based NDA was a policy decision while issuing the interim order to let them sit for the upcoming exam in November. It had also implored the government to “take a more constructive view of the matter”. The order was passed on a petition filed by Kush Kalra for equal opportunity for women at NDA and the Indian Naval Academy. Appearing for the petitioner, senior counsel Chinmoy Pradip Sharma and advocate Mohit Paul contended that the categorical exclusion of eligible female candidates from NDA was unconstitutional and done entirely on the basis of their sex. Under the current eligibility criteria, only male candidates who have cleared Class 12 level or its equivalent, and are in the age group of 16-and-a-half and 19 are eligible to apply. Those who clear the NDA exam are called for interview by the Service Selection Board (SSB) and following a medical exam, candidates are recruited in the Indian Army, navy, and air force wings of NDA, and for the INA course for pre-commission training. NDA was commissioned in 1955. On Wednesday, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati appeared on behalf of the Centre and began her submission by saying that the nudge and the push by the court has yielded results. “I have a rather delightful piece of news to share with your lordships. Your lordships’ nudging, persuading and pushing has made a difference. The decision has been taken at the highest level of the forces, with all the three armed forces’ chiefs, and the government that girls will be inducted in armed forces through the NDA. This decision was taken late last evening,” Bhati told the bench, which also included justice MM Sundresh. Bhati, however, sought an exemption from admitting women in the NDA for the current year, and requested the court to consider directing a status quo for the November-exam this year. She said the policy decision will entail various changes in curriculum, procedure, training infrastructure, billets, etc. At this justice Kaul remarked: “We were only nudging the authorities to do certain things themselves. After all, we know that they are best suited to evolve such changes. The court steps in when nothing has happened. It is not a very happy situation for us either.” On her part, the ASG said that the “thought process” was already there and the plan was in the seeding stage when the court passed the interim order to allow women to take the next entrance exam for the NDA. “If you had told this to us at the previous hearing, we would not have done anything at all. We are conscious of the complexity of the armed services where induction can take place; whether it can take place or not; in what time and manner it can take place. We are not oblivious to all this. But we only wanted to push you,” retorted the bench. Adverting to Bhati’s plea regarding the status quo for the upcoming exam, the bench said: “We are conscious that reforms cannot happen in one day. We only want progress to be made. We will see depending on what you are doing now; what is the proposal for the future; what still remains to be examined; which areas you are exploring. We will see if more nudging is required or we are comfortable with your pace. But we must have some timelines.” In its order, the bench said that it is “glad” to note that the armed forces have taken the decision for induction of women into the NDA and related issues are being examined. “ASG Aishwarya Bhati seeks time to place the development or the future plan before us. We compliment the ASG for the proactive role in persuading the armed forces in taking an approach which is in furtherance of gender equality. We hold over the matter for two weeks,” stated the court, fixing September 22 as the next date of hearing. The bench also heard another plea for admission of girls into the Dehradun-based Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC), argued by advocate Manish Kumar on behalf of NGO Centre for Reforms, Development and Justice. Kumar said that the latest advertisement issued by RIMC has yet again excluded girls. Old boys’ association of RIMC also intervened in the matter with certain suggestions. The bench asked Bhati to look into these pleas and get back with a reply on the next date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-opens-nda-to-women-after-sc-push-101631125721776.html
09-09-2021||India||SC extends interim relief to The Wire journalists in FIRs filed by UP Police||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed news portal ‘The Wire’ to approach the Allahabad high court for quashing criminal cases lodged against its journalists in Uttar Pradesh and protected them from arrest for two months. The Foundation for Independent Journalism, the company which publishes The Wire, approached the top court on August 26 along with three of its journalists for an order to quash the criminal cases lodged against them by the Uttar Pradesh police accusing them of spreading disharmony, enmity and feelings of hatred between different groups of people in the society. Senior advocate Nithya Ramakrishnan, who represented the petitioners, told the court that journalists did not seek any special protection but this was a question of muzzling freedom of press. The bench of justices L Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna said, “We are aware about your press freedom and we do not want press freedom to be muzzled. But at the same time, we do not want to open the floodgates for quashing petitions to be filed under Article 32. You approach the high court.”The counsels for the petitioners urged that arrest was imminent as the investigating officer in the Barabanki FIR had summoned the Editor and journalists to obey the summons, failing which non-bailable warrants shall be procured. In the other FIRs, the accused journalists are yet to hear from the police authorities.The bench, while allowing the petition to be withdrawn, granted protection from arrest in connection with the three FIRs for a period of two months.The three FIRs lodged this year on January 31, June 15 and June 24 related to news stories published by the news portal which related to demolition of a disputed structure at Barabanki, an interview with the kin of a person allegedly killed in farmer agitation, and a video purportedly showing miscreants chopping off the beard of an aged Muslim man. The FIRs lodged at Rampur, Ghaziabad and Barabanki accused the portal and its journalists of offences under the Indian Penal Code of Section 153A (promoting disharmony), Section 295A (insulting religion or religious beliefs) and Section 505 (spreading false and mischievous news) besides criminal conspiracy and common intention relatable to the above crimes. The petition, filed by advocate Shadan Farasat, said, “These provisions which deal with actual offences against communal harmony are presently being subverted and misused and used to gag any media reportage on incidents that may have a communal/religious/political angle. In these circumstances, it is essential that the contours of these offences particularly in the context of action against journalists or media houses be clearly set out, so that they are not used by police authorities to muzzle constitutionally protected (freedom of) speech.”Interestingly, the issue of use of Sections 153A and 505 of IPC against media channels and journalists is already pending consideration in a separate matter before the top court. Two news channels – Aamoda Broadcasting (ABN Andhra Jyoti) and Shreya Broadcasting (TV5) had approached the top court questioning FIRs registered against them in Andhra Pradesh accusing their reporting of fomenting communal disharmony and amounting to sedition.On May 31 this year, the top court stayed any coercive action against the two media houses and said, “The ambit and parameters of the provisions of sections 124A, 153A and 505 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 would require interpretation, particularly in the context of the right of the electronic and print media to communicate news, information and the rights, even those that may be critical of the prevailing regime in any part of the nation.”The present petition cited this case and said, “To posit reporting – especially the verbatim claims of citizens who are or say they are victims of crime – as tending to create disharmony or as an inherently criminal act is most pernicious, and this mode of criminalizing expression deserves relief and remedial measures from this court, else no journalist will be able to report fearlessly and the media will become caught in the criminal process for simply doing its job.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-extends-interim-relief-to-the-wire-journalists-in-firs-filed-by-up-police-101631125422541.html
09-09-2021||India||Centre signs peace agreement with Nagaland insurgent group: Home ministry||The Union government on Wednesday signed a fresh ceasefire pact with Niki Sumi-led Khaplang faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K) in New Delhi. The development is being seen as a boost to the ongoing Naga peace process for which the Centre is holding peace talks with NSCN (IM) and a conglomeration of seven Naga nationalist political groups (NNPGs). The new ceasefire agreement is for a period of one year with effect from September 8, 2021. The agreement is subject to adherence to the existing ceasefire ground rules signed by the two sides. The ceasefire agreement was signed by Union home ministry’s additional secretary (NE) Piyush Goyal on behalf of the central government while Nikato Pilot Sumi and Abel Zingru Thuer signed for NSCN (K) Niki group. A home ministry statement said the ceasefire agreement is a significant step in Naga peace process and making the Northeast insurgency-free. “In fulfilling the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ‘Insurgency free and prosperous North East’ and in a significant boost to Naga peace process, under the guidance of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the government of India enters into a ceasefire agreement with National Socialist Council of Nagaland (K) Niki Group,” the ministry said in the statement .The NSCN (K) in 2015 unilaterally abrogated its 2001 ceasefire agreement with the Centre, after which the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) declared the group as a banned outfit and an “unlawful association”. The chairman of Ceasefire Monitoring Group (CFMG Nagaland), Lt. Gen. (retired) AS Bedi, was also present during the signing of the pact on Wednesday. While speculations are rife over the Niki-led NSCN (K)’s move calling truce with the Centre, people aware of the matter, said the group was firm to remain a separate entity. However, the onus is on the Centre to decide whether it would ask the NSCN (K) to either join hands with the NSCN (IM) or the NNPGs in the peace talks, or to start fresh talks with the group. The latter would mean the Centre get into negotiations with the group and perhaps even sign another accord, which might prolong the protracted Naga political issue. However, the coming of the Niki-led NSCN (K) into ceasefire with the Centre is also being seen as a positive move for the Naga peace process as the Naga civil society has been appealing to all the political groups to come together and thrash out issues so as to bring the long-pending Naga political issue to an honourable and an acceptable settlement. The development comes days after a tripartite agreement among five insurgent groups of Assam, the Centre and the state government was signed to end years of violence in the Karbi Anglong region. After abrogating the ceasefire agreement with the government of India in 2015, the NSCN (K) led by its leader SS Khaplang went on to establish a strong base in neighbouring Myanmar. However, Khaplang died of a cardiac arrest at Taga in 2017 in Myanmar’s Sagaing Region under Naga self-administered zone. Subsequently, the group, which was taken over by Khaplang’s relative Yung Aung split into different factions, of which the Niki-led NSCN (K) is one. Niki Sumi is a prime accused in the ambush on the Indian Army in Manipur which claimed the lives of 18 soldiers and charges have not been dropped yet. The National Investigation Agency had announced a reward of ₹10 lakh on Niki Sumi.The NSCN (K) operates to establish a sovereign state bringing all Naga inhabited areas of Myanmar and India under one administrative setup. The Centre has been in a ceasefire agreement with the Isak-Muivah faction of the NSCN (NSCN-IM) since 1997 and had signed the professed historic “Framework Agreement” in August 2015, while a conglomeration of seven different Naga national political groups (NNPGs) was also involved in separate talks with the Centre since 2017 and had arrived at an “agreed position” in 2017. Another breakaway faction of the NSCN (K) led by Khango Konyak is already in peace talks with the Centre under the aegis of the NNPGs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-signs-peace-agreement-with-nagaland-insurgent-group-home-ministry-101631125302582.html
09-09-2021||India||37 cases of side effects linked to Covid-19 vaccines in govt’s new AEFI report||The Union health ministry’s latest analysis of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) shows that 61 out of 88 cases that of severe or serious side effects chosen for analysis have a consistent causal association to vaccination, and 37 were vaccine-related reactions. There were five deaths in this clutch of cases but these were not directly linked to the vaccine, according to the government report that HT has accessed.This is the fifth AEFI report of the government and experts said its findings reinforce the safety of the vaccines. The government has been analysing AEFI instances in batches – this report pertains to 88 cases selected at random between January 16) when coronavirus vaccination was launched in India) and March 30. In this period, 64.3 million doses were administered.Apart from five deaths, all other severe and serious adverse reaction cases recovered, according to the report, which said that three deaths were coincidental and not linked to vaccination– such cases are when a cause of death other than a vaccine is established upon investigation. The two remaining deaths were classified by experts in the indeterminate category.Also Read| ‘Won’t stay silent’: WHO chief reiterates moratorium on Covid-19 booster shotsMost of the side effects, which were in 22 cases, were related to anxiety following vaccination – which does not directly implicate the product. In two cases, the reactions were related to immunisation error, the report added.“61 out of 88 cases for which causality assessment has been done found to have consistent causal association to vaccination, of these 61 cases, 37 were vaccine product related reactions 22 cases were immunization anxiety related reactions, and 2 cases were immunization error related reaction. 18 cases have inconsistent causal association to vaccination (coincidental — not linked to vaccination) including 3 death cases. 9 cases were in indeterminate category including 2 death cases,” said the ministry’s AEFI report.The result of the causality assessment for these 88 cases was completed on June 28, 2021, after a thorough review, deliberation and approval by the national AEFI committee.Vaccine product related reactions are those that can be attributed based on current scientific evidence. Examples of such reactions are allergies and anaphylaxis.Indeterminate reactions occur soon after vaccination but there is no definitive evidence in current literature or clinical trial data that this could have been due to the vaccine. Further observations, analysis and studies are required.Unclassifiable events are events that have been investigated but there is not enough evidence for a diagnosis due to missing information. When this relevant information becomes available, the case may be reconsidered for causality assessment.A dedicated group has been formed both at the state and central level, to conduct causality assessment of AEFIs following Covid-19 vaccination. The results of causality assessment done by this expert group are discussed in the national AEFI committee meeting for final approval.The medical specialists include cardiologists, neurologists, pulmonary medicine specialists, and obstetrician-gynaecologists as members of the causality assessment sub-committee at the national level.Also Read| Covax cuts supply forecast for 2021, to have access to 1.425 billion doses“The surveillance happens not just for Covid-19 vaccination; in fact the country has a robust AEFI surveillance system as India vaccinates a large number of children and even pregnant women each year. A well-oiled system is in place for the purpose, and surveillance post Covid-19 vaccination is now a part of that system,” said a senior central government official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.The final analysis of the cases is sent to the Union health ministry’s immunisation division that stores all data related to immunisation in the country at the central level, including Covid-19 immunisation.Experts also say that the percentage of adverse reactions that have been reported so far is minuscule in comparison.“It has been well-established that vaccines are safe and should be taken without hesitation. Vaccinating a significant percentage of our population will eventually help in containing the disease transmission,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, department of medicine, Moolchand Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/37-cases-of-side-effects-linked-to-vaccines-in-govt-s-new-aefi-report-101631124942652.html
09-09-2021||India||TDP chief Naidu alleges AP police abetted suicide of TDP members, writes to top cop||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo and former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday accused a section of the state police of harassing his party members and abetting their suicide in Prakasam district. Naidu shot-off a letter to state director general of police (DGP) Goutam Sawang on the issue, claiming “continued deterioration of law and order” in AP. In his letter, Naidu stated that a false case was booked against two TDP leaders, M Srikanth and P Rathaiah in Mogilicherla village under the Lingasamudram police station in Prakasam district. The former chief minister alleged that both were harassed and beaten on September 5 after being picked up by the district police, leading to their death by suicide.“After physically harassing, abusing and threatening them, the police left them at 2 am in the early hours of September 6. Again, at 6.30 am on September 6, the Lingasamudram SI (sub-inspector) threatened and called them to the police station. Frightened and afraid of further police harassment, Srikanth and Rathaiah took poison,” stated Naidu’s letter to the DGP. Naidu said the police was in “connivance” with the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), and was “persecuting” those with opposing political views and beliefs for the past two and half years. However, the Prakasam district police contradicted Naidu’s statements on the issue. Prakasam district superintendent of police Mallika Garg however denied any bias or wrongdoing. “Rathaiah had a dispute with a woman named Geeta as the latter was dumping manure on a pathway in their village. Geeta had support from the YSRCP, and with the help of some others, she lodged a police complaint against Rathaiah, who was associated with the TDP,” she told Hindustan Times. Garg added a case was first registered against both sides after a local TDP leader named Gopal Rao got into a scuffle with one of the YSRCP leaders accompanying Geeta when he allegedly made an offensive comment against Rao. “The aggressor was from the TDP. Later, both sides were called to the police station, and the TDP workers were arrested and given station bail. A case was also registered against the YSRCP members as well,” Garg said. Rathaiah and Srikanth died by suicide a day after the incident on September 6.Refuting any wrongdoing by the police, DGP Sawang also said that it was a small incident between two neighbours which led to an issue. “It is normal to have such issues in every village. It happens frequently, and the police in this case acted quickly,” he said, when asked about Naidu’s allegations. Naidu’s letter, however, stated that it was “appalling to note the one-sided” leaning among a section of the police. He further alleged that some cops were favouring the ruling YSRCP and constantly harassing TDP leaders and sympathisers.Prior to this on August 30, Naidu had written to Sawang requesting withdrawal of “false” cases registered against TDP leaders in connection with a state-wide protest against the rise in fuel prices on August 28. Then, too, he questioned the police and alleged political bias.The YSRCP, however, denied any interference in police functioning. “The AP police department over the last two-and-a-half years received awards from independent third parties. Why would external parties keep rewarding them (if it was biased)?,” questioned Rajiv Krishna, advisor to the AP government and YSRCP spokesperson.Krishna stated that the ruling YSRCP was not concerned with the TDP. “The people have given the CM a fantastic mandate. The CM has gone on record to say that all government schemes are for the public without worrying about their political affiliations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naidu-alleges-ap-police-abetted-suicide-of-tdp-members-writes-to-dgp-101631091682136.html

09-09-2021||Today's||Indian sport: The triumph, the challenge||Strongmen populist leaders have a penchant for aligning sporting achievement to their personality cult. Fidel Castro used Cuba’s success in the boxing ring and on the baseball field to instil a sense of national pride and loyalty to his regime. Other erstwhile Soviet bloc leaders too were quick to use sporting success as a symbol of their larger ideological battles. So it should come as no surprise that Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s relentless media machine has clambered onto the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics medallist bandwagon. Modi’s self-image is boosted when seen in the company of sporting heroes. But are the photo-ops just optics or is India on the cusp of finally being seen as an Olympic nation? To be fair, the PM and the sports ministry can legitimately claim that they have done more than previous governments in building an Olympic medal momentum. The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), launched in 2014, has played an important role, especially post the 2016 Rio Olympics mini-debacle, in identifying and supporting elite Olympic and Paralympic athletes. In particular, after Olympic silver medallist Rajyavardhan Rathore and then the youthful Kiren Rijiju took charge of the sports ministry, there was a visible change in the planning and preparedness for mission Tokyo. With the support of private trusts and foundations such as Olympic Gold Quest, JSW sports, GoSports, there was a genuine attempt to create an ecosystem where athletes could actually aspire to go for gold. Contrast this with the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, where the sports ministry was seen as marginal. In ten years, from 2004 to 2014, India had as many as six sports ministers, with an average tenure of less than two years. There were even ministers such as Mani Shankar Aiyar who were openly disdainful of the attempts being made to bid for the Asian and Commonwealth Games, while Sunil Dutt too seemed clearly unhappy with what was seen as a ‘junior’ portfolio. It is, therefore, to Modi government’s credit that it has given a more vibrant “Khelo India” profile to a ministry that desperately needed fresh ideas and zest. The final medal haul at the Tokyo Olympics was well below the anticipated double-digit tally, but there are enough signs that the Indian contingent is now truly competitive. For a generation which grew up on the limited ambition of a hockey medal, Tokyo 2020 was a breakthrough event. A new younger India has inspirational figures such as Neeraj Chopra to allow their dreams to soar like a flying javelin into a glittering golden sky. The Paralympic performance is spectacular: 19 medals add up to more than the combined total of what India has won in all previous Paralympic Games. Which is why the celebrations are not entirely misplaced. And yet, the euphoria needs to be tempered by certain ground realities. The winners maybe feted but there is still a yawning gap between elite athlete performance and the overall standard of Olympic sport in the country. How many schools have playgrounds and physical education teachers who can train and guide the young? Better funding of potential medal-winning athletes alone cannot create a competitive sports culture; this requires public-private partnership that builds a sporting ethos, beyond just the glamour of associating with podium winners. The Naveen Patnaik-led Odisha government’s involvement with hockey is a good example of what is possible if an enthusiastic political leadership embraces an Olympic sport with total commitment, without an eye on instant gratification.The struggles of our disabled sportspersons also need a reality check. Our para-athlete winners are being honoured but when it comes to inclusion and accessibility, people with disabilities still struggle to have their voices heard. How many of our sporting facilities provide equal opportunity by ensuring easy access? And how many institutions recognise the physically handicapped as citizens with equal rights, and not just as deserving of pity? Even in cricket, it has been the herculean efforts of admirable individuals like Bengaluru’s GK Mahantesh of Samarthanam Foundation that has almost forced the cricket board to now recognise disabled cricketers as worthy of their patronage. At the heart of the future challenge is the lopsided governance structure for sport. For decades, sport has been terribly governed in the country. Most federations are run like personal fiefdoms by politicians and their cronies. It is only now, when private trusts have sought to fill the gap, that the monopoly of the neta-babu culture is finally being broken. But unless governance standards are significantly raised, federations are likely to be looked at with suspicion.Look at the manner in which wrestling federation chief, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, a six time parliamentarian now with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has warned wrestlers who are associated with private, not-for-profit trusts that they will not be considered for selection going ahead. Like other federation bosses, Singh too wants to bully players into submission. Maybe, the next time the PM has an on-camera interaction with Olympians, he could also have a stern word with his fellow BJP MP. It may prove more rewarding than a made-for-television event. Postscript: With the Olympic extravaganza over, the focus shifts back to cricket with IPL and World T20 on the horizon. The question, including for the media, is whether we will still track the inspirational stories of our Olympic heroes, or return to being a one-sport nation?

09-09-2021||Editorials||When NDA opens to women||With the Centre’s decision to allow women to be inducted for permanent commission through the National Defence Academy (NDA), one more barrier to gender equality has fallen. This is indeed “a rather delightful piece of news”, as additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati put it while appearing for the Centre before the Supreme Court (SC). The SC has consistently cleared the path for women to join the armed forces in larger numbers, while urging the forces to adopt a more proactive approach towards gender equality. The apex court had passed an interim order last month permitting women to sit for the NDA admission exam, which is now scheduled for November 4. This welcome change must now be buttressed by changes in policy, procedure, training and infrastructure, for which the Centre has sought that women’s entry be put off for year.

Three years later, on Tuesday, a petition filed by two non-governmental organisations representing the queer community in the Kerala High Court has proved that India still has a long way to go to ensure that the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community are fully recognised. The petition sought the removal of discriminatory and inhuman inferences about the LGBTQIA+ community in medical textbooks. The bench remarked that it is a “serious issue”, and directed the Undergraduate Medical Education Board to take immediate action.
