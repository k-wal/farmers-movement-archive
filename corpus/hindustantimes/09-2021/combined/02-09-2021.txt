The protesters were demanding redressal of issues related to waterlogging, as they said that rainwater enters their houses every time there is a heavy rainfall. Police officials said that they had to divert traffic through alternative routes to avoid a major jam at the tri-junction. The two localities are located adjacent to the Delhi-Meerut Road which witnesses the movement of about 120,000 passenger car units a day. The median of the road is being used by the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) for developing the regional rapid transit system (RRTS) project. The residents said that their localities are affected since last year when the RRTS project has started. “It is due to the construction activities that the drain outside our localities overflows and the rainwater enters our homes whenever it rains heavily. Rainwater has entered my house several times this season. On Thursday, it rained around 7am and the water inside my house was there till 5pm,” said Charanjeet Singh, a resident of Patel Nagar 2. “We cannot even flush out water as all the lanes and roads get waterlogged after the rainfall,” he added. Mahender Singh, a resident of Valmiki Kunj, said that dozens of houses in the locality have similar problems. “I also face similar issues. Our ration items get spoiled with water. The conditions are pathetic. We have made several complaints to the municipal corporation officials, but nothing has been done so far,” he said. Another resident Mahesh Kumar Singh said that women residents also participated in the protest. “There was no other option but to protest as people have suffered time and again during this monsoon season. It is because of construction activities of the project that the waterlogging issues have resulted with greater intensity. It takes hours for water to recede,” he said. Police officials said that around 200 people gathered at the Meerut tri-junction and protested against the waterlogging in their areas. “We had to diver the traffic. The diversion on Delhi-Meerut Road was done through ALT Centre Road and Raj Nagar Extension. The jam, which resulted due to the protest, was cleared after about one and half hours,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic).Officials of NCRTC said that the intensity of rain is higher this season and the two localities are in low-lying areas. “NCRTC is constructing an elevated RRTS station at Meerut tri-junction where a stormwater drain is passing. In order to maintain the flow of this drain, a pipe of the same width has been inserted, which discharges the water as per the drainage system of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation,” an NCRTC official said in a statement. The statement also said that NCRTC continuously runs two dewatering pumps to take out extra water from the drain located near the project site. Pramod Kumar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Our team of engineers has visited the affected localities. They have assessed the problems and will be taking up rectification measures for waterlogging.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rainwater-enters-homes-agitated-residents-block-delhi-meerut-road-101630607293519.html
02-09-2021||Noida||UP govt forms SIT to probe Emerald Court case||NOIDA: The Noida authority, in a report, has shared details of at least six officials involved in the process of sanctioning maps of twin towers -- Apex and Ceyane -- of Supertech’s Emerald Court project in Sector 93B, said officials on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh government formed a special investigation team on Thursday to investigate the involvement of top officials of the authority in the same.The government has suspended a manager in the planning department of the Noida authority in connection with the twin tower case, officials said. “Mukesh Goyal, manager in the planning department, was nominated to attend the Supreme Court hearings in the Emerald Court case. But he did not bring important facts to the notice of senior officers of the Noida authority,” said a senior authority official.The move comes two days after the Supreme Court directed demolition of the twin towers within three months and ordered prosecution of officials of the Noida authority for commissioning violations of the National Building Regulation 2005, 2006 and 2020, while approving maps of these towers in violation of the building bylaws 2010.Senior officials of the Noida authority said that they have sent a report comprising the details of those posted there when the building map was sanctioned. The names include the then chief architect and town planner, additional chief executive officer, and several others. Now, the four-member SIT, headed by Uttar Pradesh industrial development commissioner (IDC) Sanjeev Mittal, will probe the role of the officials to fix responsibility in the matter -- which is a major jolt to the realty sector.“The Noida authority has sent a report in this matter. The SIT, headed by the industrial development commissioner, will investigate the matter and do the needful. The government will issue a notification in this regard soon,” said Arvind Kumar, additional chief secretary, infrastructure and industrial department (IDD) in Uttar Pradesh.The SIT team will also have additional chief secretary (revenue) Manoj Singh, ADG (police) Rajeev Sabharwal, and Uttar Pradesh’s chief town and rural planner Anup Kumar. The state government has given a week’s time to the team to submit the report.Meanwhile, the Supertech Group said, “We will comply with the honourable Supreme Court’s order, and we may use the legal options available.”Residents of the Emerald Court said that they are hoping that the Noida authority will exercise due care during the demolition drive, and it would not impact nearby buildings. “We have requested the Noida authority to carry out the demolition drive in a manner that it does not affect the safety of the nearby buildings where people are already residing,” said UB Singh Teotia, petitioner in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-govt-forms-sit-to-probe-emerald-court-case-101630607234875.html
02-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad electrocution: CCTV footage shows 5 died in span of 75 seconds||The street number 3 at Ghaziabad’s Rakesh Marg area was abuzz with activity on Thursday as residents and even families of the victims were able to get hold of the CCTV footage, which shows the five people, who were electrocuted on Wednesday, falling into the waterlogged lane in front of the shop one after another within 75 seconds.  The CCTV footage, which was accessed by HT, shows the entire incident spanning from 9.49am to 9.50am and 15 seconds more on Wednesday. “The footage is now available with everyone and even our families. Seeing our loved ones die one by one is painful. The footage shows Simran Kumari (11), who is one of my distant relatives, holding my four-year-old niece Surbhi in her arms and going to a shop. It was raining then... As Simran reached the shop, the two can be seen falling to the ground...,” said Surbhi’s uncle Vipin Rawat. Eventually, the footage shows Laxmi Narayan (24) running out of his house to save the girls but he too fell the moment he touched the girls. “In between, one of the girls, Khushi Kumari aged 10, was also electrocuted. Though she is directly not visible in the CCTV footage, she was probably at the shop. After Laxmi Narayan fell, his neighbour Deepak Kumar rushed to the shop and started fighting with the shopkeeper. As the commotion increased, my aunt Jaanki rushed to the shop and fell down after she was electrocuted,” said Rawat adding that Jaanki had no children of her own and was raising Surbhi like her own daughter. “Surbhi is one of my aunt’s relative’s child. My aunt loved Surbhi so much that she ran to save her but in the process, lost her own life,” said Rawat. Simran’s mother Krishna Devi was in tears when she came to know about the footage. “I cannot say much as I have lost my eldest daughter to something, which could have been easily avoided. Initially, those who went to save the girls did not anticipate that electric current was flowing through...they probably thought the kids lost balance and slipped on the flooded lane,” she said. Ghaziabad MP General (retired) V K Singh, along with officials from the district administration, visited the locality on Thursday morning and handed over cheques of ₹2 lakh each to the families of the victims. “I requested the officials not to offer compensation but provide some employment and education opportunities to the families of the victims. My son died while trying to save the girls, now his two minor children and wife face a bleak future,” said Laxmi’s father Badri Narayan. Laxmi became a father to a son a month ago and also has a one-and-a-half year old daughter. Residents said the cremation of the victims was completed late Wednesday night. “Families collected the ashes from the cremation ground, which will now be taken to the native places of the victims,” said Badri. Officials from the district administration said a committee has been instituted to probe the case. Members of the committee inspected the incident spot on Thursday and also spoke to locals. The inquiry report is likely to be submitted within a day or two, said officials. “Proper action will be taken against erring persons and an FIR will also be registered. The cheques bearing a compensation of ₹2 lakh were handed over to the victims’ families. We are also trying to aid them with benefits under government schemes,” said Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city) who is heading the inquiry. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday took cognisance of the incident and directed that an inquiry be done and also announced a compensation of ₹2 lakh for each of the victims’ families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-electrocution-cctv-footage-shows-5-died-in-span-of-75-seconds-101630607053440.html
02-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad electrocution: More residents say they had warned the shop owner||The death of the five people, including three minor girls, due to electrocution on Wednesday could have been averted had the shopkeeper of the grocery store in ‘gali number 3’ at Rakesh Marg paid heed to the warnings of two residents who sustained an electric shock, when they touched the iron poles holding the newly erected shed at the shop, an hour before the incident. Residents said they had warned the shopkeeper even on Tuesday, when the shed was put in place to protect shoppers from rain, when they spotted some spark near a bulb hanging over the shed. Three minor girls--Shubhi alias Surbhi Paswan (4), Khushi Kumari (10) and Simran Kumari (11), were electrocuted while two others--Laxmi Narayan (24) and Shubhi’s mother Jaanki (35)--who tried to save them, also died at a grocery store in Ghaziabad’s Rakesh Marg locality on Wednesday morning. The owner of the shop, Sushil Kumar, is still at large, said police. On Thursday, Rita Paswan, a resident of gali number 3, said she suffered an electric shock when she came in contact with iron poles supporting the shed of the shop. “It was about 8:30am when I was going to work. There was little flooding outside the shop. I touched the iron pole for support to wade through water. I got an electric shock and lost my balance. Though it was raining, there wasn’t much waterlogging there, reason why I probably got saved,” she said. Rita immediately brought the matter to the attention of the shop owner. “He took the matter lightly and did not pay heed to my warning,” she said. Rita’s husband Yogesh Paswan said that an hour later, he got a call from his neighbour who informed him about the five who died of electrocution. “Had the shopkeeper not ignored my wife’s warning, the five people would have been saved. My wife is still having a pain on her right hand and veins have turned blue as a result of the electric shock she received,” he added. Sri Narayan Mahto, a 35-year-old resident of the area, complained that he too sustained an electric shock when he touched the iron pole around 8am. “I am a tenant at the same house where the shop is located. The shop owner ignored what I said and went on with his work. He should have closed his shop and raised a complaint with the electricity department,” said Mahto. Sunil Pandit, a tenant in the same house where the shop is located, said he had heard Rita arguing with the shop owner after she sustained an electric shock about an hour before the line of electrocutions. “The shop owner did not pay attention to her complaint. Instead, he had earphones plugged on and was listening to music,” said Pandit. On Wednesday, Lal Singh, a nearby shop owner, told HT that he and his tenants saw sparks from a bulb hanging from the shed. “The shop owner got the iron poles tested with a tester and told us there was no issue of electric current passing through,” said Singh. As per footage obtained from the CCTV cameras installed near the incident spot, it was around 9.49am on Wednesday when the victims, one by one, got electrocuted and eventually died. During a visit to the area on Thursday, HT found a bunch of snapped electric cables with open joints, with no insulation electric tapes around them, lying near the shop. The cable was drawn from the main electricity line and connected to the two electricity metres installed at the house where the shop is located. “Officials from the electricity department snapped the cables as they were passing adjacent to the shed. It has an open joint, indicating that it was probably used for providing illegal connection and passed on electric current to the newly erected shed. The shop owner ignored warnings time and again and now everyone is demanding an FIR be lodged against him. Had he acted, five deaths could have been averted,” said Badri Narayan, Laxmi Narayan’s father. Pankaj Srivastava, chief engineer of Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), said the cables were snapped after they received a complaint on Wednesday. “It is the consumer who pays for the cable. It has come to light that residents warned the shop owner but he did not lodge any complaint with us. As regards the open joint, it may be possible that the cable got cut while erecting the shed,” said Srivastava. Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city), said so far, no FIR has been lodged in the case. “The victims’ families are busy performing the last rites. Further, a report is awaited on the inquiry initiated by the district magistrate. Once the reason is established, responsibility will be fixed before an FIR is registered. Sushil Kumar, the shop owner, is yet to be traced,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-electrocution-more-residents-say-they-had-warned-the-shop-owner-101630606994603.html
02-09-2021||Noida||GB Nagar restaurateurs stare at losses after home deliveries banned during night curfew||Following the murder of a Greater Noida restaurant owner, the Gautam Budh Nagar police late on Wednesday night issued an order banning deliveries and takeaways during the night curfew hours between 10pm and 6am. The move, restauranteurs said, would affect their business that is just recovering from the impact of Covid-19.Thirty-eight-year-old Sunil Agarwal was shot dead outside his restaurant around midnight allegedly while attempting to solve an issue between his staff and delivery agents associated with an online food delivery service. Police said that they had arrested three suspects in the case and added that they were not linked to either the restaurant or the delivery agents.The Uttar Pradesh government imposed the night curfew in the state from April 15 when the second wave of Covid-19 infections gripped the country. It did not specify whether eateries were allowed to deliver food either by themselves or through online delivery partners during that time unlike last year when, during the first wave in March, these were considered “essential” along with state and health services.“During night curfew, all types of services are completely banned across the state except health related, emergency or essential services. There will also be a ban on take home services from eateries during night curfew,” read an official statement from the Gautam Budh Nagar Police Commissionerate on Wednesday night.Police commissioner Alok Singh said home deliveries were considered as “essential services” only during the first wave last year when restaurants and hotels were not allowed to open for dine-in customers. “Now that restaurants and hotels are open through the day, food deliveries will not be considered essential services during the night curfew,” he said. Restaurateurs say their revenues will be affected by the decision. “Since the lockdown in 2020, food deliveries were considered essential. All through the Covid curfew this year too, food deliveries have been going on without a hitch and became the only source of income for restaurants in the district. Almost 70% of the home delivery orders come after 8-9 pm and go on till 11pm to 1 am. If this is taken away from us, we will not be able to survive,” said Varun Khera, President of National Restaurants Association of India (Noida Chapter). Devendra Awana, owner of Swagath restaurant in Sector 104 said that he was barely able to break even and pay his employees these days.“Although our restaurant is known for our dine-in service, we began to deliver more after the Covid pandemic and now it has become a major source of our revenue. There are barely any lunch orders and home deliveries during dinner time, which starts at 9pm and goes on till midnight, sustained us. If this is also taken away from us, we may have to shut down,” he said.Some residents say that the time restrictions on home deliveries of food do not gel with lifestyle of people living in the city. “All of my friends in Noida also work in the corporate and IT sector and none of us eat dinner before 10 pm. Moreover, after working all day, we do not have the energy to cook food and hence ordering take out late night has become a part of our lifestyle,” said Prakhar Mathur, a resident of Sector 77. Mohit Bhardwaj, owner of Asian Empire restaurant in Sector 76 said that his regular customers comprise of those working in corporate and IT sector who order food late into the night till about 1 am. “The lifestyle of those in corporate and IT sector is such that they have their dinner only after 11 pm and some who work at night shifts also order food from us at 1 am. If we shut out operations at 10 pm, that means we cannot take any order after 9-9.15 pm. In Sector 76 alone, there are at least 10 more such eateries like ours who have at least a hundred customers in nearby high rises and this move will affect them all,” he said. Khera said that he will take up the matter with the police officials on behalf of the restaurateurs in GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-restaurateurs-stare-at-losses-after-home-deliveries-banned-during-night-curfew-101630606815564.html
02-09-2021||Noida||GB Nagar pandemic grievance panel orders action against private hospital||A panel set up to look into grievances against Gautam Budh Nagar private hospitals during the second wave of Covid-19 on Thursday ordered the district chief medical officer (CMO) to act against Prayag Hospital in Sector 41 for administering 11 vials of remdesivir to a woman in violation of protocol. The patient later died.The hospital denied the allegations and said they will challenge the ruling.The complaint was filed by the patient’s son on July 12. According to the complaint, the woman was admitted on April 17 with a severe case of Covid-19 and passed away on May 21. “As per the complainant, the hospital prescribed the patient 11 vials of Remdesivir drug. However, as per protocols set by the Director General Medical and Health Services, Uttar Pradesh, the number of vials prescribed to a Covid patient cannot be more than six. The complainant at the time had to pay an exorbitant amount to source the vials to save his mother,” said civil judge Sushil Kumar, who is the president of Pandemic Public Grievance Committee (PPGC). The committee had sent a notice to the hospital management on July 16 seeking its reply. “A representative from the hospital denied the allegations and said that it did not prescribe 11 vials to the patient but an investigation into the bills charged by the hospital found that it [the allegation] was true. Hence, the CMO of the district has been instructed to take legal action under the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act and under the rules of medical council of India, and inform the PPGC committee within 15 days,” said Kumar. He added that the patient was charged ₹7 lakh by the hospital that was paid immediately. CMO Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma said, “The district health department will inquire into the matter and take action accordingly”. An official from Prayag Hospital said, “The allegations are completely baseless. The hospital never prescribed 11 vials of remdesivir to the patient. We will challenge the decision of the committee”. The PPGC was set up on May 21 this year after the Allahabad high court on May 11 directed the Uttar Pradesh government to set up a three-member committee in each district to look into complaints regarding difficulties faced by the public in getting Covid treatment at government and private hospitals. Officials said it has heard over 100 complaints from the public so far and ruled against several hospitals till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-pandemic-grievance-panel-orders-action-against-private-hospital-101630606754006.html
02-09-2021||Noida||Discom to launch Scada system for real-time monitoring of power distribution in Noida||For real time monitoring of power distribution in Noida, the power distribution company (discom) – Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) – will launch a supervisory control and data acquisition (Scada) system on the network soon. The system can detect the exact location of faults along the network and help reduce the outage time, said discom officials.Scada is deployed in many industries -- from oil and gas to telecommunications -- for controlling processes and gathering data in real time.PVVNL (Noida division) chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said the system will increase network reliability, reduce costs, improve worker safety and provide greater customer satisfaction. “Their alarms and real time views into operations can prevent small problems from becoming big ones and can also reduce restoration time. It saves time otherwise wasted on field visits, and also improves worker safety during outages and power restoration,” Singh said.He also said that in the event of an outage caused by an unforeseen event like a storm, the system’s advanced data collection capabilities help field workers in quickly identifying the exact location of the outage without having to wait for a complaint. “Scada-enabled switches and line reclosers [a system that shuts off power in case of a fault] can help operators isolate the outage and open adjacent automatic switches to reroute power quickly, without the need for a line worker to visit the site to perform a lengthy visual inspection,” he said.The chief engineer said that a Scada system for a power distribution application is typically a computer-based software package. “Data is collected from the electrical distribution system, mostly originating at substations. Depending on its size and complexity, a sub-station will have a varying number of controllers and operator interface points. In addition to data collection, Scada systems typically allow commands to be issued from central control and monitoring points to substations. If desired and as circumstances allow, these commands can enable full remote control,” he said.Singh said that Scada raises alarms and logs events as they happen. “Alarms are grouped into different categories and are given different priorities’,” he added.Residents expressed happiness over introduction of the new system.Pankaj Kumar Singh, a resident in Sector 77, said, “The Scada system is already in operation in states like Delhi, Gujarat and Maharashtra. It’ll certainly increase the efficiency and credibility of the discom.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/discom-to-launch-scada-system-for-real-time-monitoring-of-power-distribution-in-noida-101630606633413.html
02-09-2021||Other||Classes 9,11 in Delhi to follow CBSE’s exam structure, says state govt||In line with the two-term Class 10 and 12 Central Board Secondary Education (CBSE) examination set to be held this year, the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) on Wednesday introduced the same assessment system for classes 9 and 11 in all public, private, and government-aided schools in Delhi for the academic session 2021-22.According to an order issued by director of education Udit Prakash Rai: “Academic session will be of two-term examinations i.e. mid-term examination (Term-1) and annual examination (Term-2) with approximately 50% syllabus in each.”According to the term and subject-wise marks shared with schools, each term will have 50% weightage for the calculation of final results.All government schools and most private schools in Delhi are affiliated to CBSE.The order explained that question papers in the 90-minute Term-1 or mid-term exams that will be conducted in October or November will have multiple-choice questions. The duration of Term-2 will be two hours, and it will be descriptive with short- or long-answer questions.In July, CBSE said that as a part of “special scheme of assessment” it will conduct two sets of board exams -- one between November and December, and the other between March and April 2022, for Class 10 and 12 students in the current academic session to prepare for any “unprecedented situation” that could arise because of the Covid-19 pandemic next year.Under this assessment scheme, the academic year has been divided into two terms, each covering approximately half the syllabus.CBSE Director (Academic) Joseph Emmanuel said the two-term assessments are in line with National Education Policy guidelines. “The NEP recommends making board exams stress-free and low-stakes in nature. It is expected that the bifurcation of syllabus into two-term will reduce stress level of students considerably, and it could be taken as a pilot to decide the future course of action. According to the board’s policy, assessment pattern of classes 10 and 12 needs to be followed for classes 9 and 11 as well even though it is done by schools internally. The same has been reiterated by the DoE circular, and it is in consonance with the CBSE guidelines.”Students of classes 9 and 11 returned to schools in Delhi on Wednesday for in-person classes. Class 10 and 12 students were already called back to schools on August 16, after a long break due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Schools said that the “timely order” will help them in planning their tests and internals accordingly.Awadesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya Rohini Sector-8, said, “Earlier, our midterms carried around 25% weightage in the final results. But the increase in weightage to 50% and inclusion of MCQs (multiple choice questions) will help students score better. After our students returned to school on Wednesday, we were planning to conduct internal tests to see where they stand after a year of online learning. The revised assessment scheme will help us plan teaching-learning and assessment better.”Some private school principals said they were yet to see the order. “We were planning to conduct the first test in September, now it’s been pushed to October. The paper pattern is very different. Since CBSE has changed the pattern for Class 10 and 12 students, it only makes sense to adopt the practice for class 9 and 11 students as well because students need training. Teachers will face challenges in setting question papers as per the new pattern,” said Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School.The education department has also given a matrix of different subjects and the break-up of marks allotted to different classes and modes of tests. For instance, in Class 9, students will have to appear for 40-mark Term 1 exams in Hindi, English, Mathematics, Science, Social Science, and Indian Language. The remaining 10 marks will be given on the basis of internal assessments. For skill courses such as Retail and Artificial Intelligence, both theory and practical component will comprise of 25 marks each.The department has also provided guidelines on internal assessment. “Internal assessment will be carried out as per the existing scheme across the year except that it will be done twice, and both will contribute equally in the final assessment. The evaluation by teachers for internal assessment/practical/project work needs to be based on evidence of the student’s performance throughout the academic session,” the DoE order stated.For subjects which have 80-mark theory paper, the division of 10 marks assigned to each term has been divided as Periodic test (3 marks), Multiple Diverse Assessment (2 marks), Portfolio (2 marks), and subject enrichment activities (3 marks).Periodic tests will be restricted to three in each subject per year, and schools can decide how many tests to conduct during each term. Multiple diverse assessment will include activities from classroom pedagogy, including group discussion, quizzes, blogs, debates, and art-integrated or sports activities.For Class 11, subjects with an 80-mark theory paper, such as Mathematics, Sociology, Political Science, Business Studies, Accounts and History, theory paper in each term will be worth 40 marks each. The remaining 10 marks, in each term, will be for internal assessment and projects.For subjects with a 70-mark theory paper, such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, Geography, and Psychology, the Term-1 theory paper will be of 35 marks and the internal assessment and project will carry 15 marks. Skill subjects will have a 30-mark theory paper and 20-mark practical or internal assessment component in both terms.The internal assessment break-up for Class 11 is different for subjects with 20-mark internal assessment component and the ones with 30-mark practical/assessment component.For instance, subjects with 30-mark practicals will have a 15-mark practical exam per term. This will be converted to pen-and-paper test if the lockdown continues till the date of the exam. For the 20-mark internal assessment, students will have to prepare one project for the session that will be divided into two parts for both the terms, carrying 10 marks for each term.Bharat Arora, general secretary of the Action Committee for Unaided Private Schools, said, “We will hold a discussion on the revised assessment scheme with the private school principals on the matter to see how it can be implemented.”While there is little clarity over how board exams will be held in 2022-23, education department officials said adopting the two-term assessment similar to the board exam pattern this year was a safe option keeping the uncertainties of the pandemic in mind.A senior education department official, requesting anonymity, said, “Due to the pandemic and its impact on schooling, we had two options in front of us. Either to continue with the previous assessment system or think of a new way for evaluation. Instead of introducing something new, the department adopted the two-term assessment proposed by CBSE as it is the most viable option."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/classes-9-11-in-delhi-to-follow-cbse-s-exam-structure-says-state-govt-101630606334171.html
02-09-2021||Lucknow||Ganga Expressway gets cabinet approval||: In a push to infrastructure development, the state cabinet on Thursday gave a go ahead to the 594-km Meerut to Prayagraj controlled-access Ganga Expressway, which is to come up at an estimated cost of ₹36, 230 crore. It also approved a proposal to develop Lalitpur airstrip into an airport in Bundelkhand region of the state. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath presided over the meeting of the state cabinet that approved the Greenfield six-lane expressway project, expandable to 8-lane, having a maximum permissible speed limit of 120 km per hour. Briefing media persons, minister for MSMEs and government spokesman Siddharth Nath Singh said the network of expressway projects coming up in the state would give a push to achieving the objective of making Uttar Pradesh a trillion-dollar economy. He said the RFP (request for proposal) and RFQ (request for quotation) documents had been approved for the project to be implemented on develop, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) basis under Public Private Partnership model. He said 60-day timeline to complete the bidding for project has been approved. He said there would be a provision for an airport on the expressway near Shahjahanpur. He said the expressway project would be implemented in four groups (each group having three packages). The estimated cost of the civil works would be ₹22,125 crore while the cost of buying the land is estimated to be ₹22,125 crore. An official press release claimed the Ganga Expressway project was second largest expressway project in the country that would cover 12 districts and provide smooth connectivity with the state capital, Poorvanchal Expressway, Agra-Lucknow-Yamuna expressway. It said project would lead to creation of about 20,000 jobs. Singh said the bidding process was being started only after acquiring about 93 percent land for the project. In an obvious indication towards the Samajwadi Party led government, he said the RFP and RFQ should be floated only after acquiring 80 percent land. “Our friends (previous government) launched the Poorvanchal Expressway project without meeting the requirement of acquiring 80 percent land to get support (of concessionaires) in the 2017 assembly elections,” he said. Singh said the chief minister had asked for areas for development of industry along the expressway. About expansion of Lalitpur airstrip to an international airport, Singh said besides the defence corridor, a drug park was also coming up in Bundelkhand region. He said there was a need for development of an international airport there as Jhansi airport was not a civil airport. He said 12.79 hectare land of defence ministry would be transferred for the airport and the state cabinet had approved a proposal to transfer a gram sabha land to defence ministry in lieu of this land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ganga-expressway-gets-cabinet-approval-101630605973992.html

In this sequence, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also released schemes from time to time to benefit people. No one will be deprived of basic necessities or die of hunger in Uttar Pradesh. I am happy to inform that out of them, 4.56 lakh are new beneficiaries. The quarterly instalment is being sent to these accounts for the first time,” he added.“Older people have a wealth of experiences. They are our guide. The central and state governments are working with a sense of service to manage the life and livelihood of each and every senior citizen. Whether the elderly needs ration or medical treatment at the time of illness, everything is being provided free of cost. Not only this, ‘Elderly Helpline 14567’ (Elderline) has been specially issued where any senior citizen can contact and get help 24×7”, he was quoted as saying in the statement.The CM also interacted with the old age pension beneficiaries of various districts virtually, where he inquired about the health of all . He also instructed the district magistrates to provide the benefit of Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana to every needy.Yogi said elderly people were neglected during the earlier governments. No one used to pay attention to them but today many efforts were being made for the happy life of old people, he added.

02-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC says Ankit Gujjar's death in Tihar clear case of custodial violence||The Delhi high court on Thursday said the nature of injuries sustained by inmate Ankit Gujjar who died in Tihar jail clearly revealed that it was a case of custodial violence.Stating that the incident involved a larger issue of extortion by jail officials, Justice Mukta Gupta said there was every implication of extortion by jail officials.The court reserved its order on a petition by Gujjar's family members for transfer of investigation into his alleged murder to the CBI.Dubbed as one of the most wanted criminals in Uttar Pradesh with multiple counts of homicide and robbery, 29-year-old Gujjar was found dead in his cell in Tihar jail on August 4.“The issue is the moment a phone is recovered (from the deceased), your (jail) officer is asking for money. It is a case that for every implication, money is extorted from family. It is far more serious. What has happened to the deceased must have happened to others also,” the judge said.“The nature of injury clearly shows that it is a case of custodial violence... It is writ large that it is a case of custodial violence and who has done it is also very clear”, she added.In the petition, the family alleged Gujjar was being harassed by the jail officials as he was “unable to meet their regularly increasing demands for money” and was murdered “as a part of pre-planned conspiracy”.On August 18, the court had sought status reports from Delhi Police and jail authorities on the plea.Counsel for the family, advocate Mehmood Pracha said that “police was not conducting investigation in proper format” as the DVR of the CCTV installed in the jail was yet to be recovered and the aspect of extortion of money by jail officials through online transactions was not being looked into.“The status report filed before the magistrate and status report filed here say that the injury is a minor injury. The post-mortem shows 12 grievous injuries,” he said.Counsel for the prosecution Ranbir Kundu said the investigation by local police was ongoing in a fair manner.He informed the court the deceased, who was found to be in possession of a mobile phone amongst other things, had attacked the Deputy Superintendent (DS) earlier in the day and as of now, action has been initiated against certain officials.“He may have committed an offence (but) this man (jail official) not only beats him up but gets CCTV closed.. show the MLC of the DS.. This is not a case of simpliciter departmental action. A life has been lost. 12 injuries show it is case of custodial torture,” the court remarked.In its status report, the jail administration has stated that four officials, including the deputy superintendent, have been suspended and eight others have been shifted from Central Jail No.3 and ordered to report to the Superintendent, PHQ till further orders.The police officer said that as per the statement of eyewitnesses, “30-35 people came with dandas (sticks)” to beat up the deceased and that as per the jail administration, CCTV cameras were switched off due to technical issues.He added that aspect of financial transactions was being looked into and sought three weeks' time for further probe.As per the police status report, 28 witnesses have been examined and section 323/341 (voluntarily causing hurt/ wrongful restraint) IPC have been added to the original FIR registered under section 302/34 (murder) IPC.During the course of the proceedings, the court orally observed that transferring the case at this stage may delay further investigation.In the petition filed through Pracha and Shariq Nisar, the family has alleged that the jail authorities in Tihar are operating an “organised extortion syndicate” and the police was trying to manipulate the investigation in order to save and shield the culprits.Although an FIR for commission of offences of murder was registered after the directions of a magisterial court, “a free and fair investigation by a neutral investigation agency would inevitably lead to invocation of not just further provisions under the Penal Code but also under special laws such as the MCOCA, Prevention of Corruption Act and Prevention of Money Laundering Act”, it saidThe plea alleges “culpability of the entire administration” on the ground that the CCTV were ordered to be shut down by an official at the time of when the deceased was beaten.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-says-ankit-gujjar-s-death-in-tihar-clear-case-of-custodial-violence-101630604664074.html
02-09-2021||Lucknow||Cong gears up for UP polls with camps, public contact drive||The Congress appears to be racing against time as it prepares the party organisation for the Uttar Pradesh assembly election due in early 2022.The Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) is holding 700 camps to train its nearly two lakh (0.2 million) workers and the process of appointing presidents of nearly 58,000 village units and setting up booth committees.“Our training camps will end by September 7. We hope to complete setting up the organisation structure up to the grassroots level by October 2. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has given indications about starting her tours from a district in the state’s eastern region. Her tours may begin after the 100-day Prashikshan se Parakram (training for valour) programme ending on September 7,” said a senior Congress leader.Priyanka addressed the party workers at some of the training camps via video conference last week. She asked them to go door to door to connect with the people and listen to their problems.“We got a very good response to the party’s Jai Bharat Jan Sampark mega campaign launched to connect with the people from August 19 to 21. About 20,000 senior leaders went door to door during the mega campaign to connect with nearly nine million (90 lakh) people and listened to their problems,” said another party leader. The Congress began revamping its organisation structure soon after its debacle in the 2019 Lok Sabha election in which it won only one seat, Rae Bareli, in Uttar Pradesh. Before that, the Congress contested the 2017 assembly election in alliance with the Samajwadi Party. It won only seven seats in the 403-member state assembly. Two out of the seven Congress MLAs (Adit Singh and Rakesh Singh from Rae Bareli and Harchadpur assembly seats of Rae Bareli) are considered close to the BJP though they continue to be Congress legislators.It remains to be seen whether the Congress will have an alliance in the 2022 assembly election. Priyanka recently indicated (in an informal interaction with media persons in Lucknow) that she was open to an alliance with like-minded parties. A Congress booklet brought out recently targeted the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alike giving indications that the party was gearing up for “ekla chalo” (going it alone) in the assembly election.Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu said the Congress was ready for polls and would align only with smaller parties in the 2022 UP assembly election. Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra ‘Mona’ said, “We are getting ready to fight the 2022 assembly election on our own. Our sangthan srajan (formation of organisation structure) is in the final stages and camps are in progress to impart training to the party workers.” Senior Congress leader PL Punia said, “As far as the issue of an alliance with any political party is concerned, the Congress is getting ready to fight the 2022 assembly election on its own.”“The Congress should reach out to the masses with a positive approach. It’s very clear that the Congress has not worked out any concrete programme and if the party is going to the people with a mindset to target the BJP only, this is going to be a futile exercise,” said prof SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cong-gears-up-for-up-polls-with-camps-public-contact-drive-101630604714038.html
02-09-2021||Other||Atrocities on Brahmins rising in UP: BSP leader||Citing the killing of gangster Vikas Dubey in a police encounter in July last year, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra on Thursday attacked the BJP government for what he termed the “rising atrocities on Brahmins” under the present dispensation in the state. The gangster was killed allegedly in a police shootout while being brought from Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh to Kanpur. The incident took nearly a week after his henchmen gunned down eight policemen in Kanpur’s Bikru village on July 2-3, 2020.“Without any court case and hearing you picked Vikas Dubey and shot him dead in the name of Bikru massacre alleging he was a criminal and trying to escape by opening fire. You justify it by saying he was a criminal. It is okay but what about others who were either arrested or killed,” Mishra said while addressing “Prabuddh Varg Sammelan” (intellectuals’ conference) in Deoria. Under “Prabuddh Varg Sammelan”, the BSP has been conducting its Brahmin outreach programme since its first conference in Ayodhya on July 23. “The wife of slain gangster Amar Dubey was arrested and later it was found that she was a juvenile. The party chief took this case personally and directed the DM to ensure that she doesn’t get bail at any cost. In fact, they asked the officials to prepare a list of all influential Brahmins in Kanpur and the adjoining region and frame them in false cases. And that’s what exactly happened. More than half-a-dozen people (Brahmins) were killed in encounters,” Mishra alleged.“Remember how safe women and daughters were during the BSP rule (in UP) unlike today when they fear to step out of their homes due to prevailing ‘Goonda Raj’ (hooliganism),” he claimed. On farmers’ issue, Mishra said, “They (government) promised to double their income but they didn’t do so. Instead, they lowered it to zero. See what is happening with agitating farmers in Haryana. Our party is standing with farmers in their movement (against three farm laws).”On queries of farmers on suspected dengue cases and deaths due to it in west UP, Mishra alleged that first the UP government completely failed to check the pandemic outbreak and that the present situation was a part of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/atrocities-on-brahmins-rising-in-up-bsp-leader-101630604415422.html

Ashish Shukla, the director of ‘Chhanv Foundation’ thanked Deepika Padukone for her generous act. “Acid attack survivor Bala found new hope, as Deepika Padukone extended a helping hand to save her life. Bala, who is suffering from a life-threatening kidney disease, urgently needs a kidney transplant to survive. Word reached Deepika and she donated an exceedingly generous amount of ₹15,00,000 to the ‘Save Bala’ campaign,” Shukla stated. “Bala is a real-life star who also featured on The Kapil Sharma show. She has inspired many by surviving even the toughest of times but is now forced to battle for life,” said Ajay Tomar, the public relations officer at Sheroes Hangout, a café run and managed by acid attack survivors. Since 2017, Bala had been associated with Sheroes Hangout, run and managed under the umbrella of Chhanv Foundation.“Her condition is deteriorating every day due to the failure of both her kidneys and she is somehow surviving on dialysis. Without a kidney transplant, she won’t live to see another day. Being an acid attack survivor, her weakened immunity is already a threat to her life,” a press statement released by ‘Chhanv Foundation on Thursday, read. Bala still requires further monetary help to come out of this tragedy, and hence, the Chhanv Foundation is seeking as much support as possible. A fundraising campaign called ‘Save Bala’ has been started on the crowd-funding platform ‘Milaap’, to not only ensure that Bala gets quality medical treatment, but also to provide the survival cost for her family, Ashish Shukla said. “Moreover, there are 150 different survivors with stories like Bala, whom Chhanv wants to help through its campaign called ‘Smile Goal Hai’. If more generous people like Deepika Padukone come forward to help these survivors, lives can be transformed,” the press statement read.

02-09-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 vaccination: Private hospitals told to adhere to govt guidelines||All private hospitals empanelled with the district health department for Covid-19 vaccination were on Thursday directed to properly follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for vaccination after senior health officials found several anomalies during an inspection of the Covid-19 vaccination centre (CVC) of a private hospital in Sector 47. A team comprising district immunisation officer, Dr MP Singh, and urban nodal officer, Dr Amandeep, undertook a surprise check of Cloudnine Hospital. “Importantly, the temperature logbook of vaccine storage was not properly maintained. The last entry was done on August 28. The temperature logbook is required to keep a record of temperature at cold chain points of vaccine storage. It helps in preserving the quality of vaccines,” said Dr MP Singh. According to Singh, government health centres have digital data loggers installed to monitor the temperature of vaccines at the cold chain points. It alerts about any change in the temperature by sending a message on mobile phones or emails. “Many private hospitals lack this digital device. Therefore, they have to maintain a logbook, where the temperature has to be entered twice a day,” said Singh. Officials found other irregularities, such as the lack of a proper mechanism to dispose of biomedical waste generated during the vaccination. “Used needles from previous days were on the vaccination table,” stated a report prepared by the health department, which was accessed by HT. According to the report, the vaccination staff was not fully aware of the features of the Co-WIN portal. Besides, officials said that the vaccination area was set up in the basement without ventilation, as there were multiple AC exhaust fans in the basement that made the area noisy and hot. The vaccination centre allegedly lacked adequate space for seating arrangements at the observation area, where people have to wait for 30 minutes after taking the vaccine shot. The management of the hospital refused to comment on the matter when contacted. Singh said that the hospital has been directed to eliminate the irregularities, failing which they will be removed from the empanelled list of Covid-19 hospitals. “An order has been circulated to medical superintendents of all private hospitals to conduct vaccination at their CVCs as per the guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare,” said Singh. About 85 private hospitals are empanelled with the district health department. Of these, at least 21 are administering Covid-19 vaccine doses. On Thursday, 20, 297 doses were administered at 91 CVCs. Of these, 13,182 doses were given at government health centres and 7,115 at private hospitals. Until now, over 2,435,768 vaccine doses have been administered. According to the government data, the district has achieved a 100% target in first dose inoculation by reaching out to almost 1,632, 456 people. Additional 300,000 people are yet to be covered as per the estimates, accounting for the influx of the migratory population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-vaccination-private-hospitals-told-to-adhere-to-govt-guidelines-101630603098975.html

The workers gathered at Rajiv Chowk for a protest and later submitted a memorandum addressed to the Haryana governor to the deputy commissioner of Gurugram at the Mini Secretariat. Senior Congress leader Ajay Singh Yadav, while addressing the workers, said, “The farm laws are anti people and they must be taken back. The decision of the government to amend the Land Acquisition Act (where consent of owners is not mandatory) is also retrograde decision and it harms the interests of the landowners.” Former Congress minister Sukhbir Kataria, who also participated in the protest, said, “The common man, working class and labour is suffering because of high inflation and this government has no solution for problems faced by people,” he said. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, refuted the allegations and said that the government was ready to hold discussions with farmers and allowed them to protest peacefully. “It is not the BJP but Congress which has a history of firing at farmers and workers across the country. The government has allowed peaceful protests but these should not become a tool to spread anarchy,” said Raman Malik, BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/congress-workers-protest-farmer-lathicharge-changes-to-land-acquisition-norms-101630603097859.html

A delegation of residents and shop owners had also met MLA Sudhir Singla on Monday regarding the matter. Rajiv Sinha, the president of Essel Tower residents’ welfare association, said that they organised a protest to create awareness and send a message to the administration that residents were not in favour of having spas in their neighbourhood. “Two years ago, the residents of MG road were forced to organise a similar protest against illegal activities in pubs and bars, after which action was taken against them. We don’t want a similar menace to grow again,” he said. Akash Oberoi, a shop owner in MGF Mall, said, “If the number of spas increase, visitors and families start avoiding such malls and there is loss of business. Also, there is a very thin line separating the legal and illegal activities in these spas and monitoring them becomes difficult.” Member of legislative assembly Sudhir Singla said, “I have assured residents that no illegal activities will be allowed in the garb of running a business. People are free to work but there should be no violation of rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/new-spas-should-not-be-allowed-in-city-mg-road-residents-shop-owners-101630603096676.html

These kits will be used on any symptomatic student to quickly identify positives case and isolate them. The nodal officer will ensure that home isolation protocols are strictly followed by the parents of children who test positive,” Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said. Schools in Haryana reopened for students of classes 9 to 12 from July 16, and classes 6 to 8 from July 23.

Vaccinations for students younger than 18 years is yet to start.Over 19,000 teachers in government and private schools were to be vaccinated in the district, of which everyone has at least received one dose, officials said. According to Yadav, doctors working with the health department under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) have been appointed as school Covid-19 nodal officers to ensure Covid-19 guidelines are followed in classrooms. “There are 12 teams of RBSK in the district who will regularly visit schools to check whether they are adopting preventive measures in classrooms. The student turnout in schools is currently low. With this move, we will build trust among parents to send their children to schools,” said Dr Yadav. Even as the cases are on a constant decline, Yadav said that they don’t want to take a risk in schools. On Thursday, eight new cases of coronavirus infection were confirmed. At least 76 cases are currently active, while the total tally reached 181,075.

The police said that a case under sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Palam Vihar police station on Wednesday. In his complaint, Singh stated that the suspect approached him in March 2020, offered to sell a 100-square yard plot in Om Vihar and told him that he wanted to finalise the sale at the earliest as he was in dire need of money. Singh said that a deal was finalised for ₹24.5 lakh and an initial amount of ₹50,000 was paid in June 2020, for which a receipt was issued.As the colony is an irregular one located within 900 metres of an IAF ammunition depot, a sale deed could not be registered. Due to this, the suspect got a power of attorney executed at a Ghaziabad court, Singh said. However, these papers were later found to be forged.Singh said that during the course of proceedings, he paid ₹17 lakh through bank transfers and the remaining sum in cash. After completing the deal, Singh started construction at the site when he was approached by the plot owner, who got the work stopped. When Singh tried to contact the suspect, his phone was switched off and following subsequent investigation, realised that he had been duped.Singh also stated that he had managed to get through to the suspect on one occasion, but he refused to return the money.Subash Boken, the spokesperson for Gurugram police, said that a case has been registered in the matter. “The matter is under investigation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fraud-resident-duped-of-24-5-lakh-in-plot-sale-based-on-forged-documents-101630603093749.html

In Shimla, the biggest challenge before the health authorities was the lack of manpower. A mere 1,456 health workers were involved in the inoculation drive in Shimla district as against 4,000-6,000 workers in other districts. Even small districts such as Bilaspur had far more manpower than the Shimla.Many of them had walk up to eight hours to reach remote regions such as Dodra Kwar to reach session sites, as parts of the district have limited road connectivity. Heavy rains, landslides leading to road blocks and snowfall in the month of April further added to their trouble, but the health teams successfully organised 9,017 sessions, since the beginning of the inoculation drive on January 16, to cover the targeted population. Ran Singh, a Class-IV employee, posted at a primary health centre, Jiskoon in Dodra Kwar, said he used to start his journey on foot at 5am to reach Kwar and receive the vaccine from the cold chain point at 7.30am. Then he would set out for Jiskoon, stopping for just a few minutes to have his breakfast. He would then hand over the vaccine carrier to health worker Jaymatti and wait for her to return with the leftover vaccine after completion of sessions at Jiskoon. Jaymati would walk up the steep hills to reach the vaccination site in the afternoon and after completing the vaccination session, return to Jiskoon at 8pm. On the way, she would submit the details of each beneficiary to the medical officers at Chirgaon, 80 kms away from Kwar, for online updation on the COWIN portal. “It was difficult task but I am happy that I have been able to serve my people. I also got to interact with the Prime Minister due to my work. That was the icing on the cake,” says Jaymatti, who hails from Jiskoon village, situated 7,700-ft above the sea-level in the remote Dodrakwar subdivsion in Shimla district. She carried out eight vaccination sessions on her own at Jakha and surrounding areas and vaccinated a total of 1, 070 beneficiaries.Another health worker, Rubha Devi, says she had to carry the vaccine from the cold chain point at Kwar to Pandhar. The village is accessible only by a trek stretching 5-6 hours. She would start her journey with peon Baji Lal at 8am, reach Futadhar by a vehicle and then cross Rupin river, followed by a steep climb uphill through a dense forest, before finally reaching Pandhar at 2.30pm. On April 23, there was a moderate snowfall in Tikker block of the district. However, it did not deter the health workers from completing the task. Shimla chief medical officer Surekha Chopra says, “Whatever success we achieved, the credit for it goes to our team members who faced the challenges bravely to ensure the entire population is vaccinated. It was especially challenging in remote regions but they did not give up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shimlas-health-workers-brave-tough-terrain-rough-weather-to-ensure-100-vaccination-101630602914075.html
02-09-2021||Lucknow||Now, cases of leptospirosis to fore in Mathura||LUCKNOW Cases of leptospirosis, a rare bacterial infection, have come to fore in Mathura where dengue and scrub typhus cases were reported recently. “Some cases of Leptospirosis have now been reported from Mathura. It is spread through urine of animals and via water,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary, medical health, in a press conference on Thursday. “As leptospirosis spreads through water, we need to ensure that stagnant water is removed immediately and personal hygiene is given priority. Officials of nagar nigam and panchayati raj have been asked to ensure cleanliness,” said Prasad. Senior officials from state health department had been sent to Mathura and Firozabad to take stock of the situation and the health facilities being provided to people, he said. “Sporadic cases of leptospirosis are reported but the threat is higher during monsoon as the infection spreads more in flood-prone areas or where water is stagnant for days,” said Dr Sheetal Verma, senior faculty, microbiology at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU). Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that comes from animals. It’s spread through their urine, especially from dogs, rodents, and farm animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-cases-of-leptospirosis-to-fore-in-mathura-101630602554002.html

The ED had filed three applications after learning that the I-T department had placed fresh documents in their case files in August 2020. The central agency had initiated action against Raninder under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) after the I-T department alleged that he had lied, under oath, about the trusts that he allegedly owned in Virgin Islands. Raninder had even appeared before the ED in connection with a FEMA violation, and the agency wants to inspect or obtain the documents to carry forward its investigation. The CM and his son had challenged the lower court order on the grounds that no opportunity of hearing had been given to them before allowing the ED’s petition. They had claimed that this was against the principles of natural justice. Their plea added that the ED had no locus standi to file an application for inspection before the trial court, as to date no cognisance has been taken against them.The court of justice Kumar, however, observed that the perusal of proviso to Rule 2 (inspection of judicial records) reveals that a stranger to a civil or criminal case may, for sufficient reason shown to the satisfaction of court, inspect the record of such pending cases. “Thus, the matter regarding the inspection was between the ED and the court. So, it was for the court seized with the matter to record its satisfaction and allow the inspection of the record to the stranger,” the order says. The order adds, “As discussed above, in view of the inspection rules, a stranger to a case can inspect civil as well as criminal pending file for sufficient reasons and the ED is an independent investigation agency under the FEMA. The department has the locus standi to inspect the file and, in case, the inspection to the ED is not allowed which is the competent authority under law to conduct the investigation, it would create hurdles in investigation.” The judge has directed the parties to the case to appear before the trial court on September 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-court-allows-ed-to-inspect-files-of-i-t-cases-of-cm-son-raninder-101630602493524.html

02-09-2021||Lucknow||Antibodies also develop a month after 2nd dose of Covid vax: Study||LUCKNOW Protective levels of antibodies generally develop weeks after the first dose of Covid vaccine, but they also develop a month after the second shot, says a study. “It is considered that antibodies develop weeks after the first dose of vaccination. Our study showed they (antibodies) might take a longer time to develop,” said Prof MM Faridi, principal, Era’s Lucknow Medical College and Hospital (ELMCH) that conducted the study. This healthcare centre was a Level 3 Covid hospital and admitted about 5,000 patients.ELMCH vaccinated 6,500 staff working on the campus, and from among them, chose 246 for the antibodies’ study. Samples were taken one month after their first jab and a month after the second dose. Covishield was used for all 6,500 staff members. “As many as 17 people had not developed antibodies after a month of their first jab. Among them, 14 developed antibodies when we checked their sample taken a month after the second dose,” said Faridi. The three who did not develop antibodies (out of the 246) included two individuals in 30-39 years age group and one 60-plus. “Our study is significant also because we tested people who had worked during the second wave when the Delta variant caused problems to most people with Covid,” he said. Out of the 246, only 18 contracted the Covid infection post vaccination and these included 10 doctors and eight other health staff. Eleven were men and seven females. As many as 246 medical staff (156 male and 90 female) were chosen randomly from among those fully immunised between January and July. After one month of inoculation of both doses of Covishield, it was found that antibodies were generated in 93% (229) staff members while 17 employees didn’t have any antibodies. The average antibodies level was 11.76, said Dr Siddharth Chandel. The study showed that young beneficiaries of vaccination had better levels of antibodies compared to the elderly. “Vaccine is a strong protection against Covid infection as those who got infected again did not have any serious problem and did not require hospitalisation,” said Faridi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/antibodies-also-develop-a-month-after-2nd-dose-of-covid-vax-study-101630602013560.html

02-09-2021||Patna||Bihar panchayat polls hit rural job schemes||The model code of conduct for the 11-phase panchayat polls in Bihar, which came into effect on August 24 and will remain in place till the conclusion of he poll process in December, is set to hit the state’s target of creating over 20 crore mandays to provide jobs to the rural poor under MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), as also the construction of several lakhs of rural affordable houses under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Grameen) during this fiscal, officials familiar with the matter said.While the model code of conduct doesn’t disallow work on ongoing projects, no new scheme can be launched as long as it’s in place.Officials said the panchayat polls, staggered from September to December, would consume four precious months during which new land related work is launched after rainy season. The biggest impact of the disruption, officials said, will be on the rural poor, including migrants, who returned home over the last two years amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown that led to loss of jobs. Officials said work on creating assets like ponds, ahars, pynes and renovation of buildings would remain at a standstill. In last five months, the government has created 9 crore man days against its target of 20 crore for this fiscal. Floods in over 20 districts have already slowed down the job creation associated with the afforestation drive to plant two crore saplings by job seekers under the rural employment guarantee scheme. Sources said 1.25 crore saplings have been planted so far and the afforestation drive is likely to remain a bit slow in the next few months. “Panchayat polls will affect our target of creating man days as September to December is a key time when land related works are done,” said C P Khanduja, director, social forestry, and commissioner, MGNREGA. Khanduja said they had instead expected to increase the target to 24-25 crore man days but the slowdown in works could hit the progress. MGNREGA is a flagship centrally sponsored scheme to provide at least 100 days of work to unskilled workers holding job cards. “We do hope we will be meeting the target of 20 crore man days under MGNREGA because we will have at least three months, from January to March, to speed up works,” he said. Khanduja said the average creation of man days for job card holders would be around 1.25 crore during the period of model code of conduct. Similarly, construction of rural houses under PMAY(G), wherein beneficiaries having land are given monetary assistance ( ₹1.30-1.50 lakh) to make their houses concrete (pucca) from is also set to take a hit. Officials said the backlog of completing around four lakh houses from last year’s targets and construction of new houses as per this year’s target of 11.49 lakh houses will be severely impacted. “As the rural polls are highly localised exercise, it will be difficult to convince beneficiaries to complete their houses as there are issues of logistics and rural labour. Monitoring is another issue as majority of rural officials at the panchayat level would be engaged in poll exercise,” said a senior officials in the rural development department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-panchayat-polls-hit-rural-job-schemes-101630599134726.html

02-09-2021||Patna||Stadiums in Bihar: No boundary walls, water stream on ground||The stadium built a few years ago at Jinhara-Lakshmipur village in Jamui district of Bihar has a water stream cutting through it. It also doesn’t have a boundary wall. Women now use it on Chhath Puja to offer tributes to the Sun God. The one at Koelwar in Bhojpur district is only a shade better. It has a pavilion, but the ground is uneven. The sorry state of stadiums came to light during a meeting held on August 24 by the youth affairs directorate of the culture department, which had in 2007 planned 534 stadiums in the state, one in every block. Between 2008-2009 and 2017-2018, it approved the design plan of 306 stadiums. Today, less than one fourth of the 534 stadiums have been constructed.And of the 115 stadiums said to be ready, half a dozen have no boundary walls, officials said. “We have formed a team of officials to visit and review the condition of all the stadiums and submit the status report,” Bandana Preyashi, who has recently joined the art, culture and youth affairs department as secretary, said. Mithilesh Kumar, deputy director of the youth affairs directorate, said many shocking facts about the stadiums were revealed during the review session. “It was expected that all the 306 stadiums which were approved must be ready, but only 115 were found ready,” he said. Officials said 66 stadiums are under construction while the process is on to start work on 125 stadiums. “Majority of stadiums said to be ready lack sports infrastructure,” said Kumar.The official said fund for the project was initially released to the respective district administration for construction work. “But in 2010, the project was handed over to the building construction department. For the last few years, it’s being handled by the recently formed Bihar State Building Construction Corporation,” he said. “Budget of the stadiums too have been revised considering the current rate of construction material,” he said. Three categories of stadiums were planned in the state. The first was a football stadium to be developed over 115x 95 metres at an estimated budget of ₹54.74 lakh. The second was a medium size stadium over 150x120 metres with a 300-metre-long track to be developed at a cost of ₹68. 23 lakh. The third category was a big stadium with a 400-metre-long track to be developed over 200x130 metres at a cost of ₹74.89 lakh. When contacted, Kumar Ravi, secretary of building construction department, said the department and the Bihar State Building Construction Corporation have been working on the project. “We are trying to get the works done fast at the sites which are free from encroachments. This is our priority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/stadiums-in-bihar-no-boundary-walls-water-stream-on-ground-101630598533509.html

Justice Arvind Sangwan recused from hearing on Thursday while recording that it has come to his notice that in the year 1986-1988, he had represented Ranjit Singh and his father in a civil suit in Kurukshetra. Now, the case has been transferred to the chief justice for placing it before some other judge. It was on August 24 that justice Sangwan had restrained a special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court, Panchkula, from pronouncing the final verdict in the murder case, two days before the final order. He had acted on the plea of Ranjit Singh’s son, Jagseer Singh, who had sought directions for the transfer of the case to any other court in the region. Ranjit Singh was murdered in 2002. As per the CBI, he was murdered as Ram Rahim suspected that he was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter highlighting sexual exploitation of female disciples on the Dera premises. The son had questioned adjournments granted by the CBI judge a number of times since joining and also levelled allegations against CBI public prosecutor KP Singh for “interfering” in the “administration of justice” and “influencing” the proceedings.

Badal village is the native place of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president and former deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and state finance minister Manpreet Badal. A senior politician owns a huge chunk of land in the area, and this was also a point of reference to investigate for the SIT. On May 22, a team of the state excise department that joint commissioner Naresh Dubey led had raided an orchard at Badal village. A large quantity of Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA), raw material for liquor, thousands of filled and empty bottles, fake holograms, caps, cartons and labels of major brands of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) and country-made liquor of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Daman and Diu were seized in this raid. Three persons were arrested from the spot on May 22 while the role of two other suspects is still being verified, he added.The SIT was formed after allegations surfaced that the operators of the improvised plant had a political connection. Three persons namely Anand Sharma of Hardwar, Pargat Singh and Jashan Singh of Muktsar were arrested from the spot.“The role of two other suspects is still being verified,” new Muktsar SSP Charanjit Singh Sohal said, adding that he had directed the SIT head Kulwant Rai, SP (investigation) to expedite the verification/checking of land details. Sohal added that the role of a politically influential person remains a point of scrutiny that had not been ruled out yet. “An authorised factory is located less than 500m from the illicit unit. An investigation shows that the legal unit was non-functional since January this year, due to administrative reasons. The operation of the improvised unit is being probed from all angles,” he added.“The excise department conducted a raid, and as per protocol, they submitted details to the local police. We are trying to find a suspect, Raja, who the excise department had named as a suspect. We plan to include an official from the excise department in the SIT to conclude the investigation objectively,” SIT head Rai said.Excise joint commissioner Dubey said Muktsar police have recently filed a challan in court against the three accused; the department has not heard anything from the police since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sitprobing-political-links-to-illicit-liquor-unit-in-punjab-s-badal-village-draws-a-blank-101630595473439.html

02-09-2021||Chandigarh||84-day gap for those travelling abroad relaxed, Sundays only for 2nd shot||The Punjab government will allow people in urgent need to travel abroad take the second dose of Covishield without waiting for mandatory 84 days. Also, to better the state’s second dose figures, the government has also decided to hold special sessions every Sunday at government centres for the administration of the second shot. This relaxation for the administration of the second dose has also been extended to foreign nationals needing to return to their countries, health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said in a statement on Thursday. For availing this relaxation in inoculation, the people needing to travel abroad for unavoidable reasons may be asked to produce a copy of travel documents such as visas, confirmed tickets and other documents justifying the urgency for undertaking the travel, he added. This decision has been taken “as several Punjabis travel abroad for studies or some other important reasons”, the minister said. “Coverage of Covid-19 vaccination or 2nd dose to beneficiaries remains critical for the successful impact of the vaccination drive. So, it has been decided to earmark every Sunday for the Covid vaccination session at all government Covid vaccination centres only for administering the second dose among due beneficiaries,” he said. Normal vaccination sessions for the first and second doses of the vaccine will remain the same during the weekdays except Sunday. On the vaccination drive in the state, Sidhu said till August 31, the state had inoculated 1.36 crore people, of which 32.8 had taken both the doses. He appealed to the public to get themselves vaccinated without hesitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/84day-gap-for-those-travelling-abroad-relaxed-sundays-only-for-2nd-shot-101630593438297.html
02-09-2021||Delhi||Teachers in a fix as Delhi schools reopen||Schools closed right at the start of the pandemic, and have been shut ever since with the exception of a few days earlier this year. With Covid-19 cases being on an all-time low, the Delhi government recently allowed schools to reopen in a phased manner from September 1, alongside providing a long list of SOPs. This has certainly made the parents go into a dilemma of whether or not to send their children to school right away. But, in a far challenging situation are the city-based school teachers, who are have to be present at school and also make arrangements to settle things back home. “I’ve started hunting for a house help who can assist my mother-in-law in taking care of my two-year-old as well as with the household chores, when I am off to school! Abhi tak toh travelling time bach jata tha and kuchh ghante ki hi class hoti thi, so I was somehow managing. But now it’s difficult to manage house work as well as school work. It’s great that schools are reopening since children were having a pretty difficult time, but for us teachers this only means more hurdles since we need to ensure that the students follow Covid-19 precautions at all time,” says Manisha Verma, a teacher from Model Town. “Functioning on an offline as well as online work module, that too simultaneously, will be stressful,” says Neha Mathur, a teacher from Dhaula Kuan, adding, “We are asked to take online and offline classes together, which is tough. Also, we do ensure that students follow social distancing at school, but what about the time when they go out of the building? Youngsters tend to travel in groups. The last time when reopened schools, teachers were put on duties even on the road outside the school to ensure that the students are maintaining social distancing. This is too taxing after a day long work shift!” The work load will certainly increase, opine teachers about having to physically go to the school. Ruchika Bagai, a teacher from Shalimar Bagh, adds, “Ab school shuru ho jayega toh I will be very busy. Besides teaching, we will have to resume other duties as well. To follow Covid precautions, school buses won’t ply, so if all parents come to drop off and pick up their kids in their vehicles, there will be a major jam near the school and no one will be able to reach on time! And at home, my daughter had been telling me until now, seeing Instagram, ki yeh bana do woh bana do khane ke liye. Now, I’ve told her ki yeh sab nahi ho payega since I’ll have absolutely no time! Yes, we teachers are excited to meet each other, but for things to go back to how they were before the pandemic will take a lot of time. Staff room mein sab saath mein nahi kha sakte, classroom me zyada paas khade hoke samjha nahi sakte, kaafi kuchh badal jayega.” Some teachers even feel that parents need to chip in for them to be able to balance their work. “Parents need to have discussions with their children, especially the younger ones, about having Covid appropriate behaviour in school. Kids love going out, but they have got used to being at home in the past year and a half. Now, they need to be told about the importance of wearing masks,” says Verma, and Mathur adds, “Parents need to shoulder the responsibility with us to ensure that the students are well-informed and stay safe in the Covid times.”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories onFacebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/teachers-in-a-fix-as-delhi-schools-reopen-101630593435816.html

Officially, the station, strategically important due to its location near the international border with Pakistan in Gharinda village, has been under construction since 2006. The transmission station has no staff, but only guards. The stand-out feature of the facility is a 300-meter (nearly 1,000 feet) high broadcasting tower with a range of 100km. This was completed in 2013, but Prasar Bharati authorities inspected it and found that it was bent in its upper portion, effectively putting a full-stop on the project.From 2014 to 2016, there was no movement; in 2017, a 100-meter high tower was built adjacent to it and on 24th of September 2018, transmission was formally started, though temporarily, from the new tower. As things stand now, a 20 kilowatt FM transmitter is radiating sound from this temporary tower, which does not fully reach the downtown areas of both Lahore and Amritsar. Compared to the 300m tower, its range is 50km and it serves only a fourth of the area and the population.In 2020, the Prasar Bharati allocated a budget for dismantling of the bent portion; the same year, the upper portion of the higher towers was dismantled; to date, there has been no reconstruction. The transmission station remains locked, with guards on duty, changing shifts thrice a day. Santosh Rishi, director, AIR Jalandhar, who also looks after the Amritsar station, said, “Only the engineering section of the department can answer your questions, as I only oversee programming.” The engineering department officials are evasive. The purpose of the creation of a long-range AIR, Amritsar, was to use it as a facility for carrying the external service programming, particularly the Urdu Service of the AIR to Pakistan’s second-most populous city. The Urdu Service, however, is neither completely carried by AIR, Amritsar, nor is its frequency is included in the announcement. Harjap Singh Aujla, a retired engineer from the US and social activist, has written a letter to Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur on the issue.“I don’t think any other radio station in India has received such a shabby treatment. An agonising wait indeed,” he said, adding “To accommodate the programmes of the Urdu Service, Des Punjab Service, programming from the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the AIR Rainbow programmes and the Vividh Bharati Service, Amritsar needs three transmitters. We have just one.”Kulwant Singh Ankhi, patron of Amritsar Vikas Manch (AVM), said, “All other radio stations in Punjab have a decent studio. AIR, Amritsar, cannot produce programmes even as this city is the theatre and cultural capital of the state. Amritsar has also been allotted a flawed frequency. Just like every other tourist city, it needs a Vividh Bharati channel of its own.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amritsar-air-station-in-the-works-for-15-years-tower-issue-grounds-progress-101630591513034.html

At 38, Dr Shabnam Nahid is a single parent of two who lives life on her terms. “I grew up hearing, ‘Arre yeh toh langdi hai (Oh, she is lame)’. Even today people call me langdi but their words make me stronger to the extent that I call myself langdi on their face and ask them if it’s a crime and if I should stop working?” says Dr Nahid, who runs a tent and catering business in Jammu. An MBBS graduate from Government Medical College, Jammu, she quit the medical profession in 2006 for varied reasons, such as lack of facilities at the girls’ hostel for differently abled students, ragging and unethical practices besides her deteriorating health. “I was not only disappointed but also getting depressed at the hostel. There were no lifts, no ramps or bathrooms for the differently abled. I quit medicine in 2006 and got married. It was a love marriage,” she says. Dr Nahid’s parents were upset with her decision to quit the profession. “I too was disappointed. I had two children, a son and a daughter, after which my husband abandoned us,” she says. Financial independence Being a differently abled woman with no source of income and two children to raise, Dr Nahid sold all her gold. “In 2017, when I was struggling to be financially independent, I came across the Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojana. In 2018, I decided to set up a tent house and my aim was achieved in 2019,” she says. Considering her health, her parents suggested she open a boutique or a beauty parlour, but she refused. From the government scheme, she took a loan of ₹6.5 lakh and sold her gold for ₹2 lakh to start the business. Children her biggest strength “My parents were not convinced. All tactics were used to discourage me. It was heartbreaking,” says Dr Nahid, who is now recuperating from cataract surgery. “The support which my parents and husband should have extended was given by my children, Shaeryl and Abbrar. My daughter helps me in wearing the calipers and knows how to handle my needs,” she says. Professional challenges Today, she stands tall as the only woman in Jammu to be running a tent house. But she has her own set of challenges. “Some people don’t pay in time; others clear their dues in instalments. Labourers are not easily available and goons in slums create problems for my staff but I’m managing,” she says. “This was a profit-making venture before the Covid-19 pandemic struck and now things are improving,” she says. Dr Nahid admits the mindset of society has not changed even after two decades into the 21st century. “Society and the system are insensitive to a differently abled woman. But I stood my ground and didn’t give up. It’s important to be yourself and be the change.” She dabbled in politics and social work by joining the Aam Aadmi Party and launched a drive against drugs and prostitution in her area. Her aim is to do her bit for society and take her business to new heights.

02-09-2021||Pune||Global village idiot: Sports, Paralympics, Inspiration||As a little boy in Mumbai, I used to watch my father play badminton every day. It was his time with his friends and I used to peep in because it was inspiring. He and his partner, Santhanam Uncle (the two MKs as they were sometimes called since both had the same initials) were birds of a feather - great characters on the court, colourful, animated, competitive, passionate … and sporting. Willing to nurture others and give them opportunities irrespective of background, they wouldn’t give an inch when competing on court. I started playing badminton in the late 1970s, but I started taking it seriously only when Prakash Padukone won the All England in 1980. That year was stellar for Padukone and for many kids in our LIC colony. We all wanted to be Padukone. (I also wanted to be Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, as also Khazan Singh, but that’s a different story.). The newspapers did a great job in keeping us kids informed and it’s been that way in subsequent decades (1990s I took up snooker thanks to Geet Sethi’s charismatic international success). Last week felt like those 1980s and 1990s days. It was an inspiring week. Bhavina Patel won a silver at the Tokyo Paralympics and it could have been a gold quite easily. I watched her play the quarter, semi and final matches, and it was clear that she was competing to win. On her way to the silver medal, she beat players ranked World Number 9, 8, 2, and 3. What struck me was her reported comment after one of the rounds “Please keep supporting me, I can win”. While Zhou Ying of China won the final in straight sets, it was a keen contest. Bhavina had a plan, played to her strengths and wasn’t overawed. Zhou is the current World Number 1 para-paddler and before the Tokyo Olympics had already won five Olympic golds from 2008 to 2016. She had beaten Bhavina in the opening round quiet easily, but had to use her diverse experience to counter the Indian’s strategy in the final. I was reminded of Sharat Kamal’s round of 32 match against eventual champion Ma Long in the Olympics. There was a conviction in Bhavina’s demeanour that she belonged in the gold medal match and it is something that can’t be taught, it evolves - self-belief. I had been waiting for the F46 men’s javelin event to watch Devendra Jhajharia, who is a legend. I had first heard about Jhajharia a decade ago and have been following his achievements off and on (through the internet) since then. Jhajharia - who was the world record holder on the F46 javelin for men - had previously won Paralympic gold in 2004 and 2016. I was keen to see if he still had the fire burning and the desire to perform at the top level of sports. His performance was incredibly inspiring, he not only performed at the top level, he delivered his best performance ever, breaking his own world record with 64.35m in his third throw; however, Sri Lankan Dinesh Priyan Herath Mudiyanselage shattered that with 67.79m on his third throw to take gold. Jhajharia took a well-earned silver, while bronze was won by Sundar Singh also of India. What was inspiring was that Jhajharia improved on his past performances and delivered his best - which is all that any human being should constantly aspire for: continuous improvement. Winning and losing, medals and records are a byproduct. There were many great stories in the Paralympics from across the world, just as there had been great stories in the Olympics. And like the Olympics, I followed the sports I enjoy playing and watching. Our children were curious at what I was reading and watching on my phone from time to time and excited about the events and the competitions. Two of them have taken up fencing since the Olympics and Paralympics (with plastic light sabres of the Star Wars kind). And here’s the thing about kids: they don’t perceive the abilities or disabilities nor the colour of skin or religion nor gender nor financial status - adults put it in their heads by drawing attention to the differences. The week was also inspiring because the government, industry, and media have been visibly supporting Paralympics and Paralympians, as they had Olympians. The media coverage has been extensive and that is significant because the fourth estate can lead the way to eventual change in societal attitudes by providing sustained visibility as a matter of equal opportunities. I also discovered that Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ), the non-profit movement that has been trying to instil the philosophy of self-belief in Indian sports people as a complementary effort to government and sports federations, has been supporting sportspersons in true spirit of equal opportunities. Several of India’s Paralympians (including Jhajharia) are among the 51 athletes supported by OGQ across eight sports disciplines. I was looking at the management team of OGQ and it took me some time to realise that the organisation was founded by two great sportspersons who brought unparalleled laurels to India in their playing days - Prakash Padukone and Geet Sethi. Former world champions giving back to society by doing, by driving others to share their expertise and experience, by providing a nurturing environment for sports people irrespective of barriers, by creating a performance-oriented legacy of sporting generations. That, is truly inspiring. Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

A video of the incident is also making rounds on the social media. According to locals, the SI had allegedly taken ₹20,000 from a youth’s family to help him in a drug case. Family members also alleged that the police had registered a false case against the youth.

Chaudhary, whose real name is Bhupinder Tomar, will be presented in court on September 16.The Delhi court observed that despite the nation celebrating ‘Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav’, the minds of certain individuals’ are "still chained with intolerant and self-centered beliefs".A video apparently made by Chaudhary surfaced on social media on Monday in which the 40-year-old said that neither he nor his organisation "did anything wrong" in Jantar Mantar on August 8. He declared in the video that he would get "himself arrested" on Tuesday. He also said that he will cooperate with the police during the probe. HT could not verify the authenticity of the video.Chaudhary surrendered to the police at Mandir Marg police station in Delhi on Tuesday and was brought to the police station by his supporters on their shoulders amid chants of ‘Jai Shree Ram’ and ‘Pinky Bhaiyya Zindabad’. Chaudhary denied allegations made against him earlier.Earlier, some of the videos on social media showed him and other protesters allegedly shouting communal slogans on August 8. Chaudhary claimed that they were protesting seeking the removal of ‘colonial-era laws’. The court earlier denied him anticipatory bail due to the ‘nature of the allegations’.Along with Chaudhary, former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay was also part of the ‘Bharat Jodo Andolan’ rally.

Which will include information like availability of beds in the city hospitals, booking of ambulance among other details. This will allow people to book a hospital bed from their home and they can also book ambulances at the same time. And as the ambulance is on its way to the hospital, the patient’s information can be provided to the hospital administration, so the hospital can admit the patient on arrival. This will help in the golden hour in medical treatment which could potentially be life-saving for the patient.About her award-winning concept Shivani, said, “During the second wave of Covid-19, many people lost their lives due to lack of information regarding hospital beds, medicine, oxygen. If we had a centralised health care information system we could handle the situation better. That is why I presented the concept of the smart health care system in the HCL Jigsaw competition, which provides centralised information on health services.”HCL Jigsaw provides a platform to young students from Class 6 to Class 9 to assess their cognitive abilities and empowers them to think methodically and holistically about real-world problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-student-s-innovating-concept-can-help-patients-in-golden-hour-101630586472625.html

We tried to bring him out of depression but he was not ready to listen to us,” his wife added.“On Wednesday, he came back home late in the night and started talking depressively. We tried to convince him that if he tries, he will definitely get a job,” she said. An argument ensued, after which the deceased attempted to take his own life, according to the wife.He was taken to the hospital where he later died.“The family members said the man was in depression and killed himself in front of all the family members. We are investigating to check their claims,” said inspector Virendra Chauhan, Jahangirabad.On Saturday, a 51-year-old engineer, who was allegedly depressed after losing his job, died by suicide after slitting his son and daughter’s throats.

02-09-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination drive in Maharashtra’s Thane rises by 4% in 10 days||The Covid vaccination drive in Maharashtra’s Thane district has received a shot in the arm with the administration of 360,000 doses in the last 10 days—a 4% spike across the district, officials said. It was made possible due to allocation of more than 200,000 vaccine doses in each of the last two weeks.The increase in supply of doses has helped in inoculating more than 15,000 people on a daily basis, which even went up to 80,000 beneficiaries on two separate days, officials said.The vaccination drive picked up in the district after more than a month, ending a period when around 50,000 doses were being supplied in one or two instalments a week, much less than the demand.3.19 million among the district’s 9.9 million eligible population have received at least one dose of the vaccine. 2.2 million of these have received a single dose, while 900,000 have been fully vaccinated.“On August 26 and August 29, we received 153,000 and 78,000 vaccine doses respectively; this has helped conduct vaccination drives across the district without any hurdles. In the current situation, when only fully vaccinated are permitted to travel by trains or visit public places, there is an increased demand for vaccination. Moreover, residents in the 18 to 45 age group who got their first dose in May and June are now due for their second jab, leading to a further rise in demand for vaccine doses across the district,” said Dr Manish Renge, Thane’s district health officer.Despite the increase in supply of vaccines, demand in densely populated civic bodies like Thane, Kalyan and Dombivli continues to be very high. Thane Municipal Corporation has covered 1 million population by administering at least one vaccine dose to 470,000 women and 530,000 men.Despite the increased availability of doses, long queues are seen in many of Thane city’s 65 vaccination centres. Special sessions are being organized for those travelling abroad for work or studies. Till now, the city has vaccinated 395 pregnant women, 43 lactating mothers, 17 bedridden residents and 411 transgenders, officials said.“Our mobile vaccination facility has been posted in different parts of the city and we ensure that the destitute are also vaccinated through this facility. Moreover, we organised a special facility for teachers, health care workers and frontline workers at Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa and Parking plaza on Thursday. We do have sufficient infrastructure to vaccinate 50,000 beneficiaries daily but we are currently relying on the vaccine supply from the state government and plan our vaccination drive accordingly,” said Dr Vipin Sharma, commissioner, TMC.Overall, the city has fully vaccinated 11.3% of its population in the 18-60 year age group while 23% in this group have got their first dose. A senior doctor described this age group as “the moving population” and said vaccinating it was crucial to reducing the chances of a third wave of Covid infections.“Once the moving population is fully vaccinated, the impact of the third wave can easily be controlled,” said Dr Tejas Ghude, Pulmonologist, Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-drive-in-maharashtra-s-thane-rises-by-4-in-10-days-101630580591826.html

An unfinished road running by an open nallah (canal) has created a risk for vehicles. “Last month one of my friends slipped on the road, fell close to the nallah and got injured. If there were barricades he would have been less injured. One of the water pipelines is busted and water flows continuously from this nallah. Then there is this road. It needs to be immediately repaired,” said Sapna Mamledar, a resident of the area. Another citizen, Abhishek Kamthe said, “During peak hours there is congestion from both sides. As it is a service road vehicles come from all over. There are no proper street lights. I have seen a two-wheeler rider falling into the nallah.”As this service road connects various localities like Ambegaon Budruk, Dattanagar and Jambhulwadi, it is used by thousands of citizens. Speaking anonymously, a senior engineer of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s road department said, “We have got complaints from citizens, but as there is some issue with the service road area jurisdiction, it is not yet repaired. Certainly we will take up this issue on priority and get it repaired soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ambegaon-budruk-open-nallah-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen-say-commuters-101630580292168.html
02-09-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: Deadly plague gets ‘foreign’ booze binge going in British India||In September 1896, the first case of the bubonic plague was detected in Bombay. It rapidly spread to Poona and other parts of the Presidency and killed thousands. The effects of this calamity were felt for many decades, as the plague kept visiting the Presidency every year until the 1930s.While the economy took a huge blow due to the plague, it had a rather amusing effect on the sales of foreign liquor, especially brandy. In 1897, Poona took 72,000 gallons of brandy and whisky as contrasted with a previous average of 12,000. The same phenomenon was repeated for the next four years, with the consumption of brandy increasing by almost 5% every year. The increase was steeper in the mofussil.When the plague struck the Presidency, a rumour gained ground that consuming brandy cured the disease. It is not known how the rumour started, but records with the Excise Department show that many teetotalers started drinking brandy in a belief that the disease would not kill them. The ravages of the plague in the Deccan and other parts of the mofussil in those years greatly stimulated the drinking of foreign spirit among the up-country natives. There was an increase in drinking among “higher caste” Hindus who adopted the “civilised” liquor of the Europeans in preference to mhowra or toddy spirit. It further helped that “foreign spirits” left little or no smell or taste in the mouth; this was no inconsiderable advantage when a man was ashamed that his friends or family would know that he drank.The significant increase in European population in Bombay Presidency between 1897 and 1908 was another factor that led to an increase in the consumption of foreign liquor.Initially, the Government was happy and intrigued by the jump in the sales of foreign liquor, especially brandy. Once it realised that a rumour was behind the phenomenon, it started monitoring the situation closely. Around 1901, the officials in the Excise Department found that most often there was not one drop of pure brandy in the stuff called “brandy”. The importers, retailers, and bottlers were selling diluted rectified spirit after adding flavours and essences.While brandy was ordinarily understood to be liquor manufactured from the juice of the grape in France, much of the commercially distilled cheap foreign spirit sold in Bombay and Poona markets as brandy and rum, was principally distilled in Hamburg in Germany and Spain, from the feculae of potatoes, and diluted in Bombay or Poona, into which an essence had been put. Occasionally some other bases, such as beets, carrots, Jerusalem artichokes, saw-dust, and cereals were also used. Sometimes the brandies which came from Germany would contain rectified spirit and were flavoured by brandies containing flavours. These were often passed as brandies from France.The practice had been in Bombay and Poona to label as “Rum” the stuff that was made locally from rectified spirit and water. They diluted the spirit, added burnt sugar, and called it rum. Tap water was used for dilution.Messrs Treacher and Co, Cursethee and Sons, Messrs Phillips and Co in Poona got their spirits in bulk and bottled the same. The first two mentioned firms did not colour or compound the same; they only added ordinary water to reduce the strength. Messrs. Phillips and Co was the only firm that added distilled water to reduce the strength of the spirits brought by them.Most of the labels were prepared in Bombay and put on the bottles according to their own fancy by the importers. Frequently, two different labels, e.g., “Superior Old Brandy” and “Fine Pale Brandy” were placed on bottles that had been filled with the spirit from one and the same consignment. Often, “Fine Pale Brandy” did not have a drop of real brandy in it. “Superior Old Brandy” was likely to be closer in flavour and alcohol content to the unadulterated brandy, though it was not distilled in France.The same quality of potato or other patent-still spirit would appear as “Vieux Cognac, Vinne Galle and Co” (with a great display of vine leaves and grapes), as “Imperial brandy, superior quality, four stars” with a portrait of the late Queen, or under a score of other equally fictitious and misleading labels.The patent-still whiskies of Glasgow were similarly described as “Scotch Whisky, Genuine Mountain Dew, finest quality” flanked with Highlanders, or “Fine Old vatted delicious whisky”, or “Finest old Highway whisky” with the names of firms below which were probably in every case fictitious. “Charles Pauline” was a popular brand, and no such firm existed in Europe.Foreign spirit was sold at a trifle over the price of the same quantity of mhowra spirit. The ordinary price for a quart bottle of cheap foreign spirit in Poona was one rupee-two annas in the year 1900, but in some shops, it was sold as low as Re 1, i.e. the price of a bottle of country spirit.The natives did not care for invented brand names. People who bought cheap brandies did not understand the difference between brandy and rum. They only required an ardent spirit to drink. They didn’t buy it for taste or flavour; they initially bought it as a cure for the plague, and later, out of addiction.To put a stop to the malpractices, a “Foreign Liquor Committee” was set up in 1907 in the Bombay Presidency of which AC Logan, ICS, was the chairman. HEE Procter, Chunilal Setalwad, Arthur Powell, Kavasji Edulji Dadachanji were the members. Exporters, excise inspectors, officers, shopkeepers, bottlers, importers, and members of the Temperance societies testified before the committee.The committee prohibited the bottling of foreign spirits or fermented liquors, or rectifying or compounding foreign spirits, and ruled that every receptacle containing foreign liquor must be conspicuously labelled showing clearly the country of manufacture, the name of the bottler, and the place of bottling.Interestingly, the consumption of foreign liquors among the natives declined after 1910. It was the time when the fear of plague had subsided and leaders like Tilak and Dr Mann had together strengthened their fight against alcohol.That story is for some other time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-deadly-plague-gets-foreign-booze-binge-going-in-british-india-101630579751627.html
02-09-2021||Chandigarh||Tribute to teachers who groom life-long learners||Sister Joyce didn’t walk; she glided through the corridors in her white habit that included her spotless white tunic, a white headgear and the silver cross dangling from a silver chain around her neck. History and I could never see eye to eye. I chastised it for being static, morbid and theoretic. I could barely keep my eyes open when the teacher read the chapter in class or summon up the names and dates of birth or death of the monarchs. Despite best efforts, I could rarely score good marks in history as I would fail to satisfactorily describe the various civilisations, or the realms spread across the surface of the earth over a span of not one but numerous centuries. God in His Heaven must have witnessed my conundrum, for in answer to my prayers, he sent Sister Joyce to teach us history as we started the ninth grade. Sister Joyce was a bundle of energy bursting with knowledge and information. As a thumb rule, she never picked up the book to teach in class. Whether it was the First World War, French Revolution or Russian Revolution, the dates, the facts, the outcomes, they were all on her fingertips. She would clothe the bare bones of history with flesh and blood by bringing every character alive in the classroom through her teaching. Whenever in doubt, she would retrieve minuscule slips out of her tunic pockets to check the facts. I still remember the day the Treaty of Versailles was to be signed after an armistice was established between the Allies and the Central Powers post World War I. There was palpable tension in the classroom, which was evident from the pin-drop silence among a class of 40 students. All eyes and ears were riveted to Sister Joyce’s face as she laid out the terms and conditions of the treaty, while also adding the guilt clause along with the already burdensome and humiliating contract. I could imagine myself entering the awe-inspiring Baroque style Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles along with other dignitaries assembled to witness the historical treaty. With every clause that Sister laid out in front of us that was signed by German representatives, I dawdled between a sense of remorse, bitterness, revenge and compunction at the fate of the Germans in particular and the world in general. I wondered if the belligerent parties would stick to their commitments and give a thought to world peace or would they backtrack it all to thwart any attempts of establishing peace. Of course, my latter conjecture turned out to be more potent than the former. Teachers like Sister Joyce are rare. They don’t force students to learn; they don’t try to educate students; they make their students fall in love with learning and education, thereby converting them into life-long learners. Sister Joyce did not stay in our school for long for the very next year she was transferred to another. I was not sad for by that time I had already fallen in love with learning and realised that Sister Joyce needed to touch many more lives like she did mine. The only regret I nurture to this day, is, that I could not stay connected with her. sonrok15@gmail.com The writer is an associate professor at SD College, Ambala Cantt||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tribute-to-teachers-who-groom-life-long-learners-101630579631821.html
02-09-2021||Kolkata||TMC leader Mukul Roy unwell, admitted to Kolkata’s SSKM hospital||Trinamool Congress (TMC) veteran Mukul Roy was admitted to the SSKM hospital in Kolkata on Thursday, according to a report by HT’s sister publication Livehindustan. He was seen walking inside the hospital with his security officials.The Livehindustan report said that Roy was hospitalised due to an increase in his sodium and potassium levels. The 67-year-old politician has been keeping unwell after his wife Krishna died due to post coronavirus disease (Covid-19) complications at a hospital in Chennai in July this year.Mukul Roy, one of the founding members of the TMC and a prominent face in West Bengal politics, left his party and joined the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2017. He fought this year’s assembly elections with the BJP from the Krishnanagar North constituency and won. However, the BJP failed to win the elections and form the government in West Bengal.On June 11, Mukul Roy returned to the TMC with party supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee describing the moment as a “homecoming of the family’s boy” and alleged that the BJP did not allow anyone to live with dignity and peace.The BJP, on many occasions, has slandered Roy for jumping ship. Leader of opposition in Bengal Suvendu Adhikari, a former TMC leader and close aide of Mamata Banerjee, had sent a petition to the Speaker on June 18, seeking disqualification of Roy as the MLA from the Krishnanagar North constituency.Roy’s appointment as the chairman of the public accounts committee (PAC) of the West Bengal assembly in July also drew sharp criticism from the BJP, with eight legislators of the saffron party resigning as heads of various assembly panels in the state. The BJP also told the Calcutta high court last month that Roy’s appointment as the PAC chairman violated a 50-year-old convention of an opposition party MLA getting the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-leader-mukul-roy-unwell-admitted-to-kolkata-s-sskm-hospital-101630576598361.html

The panel was constituted in July and the report is awaited.Retired Indian Forest Service officer (IFS) Sunayan Sharma said relocation of tigers should be done on priority or else territorial fights and man-animal conflicts will continue.“This is not scientific management as carrying capacity should be the guiding principle. Relocation and habitat improvement of tigers should be done simultaneously,” he said, referring to how tiger population was being managed at the RTR.Sharma said old tiger habitats such as Ramgarh Vishdhari, MHTR, and Raoli Todgarh in Udaipur should be revived and developed to help in tiger and environment conservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/3-tiger-cubs-added-to-ranthambore-reserve-officials-wary-of-rising-numbers-101630578611761.html

Owing to the lockdown, most banks were short-staffed and the security was also lax. We have now asked banks to ensure each [ATM] kiosk has a guard, ample lighting and operational CCTV cameras among other necessary measures,” a senior police officer from Thane said.In the past two years, six cases of thefts at ATMs have been registered in the Thane Commissionerate. In the month of June, an ATM in Kalyan was robbed of ₹49 lakh in cash by four people including bank employees since there was no security around the machine and the CCTV was not working. Earlier in January this year, four thieves tried to break into an ATM machine at Ulhasnagar camp no. 4 since it was not guarded.S Jadhav, police inspector of Mahatma Phule police station, added that in most cases, the accused conduct a recce and target kiosks with maximum security lapses.“Apart from a security guard and CCTV, the ATMs also need to have an alarm system against forced entries. The security guard should also be subjected to a background check. ATM centers should display all emergency numbers including that of police, fire brigade and bank office.”Police department has stationed employees to patrol ATMs at night, while local police officials will be visiting ATMs placed in remote locations in civilian clothes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-police-ask-banks-to-improve-security-to-prevent-atm-thefts-101630572731243.html

It asked them to hold protests in Delhi and send a delegation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah as the advisory for crowd control during the festive season came from the Centre.In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena called the demand for reopening temples inhuman as the country faces the threat of a third Covid-19 wave.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday said the government is not against any religion or festivals but against Covid-19.The statement came on the day MNS leaders defied orders and celebrated the Dahi Handi festival in Mumbai and Thane while the BJP questioned Sena’s Hindutva credentials. The BJP also staged protests across the state demanding reopening of temples. The restrictions on Dahi Handi celebrations in Maharashtra triggered a war of words with BJP leaders questioning the “selective” restrictions on Hindu festivals.“Your beloved central government has warned of a third wave. The Centre has written to the Thackeray government saying ‘there is a threat of the third wave. Remain cautious during festivals like Dahi Handi and Ganeshotsav’. Now you would not even listen to... Delhi? The Centre has sent guidelines for crowd control and festivities. Then why do not you show the courage to do a protest in Delhi? Take a delegation to Delhi and meet the Prime Minister and home minister,” the editorial said. It added an atmosphere was being created to paint the Thackeray government as anti-Hindu.In a veiled attack on MNS, the Sena said some “non-existent” political party did the “brave” thing of breaking Dahi Handis. “This political party is completely non-existent today...

She has maintained a notebook where she diligently jots down all her performances, fears, weaknesses and emotional connect with each match. Whenever she needs encouragement to tackle a challenging situation, she just flips through the pages of her notes. The mental sport that shooting is Sarnobat believes decoding herself over the years through her diary has helped prepare for the biggest moments of her career. One such moment will come in the next few days when she lines up for the 25m pistol competition at the Tokyo Olympics. The 30-year-old is a medal contender, having won two back-to-back World Cup medals this year. “I have everything noted down and that has helped me grow as a shooter. I just go back to my notes whenever I feel the need for scores of a particular match or how I felt then,” says Sarnobat.Also read | IOC president quickly corrects slip up in Olympic pep talkYears of struggle in the range with form and injuries have toughened her. At the 2012 London Olympics, as a 21-year-old, she was overawed. A look at the scoreboard and she realised she had finished 19th with a score of 579. The cut for the eight-shooter final was 583. “What has changed for me from Rio to Tokyo is belief in myself. That is the only thing I am doing differently from London. When I finished my competition in London and looked at the scoreboard I felt a medal was certainly possible. I used to initially underestimate myself. I used to feel ‘no, this cannot happen in 3-4 years’. It will take 10 years and only then will I get an Olympic medal. Sometimes, you are working so hard you are capable of getting it, you never know,” she says. After London, Sarnobat re-set her goals. Then an elbow injury kept her out of the Indian team in 2015, ending the chances of qualifying for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Only at the 2018 Asian Games did Sarnobat rediscover herself by winning a gold medal in Jakarta, becoming the first Indian woman shooter to win gold in the continental competitions. “It was a really difficult competition because of my own expectations and the fight inside me. I was really happy before the Asian Games because nobody was expecting a medal from me. So, I could focus well.” She shot well in training but competition scores were not high. “The first challenge was to break the barriers in my score. Even in the Asian Games qualifications, I only shot 580 and qualified in the eighth position. So, I thought “okay this is my chance, I can at least come back in the final”.” In finals, Sarnobat gets into her zone—she loves that pressure. “The finals are my thing, like I own the finals. It was a chance to shed fears and doubts about my performance at the Asian Games. My coach and I were absolutely not satisfied with the scores but the medal gave me a boost.”Also read | Gymnast Oleg Verniaiev out of Olympics after doping banThat she is a different shooter in the final came through in the recent World Cup in Osijek, Croatia. Having won silver in the New Delhi World Cup in March, Sarnobat not only carried good form but oozed confidence in the final, demolishing a strong field with 39 hits out of 50, including five perfect series (one series of five rapid fire shots) to win gold. She was close to the world record score of 40 and was eight points ahead of silver medallist Lamolle Mathilde of France. The field had Olympic champion Anna Korakaki of Greece, who came fifth and Rio Olympics silver medallist in 10m air pistol, Russian Vitalina Batsarashkina, who won bronze. Having lost a year of competitions due to the pandemic, it was difficult for the shooters to regain form. “Even when I was in rehab because of injury, I was not out of shooting for this long. I really know how it feels when you are out of competition. It is really important to be in that zone of training and flow of competition. “The fire and the eagerness to compete in Tokyo have kept us going even in the pandemic period. I have 10-12 years’ experience; this is when we have to use all our experience. This is an historic Olympics we are part of, taking place after five years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pistol-shooter-rahi-sarnobat-old-notes-to-find-fresh-zing-101630569250533.html

BSTDC, a wing of the state tourism department which handles cruise tourism and Ganga Arti, wants to resume the popular Ganga Aarti on Saturdays and Sundays almost four months after its suspension at the beginning of lockdown in the state in May 2020 following the outbreak of the second wave of Covid pandemic.“But as all other institutions, schools, colleges, offices, parks and cinema halls in the city have started functioning, the state tourism intends to resume Ganga Arti also,” Narayan Prasad, tourism minister said. A trial of the Ganga Arti has already been done on August 23 with adherence to Covid-19 containment protocols, Prasad added. “And it again evoked a very good response. During the show all the Covid-19 protocols including social distancing will be followed. Besides, elaborate arrangements will also be made for the safety of the visitors,” he said.The BSTDC has also requested for deployment of police force at the ghat during the show to manage crowds, he said.A tourism development corporation official who preferred not to be quoted, said, Ganga Arti was started in 2011 in Patna after watching the charm the ritual held for locals and tourists alike in Varanasi. It was also meant to enhance evening attractions in the city and to bring cruise tourism in Patna under focus.Patna DM Dr Chandrashekhar Singh could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-tourism-seeks-permission-from-patna-dm-to-resume-ganga-arti-101630568290973.html

02-09-2021||Patna||Suspended urban and housing development officer raided in Bihar in graft case||Bihar’s special vigilance unit (SVU) late Wednesday night searched properties of former executive officer of Hajipur municipal council, Anubhuti Srivastava, suspecting him of accumulating assets disproportionate to income, officers aware of the developments said.Srivastava was suspended on August 18 after a Bhabua resident accused him of corruption during a janata darbar or public meeting held by chief minister Nitish Kumar. Srivastava had been accused of corruption earlier too when posted at Jagdishpur, Bhabua and Dumraon Nagar councils between 2018 and 2021. Officials say that his conduct was then probed at the district level but it didn’t lead to any substantial action.He was also suspected to be involved in embezzlement of ₹30 and 22 crore from Bhabhua and Hajipur municipal councils respectively before his suspension.“This is the first major crackdown on an officer of the urban development and housing department this year,” said a SVU officer. The sleuths raided Srivastava’s Patna and Indore flats.The officer quoted above said the search had been completed and a list of all his properties including bank fixed deposits, vehicles, plots, household articles, was being prepared. He added that a case of disproportionate assets worth ₹1.1 crore had been lodged against Srivastava under Sections 13 (1) (e) (possession of disproportionate assets) and 13 (2) (criminal misconduct) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 at the SVU police station.In the searches at his flat located at Aparna Mansions in Rukanpur, Patna, documents of real estate investments, insurance policies, fixed deposits, mutual funds, foreign tours including to Mauritius, were found. Ownership papers of two flats in Patna and one in Madhya Pradesh were also found. Two bank lockers and two sports utility vehicles were also found during the search, the officer said.It also came to light that he was paying ₹15 lakh every year to cover insurance policies in the name of his wife and children when his annual official income was ₹8 lakhs, the officer said.Entire search operation was supervised by additional director general (ADG) Sunil Kumar. One SUV officer involved in the probe against Srivastava said he was under surveillance after the chief minister ordered a probe against him. Officials in the home department said several officers posted with the urban development and housing departments were also on the SVU’s radar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/suspended-urban-and-housing-development-officer-raided-in-bihar-in-graft-case-101630565291099.html

The department has already allocated ₹48.75 crore for temporary and ₹149 crore for complete repair,” he added.Officials said a comprehensive report on damages to the road network in the state was also being prepared. “Some stretches of the national highways have also suffered extensive damages owing to the prolonged spell of floods. We have requested the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to undertake urgent repairs,” said an officer, adding that the report would also help them get compensation from the Central government.The RCD is estimated to have suffered damages worth over ₹200 crore so far. “This is an initial assessment of loss. Final assessment of damages will be made once the floods are over. Last time, the RCD managed to get around ₹150 crore as Central assistance for repair of roads damaged by waterlogging and floods,” said the officer, adding that the department has proposed to complete rehabilitation of road infrastructure by November this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-readies-rs-200-cr-plan-to-repair-158-flood-hit-roads-101630559050867.html

According to departmental sources, reports of crop damages in flood-hit districts have started pouring in, and the agriculture department will soon send a proposal to the disaster management department to sanction over ₹550 crore for providing crop input subsidy to affected farmers. “ We are assessing crop damage. Currently, our assessment in 25 flood-hit districts indicates damages worth ₹550 crore. But, it could be more. We will be rolling out crop input subsidy soon to affected farmers after sanction of funds,” said agriculture secretary, N Saravana Kumar. The official said that the sanction of funds would be done soon, and input subsidy to compensate affected farmers would be done at the earliest based on the final assessment report. Earlier on Tuesday, chief minister Nitish Kumar conducted an aerial survey of flood-hit areas of Madhubani and Darbhanga districts. He also highlighted the government’s initiatives to provide monetary assistance to affected families. Officials said the assessment process of crop damages has been fast tracked in last few weeks to provide support to affected farmers, and also ensure that paddy crop production target this Kharif season is not badly hit. In the current fiscal, the target of total cultivable area of Kharif crops ( paddy, maize, seasonal vegetables, pulses, sugarcane) is around 40 lakh hectares, of which the target of cultivating paddy is around 33 lakh hectares. The production target of paddy this Kharif season is around 110 lakh metric tones with the targeted production of rice standing at around 80 lakh metric tonnes. “ The production target depends on various factors, including quality of crops. But, yes, floods in over four lakh hectares of Kharif cultivable land has affected paddy crops to an extent. But, if crops are less damaged after water recedes fully, the production will be not be much affected,” said a senior agriculture officer. In the last fiscal, rice production stood at 68.66 lakh metric tonnes, while the same was 68.24 lakh metric tones in 2019-20, according to agricultural department data. Officials said the department has already provided seedlings in East and West Champaran and other north Bihar districts, where floods in mid-July damaged crops, so that farmers could sow alternative crops instead of paddy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/crop-on-4-lakh-hectares-of-land-damaged-in-25-flood-hit-areas-in-bihar-101630552689741.html
02-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi wakes up to heavy rain, day after highest Sept rainfall in 19 yrs||The national capital woke up to heavy showers on Thursday, a day after the Capital received the highest September rainfall in 19 years. Over the last two days, Delhi has been seeing heavy rainfall starting from early in the morning and continuing for hours, leading to a major waterlogging issue and heavy traffic.Thursday's light showers began at around 6.30am with light thunderstorms and lightning. The temperature was at 26 degrees Celsius and the humidity level hovered above 80 per cent. Partial waterlogging on some roads was also reported, including from the stretch of roads near the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS).In view of the incessant rain, the Indian Meteorological Department has issued a yellow warning for Delhi NCR region.

02-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Poet in grief||They say that time assuages. But poet Ameer Dehlvi continues to be in mourning. “I’m not able to find myself these days,” he says, as his voice chokes up.Mr Dehlvi lost three brothers in swift succession—one of them to Covid. “Haji Faiyazuddin died on 28th April, Nasiruddin, the eldest, died on 10th May, Nawab Moinuddin died last year.” They were six brothers. Two survive.In his early 90s, the Urdu verse-composer has just stepped inside his family-owned hotel in Old Delhi. Until the coronavirus arrived early last year, Mr Dehlvi would be sighted daily in the hotel. While his brother, the late Haji Faiyazuddin, administered the longtime establishment from a stately desk in the balcony, “Ameer Bhai” would snuggle into the so-called “manager’s room,” penning poems or lying on the bed, and listening to old Hindi film songs in the radio that he would place by his pillow. His wife, whom he first met as a guest in the hotel, lies buried in Kashmir.This pandemic-era morning, Mr Dehlvi is back in the “manager’s room,” a rare occurrence. The world about him is still humming along the familiar way, and yet things are different: Haji Faiyazuddin’s place in the balcony is taken over by his gracious younger brother, Razi Zahoor Qureshi, a retired physician. The street that the balcony overlooks is, as always, clogged with pedestrians tossing cuss words at each other.Can poetry help the poet come to terms with his great losses? He lowers his head, raises his arm and says: “Yaad rakha tumhe marte dam tak, aur karta bhi kya marne wala (I remembered you till my last breath, what else could a dying man do).” In another instant, he says—“Manzil bhi nazar aaye toh manzil se gujar jaoon (Even if I see my destination, I will pass by it stealthily).”The poet sits down on the bed, looks thoughtful, gets up, and opens the small window—it faces the Jama Masjid. He closes it moments later. Keeping his hand on his heart, he mutters as if talking to himself, “Where was I a year back? Where have I reached today?”His voice trembles.“All I want is to be always able to exchange salam-dua with friends.”Mr Dehlvi talks of the love, care and respect accorded to him by his joint family in their Chawri Bazar mansion, of which he is now the senior-most patriarch. He reveals he is contributing towards a book—its subject is one of his late brothers. “The title is Haji (Faiyazuddin) Mian ki Taarif,” he says, the voice again chokes up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-poet-in-grief-101630543270075.html

The police said that the crime came to light after the suspect, identified as Rakesh, a resident of Chipyana Buzurg village, was arrested for allegedly murdering another man and planting his identity card on him in an effort to pass off himself off as dead.Anita Chauhan, SHO Bisrakh police station, said Rakesh had married Ratnesh, a resident of Etah in 2012. “The couple had a son, 3, and a daughter, 2. But he killed them and buried the bodies in their home on February 14, 2018,” she said.The suspect subsequently fled the house, following which their were complaints and counter-complaints of kidnapping by the families of Rakesh and Ratnesh.To get police off his back, Rakesh decided to pass himself off as ‘dead’ in police records, following which he killed a person in Kasganj on April 21.“The suspect decapitated the body and left his own identity card at the spot. The local police investigated the matter and the dead body was identified as a local resident,” said Chauhan.Kasganj police subsequently tapped Banwari Lal’s phone. “Based on the surveillance, Rakesh was arrested by Kasganj police in connection with the murder there. During interrogation, he revealed that he had also murdered his wife and two children in 2018,” the SHO said.Kasganj police dug up the crime spot in Greater Noida and found bones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-held-for-killing-wife-kids-in-greater-noida-101630542985784.html
02-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Mobility plan in the works for new sectors in outskirts||rThe Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has decided to work out the mobility plan for the new sectors that will be developed on the outskirts of the city under the land pooling policy. The authority has invited bids to hire a consultant for the preparation of a detailed mobility plan for the Zone L, which includes 30 urbanised villages located in southwest Delhi near Najafgarh.A senior DDA official said, “These are areas where the new developments will take place. The plan is to develop commercial centres, business districts and residential complexes here in the next few years. For this, we need a mobility plan within the area and ensure proper connectivity with the rest of the city.”There are 95 urbanised villages spread over five DDA planning zones where the land pooling policy, which was approved in 2018, will be implemented. Of the five zones, Zone L, spread over a total of 22,874 hectares, has the maximum number of villages.According to the request For proposal (RFP) floated by DDA, the consultant will have to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the transport network and transportation system in line with the current Master Plan. The DPR will also take into account the estimated growth in traffic volume because of the new developments in the next three decades.The consultant will have to assess the type of public transportation that will be required to cater to the population in this zone once it is fully developed. Currently, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s network has reached up to Najafgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-mobility-plan-in-the-works-for-new-sectors-in-outskirts-101630542751975.html
02-09-2021||Delhi||‘82% success rate for facial recognition system for driving licences’, says NIC||SwThe facial recognition software used to issue e-learner’s driving licences in Delhi was able to identify 82% of all applicants in the first few weeks of its usage, said officials in National Informatics Centre (NIC), which developed the software for the state government.Out of the 24,684 applications the state received for e-learner’s driving licence between August 7 and August 31, the software was able to successfully identify — and therefore allow or reject — 20,144 (81.6%) candidates, according to a report prepared by the centre.Of the 20,144 candidates the software was able to identify, 18,294 (74.11%) passed the online test and around 6.6%, accounting for 1,628 candidates, failed the test. In addition, 222 people failed the colour blindness test, which means they could not further appear for the proper learners’ licence test.As on Wednesday, a total of 6,390 applications were pending — which includes those who failed the test since they have been slotted for a re-test — the report seen by HT said.“The biggest challenge for us was developing the facial recognition software for the online learners’ DL test. The software is such that it matches the face of the test taker in front of the computer or mobile phone with the picture in the Aadhaar card uploaded by the applicant. It is meant to ensure there is no proxy for the test and hence, is the most important feature of the entire faceless transport services,” said a senior NIC official involved in the project.Officials said the 18% unsuccessful recognitions were likely due to shortages in the software’s mapping of facial features of applicants aged between 18 and 21. “The facial features of teenagers and people in this age group change fast. We saw that the picture in the Aadhaar card of such applicants often varies from their current appearance. So we are now fine tuning the software to predict age-related facial changes too,” said a second official.The online DL test is a part of the Delhi government’s “faceless transport services” project, under which 33 transport-related documents are issued online without necessitating a visit to a regional transport office (RTO).The initiative was formally launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on August 11, even as the e-learners’ driving licence service had a soft launch on August 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/82-success-rate-for-facial-recognition-system-for-driving-licences-says-nic-101630542299008.html
02-09-2021||Delhi||New Delhi: Water, Water everywhere||Roads, residential areas, schools, hospitals, markets and even the diplomatic enclave in the national capital were inundated after a spell of heavy rain on Wednesday, leading to winding traffic jams on arterial stretches, shopkeepers using buckets to flush out water from their establishments, and patients wading through waterlogged lanes to access hospitals.Besides the regular waterlogging-prone areas, Wednesday saw areas under the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) such as Connaught Place, and Chanakyapuri, where embassies are located, going under rainwater.Water enters Connaught Place shopsTraders in one of Delhi’s most popular shopping areas said they had not seen anything like Wednesday in a long time. Roads in the British-era arcade were heavily waterlogged, and the stormwater then overflowed on to the parking lots and then entered shops.Traders in blocks C, G and H said rainwater entered their shops and did not clear till at least 11am. They blamed the New Delhi municipal body for poor maintenance and drainage.Atul Bhargava, president of the New Delhi Traders Association, said, “The situation arose despite a renovation a few years ago. Water entered our shops. The parking lots, middle circle and parts of the outer circle were flooded. Traders had a hard time removing the stock put up for display for fear of getting damaged by water.”Traders say that their complaints to fix the slope problem at Panchkuian Road-Outer circle junction have fallen on deaf ears. “As the slope is towards CP, our market gets flooded. We have been asking NDMC to fix this problem. Though they claim that the problem has been addressed, little has been done,” said Bhargava.A senior NDMC official said that the roads were inundated, but water was pumped out in about half an hour. “Excess rain water was not allowed to stagnate for long. We have 120 permanent pumps, which were turned on, as soon as water started accumulating. The parking lots were cleared within 20 minutes of water filling in,” said the official who asked not to be named.Residential coloniesSeveral residential areas reported almost two-foot deep water on streets and basements inundated. Residents from Pamposh Enclave, Saket, Munirka, Rajendra Nagar, Karol Bagh, Laxmi Nagar, Geeta Colony, Krishna Nagar, Lajpat Nagar and Kalkaji reported waterlogging and shared videos on social media.Gurvinder Singh Saluja, a resident of Old Rajendra Nagar, shared photos of water flowing into his basement from where he runs his office. “Sewer lines in the area have not been laid in the entire area. I had to call a plumber to get the manhole checked. It had loads of debris. We had to keep draining out water from the basement. If water keeps seeping in during every spell of rain, the foundation of the houses will weaken over the years,” said Saluja.Kirti Bhatnagar, a resident of Yamuna Vihar in northeast Delhi said she couldn’t send her son to the school on Wednesday since the streets were full of water. “My son had to go to school today for the first time after so long but the road outside our house was completely inundated,” Bhatnagar, a homemaker said.Mayhem on roadsDespite several interventions by the government at Minto Bridge in central Delhi, it went under water, forcing the police to cordon it off for traffic. The police also diverted traffic at Zakhira and Pul Prehladpur underpasses after they were inundated.Besides this, the other stretches that saw heavy waterlogging were Vikas marg, Aurobindo Marg, AIIMS underpass, Dhaula Kuan, Najafgarh road, Uttam Nagar, Saket Metro station, Jahangirpuri Metro station to Mukarba Chowk and Mother Teresa Crescent Marg.Traffic officials also tweeted about the places where traffic jams are being reported and when the waterlogging issue has been resolved. “Wherever required, the traffic was diverted onto other parallel roads. The underpasses were barricaded for safety,” said a senior police official, who didn’t wish to be named.Hospitals floodedSeveral city hospitals were waterlogged that resulted in patients facing inconvenience as they had to wade through to reach the department concerned to get treatment.At Lok Nayak Hospital, there was waterlogging at the entrance of the emergency for around half an hour on Wednesday morning making it difficult for people to find their way.There was a similar situation at the central government-run Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital that is situated in Central Delhi, which is the heart of the national Capital.The path outside the hospital’s outpatient department (OPD) was flooded.The road outside the gate of Sucheta Kriplani hospital’s OPD was also flooded, although the area inside remained largely dry. “There was no flooding here but there was a lot of water flowing on the road. There is always water on this road whenever it rains,” said a guard posted at the hospital gate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-delhi-water-water-everywhere-101630538036717.html
02-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Ashram Chowk woes deepen after two days of rain||Heavy rain for the past two days has added to the endless cycle of chaos at Ashram Chowk in the form of deeper potholes and loose mud, adding another degree of pain that hundreds of thousands of commuters have to endure while passing through this important road intersection.A site visit by HT on Wednesday showed how the already worn out road surface at the intersection has worsened due to rains, and the construction material dumped on the roadside has flown on to the road as slush that is making it even more difficult for the motorists to negotiate the stretch.The Delhi government’s public works department (PWD) began constructing an underpass, aimed at decongesting the transport heavy stretch, in December 2019. HT reported on August 17 that, having missed four deadlines already, the PWD has fixed a new December-end deadline for the project. However, as construction work continued at a snail’s pace, pathetic site management has ensured that the stretch has remained a traffic nightmare for nearly two years now. Simultaneous work on extending the Ashram flyover on Ring Road has expanded the chaos from all four directions at the main intersection to Maharani Bagh.Ashram, which connects south and central Delhi and virtually serves as the link between two NCR cities — Noida and Faridabad — sees over 350,000 vehicles passing every day during peak rush hours in the mornings and evenings.A PWD official said they will complete the first phase of the project by the end of 2021. “We have received complaints about potholes. We used to fill those up before the monsoon, but no road repair work can be done during rains,” said a senior official.Department officials said both the underpass and the flyover extension projects were hit by multiple setbacks in the last two years.“Delhi has received record rainfall in the past two days. It is because of the monsoon preparations and precautions taken by the Delhi government in the past few months that the infamous Minto Bridge did not witness waterlogging to the extent of a bus getting inundated. Apart from this, it was observed there was no waterlogging in several other parts of the city as well,” said a state spokesperson.Commuters rued that there was no end in sight to their daily travails.“Whenever it rains, it becomes a nightmare to cross this area. PWD is not doing anything to fix it. I have often read about the deadlines of this project in newspapers, but the work is yet to be completed. What will happen if a mishap occurs due to these potholes?” asked Gagandeep Singh, who travels from central Delhi’s Gol market to Faridabad for work||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-ashram-chowk-woes-deepen-after-two-days-of-rain-101630535274760.html

Please clarify how you see the Taliban? Is Taliban a terror organisation? If it is not, will you move the United Nations to have it delisted as a terror organisation because right now you (India) are presiding over the United Nations Security Council? If it is a terror organisation then how do you distinguish between Taliban and other terror groups? If it is not a terror organisation, then please move the United Nations to have it removed from that list of terror organisations. Let their bank accounts start functioning and let’s not treat them differently but you can’t have different yardsticks for different organisations.” “If they are a terror organisation, why are you talking to them? If they are not a terror organisation, why are you banning their bank accounts? Why are you not recognising their government? Make up your mind what it is… I am not the decision maker,” he said. The junior Abdullah, however, refused to respond to a question about his opinion on the al-Qaeda’s threat to Kashmir and said that the question should be answered by Prime Minister. Omar also feigned ignorance over ‘Ghazwa-e-Hind’, a mission of al-Qaeda and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen to capture India. “I don’t know anything regarding that,” he responded. He also said he was not aware of any statement from al-Qaeda about its wish for Kashmir to be liberated and the promise of ‘Ghazwa-e-Hind’ to be kept. Omar also demanded full restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir before holding assembly elections. “Whenever the Election Commission wants to hold elections, they should do it, but we demand full statehood to Jammu and Kashmir before elections,” he said.“We had prepared for assembly elections in 2019 because the assembly had been dissolved, he said. Regarding revocation of Article 370 and 35-A, besides other decisions that unfolded on August 5, 2019, Omar said his party will legally fight them before the Supreme Court. “The Prime Minister and Home Minister had made a commitment in the Parliament that statehood will be restored; then should it be delayed,” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/clarify-stand-on-taliban-a-terror-outfit-or-not-omar-to-centre-101630528807134.html

Addressing a day-long interactive session with the National Conference functionaries here, Abdullah dwelt upon the overall scenario and also discussed the party affairs with senior colleagues. He made a special reference to acts of violence against elected representatives, especially those in Panchayat Raj Institutions, and called for adequate security as they are required to visit their areas for purposes of development and to listen to the people. Their security should not be jeopardised, Abdullah cautioned. He said the people, especially the youth, are encountered with numerous problems as the promises made have proved just a hoax. Unemployment is on the rise and the educated unemployed are undergoing a phase of despair. The trend is needed to be arrested by opening up vistas of opportunities in terms of employment generation and recruitment on fast-track basis. Dr Abdullah, however, expressed optimism about things changing for the better in Jammu and Kashmir, saying the National Conference has to play a vital role in this regard. He called for further rejuvenating the party at the grassroots level and enhancing the public outreach at all levels. He said the National Conference cadre has to get further activated to meet the challenges. Dejected and disillusioned people are looking towards the National Conference with hope and we have to prepare ourselves to meet their aspirations”, he said and asked the functionaries to mobilise workers for identifying the problems. “We are passing through most difficult times and there is a need to guard against polarising forces by upholding our unity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farooq-debunks-bjp-s-all-is-well-in-j-k-claim-101630528804858.html

It is his duty to address these,” Rawat told reporters after the meeting.The two leaders met at the CM’s Siswan farmhouse, with Singh summoning top officials, including the advocate general and the director general of police, to brief Rawat on the Bargari sacrilege (the 2015 desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book) and police firing cases, power purchase agreements (PPA), arrest of “big fish” in the drug rackets, cancellation of the three controversial farm laws passed by the Union government, and other pending election promises.These promises are part of an 18-point to-do list prepared by the party’s central leadership based on feedback received from state leaders and handed down to the CM for implementation ahead of next year’s assembly elections. Sidhu, who has been seeking action on the agenda, had conveyed to Rawat on Tuesday his dissatisfaction with the state government’s efforts on this front, urging him to get these issues sorted out quickly.Rawat met Sidhu on Tuesday and offered to quit if he was not being given any say in party affairs, according to people privy to the meeting.‘Give cheaper power’Rawat said the government would try to find a way to give power to consumers at reduced rates. “On PPAs, the CM said that some actions have been taken. I am hopeful that the state government will extend the facility of 200 units of free power given to SCs (Scheduled Castes) and the poor to consumers of general category also. I have also requested him to give relief to general consumers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lend-ear-to-miffed-congress-leaders-grouses-harish-rawat-tells-punjab-cm-101630528753247.html

The medical team was airlifted in a state government helicopter in the morning. Himachal Pradesh has achieved 100% vaccination in terms of the targeted population as per the 2011 census—the first state in the country to do so. However, many people in remote areas of the state are yet to get the jabs. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had recently ordered a mop-up campaign to vaccinate the remaining population. Located deep in Himalayas at the height of 2,575 metres, in Baijnath sub-division of Kangra, Bara-Bhangal village is one of the remotest hamlets in the state. Deputy commissioner Dr Nipun Jindal and chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Gurdarshan Gupta accompanied the medical team. “It is a challenge to reach the village as it is not connected with road. So, the state government provided its helicopter to conduct the vaccination camp,” said Dr Jindal. Chief medical officer Dr Gupta said close to 100 people had been already given the jab. “We have sent another team with additional doses and the total number of people vaccinated will be known when the team returns tomorrow,” said Dr Gupta. The village, having a population of around 700 persons, is accessible through a 70-km arduous trek. It takes two to three days to reach Bara Banghal on foot, either from Bir in Kangra or from Nayagran in Bharmour subdivision of Chamba. The village remains cut off from the rest of the state in winters even as most of the residents migrate to the Bir village. However, many of them, mostly elders, stay behind in the village. Dr Jindal said many people had got the jabs at Bir but those who stay behind were yet to be vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccination-teams-fly-to-himachal-s-remotest-village-bara-bhangal-101630528748283.html

02-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra forms Council for Climate Change to prepare action plan||Maharashtra government on Wednesday announced the formation of State Council for Climate Change based on a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) about carbon impact. Terming it as a “climate emergency”, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said the council will prepare an action plan within a month to deal with the challenges of climate crisis.“Climate change is impacting us. We believe this is a climate emergency. Today we presented the IPCC report before cabinet and an important decision has been made to set up a State Council for Climate Change under the chairmanship of the chief minister. The cabinet has asked us to prepare an action plan which we will present after one month,” Thackeray said after the cabinet meeting on Wednesday.He added, “Largely, it is believed that this is the last decade for mitigation measures, but I personally think we do not have the luxury of time. We have already started acting on it through out Electric Vehicles Policy, Aarey forest and other multiple actions. In the next one month, we will have interdepartmental conferences where we will finalise the goals of our government for climate change mitigation and adaptation.”According to a senior government official, five sectors including energy, agriculture, industries, transport, and urban development need urgent action. “Under this council, the department dealing with these sectors will hold interdepartmental conferences. Since the environment department cannot directly ask other departments to come up with mitigation measures in their proposals, this council will be that forum. It will have its separate funds,” the official said requesting anonymity.According to the presentation, the government is expected to look at “decarbonizing the power sector”, move towards “electric, non-motorised transport system”, look at “33% mandatory green cover” for industries, “reforms” in agriculture sector, and look at “sustainable, eco-friendly buildings”, and achieve “zero waste” in urban areas.Thackeray said all departments and public representatives will need to work together to achieve this. “If all the departments and public representatives work together we can take mitigation and adaptation measures to tackle climate change. As part of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, whenever cabinet notes are moved by any department, it will contain the development goal it aims to achieve through the decision,” he said.Highlighting that the state witnessed some extreme weather conditions recently, the minister said that climate change is visible with reduction in the number of days of rain and winter and increase in the number of warmer days. “Climate change is impacting us all. Not just the melting of polar ice and glaciers, but we can see that days in monsoon are reducing, heavy rainfall is witnessed in a short period of time, warmer days are increasing while colder ones are reducing,” he said.Dr Anjal Prakash, who was involved in the IPCC Report 2021, welcomed the move by the state government, but also called for a national-level movement to tackle climate change. “I welcome this step as it will create more scope and space to look at the problem and solutions. The council under the chief minister could be a bridge between departments. This is a small start to make some efforts to take climate change, but is it not all-encompassing. “Climate change needs to have a wider national mitigation. I have always maintained that these are kneejerk, short-term solutions. We need to have a separate ministry for climate change. Because of the kind of crisis we have, this cannot be handled with a backyard ministry. Most progressive nations have a separate ministry,” said Dr Prakash, research director, Bharati Institute of Public Policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-forms-council-for-climate-change-to-prepare-action-plan-101630528745993.html

02-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to depute BSF commandants as superintendent of 3 more jails soon||With the experiment of deputing Border Security Force (BSF) commandant-rank officials as superintendents of four central jails in the state yielding positive results, the Punjab prisons department is set to give charge of three more jails to the officials of the paramilitary force. In July this year, four senior BSF officials were posted as superintendents in central jails of Ferozepur, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Faridkot. A senior prison department official said, “Three BSF officials will be posted as superintendents in the coming days. We are in the process of identifying the prisons considering various factors.”Jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said, “The experiment (of posting BSF officials) proved successful. Earlier also, we have posted police officials in prisons on deputation. But of late, many police officials have shown their reluctance to join the prison department as they face pulls and pressures while supervising the prisons.” The biggest success of this experiment is that the staff of the prisons department have adapted well to the command of officials of the paramilitary force, the minister added. “We have not compromised with the professional competence of our own officials. Where the BSF officials are posted as in-charge, our department officials are being posted as additional superintendents,” Randhawa said. Additional director general of police (ADGP prisons) PK Sinha said the idea behind posting BSF officials as superintendents was mooted to bring more transparency in the prison system in the state. “With this experiment, we have tried to open our jail system which was considered closed. Punjab is the only state which has deputed BSF officials as superintendents,” the ADGP said. The department’s earlier experiment of posting Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans to guard the prison cells where dreaded gangsters are lodged has been successful by and large with a view to keeping check on the activities of gangsters in the jails, an official said.The state has nine central, 11 district and five sub-jails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-depute-bsf-commandants-as-superintendent-of-3-more-jails-soon-101630528689097.html

Ashwani Sahota, chairman of the employees’ union, said, “Even though the FIR is lodged against unidentified persons, it has brought down the morale of the MC’s operations and maintenance cell. They are fearing action against them in the coming days. No official forces any sewerman to enter the manhole. It is difficult for the employees to work under this pressure, and it might also have a bad impact on their mental and physical health.”“In the memorandum submitted with the commissioner, we have demanded cancellation of the FIR within 15 days otherwise, we will be forced to raise an agitation,” said Sahota.Despite attempts made to reach MC commissioner Sabharwal, he was not available for comments. While the police stated that an investigation is being done in the case, Geja Ram demanded that the FIR should be lodged against the concerned MC employees by name, failing which he will move the court.Geja Ram had recommended an FIR against the MC executive engineer and sub-divisional officer for allegedly forcing the sewermen to enter manholes to clean the sewer lines without safety kits in the Jugiana area on July 16. Subsequently, MC officials including executive engineers, sub-divisional officers, and junior engineers locked horns with Geja Ram, during the meeting of the commission convened to discuss the delay in lodging an FIR.Sharing a video of the incident, the MC officials alleged that the chairperson himself had forced the employees to enter the manhole, to implicate MC staffers.

A police team led by additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Rupinder Kaur Sra, assistant commissioner of police Raj Kumar and other officials tried to persuade the protesting farmers to lift the blockade, but in vain. Sukhbir had to walk to the rally venue, which was around 300 metres from the protest site. The protesters raised slogans and accused Sukhbir of supporting the farm laws and then changing his position after facing the farmers’ ire.A farmer leader, Jagjit Singh, said: “Akali MLA Sharanjit Singh Dhillon had assured us that Sukhbir will speak to the farmers and answer all our queries pertaining to the farm laws and the Behbal Kalan firing. But later, Dhillon backtracked and Sukhbir refused to meet us and instead proceeded for the rally, which is why we have blocked the road.”A clash broke out between SAD workers and farmers at Buthgarh Gurdwara after SAD chief left the venue.Addressing the gathering, the SAD chief dismissed the protesters as “Congress workers in the garb of farmers who are being backed by the Punjab Police.” Addressing the rally, Sukhbir listed out contributions of the party to uplift the farmers of the state. He said from free power to bringing assured MSP for paddy and wheat to scrapping taxes on the purchase of tractors and issuing tubewell connections to farmers, all such initiatives were undertaken during the SAD government.He said the party’s “Gal Punjab Di” programme would continue at full steam and would not be affected by the “sponsored protests of the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party”. On the occasion, Sukhbir also announced sitting MLA and senior leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon as party’s candidate from Sahnewal. Majithia faces farmers’ ire in Gurdaspur GURDASPUR: Former minister and senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia faced a protest from farmers during his visit to Sri Hargobindpur constituency in Gurdaspur on Wednesday. Farmers under the banner of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee also raised slogans against Majithia for supporting the three farm laws in Parliament. They also showed black flags to Majithia’a motorcade. Terming the protest sponsored, Majithia alleged that his car was attacked by protesters. Heavy police force was deployed during his visit, but the farmers managed to block his motorcade for a few minutes. Majithia said the Congress government was playing into the hands of central agencies that were using sponsored protests to destabilise the peace of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-block-sukhbir-s-motorcade-in-mattewara-101630528633912.html
02-09-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh initiates steps to revise SAP of cane||Ahead of the assembly polls, the Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday initiated the process for the enhancement of cane rate in the state with the State Advisory Committee on cane prices holding a high-level meeting with all the stakeholders, including farmers and sugar mill associations, two officials who participated in the meeting said. The development comes in the wake chief minister Yogi Adityanath making an announcement during an interaction with a group of progressive farmers here last week that the government would soon increase the State-Advised Price (SAP) of cane. The SAP of cane was last upped by ₹10 per quintal in 2017 soon after the present government came to power. The current SAP is ₹325 per quintal—the price that has not been revised since 2017 because of which the Opposition has been targeting the government within and outside the assembly. In the meeting chaired by chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari, farmers’ representatives, according to officials, demanded the government fixed the SAP at ₹400 per quintal in view of the fact that the SAP had not been revised for last four consecutive years and also because their input costs in terms of diesel price etc had gone up considerably since. People representing sugar mills, however, expressed strong reservations over the demand on the plea that it would not be possible for sugar mills to be viable at the rate demanded by the farmers. “The sugar mill associations did agree to farmers that cane price revision was overdue considering the growing input cost but at the same time they said ₹400 per quintal price as demanded by farmers would be too high for mills to pay,” officials said. The sugar mills association pleaded that the current minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar, as fixed by the Centre, was already too low for sugar mills to earn profits amid slump in the sugar industry and any irrational hike in the SAP of cane would further hit sugar trade hard in UP, officials said. The chief secretary, according to officials, asked cane commissioner Sanjay Bhoosreddy who is also additional chief secretary, sugar, to prepare a proposal for the SAP revision taking into consideration all stakeholders’ views and suggestions. The proposal recommending the SAP hike may soon be put to the Cabinet for approval The next cane crushing season is scheduled to start from October 20 in western UP, from October 25 in Central UP and from the first week of November in the eastern region. Though the government has often claimed of having made a record payment of ₹1.42 lakh crore to farmers as arrears pending since 2010, non-revision of the SAP since 2017 was snowballing into a political issue before assembly polls in the state. Many farmers in western UP have also been staging protests against the Centre’s three farm laws for last several months and have threatened to intensify the stir incorporating other issues too, including non-revision of the SAP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-initiates-steps-to-revise-sap-of-cane-101630528631764.html

District BJP president Pushpinder Singal and BJP unit executive member Bikram Singh Sidhu alleged that the LIT had auctioned the land for ₹98.38 crores (including 6 percent cess) throughan e-auction, while the market value of the 16,344 square yards (3.79 acres) of auctioned land is around ₹300 crore. The leaders alleged that the LIT had also deliberated on establishing a food gallery and shops-cum-offices on the site and auctioning the same for around ₹400 crore in the past, but the proposal had been set aside to favour the “land mafia.” Sidhu said,”The Congress government has been involved in several scams. The City Centre scam also took place during the Congress’ tenure. The LIT chairperson, who is working on the directions of a Cabinet minister, is currying favours with the bidders by auctioning prime land at throwaway prices. The LIT has also auctioned land reserved for a community centre and school by changing its land use. All of this is being done to favour the land mafia.” “Former officiating LIT chairman PS Gill had also proposed that shops-cum-offices be established on the site, but the proposal was disregarded. The details of the e-auction were not publicised properly so that fewer people bid for the land,” said Sidhu, adding the matter has already been raised with the Centre and a CBI probe has been sought. “ A copy of the complaint has also been marked to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. We will move court if the state government fails to take action to stop auction proceedings within 30 days. An agitation will also be raised,” he said. Meanwhile, the LIT chairman refuted the allegations and said that information regarding the e-auction was publicised in the newspapers thrice and four bidders participated in the same. “No proposal to establish a food gallery was ever tabled and misinformed BJP leaders are levelling baseless allegations. As far as allegations pertaining to quoting a lower reserve price are concerned, the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority has auctioned over 6,000 square yards of land on Dugri Road for ₹54,000 per square yard. We have auctioned the land for around ₹56,000 per square yard,” said the chairman, adding the proceedings were transparent and had also been recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-move-court-if-lit-e-auction-not-nullified-within-month-bjp-101630528629545.html

He paid his tribute to those killed in the massacre of April 13, 1919.“I have paid my homage to martyrs. The complete renovation team had done a wonderful and archaeologically right job. No changes have been made to the archaeological site of this place,” the governor wrote in the visitor’s book.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, virtually inaugurated the historic site on August 28. The renovation had led to a huge row with historians, among others, criticising the central government for ‘erasing history’ of the Bagh. It had also started a political debate in the country.On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi slammed the makeover of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre site as ‘belittling of the martyrdom’. However, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had said, “I don’t know what has been removed. Whatever I saw that night (at the inauguration event), it looked very nice to me.”Some family members of those who were killed during the massacre also raised objections over the work done on some parts of the Bagh and the changing of Amar Jyoti (the eternal flame) and the flag post.The governor also visited the Golden Temple and the Durgiana Temple in Amritsar, where the managements of both the sites honoured him. He, however, refrained from talking to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-alteration-done-at-jallianwala-bagh-punjab-guv-101630528628396.html
02-09-2021||Delhi||When it rains in the national capital, the buck doesn’t stop anywhere||Five municipal bodies and two government agencies, one of them the state and the other under the Centre, manage roads and drains in the national capital. Rampant flooding of roads, markets, hospitals and residential colonies on Wednesday showed their collective failure, and exposed their lack of preparedness to deal with waterlogging during monsoon.Besides the three municipal corporations -- East, North and South, the city has a cantonment board for administering areas under the defence establishments, and the New Delhi Municipal Council for managing civic affairs in the New Delhi and Lutyens zones. The Delhi government’s public works department (PWD) — essentially a construction agency — and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) which comes under the Union government also manage roads and drains in their respective jurisdictions.City residents described the situation as the “same story repeating over the years”, and experts said that Delhi’s civic infrastructure has not been upgraded commensurate with the increase in population.Besides the usual road stretches that are waterlogged every time it rains in Delhi, Wednesday witnessed roads in NDMC areas and Lutyens’ zone such as Connaught Place and Chanakyapuri going under the water. A large number of residential areas also reported knee-deep waterlogging with stormwater entering the basements and ground floor houses in many areas such as Rajendra Nagar, Karol Bagh, Pamposh Enclave, Saket, Krishna Nagar and Geeta Colony, among others.Delhi received the highest single-day rain received in September in the past 19 years, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). The city received 112.1mm rain in 24 hours, ending 8.30 am Wednesday. An additional 75.6mm rain was recorded over three hours between 8.30am and 11.30am, the Met department said.Experts said little has been done to upgrade the infrastructure or address the problem in entirety, and only piecemeal measures have been taken over the last decade. They also pointed out the lack of a comprehensive stormwater drainage network, multiplicity of authorities and lack of monitoring as other reasons why no lasting solution has been found yet to the annual mess.Experts stressed on the need to have a single agency for maintenance of drainage network so that accountability can be fixed and work can be done in a systematic manner. They also stressed on the need to immediately implement the drainage master plan, which was prepared by IIT-Delhi experts in 2016.Till 2011, the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi was largely responsible for the maintenance of drainage along all colony and arterial roads (that are less than 100-ft wide). But in 2011, the then Congress government transferred the upkeep of 60-foot and wider roads to the Delhi PWD. Later, the drains along these arterial roads were also transferred to PWD even as the maintenance of drainage in residential areas remained with the civic bodies.Though waterlogging has been a perennial problem, it has become worse since 2011, said Sarvagya Srivastava, former engineer-in-chief, PWD.Former MCD commissioner KS Mehra said there should be one agency in-charge of desilting and maintenance of the drainage network, as it is important to fix responsibility. “But the most important thing is that the city needs a proper drainage system. The drainage plan prepared by IIT-Delhi should be implemented at the earliest,” said Mehra.The last drainage master plan was drafted by the Delhi administration in 1976. To be sure, Delhi was administered by a metropolitan council between 1966 and 1990. In 2016, the Delhi government commissioned a study of the city’s drainage system by IIT-Delhi. Following the study, a drainage master plan was compiled which had also pointed out to the fact that the city had no single agency to manage and maintain drainage. However, the plan could not be implemented.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is now working on the Delhi Drainage Masterplan. At a review meeting on August 25, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the design of city drains will be changed according to the suggestions by an expert team from IIT-Delhi to ensure smooth flow of water during and after heavy rains and resolve waterlogging on roads during monsoon.There are about 2,846 drains in Delhi with a combined length of about 3,692km. Most of these drains are maintained by PWD.Srivastava said in many areas there was no sewerage lines due to which storm water drains also carry sewage. “The stormwater drains of residential colonies and along arterial roads should be separate. But in several cases, we found that these were connected. The storm water drains along arterial roads are designed according to the road capacity. Waterlogging is bound to happen if it carries additional water, including sewage, from residential neighbourhoods,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/when-it-rains-in-the-national-capital-the-buck-doesn-t-stop-anywhere-101630528624760.html

02-09-2021||Chandigarh||Grenade seizure: Germany-based handler on Punjab Police radar||Two days after a potential terror plot was foiled in Punjab with the arrest of a man with two hand grenades at a Tarn Taran village, police have zeroed in on a Germany-based handler. Saroop Singh of Johal Dhai Wala village in Goindwal sub-division was nabbed with two China-made hand grenades on the outskirts of Kakka Kandiala village, 4km from Tarn Taran, on Janmashtami night. Police said Saroop had identified some locations in Amritsar and Ludhiana to launch a terror attack. “Our preliminary investigation has found that Saroop was in contact with a man who lives in Germany through various social media apps. We have got the Germany-based man’s contact number, which is being examined by cyber experts. We are also working to ascertain his identity,” said a senior police official, who didn’t wish to be named. “Saroop was paid only ₹15,000 by the Germany-based handler for collecting and keeping grenades. He had collected the grenades from a dump, the location of which was sent to him through a social media platform, the official said, adding the recovered grenades were a part of consignment smuggled from Pakistan via drones, the official added. A training video sent by his foreign handlers explaining how to successfully explode a hand-grenade was also recovered from Saroop’s mobile phone.Saroop had been living with his mother and elder brother, an ex-army man. His father, who was a truck driver, died around 13 years ago. Police said the family had 2 acres of farm land and Saroop had sold his part of the land to his brother a few years ago. Saroop was a truck driver and wanted to become rich. “He had not been talking to us for the past two years. He never informed us about his routine or work. He had no friends,” said Saroop’s mother. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) OS Ghumman said: “We are investigating the case and questioning the accused. We hope to break the chain soon.”On Wednesday, Saroop was taken to a joint interrogation centre (JIC) in Amritsar where various security agencies questioned him. A case under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Explosives Substances (Amendment) Act was registered against him at the Tarn Taran city police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/grenade-seizure-germany-based-handler-on-punjab-police-radar-101630528573879.html

BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar alleged that son-in-law of a Rajya Sabha MP of Shiv Sena has been mediating between theatre owners and the Uddhav Thackeray-led government to “strike a deal” for relaxations from curbs. The Shiv Sena said the allegations were part of the BJP’s conspiracy to defame the government. Decisions related to lifting restrictions are taken only after due consultations, it said. “After the associations representing particular sectors meet certain people in the government, the sectors are given relaxations. Hoteliers met them, after which they got the permissions. Bar, pub operators met people in government, after which they were allowed to open their shutters. Similarly, theatre owners and their associations are being approached for a deal for the permission. The son-in-law of a Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP is actively involved in it,” said Shelar. Shelar said the sectors which cannot afford to crack such a deal with the government, have been deprived of their livelihood. “Flower, agarbatti sellers outside temples have been struggling hard for their livelihood. Marathi drama artists and folk artists have been agitating for the permission for opening of the auditoriums, but no heed is paid to them because they are not able to ‘pay’ the required financial favours. Does the government expect such ‘deals’ from dahi handi, Ganeshotsav and Navratri Utsav mandals,” asked Shelar, adding, “They point at the Union health ministry’s letter while imposing curbs on dahi handi and Ganesh festivals. But the state did not follow the directives related to aggressive testing, equitable distribution of vaccine and prioritising vaccination for health workers.” Shiv Sena legislator and spokesperson Sunil Prabhu said, “The decisions related to the opening up of activities/sectors are taken only after due deliberation with the state-appointed task force of doctors and senior officials from various departments. Even the state wants to open up everything, but it has to think about the risk of the spread of infection too. Shelar’s allegations are part of their party’s conspiracy to defame the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-striking-deals-to-lift-curbs-says-bjp-sena-calls-it-conspiracy-101630528566355.html

They accused the group of around 20 bitumen contractors led by Vinod Jain of levelling baseless allegations against the civic body for their alleged vested interests.They said that no corruption case had come to their notice in the past.Manmohan Singh said,” Many contractors are working in the city including, those working on the construction of RMC roads, installation of interlocking tiles, etc. We have decided to keep away from the allegations and continue with the development works.”As per sources, the group led by Singh is being forced to support the MC to mount pressure on the other group.Vinod Jain said that the contractors supporting the MC officials are hand in glove with them.“The MC officials also support these contractors while allotting the contracts and we have been raising an issue regarding the same. Rather than using pressure tactics, mayor Balkar Sandhu should take action against the corrupt officials,’ said Jain. On August 24, contractors led by Jain had announced the boycott of development works in the city, citing corruption in the MC. They alleged that a commission is also sought for releasing payment for completed works. The mayor had said the allegations are baseless.After it was found that Jain was blacklisted last year and was still awarded contracts by the MC officials, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had marked an inquiry into the matter to MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal.On Tuesday, the MC employees’ union had also asked Jain to submit proof of corruption or apologise in three days failing which the union will raise an agitation against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-contractors-divided-over-corruption-allegations-101630528515814.html

Sahai, who was here as part of the party’s national campaign against the government’s new national monetisation plan, alleged that the BJP-led government has put India on “clearance sale” to benefit a few of its “business friends”. “They are selling the national assets built over the past seven decades to a few capitalist friends. These assets are not going to come back after being leased out for 30 to 50 years and the next 10 governments will not get any benefit by this move,” he said.

02-09-2021||Lucknow||Nearly 1 lakh students secure RTE admission in UP this year||Nearly one lakh children from underprivileged sections of the society this year secured admissions under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, in 12,563 unaided private schools across UP where they will receive free and quality education from the beginning up to class 8. The increase in the number of admissions assumes importance as it has come amid the Covid pandemic. The admissions were for kids in 3-6 age group (less than 7 as on April 1, 2021) in pre-primary to class 1. Under the RTE policy, 25 per cent seats in these schools are reserved for economically weaker sections. A record 2.55 lakh applications were received for admissions under RTE this year. The admission process opened on March 2 and ended on July 15, 2021.More than 1.53 lakh applications were verified and eventually 99,146 children were allotted seats in various private schools. This is the best conversion rate so far in the state since 2017 when the RTE lottery system shifted online. The selection is based on the lottery system set up by the state government.While Lucknow topped the list with 12,770 children securing admissions under RTE, Varanasi stood second with 8,655 children getting admission and Kanpur Nagar was third with 6,078 admissions. In Aligarh, 4,864 students secured admission and in Moradabad 4,202 students got admission.“It was my dream to enrol my six-year-old son Aaroh in a good school. However, it was just a dream as I had no means to turn it into a reality. My dream came true recently when my son secured admission in a reputed school in Lucknow under Right to Education [RTE 12.1.(c)] policy in this year’s (2021) lottery,” said Ankit Singh, 26, a gardener and earns ₹4,000-5,000 per month.Singh, who hails from Sitapur district, moved to Lucknow three years back so that his children could study in a good school. However, the pandemic and corona-induced lockdown derailed his plans.“I wasn’t getting regular work. I exhausted my savings but I did not return to my village. I stayed back in Lucknow so that both my children could get good education. I am happy that my son is getting a chance to study in a good school. He is too young to understand the importance of good education, but I will provide him with all the facilities. I even bought a smartphone for him so that he could attend his online classes,” said Singh.This year, six-year-old Antara’s Singh life changed forever. She lost both her parents to Covid within a week. For a few days, Antara and her elder brother lived with their landlord in Kanpur and later moved with a local guardian. In April, Aditya Pandey, an office assistant, who looks after RTE lottery and allotments in Kanpur, and a few others from the department, enrolled Antara’s name for RTE 12.1.(c) lottery.Early this week, Antara secured admission in a reputed school in Kanpur. She received her admission letter from UP minister of state for higher education Neelima Katiyar in the presence of district education officer Pawan Kumar Tiwari.Like Antara and Aaroh, all other students who got admission come from most underprivileged section and RTE 12.1 (C) will provide them with free and quality education in private schools across the state.Commenting on the increasing number of students from humble backgrounds getting admission under RTE, director general, school education, Anamika Singh said, “With a robust online RTE portal incorporating end-to-end process integration and widespread awareness campaign in 2021, we could receive a large number of applications from diverse geographies resulting in record 1 lakh lottery allocations.”“The state is now committed to ensuring these admissions in schools as we gear up towards opening of schools post Covid. We are also encouraging private schools to register themselves on RTE portal in order to receive timely reimbursements. This would be mandated under SSSA (State School Standards Authority) of NEP 2020,” she said.Lalita Pradeep, additional director, basic education said, “It is fascinating to see that now guardians are more aware and some social organisations have contributed a lot to instil the spirit of the RTE Act into system.”Samina Bano, founder and CEO, RightWalk Foundation, which was instrumental in implementing the RTE policy in the state, said: “We request all the private schools in the state to register on RTE portal for smooth functioning of the process and it will also make data collection easier.” In 2019, 59,692 children had secured admissions while in 2020, 87,728 children had got admission despite Covid.Top five districts Lucknow (12,770), Varanasi (8,655), Kanpur Nagar (6,078), Aligarh (4,864), Moradabad (4,202)Upgrade of RTE portalAs the number of allotments has gone up, to keep up with the pace, the RTE portal has undergone key changes since its inception.

The government has failed to address grievances of youth, farmers, women and labourers. Every section of the society is forced to come out on road to raise their issues but the government is still turning a blind eye to their grievances. The government is responding to protesters with sticks. I have never seen such a failed government in my entire political career,” Chautala added.“The BJP-JJP leaders are not allowed to visit their constituency which showcases the resentment against them. The Congress has hatched a conspiracy against me for giving jobs to 3,600 junior basic teachers during our tenure, following which I had to stay in jail. People of Haryana are looking towards us as we are capable enough to fulfil their dreams. Lakhs of people will attend Devi Lal’s birth anniversary in Jind on September 25,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chautala-starts-state-wide-tour-to-invite-people-to-devi-lal-s-birth-anniv-101630528509905.html

Out of the 149 commercial units on sale on leasehold basis, the board could sell only two units. The total reserve price of the two units was ₹1.06 crore and their sale fetched CHB ₹1.09 crore. Similarly, out of 33 residential units, only two found takers. The highest bids received against these units came to ₹90.85 lakh against a total reserve price of ₹89.83 lakh. Even in the previous e-auction held on August 10, CHB could sell only three of the 151 commercial units and five of the 38 residential units on offer. On the tepid response to the latest auction, Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB, said, “In the residential category, the number of units was low, limiting the bidders’ choice. The lack of provision for conversion of leasehold to freehold impacted the sale of commercial properties. The outcome of all e-tenders will be placed before the board in its meeting on September 9 for deliberations and appropriate measures.” Response to freehold properties tad betterThe freehold properties fared better in the auction though here also the response was lower than the last auction. CHB sold eight out of 34 units to the highest bidders. The reserve price of the eight units was ₹4.7 crore and a revenue of ₹4.8 crore was made from their sale. A freehold MIG flat in Sector 51 (West) went for ₹92.25 lakh against the reserve price of ₹90 lakh, while the highest bid for a commercial unit on leasehold basis in Sector 49-B was ₹56.5 lakh against the reserve price of ₹55.03 lakh. Similarly, a leasehold MIG flat in Sector 44-D received the highest bid of ₹53.41 lakh against the reserve price of ₹53.39 lakh. In all, CHB raked in ₹6.8 crore from the auction of eight residential units on freehold basis, and two residential and two commercial units on leasehold basis. These were offered against a total reserve price of ₹6.66 crore. “During the past five months, the board has sold 95 residential properties on freehold basis in five e-auctions and earned ₹75.4 crore against the total reserve price of ₹70.26 crore. For leasehold properties, the board earned ₹5.42 crore by selling nine residential units and ₹7.39 crore from the sale of commercial properties,” Garg added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chb-e-auction-finds-takers-for-only-4-of-182-leasehold-properties-101630528507319.html

The party, it is learnt, has decided to go ahead with Brar’s candidature to strengthen its claim that it had no involvement in the post-sacrilege firing incidents. Brar was the Kotkapura MLA when the firing incident took place in 2015. He was named as accused in the FIR alleging his involvement in the Kotkapura firing incident. The special investigation team (SIT) had claimed that Brar pressurised the then Kotkapura station house officer (SHO) Gurdeep Singh not to record statements of the complainant, Ajit Singh, and other persons injured in the police firing. Brar allegedly exchanged 157 calls with senior police officers on the day of firing and directed the administration to disperse the protesters by using force, the SIT had alleged.However, the chargesheets filed by SIT in the Kotkapura firing cases were quashed by the Punjab and Haryana high court in April and a fresh SIT was constituted by the state government to probe the Kotkapura firing case. The SAD on Wednesday announced its candidates from six constituencies in Punjab, repeating all the three candidates from Faridkot district who unsuccessfully contested the 2017 polls. Apart from Brar, Youth Akali Dal (YAD) president Parambans Singh Romana was declared candidate from Faridkot and Suba Singh Badal from Jaitu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/spotlight-on-sacrilege-sad-bets-on-police-firing-accused-mantar-brar-from-kotkapura-seat-101630528504728.html
02-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn employees to receive salary hike from October||Salaries of UT employees are set to increase by a minimum of 15% from October with the Chandigarh administration adopting the recommendations of the Sixth Punjab Pay Commission.The administration has notified the Punjab Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2021, in respect of the UT employees who draw pay on Punjab pattern. These will also apply to employees on deputation from Punjab. Most of the 20,000 UT employees stand to gain from the decision. The Sixth Punjab Pay Commission had submitted the first part of its report to the Punjab government on April 30, 2021, broadly comprising recommendations on revision of pay scales, allowances, and pension and retirement benefits.The Punjab government notified the revised pay rules on July 5 with effect from January 2016, followed by Chandigarh also deciding to roll out the pay hike from October this year. “Decision on payment of arrears for January 1, 2016, to September 30, 2021, will be taken in due course of time,” states the UT notification. “A salary increase of ₹8,000 to ₹16,000 per month is expected depending on the grade/post of the employee,” said a UT official. An employee currently getting ₹56,038 monthly pay can expect a hike of ₹9,454 to ₹14,910 per month, with the difference being mainly due to the rate of dearness allowance –17% or 28%. The rate of future increments in salary will be 3% of the basic pay, uniformly for all government employees. The notification states, “The level of posts shall be determined in accordance with the grade pay assigned to the post as per the recommendations of the Fifth Punjab Pay Commission notified by the government in 2009.” The Fifth Pay Commission was applicable from 2006. Gopal Dutt Joshi, general secretary, UT Powermen Association, said, “While the Punjab government doesn’t have the funds to release arrears of employees, the UT administration doesn’t have such constraints. It should immediately disburse the arrears due from January 1, 2016.” Balwinder Singh, president, Chandigarh Subordinate Services Federation, said, “The pay rise does not match the level of inflation in the country. The relief for UT employees has come too little, too late.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-employees-to-receive-salary-hike-from-october-101630528457604.html

02-09-2021||Delhi||112.1mm of rain in 24 hours is heaviest Delhi has seen in September in 19 years||Delhi on Wednesday received 112.1mm of rain, within a span of 24 hours, to record the highest single day rainfall for the month of September in 19 years and the fifth highest for the month since 1963, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) records. The intense rain showed no signs of abating and continued well into Wednesday morning, leading to widespread waterlogging on key stretches, residential colonies and low-lying areas. The weather officials said the rainfall activity is likely to decrease from Thursday — they have forecast only light and scattered rain over the next two days. “The monsoon trough has shifted southwards again and is closer to Delhi, which combined with easterly winds blowing over the north-west region resulted in these heavy spells. Light rain may occur in parts of the city on September 2-3,” an IMD official said, asking not to be named.According to the IMD rainfall data, the Safdarjung Observatory, considered representative of Delhi’s weather, received 112.1mm rain between 8.30am Tuesday and 8.30am Wednesday — the highest 24-hour rainfall in September since 2002. The last time it rained so much was on September 13, 2002, when Delhi received 126.8mm rain over 24 hours. The Palam weather station recorded 71.1mm rainfall over 24 hours. The Lodhi Road and Ridge weather stations recorded 120.2mm and 81.6 mm rain, respectively, during the same period, while the Ayanagar station received 68.2mm rainfall.Weather scientists said the Safdarjung observatory recorded another heavy spell of rain between 8.30am and 11.30am, measuring 75.6mm. The Palam weather station received 78.2mm during this period while Lodhi Road received 75.4mm, Ridge received 50 mm and Ayanagar received 68.2 mm.On Tuesday, too, Delhi received heavy rainfall measuring 84.1mm over six hours.Delhi has been receiving short and intense spells of rain instead of being more uniformly distributed this season, which weather experts say is adversely affecting the ecology. The intense spells have covered the monthly rainfall deficit as well.While August had ended with a monthly rainfall deficit of 13%, September has already recorded surplus rain on the first day of the month itself. August had received 214.5 mm rain against the normal reading of 247.7mm. However, September has received 112.1mm rain in just one day, against a normal reading of 6.6mm for the month so far. Delhi this monsoon (from June 1) has received 868.5mm rainfall, against a normal reading of 530.4mm til September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/1121mm-of-rain-in-24-hours-is-heaviest-delhi-has-seen-in-september-in-19-years-101630528450954.html

Irregularities in this case have been going on continuously since 2004,” the CM said, according to the spokesperson.“A special inquiry committee should be constituted at the government level and a thorough investigation be done,” Adityanath said at a high-level meeting in Lucknow on Wednesday.On August 4, while reserving its judgment in the case, the apex court observed that the conduct of the Noida authority “reeks of corruption from the eyes, ears and nose”.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah on Tuesday directed that Supertech shall carry out the demolition at its own expense and will complete it within three months under the supervision of Noida authority and an expert body such as the Central Building Research Institute.Further, the court ordered that Supertech will refund money to all the existing homebuyers in Emerald Court’s Apex and Ceyane towers within two months, along with an interest of 12% per annum from the date of their deposits. Besides, the developer shall shell out ₹2 crores to the Emerald Court Owner Resident Welfare Association (RWA), which had led the legal battle against erection of the twin towers on a green area and in breach of the minimum distance norms.“The sanction for the construction of Tower-16 and Tower-17 were given by NOIDA (New Okhla Industrial Development Authority) in contravention of the minimum distance requirement provided by the building regulations... the record of this case is replete with instances which highlight the collusion between the officers of NOIDA with the appellant and its management. The case has revealed a nefarious complicity of the planning authority in the violation by the developer of the provisions of law,” the apex court held.The Noida authority on Wednesday said a two-member committee has begun investigation to identify the guilty officials. “The committee will probe into all aspects of this case and is likely to submit a report within a week,” said Ritu Maheshwari CEO of the Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/up-cm-yogi-adityanath-orders-probe-in-supertech-towers-case-criminal-cases-against-guilty-101630528449730.html

As per the data shared by the health department, of the 20 lakh people who have received the shot, only five lakh are fully vaccinated, while the rest have only received a single dose. Of the 20 lakh people inoculated in the district so far, 12 lakh are men and eight lakh women. As per the health department, 11,77,817 men have been vaccinated so far, while 8,07,560 women have got the jab, leaving a gap of 3,70,257 doses between the genders. Experts say vaccine hesitancy due to rumoured side effects, lack of information, technical and logistical support, and patriarchal social values are responsible for the gender gap in Covid vaccination. Vaccination in-charge Dr Puneet Juneja says, “A variety of factors are responsible for the gender gap in the vaccination drive. We are doing better than other states in bridging the gender gap. Women should also come forward and get vaccinated as they too are at a similar risk of catching the fatal infection as men.” An age-wise breakup reveals that 9,80,298 people in the 18 to 44 age bracket have received the jab, 6,15,606 people in the 45 to 60 bracket have been vaccinated and 3,89,751 people above the age of 60 have got the shot. Ludhiana, which has the distinction of being the most populous district, is leading the state in the vaccination drive. It had crossed the milestone of inoculating 10 lakh people on June 22. Out of 20 lakh people vaccinated in the district so far, five lakh people were vaccinated in August.Dr Juneja says the vaccination drive is on the right track and people are receiving the second dose at regular intervals of 12 to 16 weeks as suggested by the government.In a nutshell Category PeopleMen: 11,77,817Women: 8,07,560Gender gap : 3, 70,257First dose: 14,85,551Second doses: 5,00,10418 to 44 age group: 9,80,29845 to 60 age group: 6,15,60660+ age group: 3,89,751||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/women-falling-behind-in-vaccination-drive-in-ludhiana-101630528445974.html

02-09-2021||Mumbai||PM2.5 exposure reducing lifespan in Mumbai by 3.7 years: AQLI||Exposure to PM2.5 — respirable particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter — is potentially reducing the lifespan of Mumbai citizens by an average of 3.7 years, suggests a recently updated index known as the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) by the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute (EPIC).The index also shows that the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Mumbai increased from 43.4ug/m3 to 47.9ug/m3 from 2016 to 2019. Accordingly, the outcome for life expectancy has been unfavourable and the average reduction in a single citizen’s lifespan has also increased from 3.3 years in 2016 to 3.7 years in 2019. This is based on AQLI’s epidemiological assumption that life expectancy is reduced by 0.98 years for every 10μg/m3 of sustained exposure to particulate matter.AQLI was first published in 2018, using available data till 2016. The latest instalment in AQLI uses updated air pollution data till 2019 and translates it into impact on life expectancy using an approach similar to that deployed in China, where populations north of Huai River are provided free or subsidised coal for indoor heating in the winter. AQLI is based on a study in which researchers were able to measure the effect of sustained exposure to high levels of pollution on a person’s life expectancy.As per the updated numbers released on Wednesday, the national average reduction in lifespan due to PM2.5 is 5.9 years in India, while that in Maharashtra is four years. In Pune, exposure to PM2.5 is reducing life expectancy by 4.2 years on an average. Gondia and Bhandara districts in Vidarbha were found to be the most polluted with life expectancy reducing by 5.1 and five years, respectively.Dr Piyush Goel, pulmonologist with a leading chain of private hospitals in Asia, explained that PM2.5 particles are minute enough to enter the alveoli in human lungs, where the exchange of respiratory gases takes place. “When this alien material, which comes from vehicles, construction and many other sources, enters the alveoli, the body begins to secrete mediating enzymes which cause destruction of lung tissue,” he said. These particles can even be tiny enough to pass through the alveoli and enter the blood stream, from where they get deposited in other organs, making them degenerate prematurely.“On the whole, inhalation of PM2.5 leads to a gradual degeneration of various parts of the body, which results in accelerated aging. This may be one reason why we’re seeing younger people having chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), heart attacks and similar ailments which were earlier majorly seen in older age groups,” Dr Goel said.Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist and epidemiologist from Hinduja hospital, emphasised that the link between ambient air pollution and life expectancy has been reported in multiple studies and guides WHO guidelines. “Air pollution has a strong link with respiratory disease through its association with diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death in India, as well as asthma and other underlying respiratory diseases. There is also a link with cardiovascular diseases through its effects on heart rate, blood pressure. It [AQLI] is important for policymakers because the focus on health is often on helping to build healthcare infrastructure, which addresses disease once it has occurred (tertiary prevention). Primary prevention might yield much higher returns, by promoting health, and preventing, rather than curing disease.”In a statement released on Wednesday, EPIC noted that India’s high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time. “Compared to a couple of decades ago, particulate pollution is no longer a feature of the Indo-Gangetic plains alone. Pollution has increased so much in the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. For example, the average person in those states is now losing an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy, relative to early 2000s,” it said.SN Tripathi, atmospheric scientist and professor at Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur who recently led an air pollution study across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), said the numbers are plausible, and that the increase in PM pollutants in Mumbai was likely to be due to anthropogenic activities. “We have always believed that Mumbai, being a coastal city, has a natural defence against air pollution, but now it seems even this has its limitations. In a recent study, we have observed PM2.5 concentrations of up to 100ug/m3 in some locations. The increase in such pollutants is likely to be due to human activity, namely vehicular emissions, construction or industries. Sectoral policies to mitigate emissions from these sources are the appropriate response. For example, a policy to increase adoption of cleaner transport and fuel would help bring down pollutants from vehicles and improve human health to a degree,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pm25-exposure-reducing-lifespan-in-mumbai-by-3-7-years-aqli-101630528391307.html

02-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Woman snatcher strikes again, takes away walker’s chain||A female snatcher struck again, the third time in the past four months, plucking a woman’s gold chain in Sector 23 on Tuesday night.The victim, Pardeep Kaur, was out for a walk with her two daughters around 8.40pm when a woman walked up to her and snatched her gold chain. Before Kaur could react, the snatcher ran towards her male accomplice waiting on a motorcycle in the nearby market and the duo sped away. “The woman was around 40 years old, was wearing jeans and had her hair tied with a claw clip. I was talking on the mobile phone when she attacked me from behind,” Kaur told the police. Acting on her complaint, a case under Section 379-A (snatching) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Sector 17 police station. According to police the area was poorly lit and not much could be made out from the CCTV footage. Not a firstOn May 30, a woman riding pillion on a motorcycle had snatched the mobile phone of a Sector 41 resident. More recently, on August 4, a man and a woman on a motorcycle had snatched a 76-year-old woman’s gold chain in Sector 15. So far the police have failed to make any headway into these cases. They have neither been able to track down the accused nor the motorcycles used by them. “Such gangs mostly cover the registration plates with mud or tape to avoid being traced,” said a senior police official. “Women are active in various crimes, but now Chandigarh is witnessing their involvement in snatchings as well. These crimes appear to be the handiwork of same people working together as a gang,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh. He said, “The lure of easy money was pulling youngsters into the vortex of crime, irrespective of gender.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhwoman-snatcher-strikes-again-takes-away-walker-s-chain-101630528388910.html

The hill-state recorded a total of 7,521 cases in August against 3,904 in July. The positivity rate which was 0.9% in July, climbed to over 2% in the month gone by. The overall positivity rate in the state currently is 6.7% Though the state government has made RT-PCR negative reports or vaccination certificate (both doses) mandatory for those trying to enter the state, there is no mechanism to check violations within the state boundaries. There is also no check on social gatherings, where the cap on attendees has been set at 50 for indoor facilities and 50% of the total capacity in open spaces. Norms are also being openly flouted in public transport, which are supposed to ply with 50% capacity but are running overcrowded. The State Executive Committee (SEC) has been issuing guidelines from time-to-time but the implementation is not as stringent as it was during the second and first wave. “We are issuing guidelines, the government is increasing testing and tracking to detect the positive cases,” said health minister Rajiv Sehzal, though he stayed mum on rallies and political events being organised by the Congress as well as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. What is more worrying is that of the 28 oxygen plants sanctioned in the state, only three are functional so far while another six plants had to be set up in the state under corporate social responsibility Mandi worst-hit: Political events to be blamed? Mandi is the worst-hit district in the state, recording 1,839 infections—highest among all 12 districts— in the month of August, which was more than double the July figure of 821. The central district, also the home turf of chief minister (CM) Jai Ram Thakur, has become a political hotbed in view of the Mandi parliamentary constituency byelections. The CM himself has been extensively touring the district and addressing public rallies, where people have been openly flouting the norms. There is no implementation of Covid safety rules in such events. Even the CM and leaders accompanying him have been seen without masks at such events. Mandi, with a high positivity rate of 5%, is among the 67 high Covid positivity districts in the country along with Lahaul-Spiti. Mandi is followed by Kangra, the largest district in terms of population, with 1,444 cases and Chamba with 1,377 cases. In the last one week, six of the 12 districts in the state had positivity rate above 2%. Lahaul-Spiti’s positivity rate is high but the absolute number of tests and cases reported is low compared to other districts. Covid becoming lethal again With rising infections, the number of fatalities has also gone up. In August, a total 77 people died of the infection as compared to 42 in July. Forty-seven people have died in last two weeks with weekly CFR crossing 1.5%. On an average, three to four fatalities are being reported daily in the state while the highest number in a day was six.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachals-covid-cases-shot-up-by-92-in-august-101630528386842.html

These will be reopened this month after all students are vaccinated.”Earlier after a review of Covid-19 situation in the union territory, the government had allowed higher educational institutions, where 100% staff and students were vaccinated, to open for ‘limited on-site’ classes.During the review, conducted under the chairmanship of chief secretary Arun Kumar Mehta last week, it was reiterated that there was a need to continue with the existing containment measures in all districts “in view of the uneven trend observed in daily Covid cases”.In an order on Sunday, the chief secretary had said that all educational institutes, including coaching centres, shall continue to remain closed for onsite or in-person teaching till further orders. However, higher educational institutions can be permitted to commence with limited in-person teaching, subject to 100% vaccination of staff and students and specific permission of deputy commissioners concerned. “Such institutions can organise special vaccination camps in consultation with the district administration,” the order said.The other educational institutions can allow attendance of vaccinated staff for administrative purposes. Schools and colleges have been closed in Jammu and Kashmir since March when the second wave of Covid-19 had started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-will-open-higher-educational-institutes-once-all-students-are-vaccinated-lg-101630528385693.html

Since inspector general of police (IGP) Surinder Pal Singh Parmar took over as SIT head in February, no further progress was made in the case as a supplementary chargesheet is yet to be filed in court. The SIT had so far focused on the other two interlinked sacrilege cases with the arrest of Dera Sacha Sauda followers and filing of chargesheets against them. IG Parmar along with other team members — assistant inspector general of police (AIG) Rajinder Singh Sohal and deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Lakhbir Singh —visited Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on Wednesday and interacted with the locals seeking their assistance in the investigation. In the morning, the SIT members visited the Bajakhana police station and discussed the probe status. The SIT head appealed to the locals to provide any information regarding the “bir” theft. “This is the place of origin of sacrilege incidents. Therefore, it was important to talk with the locals. Sometimes people are hesitant about sharing information. We have already filed chargesheets in two sacrilege cases, while the challan in this case will be filed soon after collecting evidence,” he said. Refusing to comment on the chargesheet filed by IG Ranbir Singh Khatra naming the dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh as an accused, Parmar said, “We will move ahead in the case as per evidence only.” Whether the jailed dera head will be questioned in this cases, the IG said that will depend on the evidence that they may come across. The “bir” was stolen on June 1, 2015, and a case was registered at the Bajakhana police station in the district the next day. The SIT led by IG Parmar is probing the “bir” theft case and two other interlinked cases wherein derogatory posters were put up at Bargari on September 24, 2015, and torn pages of a “bir” were found scattered near the Bargari gurdwara on October 12 the same year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sacrilege-probe-at-a-standstill-sit-now-turns-focus-on-burj-jawahar-singh-wala-bir-theft-case-101630528329626.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently inaugurated four new galleries and opened the renovated memorial virtually, a year-and-a-half after it was closed for the revamp.The well into which the people jumped when forces led by Reginald Dyer opened fire on them has been covered with a transparent barrier. The narrow entrance has been adorned with sculptures. A daily sound and light show explaining the events has been started.Ministry of culture secretary Raghvendra Singh argued the complex was in dire need of conservation. “Instead of letting a derelict structure to fall, we have restored it to conserve it for posterity,” he told PTI, but refused to comment on the political storm brewing over the restoration.On the criticism over the light and sound show, he said that the show existed but it became defunct over time. “The soundtrack is so poignant. It has been very sensitively done and is informative as well. Anyone coming to this place will leave better informed. The galleries too have been improved, technology has been improved to bring out the poignancy of the killings of innocents and how the incident influenced other bravehearts,” said Singh. He said the work has been done with “utmost respect”. Slamming the revamp, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said only a person who does not know the “meaning of martyrdom can inflict such an insult on the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh”.“I am the son of a martyr — I will not tolerate the insult of martyrs at any cost…We are against this indecent cruelty,” he had earlier this week.Some historians have also criticised the work terming it an “insult towards the martyrs”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jallianwala-bagh-complex-restored-with-utmost-respect-culture-ministry-101630528328166.html

August, however, also saw a 6% decline in average daily tests with 53,359 persons tested daily as against 56,719 in July. The union territory reported 3,957 infections and 30 deaths in August while in July, it saw 5,800 cases and 55 deaths. In June, the UT had seen 25,197 cases and 416 deaths.Last month, experts had warned that the cases may see a substantial rise by the third week of August as restrictions had been lifted and people were hardly wearing masks.Prof Dr Mohammad Salim Khan, head of the department of community medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar, and nodal officer, Covid, said that the situation seems fine as of now. “The current trend is not that scary. Vaccination has certainly augmented our immunities, though not that profoundly. There may be a slight rise but it will be unlike (the intensity of) the second wave,” he said.There was a slight increase in TPR in the last-third of August, climbing to 0.26 % for the period of August 21-31 after recording 0.22% in the first-third (August 1-10) and 0.23% in the second-third (August 11-20).However, Srinagar saw an increase in active cases in the past week. From 293 active cases on August 24, the capital has 528 active cases on August 31. “Srinagar is showing an upward trend in cases. That should not happen as it is the capital city and may affect other places as well. That is a cause of concern,” said Khan.In June, the TPR in the UT was recorded at 1.80%. In May, when the second Covid-19 wave peaked, the TPR was 8.77% with the month recording 1.14 lakh cases and 1,625 deaths.The UT conducted 16.54 lakh tests in August as against 17.58 lakh tests in July – a decline of around 6%. In June, 13.93 lakh tests were performed. Dr Owais H Dar, general secretary of Doctors Association of Kashmir, said that August was a fluctuating phase for J&K. “Nobody can say exactly when the third wave will hit. It is more likely that the cases may rise again after September 15 but this time, we are better prepared,” he said.He said that the intensity of the third wave may not be as severe as the second wave.“Our preparations for the third wave are good. We are better vaccinated. Oxygen plants have also been augmented. And schools are yet to be opened,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jammu-and-kashmir-s-covid-cases-dipped-by-31-deaths-by-45-in-august-101630528325746.html

Before this, he had also cast his vote in the science and combined faculties amid polling for six faculties of PU. Gheraoed by students, the V-C tried to leave by getting on a security guard’s motorcycle, but eventually managed to board his official vehicle and left amid jeers by students.The students have been on an indefinite protest since August 14 for reopening of the campus and immediate conduct of polling for the registered graduate constituency.On Tuesday, they had also locked the main entrance of the varsity’s administration block. “We have been protesting for the last 19 days outside his office, and even marched towards his house and administration block, but neither the V-C nor any official has paid heed to our demands. So we wanted to ask him to address our demands,” said Aman of Punjab Students Union (PSU-Lalkaar).Chief of university security Vikram Singh refused to comment on the matter, while the varsity’s official spokesperson said the students should have maintained the dignity of student-teacher relationship.Meanwhile, according to candidates, Kumar’s presence at the venue was unprecedented, as a PU V-C has never voted in senate polls in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-vice-chancellor-heckled-by-protesting-students-amid-senate-polls-101630528324595.html
02-09-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Classroom teaching resumes for primary students||Classroom teaching for students of the primary section (classes 1 to 5) resumed in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday after nearly five months of closure of schools due to Covid-19 with attendance varying from a meagre 25% to moderate 70% on the first day.With this, physical classes from grades 1 to 12 are now operational across the state. Students of class 9 to 12 returned to school on August 16 and those of classes 6 to 8 on August 24.On day one, the turnout remained low due to a number of reasons. Parents were concerned about the health of their children for whom no Covid-19 vaccine has become available yet. Concern over a possible third wave in the future also appeared to have made them cautious.Plus, a number of schools are not plying school vehicles to transport students. At St Teresa’s College in Lucknow, students reached school either with their parents or on bicycles.“The school will provide transport from September 6 for those students whose parents ask for vehicle service,” said Geetika Kapoor, principal of St Teresa’s College in Aashiana locality of the state capital.“Commuting daily to school will be mostly taken up by parents through their own vehicles or hired ones with minimal seating. School will provide conveyance facility after taking the consent for the same, most probably by September 6,” said Anil Agarwal, managing director of St Joseph group of institutions in Lucknow.St Joseph group of institutions saw attendance of around 58.21% for classes 1 to 5. Parents accompanied primary section students to school in their own vehicles. Some children came on hired auto-rickshaws as well. Those staying nearby came walking with their parents.Mala Mehra, principal of Hoerner College in the state capital, said, “All students were dropped by parents and no public transport was seen. All Covid-19 protocols were met within the campus as well as during entry and exit. Staggered timings made the task easier as the entire school didn’t come and go at the same time. Whereas 75% attendance was witnessed in pre-primary, it was 44% for the primary section. The feedback from students and parents was most positive and encouraging.”The thrill of being back at school was palpable as the children were greeted with balloons and toffees.It was hustle and bustle at Hoerner College as the pre-primary and primary sections returned after one-and-a half years, Mehra said.GD Goenka Public School conducted classes on the campus for grade 1-8 students on Wednesday.“Students from grade 9 to 12 have been attending the offline classes since August 16, 2021. This essential exercise of letting students attend in-person classes in school is a step towards normalcy. Amid Covid-19, every classroom has sanitisation facilities. Students’ thermal checking on arrival and use of pulse oximeter is among the school’s standard operating procedures. Students and teachers are required to wear masks all the time. Seating arrangements in classrooms and the entry and exit of students have been planned to keep the obligatory distancing in mind,” said Raveen Pande, principal of the school. More than 45% of parents have given their consent to send their children to school, Pande said.At City Montessori School (CMS), 12, 222 of the total 20,03 students on the rolls of class 1 to 5 were present.“It was extremely delightful to see the students of primary section come back to schools. They were themselves very excited to be back. We are ensuring complete safety of our students by strictly following Covid protocols. The safety of students is our topmost priority,” said CMS founder Dr Jagdish Gandhi.Justifying the state government’s decision to reopen schools, UP basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi said, “As the Covid situation has eased, it was felt necessary to reopen schools in UP in a phased manner.” He said under chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s guidance, the Covid-19 situation was “well within control” and more than six crore people in the state were vaccinated. Dwivedi visited a government primary school in Makdampur. He said every school would have a nodal officer to keep a watch on the students’ health.At several government schools, teachers accorded a warm welcome to students by applying tilak, offering laddus and garlanding them as they entered the school premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-classroom-teaching-resumes-for-primary-students-101630528276146.html
02-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MVA delegation meets Governor, seeks nod for MLC names||Nine months after recommending 12 names as nominations to the post of members of the legislative council, a three-member delegation led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Wednesday evening and requested him to clear the appointments. The governor has assured them to take a final decision soon, a leader from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government said. The delegation comprised deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar (NCP) and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat (Congress).The appointment of 12 members has become a major friction point between Koshyari and the three-party coalition government in Maharashtra. It has been 20 days since the Bombay high court said the governor is constitutionally obligated to either accept or reject the proposal sent by the state within reasonable time. The verdict was passed by the court on August 13, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed against the governor’s inaction on the recommendations made by the Thackeray government.“We requested the governor to see if the decision can be taken early as it would help in the functioning of the state legislature. We said it was our request to accept the recommendation even though it is your right to take a decision,” Pawar told reporters outside Raj Bhavan after their meeting with Koshyari.“He (governor) has no objection to any of the names recommended by the state government. The governor told us that he has heard everything and will take a final decision soon,” he added.Thorat said, “We discussed almost all major issues of the state such as floods, monsoon, Covid-19 and at the end requested him to take a decision on appointing MLCs.”The MVA leaders wanted to meet the governor last Wednesday, but Koshyari denied an appointment owing to prior appointments, it is said.

The Congress staged a demonstration outside Adani agri fresh fruits store in Bithal in Rampur subdivision. Wholesale apple prices had sharply declined three weeks ago while it further declined after agri fresh stores announced new prices. “Farmers will continue to raise their voice against the open loot started by the corporate,” he said. He said the Congress will fight a decisive battle for the rights of farmers and fruit cultivators. Rathore said the state government has completely ignored the horticulturists. Nor has the government given them any relief. He said the BJP has exploited fruit cultivators at every stage. He said the government had assured that this time due to natural calamity, there would be no increase in the prices of cartons, but it was increased by Rs.25-30. He said the cost of apple production was increasing. It is falling and is now being sold in the market at the same price. Rathore said the horticulture department in the state has been given to a leader who neither has experience nor interest in horticulture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachal-govt-ignored-apple-cultivators-rathore-101630528271410.html
02-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt gives nod to policy to set up medical colleges, hosps with help of private sector||In a bid to provide better medical services across the state, address the shortage of qualified doctors and bridge the gap in medical education, the state cabinet on Wednesday cleared a policy to allow setting up new medical colleges and super speciality hospitals on public-private partnership (PPP) basis. The policy is expected to boost the number of doctors, including intensivists and specialists, in the state, as well as augment the medical infrastructure in the state. The model will help set up new medical colleges and specialised hospitals and also link new private medical colleges with existing functional district hospitals to increase medical seats. Medical education department minister Amit Deshmukh said that the policy will help districts that do not have medical colleges so far. “This policy will be beneficial in districts where there are no medical colleges so far. It will boost the standard of medical education and also augment the medical services in the state. We are confident that the gap in the number of doctors, intensivists etc, which was felt during the pandemic in Maharashtra, will be reduced by this policy. The numbers of doctors, nurses, paramedics, super-specialists will be filled up through this,” the minister said after the cabinet meeting.According to officials, 20 new medical colleges and super speciality hospitals can add 350 doctors including Doctor of Medicine (MD) and Master of Surgeon (MS) in the state, taking the total to 1,000 in three years. In 10 years, 1800 new medical colleges seats for MBBS will be created. Besides that, the additional medical infrastructure will help cater to 10 million patients in the OPD sections, 2,500 surgeries in one year.“From 2026, 200 additional intensive care units will be created, and the hospitals will be able to provide about 300,000 outpatients and about 75,000 admissions per year. The establishment of new medical colleges and speciality hospitals through public-private investment will create skilled and unskilled employees in small towns,” a statement from CMO said.Deshmukh added that the district hospitals where tertiary care is provided can be upgraded and modernised through this policy and a medical college can come up in the same vicinity. “Our intention is to create world-class medical infrastructure in the districts. Similarly, greenfield projects can also come up where the government will provide them with the land, where the interested private player will set up a medical college, super speciality hospital and other required amenities,” he said.To give a push in setting up of colleges and hospitals in rural and remote areas in the state, the state government could provide some incentive to private players. The incentive would be a part of the Industries Department’s Package Scheme for Incentives, officials said. He said that 17 districts in the state do not have a medical college. The statement from CMO added that the viability difference fund (VGF) will be financed by the Central government, as per the Niti Aayog’s policy. The VGF is a key bidding parameter. “In view of the continuous population growth, it is imperative to increase the number of doctors in the state from the point of view of public health and for this, it is necessary to set up new government medical colleges in the state,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-gives-nod-to-policy-to-set-up-medical-colleges-hosps-with-help-of-private-sector-101630528268577.html

02-09-2021||Mumbai||6,504 fully jabbed contracted Covid in Mumbai||In Mumbai, 6,504 individuals have contracted Covid-19 after taking both vaccine doses against novel coronavirus, with a few beneficiaries having contracted the Delta Plus variant. As per the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), such breakthrough infections have been recorded in only 1.5% of the fully vaccinated population in the city. If breakthrough infections increase and get more severe, there might be a need to boost immunity through homologous or heterologous booster doses, said medical experts. A breakthrough infection is when a person develops Covid-19 after two weeks of being fully vaccinated. Those vaccinated are much more likely to have mild symptoms compared to those who are not vaccinated. Last month, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC (health), who is fully vaccinated, contracted the Covid infection. He was mildly symptomatic and was treated at Seven Hills Hospital, Marol. “No vaccine is 100% effective against the illness. Some fully vaccinated people will get sick and may require hospitalisation. Data across the globe shows that vaccination makes illness less severe for those who are immunised,” said Kakani. The state Covid-19 task force said the purpose of anti-Covid-19 vaccines is to save lives. Immunisation contributes to eradicating an infection only when the vaccines reach a certain quantum, in terms of the number of vaccinated people. Dr Rahul Pandit, part of the task force, citing an example, said that smallpox or polio viruses were eradicated after several mass immunisation programmes across the globe for decades. “In case of Covid, there will be no infection after vaccination only when 70-90% people across the globe are completely vaccinated. That is when the infection rate will also go down,” said Dr Pandit. Doctors said it’s too early to predict if the trend is worrisome. It will depend on the proportion of vaccine breakthrough cases that progress to moderate and severe infections. But if the cases increase, immunity boosters might be an option. “If that proportion is very small, Covid-19 will become an endemic disease like common cold, without a heavy healthcare burden. If not, we need to start thinking of ways to boost immunity, such as homologous or heterologous booster doses,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist and epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital. Medical experts said as the efficiency rate of the available vaccines is around 70%, such a phenomenon is not rare. “Breakthrough infections with variants such as Delta are worrisome as they are highly transmissible and put those who haven’t been vaccinated at a high risk of getting infected,” said Dr Pinto. Globally, this breakthrough pattern is being observed in around 1% of fully vaccinated people. “As long as we are able to keep patients out of hospitals and ICUs, we should look at it as winning the battle against the virus.” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/6504-fully-jabbed-contracted-covid-in-mumbai-101630528264675.html

Commuters had a difficult time between 8am and 10am due to slow movement of traffic on major roads.“There was heavy waterlogging on several roads in Indirapuram. The worst affected stretch was from Mangal Bazaar Chowk to Rail Vihar that witnessed almost knee-deep waterlogging. The other areas like Niti Khand and Shakti Khand were also affected. In Shakti Khand 1, water even entered some houses,” said Mohan Sangwan, a resident of Shakti Khand in Indirapuram. “Commuters suffered a lot while reaching their workplaces due to heavily waterlogged roads. Pockets of Ahimsa Khand 2, Vaibhav Khand and near Shipra Sun City were also waterlogged as these are low-lying areas,” said Alok Kumar, a resident of Arihant Harmony in Ahimsa Khand 2, Indirapuram. Residents who travelled outside the city also faced major issues. “I was travelling to Bulandshahr from Vaishali and got stuck at Lal Kuan intersection (GT Road) which was heavily waterlogged. Vehicles were hardly moving. It took more than 30 minutes of cross the intersection. In Vaishali, waterlogging was prevalent in sectors 1, 2, 3 and 4,” said BK Pandey, resident of Vaishali. Govindpuram resident Pratibha Rai also complained of heavy waterlogging on main road leading to Harsaon police lines. “I was to go to a school for submission of forms for my daughter. Due to heavy waterlogging, my car got stuck in water and we had to return home,” she said. The weather analysts, meanwhile, said that there are chances of light to moderate rains on Thursday.According to the Indian Meteorological Department, Ghaziabad recorded an average rainfall of 12mm over the past 24 hours (between 5.30pm Tuesday and 5.30pm Wednesday). The automatic weather monitoring station at CDO Ghaziabad did not get a record for morning rainfall. According to IMD, Ghaziabad has so far recorded 178.2mm of rainfall since June 1 till date, which is 60% deficient, against expected 448.9mm. Officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation said that they have deployed teams in areas like Kavi Nagar, Vijay Nagar, Vaishali, among others. “The team continued their work throughout the day. We even roped in jetting machines to clear off water from roads. The volume of rainwater was high. But most of the waterlogged areas were got cleared by evening,” said Pramod Kumar, additional municipal commissioner. The officials of the Ghaziabad development authority, which maintains Indirapuram locality, said that pumps were deployed to clear the waterlogged areas. “The intensity of rain was high that caused waterlogging in some areas. Our teams worked continuously to clear water from low-lying areas,” said AK Chaudhary, executive engineer of the authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/heavy-rain-waterlogging-throw-life-out-of-gear-in-ghaziabad-101630528224860.html
02-09-2021||Chandigarh||HC grants temporary custody of minor to NRI father, final call to be taken by US court||The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted custody of a minor child to his NRI father and directed the wife to return to the US with the child.The HC bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi observed that it will be in best of interest of the minor that an order be passed for his return to the US, from where he was removed. It will be appropriate that the question of appointment of guardian/handing over custody of the minor child to either of the parents be left for adjudication by the court of competent jurisdiction in the US on the basis of paramount consideration of welfare of the child, it said. The order came on the plea of an NRI techie from Benton County, Arkansas, US. The couple had gotten married in New York in 2011 and the child was born in January 2016. The mother left for Gurugram in January 2019 for surgery of the child. But as per the petitioner father, she started making excuses to not return to the US even as the deadline as per consent given by him for travel of the child ended in September 2019. In June 2020, the father had approached HC seeking custody of the child with the minor being a US citizen. He had also secured an order on custody of the child from jurisdictional court in the US in his favour. The mother had argued that only one surgery has been performed and that child needs to be operated upon again. The child is being monitored and requires regular follow-ups. The standard medical care and ease of availability of medical advice is better in India, she had argued. She had also levelled allegations of domestic violence against the NRI petitioner. The court had sought a report from lawyer Anil Malhotra who was appointed as amicus curaie. He had opined that the jurisprudence in child abduction law varies in India. The welfare of the child principle being the paramount consideration, there is a tendency among Indian courts to digress from a consistent approach, he had submitted. The court took note of the fact that there is a pre-existing order of the foreign court in favour of the father. But added that the same is not determinative of the question of repatriation of the minor child as same is to be decided on the test of “best of interest and welfare” of the minor child. To determine the same, the court had held a summary inquiry on various aspects of the case. “…Repatriation of minor child to US will not be harmful to him on account of his medical condition,” the court said, adding that there is no reasonable ground to believe that the minor child cannot be given due personal care and attention in the US by the father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-grants-temporary-custody-of-minor-to-nri-father-final-call-to-be-taken-by-us-court-101630528224257.html

In the past also, corporators had blamed EcoGreen for poor sanitation in the state capital. Now, in the wake of fever and dengue cases, there is pressure on the LMC to deploy more sanitation agencies.Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said, “It’s a proposal that needs to be implemented soon by LMC. We cannot compromise with the health of Lucknowites. More than one agency could be roped in for collection of waste and sanitation work in every zone.”“The proposal in this regard is being considered by the authorities,” said Dr SK Rawat, nagar swasthya adhikari. EcoGreen is covering around 50% of houses in the city, but there are complaints about workers not collecting waste. At many places, workers of the company don’t turn up daily for waste collection, he said.He added , “Some of the agencies supplying manpower to LMC are under scanner for fudging records of their employees. Many times, the companies don’t appoint the staff in adequate numbers because of which sanitation in the area suffers.”In the past, the LMC tried to introduce Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology so that bar codes could be used to ensure door-to-door garbage collection.“The LMC brought the technology from a Pune firm at ₹10 lakh. But the sanitation workers never allowed its implementation,” said Rawat.“Now, the corporation is thinking of starting a pilot project in which a sanitation worker will be required to scan the ward using a smartphone, after collection of waste or cleaning the lane. However, the sanitation workers take a plea that they don’t have any smart phone with them. This has to be sorted out,” added Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lmc-may-rope-in-more-agencies-for-door-to-door-collection-of-waste-101630528210087.html

He paid his tribute to those killed in the massacre of April 13, 1919.“I have paid my homage to the martyrs. The complete renovation team has done a wonderful and archaeologically right job. No changes have been made to the archaeological site of this place,” the governor wrote in the visitor’s book. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, virtually inaugurated the historic site on August 28. The renovation had led to a huge row with historians, among others, criticising the central government for ‘erasing history’ of the Bagh. It had also started a political debate in the country. On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi slammed the makeover of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre site as ‘belittling of the martyrdom’. However, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had said, “I don’t know what has been removed. Whatever I saw that night (at the inauguration event), it looked very nice to me.”Some family members of those who were killed during the massacre also raised objections over the work done on some parts of the Bagh and the changing of Amar Jyoti (the eternal flame) and the flag post.The governor also visited the Golden Temple and the Durgiana Temple in Amritsar, where the managements of both the sites honoured him. He, however, refrained from talking to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-alteration-made-in-jallianwala-bagh-punjab-governor-after-visit-101630528206756.html

The CRID has been dealing with some of the flagship programmes of the government, the progress of which is personally monitored by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.Sinha is among 19 IAS officers who were either transferred or given additional charge, the government order read.The transfer order came a day after the state government sought a report from Karnal deputy commissioner on the alleged video that surfaced after police action on protesting farmers at Bastara toll plaza on Saturday. Chief secretary Vijai Vardhan has reportedly asked the deputy commissioner to also take into account Sinha’s version of events while preparing the report.In the video clip, Sinha was heard instructing a group of policemen: “Utha utha ke maarna peeche sabko (hit them hard)…We shall not allow this cordon to be breached. We have enough force available. We haven’t slept for the past two days. But you have come here after taking some sleep… Mere paas ek bhi banda nikal ke nahi aana chahiye. Agar aaye toh sar foota hua hona chahiye. Clear hai aapko (No one should break the cordon and reach me. If someone does, make sure he has a broken head. Hope this is clear).”The IAS officer, however, alleged the video was edited and consisted of selected portions of his instructions to the cops.Police had used force on the protesters when farmers allegedly tried to march towards the venue of the BJP meeting, in which the chief minister and other senior party leaders from the state were present.While the CM admitted that Sinha’s choice of words was wrong, he defended the police action against the farmers. Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala also condemned Sinha’s instructions to the police and assured action against the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/karnal-sdm-ayush-sinha-transferred-101630521603939.html
02-09-2021||Chandigarh||‘Auto appeal software to hasten delivery of services in Haryana’||An auto appeal software (AAS) was launched on Wednesday to ensure that citizens get delivery of services by government departments in a time bound manner in Haryana.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said this will bring transparency and accountability in government functioning.The software of the Haryana Right to Service Commission will ensure that if a government department fails to deliver a service to a citizen within a stipulated time period under the Right to Service Act, the matter will get auto escalated to an appellate authority.The commission, constituted under the Haryana Right to Service Act, aims to provide delivery of service to citizens in a time-bound manner.RTSC chief commissioner TC Gupta said if the service still remained undelivered, the application will get escalated to a higher authority and so on to the RTSC.Also, citizens can themselves file an appeal against rejection of a service by a government department, Gupta added.At present, 546 services pertaining to 31 departments have been notified under the Right to Service Act. The Act has also notified designated officers, first and second grievance redressal authority for delivery of services.Gupta said with the introduction of auto appeal software, people can expect services to be delivered within a stipulated time frame. “Officers and employees will no longer be able to take things casually. Failure to deliver may result in action and they can lose their job if a monetary penalty is imposed on three occasions,” Gupta added.The chief commissioner said all deputy commissioners have also been given clear direction to review the status of notified services under the Right to Service Act. The DCs have been told that if a district’s score is below 8 (out of 10), then a displeasure note will be communicated, and if the score is above 9.5, then a letter of appreciation will be given every month.Khattar said AAS will prove to be a milestone in timely-delivery of government services. He said action should be taken against the officer or employee who does not work within the prescribed time limit.“The punishment fixed by the commission for dereliction of service delivery should be strictly implemented. But the officers and employees who work ahead of time should also be rewarded,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/auto-appeal-software-to-hasten-delivery-of-services-in-haryana-101630521543999.html
02-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: No decision on school restart yet, says Varsha Gaikwad||Maharashtra school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Wednesday said they are yet to take a decision on reopening schools in the state. The state task force had a meeting with the school education department and asked them to make changes to the standard operating procedure (SOP) prepared by them. Following the changes, they will again meet to finalise the SOP. The proposal will then be sent to the chief minister for final approval.“We had a meeting with the state task force as well as the paediatric task force last week, during which they asked us to make changes to the SOP. We have started our preparations. We will again have a meeting with the task force to finalise it and then a proposal will be sent to the chief minister for final approval,” Gaikwad said. “They also want us to brief parents and teachers on what they need to do when physical classes resume in schools for which we have started our preparations,” she added.Physical classes in schools were shut in Maharashtra from March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the state. On July 12, schools in rural areas were allowed to resume physical classes for Class 8 to 12 students in areas where Covid-19 cases are minimal. Nearly 17,701 schools resumed offline classes in rural areas, where Covid-19 cases are on the decline, said the officials.From August 17, the school education department decided to reopen physical classes in schools even in urban areas. It was decided that the offline classes will be allowed for Class 8 to 12 in urban areas and for Class 5 to 7 in rural areas of the state. The decision was deferred following strong opposition from the state task force on Covid-19.On August 29, state health minister Rajesh Tope also said they are working on vaccinating all teaching and non-teaching staff by September 5, which will be their first step towards reopening schools in the state. “We have been asked to complete the vaccination drive of teaching and non-teaching staff by September 5. They have been asked to hold a special drive for the same, if required. This is a first step towards opening schools and the final decision will be taken after holding deliberations with the state task force,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-no-decision-on-school-restart-yet-says-varsha-gaikwad-101630521489403.html

There were allegations that Dhull had demanded and accepted the bribe from complainant Sandeep, who had applied for a loan under the Pradhan Mantri Rozgar Yojana. He was arrested by the CBI with the first instalment of ₹10,000.Seeking leniency, Dhull had stated that he is not a previous convict and was not involved in any criminal activity. He is facing the agony of a protracted trial since 2016. So, a lenient view may be taken while awarding a sentence for him.But public prosecutor for the CBI, Kanwar Pal Singh, argued that in order to check rampant corruption in public life, it is needed to give exemplary punishment to the public servant who was found indulging in corrupt practices.Sushil Kumar Garg, special judge, CBI, said: “Be you ever so high, the law is above you. One lie is enough to question all truths. But it is the duty of the court to enforce the rule of law and, thus, to guard against erosion of the rule of law. We all are governed by the rule of law, not by the rule of man.”“This court agrees with arguments of the public prosecutor and observation made in the judgment cited by him that undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would be more harmful to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in efficacy of law and corruption is a hydra-headed monster and it is eating into vitals of the country,” the court observed.Stating that his conduct is highly deplorable, judge Sushil Kumar Garg observed: “Any softness in this regard could produce an undesirable result, namely, encouragement to adoption of corrupt means by public servants which has indeed to be checked.” The court awarded him four-year imprisonment and a fine of ₹1 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bribery-4-yr-jail-to-the-then-senior-bank-manager-of-pnb-kaithal-101630521425547.html

It has adjourned the matter for two weeks.Bhushan on Wednesday said Alam’s petition was a copy-paste of the plea that he filed in the SC. Bhushan said, “Prayer in my application was just to take it on record after we were granted liberty by the SC…My petition is pending in the SC.”Solicitor general Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said, “...Mr Alam seems to have copied and followed the dangerous path of Mr Bhushan (NGO’s counsel). The debutant should be stopped here and now.” He also said the petitioner must be investigated. When the court asked advocate BS Bagga, Alam’s counsel, if the petition was copied, he replied in negative. The bench posted the matter for further hearing on September 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-seeks-centre-response-on-plea-challenging-appointment-of-asthana-as-delhi-police-chief-101630521423337.html

They have already booked around 40,000 farmers so far but there is no impact on the agitation,” he said during his visit to Kaithal on Wednesday.“We don’t fear going to jails. We have more farmers ready to go to jail than the capacity of their prisons,” he added.Reacting to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s statement that the government may take strict action if farmers try to disrupt law and order after a state-level meeting of the Morcha leaders was scheduled in Karnal on September 7 against the lathicharge on farmers on August 28, Charuni said, “The government is free to take any action against us. We are ready to even sacrifice our lives but we will not allow them to sell our land and agriculture to corporate houses.”“We are fighting for the future generations of farmers,” he added. “The Karnal lathi-charge was enough to prove that the BJP has forgotten humanity. Farmers were beaten up mercilessly. This is a fight against the rich corporates and politicians,” he said.He said people who did not have any contribution in the freedom movement are ruling the country but the farmers will not allow them to sell everything to rich corporations.Charuni also addressed farmers in Kaithal and urged them to reach Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh to attend the mahapanchayat on September 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-cannot-suppress-the-agitation-with-lathis-firs-charuni-101630521305036.html
02-09-2021||Noida||Noida: Rains leave several roads waterlogged||Noida: Morning showers in Noida led to waterlogging and traffic snarls on several main roads of the city on Wednesday.The worst affected areas were Labour Chowk, underpass at Mamura metro bridge in Sector 61, Vishwakarma Marg, and Electronic City metro station. Heavy waterlogging was also reported from the stretch near Fortis hospital and Haldwani mod in Greater Noida, officials said.“The traffic was moving very slow due to the waterlogging at some areas, including the road near Fortis hospital, Sector 61 underpass and Labour Chowk, among others. However, at DND cut and Mahamaya Flyover, the traffic was normal as the water was pumped out before 8am,” said an official from the Noida traffic police department.With some of the major roads waterlogged, commuters sought alternative routes while the broken roads in some areas added to their discomfort.“Several stretches of Vishwakarma Marg were waterlogged and there were also some potholes. So, I had to be very attentive while going towards Indirapuram in the morning. On the way, I took shelter near Sector 59 metro station as the underpass was fully waterlogged. Later, I took a longer route to avoid the underpass,”said Vaibhav Maheshwari, who commuted towards Indirapuram on a two-wheeler from Noida’s Sector 75.“The traffic towards Delhi was very slow during the morning hours. I use Noida bypass road from Vishwakarma Marg to reach Delhi. But the connecting route is broken with big potholes which fill up during the rains and become dangerous for driving,” said Sangeeta Mishra, another commuter going to Delhi for work.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city recorded 35mm of rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Wednesday. So far, Noida has been rainfall deficient. According to the IMD, the city has received about 65% deficient rainfall since June 1 till date. It has so far seen 155mm of rainfall against the expected 448.9mm. Meanwhile, officials of the Noida authority said that several workers were rushed to clear the roads.“Since the rainfall was heavy, there were some instances of waterlogging. But all our workers were in the field sorting out the issues. At the Sector 61 underpass towards Mamura, there are pumps installed but we must also understand that there will be some retention time whenever there is a heavy rainfall. The roads where waterlogging happened were later cleared off water, and we are also working on such spots,” said PK Kaushik, general manager, Noida authority.Meanwhile, the weather analysts said that there are chances of light to moderate rains on Thursday too.“Noida may also see rainfall on Thursday. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 31 and 25°C,” said an IMD official.“On Wednesday, the Delhi-NCR received excessive moisture intrusion from both the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. This led to heavy rains. The moisture is still there, so there is a possibility of light to moderate rainfall on Thursday,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet.According to IMD, the rainfall below 1.5mm is considered very light, between 1.5mm and 15mm is light, 15mm and 64mm as moderate, 64mm and 110mm as heavy and above 110mm as very heavy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-rains-leave-several-roads-waterlogged-101630521182591.html

The court was hearing a plea by Vasant Vihar Residents’ Welfare Association seeking the removal of the protesters on the grounds that they were inconveniencing residents.“We are also dealing with Covid-19. Look at the pictures. What if this could be a superspreader of Covid-19? You should ensure some protocol is there. Why are they not wearing masks? You are fining people daily for not wearing masks in cars,” justice Palli said.The bench asked the Delhi government what steps have been taken to comply with the Supreme Court’s direction to frame guidelines on the issue of the right to protest so as to ensure a balance between fundamental rights and the maintenance of law and order.Central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul told the court that it was not a normal situation and residents should have a more “humanitarian approach”.Delhi government additional standing counsel Satyakam said there are around 500 protesters at the site and sufficient force has been deployed there and Centre shall be asked to resolve the issue at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/afghan-protest-outside-unhcr-office-could-become-covid-super-spreader-says-high-court-101630520763821.html
02-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi court takes cognisance of Kailash Gahlot’s defamation plea against BJP’s Vijender Gupta||A Delhi court on Wednesday took cognisance of a criminal defamation complaint filed by Delhi transport minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Kailash Gehlot against fellow legislator Vijender Gupta of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for allegedly making defamatory remarks about him over the procurement of 1,000 low-floor buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey fixed the matter to September 18 for examination of the complaint as part of the pre-summoning evidence.In his complaint, filed through advocate Dhruv Rohatgi, Gehlot has alleged that Gupta “intentionally and for malafide purposes” defamed him and tarnished his reputation to gain political mileage.He said Gupta levelled “defamatory, scandalous, mischievous, false and scurrilous allegations” verbally as well as in writing.Responding to Wednesday’s proceedings in the court, Gupta said, “The Delhi government is filing cases in an attempt to save face amid allegations of corruption. They aren’t replying to the people on the charges. Today’s proceeding in the court was routine and the high court’s (earlier) order should be a lesson to them.”On August 28, the Delhi high court declined to grant ex parte interim relief to Gahlot in his civil defamation plea seeking the removal of alleged defamatory statements and posts shared by Gupta on social media. The court, while issuing summons to Gupta, gave him 30 days to respond to the suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-takes-cognisance-of-kailash-gahlot-s-defamation-plea-against-bjp-s-vijender-gupta-101630520163112.html
02-09-2021||Delhi||Police probe possible collusion of Tihar jail officials, ex-Unitech promoters||The Delhi Police commissioner’s office has written to the city prison department seeking details of all officers posted inside Tihar jail number 7 as it began a probe to identify how former Unitech promoters Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra, in alleged connivance with jail officials, operated a “secret undergound office” in south Delhi while staying in jail. The Chandra brothers were arrested in April 2017 for duping homebuyers in 74 projects. Police have also sought details of the dates and the duration when the two brothers were out on bail or parole and also the reason why they were granted parole/furlough in the last three years.“A notice was sent to director general Sandeep Goel asking him for the details of all persons who were posted in jail number 7 in the last one year. Along with the names and ranks, they were also told to submit the phone numbers of those officers. In the notice, the prison department has also been told to submit the registered phone numbers to which the Chandra brothers were authorised to make phone calls from the prison’s landline. Any other number to which the calls were made is illegal,” said an officer aware of the matter. Officials privy to the inquiry said the prison department has submitted some of the details and requested time to provide all the information sought.Sanjay and Ajay Chandra, who were lodged together in Tihar’s jail number 7, were moved to Mumbai’s Arthur Road and Taloja jails on August 28 on the orders of the Supreme Court, which was informed by the Enforcement Directorate that jail authorities helped the two engage in illegal activities, including running an underground office in south Delhi.According to ED, the office, which was being operated by Unitech founder Ramesh Chandra, was visited by his sons, Sanjay and Ajay, when they were on parole or bail. ED further said that the two brothers were communicating and instructing their staff from inside jail to dispose of their properties.The apex court asked Delhi Police chief Rakesh Asthana to conduct an inquiry into the matter and submit a report within four weeks. HT spoke to senior police officers who confirmed that the inquiry started on Saturday. This is the first time that the police commissioner is personally conducting an inquiry to probe the nexus between prisoners and jail officers.Even as the police are probing how both the Chandra brothers had access to cell phones and communicated freely with their contacts outside the prison, interestingly, records from jail 7 show that the two were never caught for violating any prison rules. HT contacted the Tihar director general for a response, but he declined to comment.Meanwhile, on Saturday, a team of officers from the Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing visited the prison headquarters to take the details of officers posted in jail housing another prisoner, Sukesh Chandrashekhar, who is accused of allegedly duping the wife of Shivinder Singh, the former promoter of Religare Enterprises. Chandrashekhar allegedly cheated her by posing as a senior government officer and promised to secure bail for Singh, who was arrested in October 2019 in a case pertaining to alleged misappropriation of funds.“Sukesh was in jail 1 with former promoters of Unitech until 2018. There are reports that he had helped the two men...This will also be part of the inquiry,” said an EOW officer.Delhi Police arrested Chandrashekar in 2017 for allegedly duping an AIADMK leader of ₹2 crore on the pretext of helping his faction of the party retain the two leaves symbol by bribing Election Commission officials.Meanwhile, the Tihar prison department on Saturday also transferred at least 23 deputy superintendents across Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli complex of Tihar prisons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-begin-probe-into-collusion-of-tihar-jail-officials-with-former-unitech-promoters-101630519263411.html

02-09-2021||Pune||Pune mandals press for permission to allow advertisements near Ganesh mandaps||The “Covid fund crunch” has hit small and medium-sized mandals in the city, ahead of the Ganesh festival to begin on September 10 this year. With public donations, normally sought by house-to-house or shop-to-shop visits by these mandals, out of the question, this year, some may have to skip the public observance of the festival altogether.“Last year, celebrations were done in a simple way. It is the same this year, but funds available with our mandal are over. To do a 10-day celebration with minimum resources, taking all precautionary measures, Rs1 lakh is needed for a medium-sized mandal,” said Piyush Shah, president, Sainath Mitra Mandal on Shivaji road.As a result, Ganpati mandals are now talking about getting the permissions to have advertising in specific zones near the public display of the statue.“Our demand is that police allow us to display advertisements, like we used to have in pre-Covid times. We can charge for the advertisements. It will certainly help us to keep our festival tradition going even in these tough times,” he added. The permission is for advertisements to be displayed on barricades set up around the mandap to control crowd movement.Ganpati mandal president Sachin Alande said, “We have cancelled our celebrations this year as there are not enough funds available. We do not want to put a financial burden on citizens by taking public donations. Every one of us is struggling in these tough situations. Advertising or direct donations from big offices or companies can help the small mandals survive this year.”The Pune police, on Sunday, held a meeting with Ganapti mandals in the city and issued guidelines for the 10-day celebrations for this year. Amitabh Gupta, police commissioner, Pune, said, “We have got a request from Ganpati mandals about advertisements and our discussions are going on.

02-09-2021||Pune||Pune civic body asks pvt hospitals to reserve 10% beds for paediatric Covid-19 cases||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has requested private hospitals to reserve 10% of the total beds available with them for paediatric Covid-19 patients in view of the anticipated third wave. The move comes in the wake of the central and state governments asking to start preparations for the predicted third wave and the possible surge in paediatric patients with respect to the management of both beds and oxygen.Dr Ashish Bharti, chief health officer of the PMC, said, “The central and state governments have asked us to prepare keeping in mind the peak of the second wave and the day when the city had maximum active cases in terms of oxygen- and bed- management. As of now, we have 16,000 beds available for Covid-19 which includes private and government (2,500) hospital beds. As of now, the number of Covid-19 patients in private hospitals has gone down and so, we have instructed them to reserve 50% of the beds for Covid-19 in case the number of cases increases again. We have further instructed them to reserve 10% of the total beds available with them for paediatric patients, keeping in mind the third wave.”“To ensure that we do not face a shortage of oxygen the way we faced during the second wave, we have built oxygen generation plants which we did not have during the second wave due to which we had to rely upon liquid oxygen and cylinders. Now however, we have oxygen generation plants ready with us and we can generate 8,400 litres of oxygen per minute. In the coming week, more generation plants will come up to generate 5,300 litres per minute,” Dr Bharti said.He said that 75 kilo litres of liquid oxygen which is required for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is readily available for now and 30 kilo litres will be ready in the upcoming week. “As per the deficit report given by the state a month ago, we fell short of 28.3 metric tonne of oxygen which we have covered now and the current capacity is more than the requirement,” Dr Bharti added.The anticipated third wave will allegedly affect children the most as they remain a vulnerable, unvaccinated population. To ensure that there is no shortage of beds in future when the number of cases begin increasing, the PMC will soon send an official letter to private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-asks-pvt-hospitals-to-reserve-10-beds-for-paediatric-covid-19-cases-101630512780970.html

The Pune Zilla Parishad has earmarked ₹3.5 crore for the construction of the centre. The Zilla Parishad has prepared a draft for the building of the centre which will be housed at the existing campus of its district hospital.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Zilla Parishad, said, “The draft is ready and we have sanctioned ₹3.5 crore for its construction. The draft is out in the public for feedback and guidance by September 7. The centre is planned holistically, so that we can take care of prevention, treatment, post treatment, as well as to ensure that those with disabilities are able to survive on par with the general population. This would be a first- of-its-kind, state-of-the-art centre and one-stop solution for all kinds of disabilities.” In addition to providing medical treatment, like artificial limbs, the centre will also provide rehabilitation therapies. This will be a first such centre in the state, officials said on Wednesday. The centre would identify persons with disabilities and work towards prevention of disabilities through early detection and intervention, treatment, therapeutic services, facilitation of disability certificates, and surgeries. Funds will be sought through government and charitable institutions and loans from banks and other financial institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-zp-earmarks-rs-3-5-crore-for-disability-rehab-centre-101630511760792.html
02-09-2021||Pune||Pune river pollution: MPCB sends eighth show cause notice to PMC, PCMC||The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) this week sent a show cause notice to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) seeking a report on compliance with the steps taken by it to curb pollution in the rivers under its jurisdiction.The notice stated that the PMC should reply as to why necessary action should not be initiated against it under the Water (P and CP) Act 1974; Air (P and CP) Act 1981; and Hazardous and other waste management and trans-boundary movement (M and TM) Rules 2018. On its part, the PMC said that it will reply to the notice seeking a compliance report.Sanjay Jagtap, regional officer of the MPCB, in its report said, “Given the poor quality of water, we have issued notices to PMC and PCMC this week regarding failure on their part in using the mandated 25% budgetary allocation to curb river pollution. Earlier too, we had filed a case against both civic bodies and had issued guidelines regarding the same.”This is the eighth notice issued to the PMC in the past four years and the second one this year. Previously, green tribunals have slapped a fine of Rs8 crore on the civic body for polluting rivers. Notwithstanding the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT’s) explicit warning, the PMC has continued to operate the garbage processing plant at Sinhagad road and is still engaged in large-scale dumping of garbage on the Mutha riverbed. After locals and environmental activists complained, MPCB officials even visited the spot and sought an explanation from PMC officials in May this year. The MPCB has also been issuing notices to the PMC for dumping debris and releasing sewage into the rivers under its jurisdiction.PMC executive engineer and compliance in-charge, Pramod Unde, said, “Currently, we don’t have maximum sewage treatment to process the sewage flowing into the river. Also, the necessary compliance is being carried out by constructing a sewage treatment plant (STP) which will take time. This is a follow-up notice which the MPCB has sent, seeking compliance from us. We will send a compliance report to the MPCB authorities at the earliest.”As per the 2018 MPCB report, the Mula-Mutha river which flows for 22km through Pune city is Maharashtra’s second-most polluted river after the Mithi river in Mumbai and has been found to contain human and animal excreta three times more than the safe limit. The MPCB study revealed that levels of faecal coliform content (an indication of human and animal excreta); biochemical oxygen demand (oxygen levels for aquatic life to survive); and dissolved oxygen in the Mula-Mutha river are more than the safe limit.In 2019, civic rights’ activist Sarang Yadwadkar filed a petition in the NGT and revealed the 12 dumping spots in the PMC, PCMC and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA). The NGT took cognisance of the same and appointed a five-member committee along with deputing MPCB as the nodal agency, while warning the municipal commissioners of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad against further dumping of debris or any other waste, including construction waste, into the rivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-river-pollution-mpcb-sends-eighth-show-cause-notice-to-pmc-pcmc-101630511640803.html

02-09-2021||World||Biden blasts high court failure to block Texas abortion curb||President Joe Biden on Thursday lambasted the Supreme Court's decision not to block a new Texas law banning most abortions in the state and directed federal agencies to do what they can to “insulate women and providers” from the impact.Hours earlier, in the middle of the night, a deeply divided high court allowed the law to remain in force in the nation's biggest abortion curb since the court legalized the operation nationwide a half-century ago.The court voted 5-4 to deny an emergency appeal from abortion providers and others but also suggested that their order likely wasn't the last word and other challenges can be brought.Biden said his administration will launch a “whole-of-government effort to respond to this decision” and look at “what steps the federal government can take to ensure that women in Texas have access to safe and legal abortions as protected by Roe."He said women should be protected from "the impact of Texas’ bizarre scheme of outsourced enforcement to private parties.”Biden, who has come under pressure from Democrats to expand the size of the Supreme Court, has ordered a review of the court that is due next month.The Texas law, signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant.It is the strictest law against abortion rights in the United States since the high court’s landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 and part of a broader push by Republicans nationwide to impose new restrictions on abortion. At least 12 other states have enacted bans early in pregnancy, but all have been blocked from going into effect.The high court's order declining to halt the Texas law came just before midnight Wednesday. The majority said those bringing the case had not met the high burden required for a stay of the law.“In reaching this conclusion, we stress that we do not purport to resolve definitively any jurisdictional or substantive claim in the applicants’ lawsuit. In particular, this order is not based on any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas’s law, and in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts,” the unsigned order said.Chief Justice John Roberts dissented along with the court's three liberal justices. Each of the four dissenting justices wrote separate statements expressing their disagreement with the majority.Roberts noted that while the majority denied the request for emergency relief “the Court’s order is emphatic in making clear that it cannot be understood as sustaining the constitutionality of the law at issue.”The vote in the case underscores the impact of the death of the liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last year and then-president Donald Trump's replacement of her with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Had Ginsburg remained on the court there would have been five votes to halt the Texas law.Justice Sonia Sotomayor called her conservative colleagues' decision “stunning.” “Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of Justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand,” she wrote.Texas lawmakers wrote the law to evade federal court review by allowing private citizens to bring lawsuits in state court against anyone involved in an abortion, other than the patient. Other abortion laws are enforced by state and local officials, with criminal sanctions possible.In contrast, Texas' law allows private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone involved in facilitating abortions. Among other situations, that would include anyone who drives a woman to a clinic to get an abortion. Under the law, anyone who successfully sues another person would be entitled to at least $10,000.In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan called the law “patently unconstitutional,” saying it allows “private parties to carry out unconstitutional restrictions on the State’s behalf.” And Justice Stephen Breyer said a “woman has a federal constitutional right to obtain an abortion during” the first stage of pregnancy.After a federal appeals court refused to allow a prompt review of the law before it took effect, the measure’s opponents sought Supreme Court review.In a statement early Thursday after the high court's action, Nancy Northup, the head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents abortion providers challenging the law, vowed to “keep fighting this ban until abortion access is restored in Texas.”“We are devastated that the Supreme Court has refused to block a law that blatantly violates Roe v. Wade. Right now, people seeking abortion across Texas are panicking — they have no idea where or when they will be able to get an abortion, if ever. Texas politicians have succeeded for the moment in making a mockery of the rule of law, upending abortion care in Texas, and forcing patients to leave the state — if they have the means — to get constitutionally protected healthcare. This should send chills down the spine of everyone in this country who cares about the constitution," she said.Anti-abortion groups cheered the court's action.“We are celebrating this decision for what it is, baby steps in the right direction toward the obvious conclusion that Roe is fatally flawed and must go," said Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life of America, in a statement.Texas has long had some of the nation’s toughest abortion restrictions, including a sweeping law passed in 2013. The Supreme Court eventually struck down that law, but not before more than half of the state’s 40-plus clinics closed.Even before the Texas case arrived at the high court the justices had planned to tackle the issue of abortion rights in a major case after the court begins hearing arguments again in the fall. That case involves the state of Mississippi, which is asking to be allowed to enforce an abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-blasts-high-court-failure-to-block-texas-abortion-curb-101630601058990.html
02-09-2021||World||Pakistan faces accusations of undercounting Hindus, Christians in latest census||Religious minorities in Pakistan have accused the government of undercounting them in the latest census data published in May, four years after the survey was conducted. The survey for the sixth Population and Housing Census was undertaken under former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and got completed in 2017. The results, however, were delayed after some provinces, including Sindh and Balochistan flagged the issue of undercounting.Pakistan Bureau of Statistics published the data of the sixth Population and Housing Census after approval from a constitutional body that resolves power-sharing disputes between the provincial and federal governments. While Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan caved in under pressure from the Imran Khan government, Sindh continued to raise objections on the census data.According to the 2017 census data, Pakistan’s overall population has grown to 207.68 million, an increase of around 75 million since 1998 when the country recorded 132.3 million people. The census suggests that the Muslim population in Pakistan grew by 96.47% while the population of other religious minorities reported negligible growth and even shrank in some cases.Hindus in Pakistan account for 1.73% of the total population while Christians make up for 1.27% of Pakistani residents. Other minorities like Ahmaddiyas account for less than 0.1% of Pakistan’s population. Karachi Supreme Court attorney Neel Keshav claimed that the Hindu population in Pakistan is likely to be much higher, reported Pakistan Today."The 1998 census data showed a Hindu population of nearly 2 million. Yet the new census showed that it had only risen to 3.5 million in 20 years," the Pakistani daily quoted Keshav as saying.Human rights groups have frequently raised concerns over the condition of religious minorities in Pakistan. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said in a 2019 report that both the Hindu and Christian communities in Sindh and Punjab continued to report cases of forced conversion."Even though Christians have migrated overseas and converted to Islam, our church records make us suspect that Christians may have been undercounted by at least half a million. We're struggling to find accurate data, and somehow the government is not helping. It is not investigating," Pakistan Today quoted Center for Social Justice Director Peter Jacob as saying.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-faces-accusations-of-undercounting-hindus-christians-in-latest-census-101630602766899.html

"They suffered heavy losses."However a spokesman for the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, a grouping of rebels, said it had full control of all passes and entrances and had driven back efforts to take Shotul district at the entrance to the valley."The enemy made multiple attempts to enter Shotul from Jabul-Saraj, and failed each time," he said, referring to a town in the neighbouring Parwan province.The spokesman said NRFA forces had also killed large numbers of Taliban fighters on two fronts since clashes first broke out earlier in the week."It has been proven to the other side that they cannot resolve this issue through war," the spokesman said in reference to the Taliban's losses.Both sides provided varying figures for the other's casualties, without offering evidence. It was not possible to verify the numbers of fighters on either side killed.The Taliban says the Panjshir valley is surrounded on all four sides and a rebel victory is impossible. The rebels say they will refuse to surrender.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-rebels-and-taliban-claim-heavy-casualties-in-fighting-over-valley-101630600036014.html

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of ivermectin for humans to treat infections caused by internal and external parasites and not for Covid-19. The AMA said in a statement that they are alarmed by the reports of exponential increase in prescribing and dispensing of the drug in the past few months.A recent study found that ivermectin dispensing from outpatient retail pharmacies in the United States shot up to 39,000 prescriptions in the week ending January 8, 2021, as against an average of 3,600 prescriptions per week in the pre-pandemic period. The AMA highlighted that calls to poison control centres due to ivermectin ingestion have increased five-fold from their pre-pandemic baseline.“As such, we are calling for an immediate end to the prescribing, dispensing, and use of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 outside of a clinical trial,” the association said, urging physicians and pharmacists to warn patients against its use outside of FDA-guidance.Also Read | ‘Lower mortality...’: Goa govt defends Ivermectin’s efficacy against Covid-19The US drug regulator recently clarified that they haven’t reviewed the data to support the use of ivermectin in Covid-19 patients, though some initial research is underway. Referring to the misinformation around the use of ivermectin in Covid-19 patients, the FDA warned that any drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous.“There’s a lot of misinformation around, and you may have heard that it’s okay to take large doses of ivermectin. That is wrong,” the regulator said, adding that patients can also overdose on the drug which can nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hypotension, allergic reactions, dizziness, seizures, coma and even death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-medical-association-calls-for-immediate-end-to-ivermectin-use-in-covid-treatment-101630597388429.html

Massoud was known as the Lion of Panjshir and led the strongest resistance against the Taliban from his stronghold in the valley until he was assassinated two days before 9/11.His son Ahmad Massoud is currently leading the resistance against Taliban along with former vice president of Afghanistan Amrullah Saleh and former defence minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi in Panjshir valley. Panjshir is separated from Tajikistan by Badakhshan province where Tajiks and Uzbeks are a majority rather than Pashtuns, who form the core of the Taliban.This is the only region which was not captured by the Soviets or the Taliban in the 1980 and 1990s.Rabbani, meanwhile, served as the political head of the Northern Alliance, when it took on the Taliban in the 1990s.Tajik President Emomali Rahmon issued the decree awarding the Order of Ismoili Somoni 1st Class on both the leaders posthumously. According to the president's official website, the award has been given to Massoud and Rabbani "for their assistance and mediation in organising inter-Tajik peace negotiations in 1993-1996". The honour is a recognition of the role the two leaders played in ending the civil war in Tajikistan.The website also said that the decrees have been issued as Tajikistan marks 30 years of its independence on September 9, 2021.The award comes just days after American soldiers left, and fuels speculation that Tajikistan will support the resistance being led by Ahmad Massoud and Saleh.Saleh is a Tajik and fought with Massoud's father as he took on the Taliban. After the US' withdrawal, Saleh said that he will not betray his mentor and vowed to continue fighting Taliban.The Order of Ismoili Somoni is Tajikistan's highest distinction. It is named after Isma'il ibn Ahmad, the ruler of the Samanid dynasty, also known as Ismoili Somoni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tajikistan-honours-lion-of-panjshir-ahmad-shah-massoud-after-two-decades-101630593138174.html

They marched on the tarmac of Kabul airport, the last stronghold of the western forces till August 31, even fired in the air expressing their happiness.But just days later, all that has changed.According to a report in Al Jazeera, the Taliban have said that they "feel betrayed" because Americans disabled military helicopters and planes before their departure from Kabul.The fighters said they expected the Americans to leave helicopters in one piece for their use, according to Al Jazeera report. "We believe it is a national asset and we are the government now and this could have come to great use for us," the report added.Early on Tuesday (August 31), Kabul airport was littered with artifacts of the withdrawal. Inside the terminal were scattered piles of clothes, luggage and documents. Several CH-46 helicopters used by American forces were parked in a hangar. The US military said it disabled 27 Humvees and 73 aircraft before leaving.The Taliban are now left with 48 aircraft, though no information is available on how many of these are operational.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Wednesday that their technical teams are "repairing and cleaning" the airport and advised people to avoid the area for the time being.For now, the Taliban appear to be engaged in getting Afghanistan running again, a task that could prove challenging to fighters who have spent most of their lives waging an insurgency in the countryside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-say-they-feel-betrayed-because-us-disabled-helicopters-planes-report-101630586829214.html

The secretive regime, which has not reported a single case of Covid-19, suggested that the vaccines should be given to severely affected countries, according to the UN agency that manages the supply of Covid-19 vaccines for lower-income countries under the COVAX scheme.North Korea was the first country to impose strict nationwide lockdown and close its borders in January last year to stop the spread of coronavirus from neighbouring China where the virus first emerged. While the isolated country has not officially reported any Covid-19 case to the World Health Organization (WHO), analysts doubt the claim.North Korea's public health ministry "has communicated that the 2.97 million Sinovac doses being offered to DPR Korea by Covax may be relocated to severely affected countries in view of the limited global supply of Covid-19 vaccines and recurrent surge in some countries", AFP quoted a spokesperson for Unicef as saying.Watch | Why watchdog IAEA is alarmed over North Korea restarting reactorThe public health ministry will continue to communicate with the COVAX facility to receive vaccines in the coming months, agencies reported quoting Unicef spokesperson.In July, a South Korea think tank said that Pyongyang had also rejected shipments of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine over safety concerns. Several Western countries had temporarily halted administering AstraZeneca’s vaccine after cases of blood clotting were reported in some people. But most of them resumed their vaccination campaign after the WHO and European medical agency insisted that the benefits outweigh the risk.Institute for National Security Strategy (INSS), affiliated with South Korea’s spy agency, said in its report that Pyongyang was also not keen on Chinese vaccines due to concerns over their efficacy.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-rejects-nearly-3-million-chinese-covid-19-shots-gives-humanitarian-angle-report-101630573980809.html

This is the latest round of spat between the two companies in race to dominate the space internet field.According to documents posted on Twitter by CNBC's space reporter Michael Sheetz, Amazon, founded by Bezos, asked the United States' Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to dismiss SpaceX's latest amendment to its Starlink satellite network. Musk's company responded by calling it "the latest in continuing efforts by Amazon to slow down competition".And then came Musk's salvo. "Filing legal actions against SpaceX is *actually* his full-time job," the SpaceX founder tweeted in response to Sheetz's post.Filing legal actions against SpaceX is *actually* his full-time job pic.twitter.com/XifRICQ62kStarlink is SpaceX's ambitious project, launched by Musk to build an interconnected internet network with thousands of satellites. It is competing with Amazon's Project Kuiper, which is also aiming to dominate the field.Musk explained how the system will work. "Processing is not an issue. Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints, so data can go from say Sydney to London through space, which is ~40% faster speed of light than fiber & shorter path. Also, no need for ground stations everywhere. Arctic will have great bandwidth!" he said in response to another post on Twitter.Musk also said that Starlink's satellites will be launching in next few months with inter-satellite laser links, which would not require local downlink.Other major companies including Google, Apple and Amazon also rely on satellites to transmit data, as do telecom providers, government agencies and universities working on space research, insurance sources said.The number of active satellites has jumped 68% from a year ago and more than 200% from five years ago.There are 8,055 satellites roaming Earth's orbits, 42% of them inactive, according to Seradata, which tracks the statistics. Most operate in the Lower Eart Orbit (LEO), which extends 2,000 kilometres beyond Earth.LEO satellites are much smaller than GEO satellites. Typically the size of a small refrigerator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-full-time-job-is-to-file-lawsuits-against-spacex-elon-musk-101630568277662.html

Deputy head of the Taliban's political office in Qatar, Sher Abbas Sranikzai, has said that the announcement will come in a day or two. This will mark a crucial development in the history of Afghanistan as after the Taliban form the government, countries will decide whether to recognise the Taliban rule or not.Supreme leaderThe Islamist movement's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, is expected to have ultimate power over a governing council, with a president below him, reports said.“Consultations are almost finalized on the new government, and the necessary discussions have also been held about the cabinet. The Islamic government that we will announce will be a ... model for the people. There is no doubt about the presence of the Commander of the Faithful (Akhunzada) in the government. He will be the leader of the government and there should be no question on this,” Anamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban’s cultural commission, told Tolo News.Will there be a ceremony?Taliban official Ahmadullah Muttaqi said on social media that a ceremony was being prepared at the presidential palace in Kabul.Inclusive government?Earlier, the Taliban said that the new government in Afghanistan will not be a totalitarian government and will have representation of all ethnic communities of Afghanistan.Sharia lawThe Taliban have made it clear that the guiding light of the Afghan rule would be Sharia. Sharia is Islam's legal system, derived from the Quran. In Arabic, Sharia literally means "the clear, well-trodden path to water".Panjshir ResistanceThe anti-Taliban force in Afghanistan, led by Amrullah Saleh and Ahmad Massoud, will continue their protest as a negotiation between Panjshir leaders and Taliban leaders has failed. Reports claimed that conflict is going on in the Panjshir province which had remained undefeated during the earlier regime of the Taliban between 1996 and 2001.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sharia-law-supreme-leader-what-we-know-so-far-about-taliban-government-101630566647353.html

"This resistance is based in Panjshir, not for Panjshir and for Panjshir. Today, this valley hosts all the country and is a hope for all the Afghan people who are escaping from oppression, revenge, prejudice, slipping on people's property and your dark thinking," news agency ANI quoted Saleh as saying.The former vice president of Afghanistan also slammed the Taliban leaders who are claiming to form a more moderate government this time in comparison to their previous regime. "If the nation trusts you a bit, then why are people lining up on the borders of the country," said Saleh, adding, "Have you asked yourself why? Dominating the structure in the last years has not meant stability, and your modern dominance over the soil does not mean stability.""Stability and sustainability is a consistent system with components that your group is far from," he also said, as per the ANI report.Saleh, along with Ahmad Massoud, the son of famous Afghan commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, another leader of the resistance, are presently in Panjshir valley and trying to mount a challenge to the Taliban. Panjshir is the only province left that is not in control of the Taliban group.He further lashed out at the Taliban for their history of violence and forced military takeover of the country following the withdrawal of US forces. "The collapse of the economy and absence of service machines will soon destroy people and your weapons and harsh methods will not be effective against the uprising and anger of people. Only time is between, not if and unless," Saleh told the terrorist group.He further urged the international leaders to focus on the Taliban's action and not their words. "It is enough to pay attention to the interview and performance of your appointed first ranks so that you know that the Afghan administration is not possible today with a bunch of obsessed illiterates," he said.Last month, the Taliban captured Kabul after mounting a swift offensive in a matter of few weeks. So far, the Taliban have controlled all the regions apart from the Panjshir province.The US completed its troop withdrawal on Monday, after 20 years of anti-terrorist operations in the country. In the fallout of troop withdrawal, the Taliban has taken control of the city and is set to announce a new Afghan government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/your-dominance-over-afghan-soil-doesn-t-mean-stability-resistance-leader-sale-101630565251524.html

There was a plane that was burned all the way. You could see its cockpit, while the rest of the plane resembled the skeleton of a fish,” Lt. Colonel Coleman remarked.Also Read | 'Will continue fighting,' says resistance force in Afghanistan's Panjshir as negotiation talks with Taliban failMeanwhile, Captain Kirby Wedan, who piloted the plane that led the formation of the final five aircraft out of Afghanistan, said that the situation was “definitely very tense.” The Air Force officer said, “We were definitely on the edge watching everything going on to make sure that we were ready. What added to our stress what that the planes were parked in such an area of the airport which had been attacked and breached in the past.”Also Read | China trying to 'take over' Bagram airbase in Afghanistan, says ex-diplomat Nikki HaleyCaptain Wedan further revealed that during the night, a group of civilians entered the airfield and tried to board the aircraft but were stopped by US Army troops securing the planes.Also Read | Pakistani terrorists coming to Afghanistan: Ghani informed Biden on July 23General Jacqueline Van Ovost, the commander of the Air Mobility Command who was watching the final departure from Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, said she could hear instructions being issued by Lt.

Proud of a you all.” Major General Donahue was the in-charge of security for the evacuation mission.The group’s departure from Afghanistan meant that American forces were no longer present in the country after landing here following the 9/11 attacks. Their withdrawal was earlier scheduled to end by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the attacks, but was preponed to August 31.

"I am declaring a state of emergency to help New Yorkers affected by tonight's storm," New York Governor Kathy Hochul tweeted, after Ida, which slammed into the southern United States as a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday, caused tornadoes and flooding as it steamed north.This emergency was declared hours after the weather department had issued a 'flash flood emergency for New York City. It was the first time that such a warning was issued for the city.Nearly all New York City subway lines were suspended as water stormed inside the tunnels. According to local media reports, Central Park saw more than 3 inches of rain in one hour. Flight operations were also disrupted in the city.At least five flash-flood emergencies were issued Wednesday evening by the National Weather Service, stretching from just west of Philadelphia through northern New Jersey.Many people also took to social media to share photos and videos of the rainwater gushing over inside subway platforms and flooded streets.Video from 145th st on 1 line.

02-09-2021||World||Canada: Trudeau announces $61.80bn in new spending to woo voters||Struggling to arrest a slide in support ahead of the September 20 general elections, the ruling Liberal Party of Canada released an expansive election manifesto on Wednesday that includes 78 billion Canadian dollars ($61.80 billion) in new spending to be funded from higher taxes on banks and insurance companies and individuals in higher income brackets.However, the 86-page manifesto has no mention of India while it does talk of measures to “respond to illegal and unacceptable behaviour by authoritarian states, including China, Russia, and Iran”.Much of the manifesto recaps the achievement of the government of outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over the past six years, including various benefits announced to counter the economic challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.In an introduction to the manifesto, Trudeau said, “This is our moment to decide where our country goes from here. This is our time to choose. And this platform is our path ahead for generations to come.” It was released at an event in Toronto, with Trudeau adding that this was “the plan that Canada needs to be even more ambitious, to draw all that we’ve learned in fighting this crisis of Covid, to apply it to the crisis of climate change, of housing, of health care, of child care”.It addresses the current crisis in Afghanistan, promising to increase the number of refugees to be accepted from that country from 20,000 to 40,000. However, it does not mention the logistics of that plan. It added that a Liberal Party government will “continue to help support Afghan citizens through humanitarian assistance and to work with our allies to protect democratic and human rights, including for women, girls, and minorities”. The new plan has many giveaways and is meant to be funded through revenue generated via new sources such as raising corporate income taxes “on the largest, most profitable banks and insurance companies who earn more than 1 billion Canadian dollars per year” and creating a “minimum tax rule so that everyone who earns enough to qualify for the top bracket pays at least 15% every year”.The manifesto was launched as the ruling party continues to trail the principal opposition Conservatives in voter preference across a range of fresh surveys. In fact, according to the poll tracker 338 Canada, the Conservatives led by Erin O’Toole are now in a position to garner the highest number of seats, at 143, with the Liberals at 132. That agency, along with others, places the Conservatives at least 2% ahead in national vote share.A warning for Trudeau was sounded by pollster Darrell Bricker, CEO, Ipsos Public Affairs, as he tweeted, “An election that was supposed to be an opportunity for Trudeau and the LPC to score a quick majority has turned now into a fight for survival.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-trudeau-announces-61-80bn-in-new-spending-to-woo-voters-101630560491737.html

"All top Taliban leaders were born and brought up in Pakistan. This has been our 'service' that we trained them and many more might be studying," Sheikh Rashid said in an interview on Hum News programme called 'Breaking Point with Malick'.At the same time, he countered the international criticism of Pakistan aiding the Taliban and said, "Mullah Baradar was in Pakistan jail. America asked us to release him.""We want peace on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Peace suits both Pakistan and Afghanistan border," Sheikh Rashid said.Pakistani terrorists coming to Afghanistan: Ghani informed Biden on July 23This comes at a time when Pakistan is officially throwing its weight behind Afghanistan and is also refuting allegations that Pakistan had a hand in the fall of Afghanistan. Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Wednesday said the world must not abandon Afghanistan as that would have dangerous consequences. "Such a move would have dangerous consequences and no one would be spared,” the foreign minister said.This is not the first time that Pakistan leaders admitted the country's link with the Taliban. Neelam Irshad Sheikh earlier said that the Taliban will help Pakistan in Kashmir.Pakistan's aid to the Taliban remains an open secret as Pakistan attempts hard to distance itself from the Taliban. Reports have revealed that in the last phone call between US President Joe Biden and then Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on July 23, Ghani informed Biden that Afghanistan was under full-scale invasion and the Taliban were not alone. There was full support of Pakistan and several international terrorists, mostly from Pakistan, had already infiltrated Afghanistan at that time.Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Asad Majeed Khan, has recently countered the allegation that Pakistan had a crucial role behind the rise of the Taliban in his scathing letter where he said that the fall of Kabul was because of the corrupt army and not Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-minister-says-top-taliban-leaders-born-and-trained-in-pak-101630559079232.html

An FAA spokesman told Reuters the vehicle "deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America. The FAA investigation is ongoing."Virgin Galactic acknowledged in a statement to Reuters that "the flight’s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan" but added it "did not fly outside of the lateral confines of the protected airspace."The company said "the flight did drop below the altitude of the airspace ... "for a short distance and time (1 minute and 41 seconds) before re-entering restricted airspace."It added that "at no time did the ship travel above any population centers or cause a hazard to the public." The company said it is "working in partnership with the FAA to address the airspace for future flights."Virgin Galactic said that "when the vehicle encountered high altitude winds which changed the trajectory, the pilots and systems monitored the trajectory to ensure it remained within mission parameters."The New Yorker reported that during the flight a red light flashed on the ship's console, indicating an "entry glide-cone warning." Virgin Galactic said that "at no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory."Branson, one of six Virgin Galactic employees who took part in the flight, soaring more than 50 miles above the New Mexico desert, in July touted the mission as a precursor to a new era of space tourism and said the company he founded in 2004 was poised to begin commercial operations next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-probes-off-course-descent-of-richard-branson-s-virgin-galactic-spaceflight-101630547066817.html

She was charged with two misdemeanor counts of violating Hawaii's emergency rules to control the spread of Covid-19. She had been in custody on $2,000 bail until a judge released her at a hearing Wednesday and scheduled another hearing in three weeks.State Public Defender James Tabe, whose office represented her at hearings this week, declined to comment on her case, noting it's not clear if she'll hire her own attorney or apply to have a public defender represent her.The voicemail at a number listed for her in court documents was full Wednesday. She didn't immediately respond to a text message from The Associated Press.In addition to the suspicious card, authorities determined that the travel information she provided listed she would be staying at a Waikiki Holiday Inn but didn't include a reservation number and return flight information, court documents said.An assistant manager at the hotel confirmed to Lau she didn't have a reservation. Lau said in the court document that he tried to call the number she listed but her voicemail was full. He said he emailed her and didn't get a response.Lau said he searched for her on Facebook and found a photo showing a “distinctive tattoo on her left hip area.”The tattoo helped authorities find her at a Southwest Airlines counter when she was trying to leave Honolulu on Aug. 28, the court document said. She showed her ID and vaccination card to Lau, who informed her she was being arrested for falsifying vaccination documents.Other visitors to Hawaii have been arrested for fake vaccination cards, including a father and son from California, who appeared in court via Zoom Wednesday and waived their rights to a jury trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-to-maderna-tourist-arrested-in-hawaii-after-spelling-error-on-covid-19-vaccine-card-101630546034156.html

Thursday marks the 138th birthday of the scientist.In the doodle, the inventor is illustrated with a test tube in his gloved hands. The illustration also had lice on the wall, and a human body at the extreme left corner, while the tech giant's name is illustrated with a microscope, beakers on bunsen burners, and test tubes in holders all placed on a lab table.Typhus spreads through lice in the body and has been responsible for millions of deaths throughout history.Weigl was born in 1883 in Moravia's Prerau, modern-day Czech Republic, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was a native German speaker but was raised in Poland where he adopted the Polish language and culture.In 1907, Weigl graduated with a degree in biological sciences from Poland's Lwow University. He then went on to earn doctoral degrees in zoology, comparative anatomy and histology -- the study of the microscopic anatomy of biological tissues.During the spread of Typhus across Europe, Weigl carried out innovative research in which he grew infected lice in his lab and harvested their stomachs to be mashed into a vaccine. At the time of research, Weigl himself got infected with the disease but recovered.In 1936, Weigl's vaccine was successfully administered to its first beneficiary.For his landmark work, Weigl was nominated twice for the Nobel Prize. He died in 1957 at the age of 74.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-doodle-honours-polish-biologist-rudolf-weigl-who-invented-typhus-vaccine-101630545601520.html

You are going to see more lone wolf situations,” she added.“We need to make sure we are protected. We need to make sure our cybersecurity is strong because actors like Russia are going to continue to hack us because we show no signs of willingness to fight back. We need to watch China because I think you are going to see China make a move for Bagram Air Force Base,” Haley apprehended.“I think they are also making a move in Afghanistan and trying to use Pakistan to get stronger to go against India. So, we have got a lot of issues. The biggest thing he should do is strengthen our allies, strengthen those relationships, modernise our military, and make sure we are prepared for the cyber-crimes and the terrorist crimes that are headed our way,” she said in response to a question.Haley slammed Biden for his disastrous withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. “By the end of that speech that President Biden gave, it was the beginning of the lame-duck presidency for Joe Biden,” she said.“I mean, he has lost the trust and confidence of every member of the military and the military families that I'm proud to be a part of. He has lost the trust and confidence of our allies who are now negotiating without us because they don't know why we are doing what we're doing,” she said.Biden, she alleged, has lost the trust and confidence of the American people. “If you look at the fact that the jihadists are celebrating in the streets because America has run out of town – and they left them with billions of dollars worth of equipment and ammunition as a housewarming present,” she said.“You couldn't ask for a more embarrassing, humiliating situation than what we have right now. The world is more definitely a dangerous place. Just because we are out of Afghanistan does not mean this war is over,” Haley said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trying-to-take-over-bagram-airbase-in-afghanistan-says-ex-diplomat-nikki-haley-101630545009392.html
02-09-2021||World||Biden always said Afghan leaders needed to lead: White House on US President's last phone call to Ghani||Talking about the last phone call between Joe Biden and Ashraf Ghani, accessed by news agency Reuters, the White House said that it won't get into private diplomatic conversations or leaked transcripts of phone calls but what has been reported as Biden's last advice to Ashraf Ghani remained Biden's public advice for Afghanistan leaders, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said."What the President conveyed publicly, and certainly privately as well, repeatedly, to Afghan leaders — as did our national security officials — is that it’s important that the leaders in Afghanistan do exactly that: lead and show the country that they are ready to continue to — the fight against the Taliban; that they have the will for the Afghan National Security Forces to continue that fight even as our US forces leave," the press secretary said.Reuters reported that the last phone call between Biden and Ashraf Ghani was on July 23-- just 23 days before the fall of Kabul in which none of the leaders appeared to have any inkling about the imminent takeover of the country by the Taliban. In that call, Biden promised Ghani close air support and advised him to mobilise Afghan leaders to change the perception of the world that the Taliban were winning.To this advice, Ashraf Ghani informed Biden that the country was facing a full-scale invasion and the Taliban were not alone as over 10 to 15,000 Pakistani terrorists were already inside the country at that time.The White House said that Biden has been consistently conveying this to the Afghan leadership that they were required to lead. "The President has consistently conveyed — and I just noted an example — publicly that the Afghan leadership, at the time, needed to do exactly that: lead. They needed to come together in a cohesive manner. They needed to be united. They need to just show the country and the Afghan people they were going to fight and they are going to lead through this transition, even as US forces left. That is entirely consistent with what he has said publicly throughout," the press secretary said.Confirming that it's true that the fall of Kabul was not anticipated, Psaki said, "what I can reiterate for you is that we have stated many times that no one anticipated — the vast majority, I should say — there may have been individuals and agencies, so I don’t want to eliminate that option — but our national security team and no one in Congress or, I would say, most people out in the public anticipated that the Taliban would be able to take over the country as quickly as they did or that the Afghan National Security Forces would fold as quickly as they did."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-always-said-afghan-leaders-needed-to-lead-white-house-on-us-president-s-last-phone-call-to-ghani-101630544541443.html

Panjshir is the only province, where the anti-Taliban forces have maintained a stronghold and which is out of the Taliban's reach following their blitz across Afghanistan.On Wednesday, the Taliban, who have negotiated with the leaders of the resistance force, said that the talks the group’s efforts to find a political solution to a dispute "went in vain" and led to no results.In an audio message on Wednesday, Amir Khan Motaqi, the head of Taliban’s commission for guidance & encouragement, also urged Panjshir residents to join the Islamic Emirate and promised that it will be a home for all Afghans. "We still want to prevent war and find a political solution," Motaqi said in the message posted on social media.The Panjshir valley lies in the Hindu Kush mountains, approximately 90 miles north of the capital city of Kabul, which fall into Taliban control on August 15 after the collapse of the Afghan government. The Taliban have been unable to take this major holdout of resistance after steamrolling across pro-government troops in a matter of months.The resistance in Panjshir is being led by Ahmad Massoud, son of famous Afghan commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, and Amrullah Saleh who is a current acting president of the South Asian nation. Presently they are all in Panjshir valley and trying to mount a challenge to the Taliban.Meanwhile, the last remaining troops of the United States have left the country, ending the two-decades-old war in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-continue-fighting-says-resistance-force-in-afghanistan-s-panjshir-as-negotiation-talks-with-taliban-fail-101630544952451.html

In the administrative vacuum that has since followed the retreat of the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani regime, the Taliban rulers are struggling the keep the country afloat with their newfound administrative duties at the end of 20 long years of military activity and chaotic warfare.Also Read | US in no hurry to recognise Taliban, says 'don't think they are good actors'The Taliban are finding it difficult to keep hospitals and government machinery running, news agencies reported. Prices have soared amid the tumultuous state of economic affairs, and the financial system is in shambles after 40 years of war while liquidity and inflation continue to rise. Foreign aid and currency reserves now seem largely out of reach for Afghanistan, as many in power in the international monetary community take to a policy of alienating the Taliban. The new rulers of the country, too, have provided little detail so far on how they will acquire funds to get the financial system fully functional.Under the Taliban's previous rule between 1996 and 2001, Afghanistan had little functioning banking sector and although a handful of commercial banks retained licences, none were operational and few loans were made. This time, too, their immediate concern is staving off economic collapse. However, it seems unlikely that the militants will get quick access to most of the roughly $10 billion in assets held by DAB, much of which is outside of the country.The Taliban have ordered banks to reopen, but strict weekly limits on withdrawals have been imposed. Since 80% of the transactions done by banks are in dollars, it is critical that the Taliban leaders make their relationship with the US, bankers say.Also Read | Top US general in 'pain and anger' over Afghanistan situation after withdrawalWashington, on the other hand, says that it would keep having conversations with the Taliban that serve US interests and look at how it could give aid to Afghanistan without benefiting any government that it forms. The European Union has also said that it will need to engage with the Taliban but won't rush into formally recognising them as the new rulers of Afghanistan anytime soon.The Kabul airport, too, lies currently inoperable, but the Al Jazeera television reported that technical experts from Qatar had arrived at the Taliban's request to discuss resuming operations there.Outside the Afghan capital of Kabul, humanitarian organisations have warned of impending catastrophe as severe drought has hit farmers and forced thousands of rural poor to seek shelter in the cities. But foreign donors are unsure about who to speak to. Taliban officials have, however, said the problems will ease once a new government is in place, and urged other countries to maintain economic relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinking-currency-soaring-prices-how-afghanistan-looks-as-taliban-take-charge-101630542301695.html
02-09-2021||World||US in no hurry to recognise Taliban, says 'don't think they are good actors'||The United States said it is in no rush to recognise the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. Neither do countries that the US has spoken to in the recent past have any such rush, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a press briefing on Wednesday (Washington time). "It will be very dependent on their behaviour and whether they deliver on what the expectations are of the global community," she said.Commenting on whether there is any communication channel between the Taliban and the White House after the pullout of the last army personnel, the press secretary said that some form of communication and coordination will be necessary as the Taliban oversee the majority of Afghanistan.Top US general in 'pain and anger' over Afghanistan situation after withdrawalThe United Nations Security Council passed a resolution in coordination with many countries which makes it clear what the countries want from the Taliban. "These are many of the countries that worked with us to help build a list of 100 countries — more than half the countries in the world — making clear we are united in what we expect from the Taliban," the press secretary said.The evacuation operation which has come to a close was the largest airlift in US history. But the fact that the Taliban allowed safe passage for more than 120,000 people does not make the US think that the Taliban are good actors. "We don't. But we needed to work with them in coordination to get this done," the press secretary said.America's former envoy to the United National Nikki Haley said the US needs to closely watch China as it is making a move to take over the Bargam air force that was controlled by the US for the last 20 years. “The first thing you should do is immediately start connecting with our allies, whether it's Taiwan, whether it's Ukraine, whether it's Israel, whether it's India, Australia, Japan, all of them, and reassure them that we will have their back and that we need them as well,” Haley said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recognition-will-depend-on-us-doesn-t-think-taliban-are-good-actors-101630540406154.html
02-09-2021||World||Top US general in 'pain and anger' over Afghanistan situation after withdrawal||With the United States finally completing its troops withdrawal in Afghanistan, hastily ending its extended two-decade-long military mission in the war-torn country, one of its top generals has now expressed "pain and anger" over the situation which has long plagued the land now overrun by Taliban insurgents. "When we see what has unfolded over the last 20 years and over the last 20 days, that creates pain and anger," said General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Wednesday. "And mine comes from 242 of my soldiers killed in action over 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan."Also Read | US in no hurry to recognise Taliban, says 'don't think they are good actors'Milley added, however, that he was a "professional soldier" and was thus going to contain his pain and anger and continue to execute the mission at hand.Also watch | Top US General on Afghanistan: ‘How we got to this moment will be studied for years’﻿Notably, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which was completed on Tuesday morning, has been dissed as "hasty" and "chaotic" by many of the Biden administration's critics, including former US president Donald Trump, several Republican leaders, and even officials in China and Russia.The rapid takeover of Afghanistan by Taliban came amid the US withdrawal, and many considered it a "tactical mistake" to leave the war-torn nation at the mercy of the militants. “Afghanistan under Biden was not a withdrawal, it was a surrender," Trump had said, adding that leaving people behind for death is an "unforgivable dereliction of duty, which will go down in infamy."Now one of Biden's top military generals has also voiced displeasure with the administration's decision to mark a chaotic and messy exit from Afghanistan's longest war. "I have all the same emotions, and I'm sure the secretary does, and anyone who served," General Milley said. "And I commanded troops. And I wasn't born a four-star general. I have walked the patrols and been blown up and shot at and RPG'd and everything else. My pain and anger come from the same as those grieving families, the same as those soldiers that are on the ground."Also Read | Sinking currency, soaring prices: How Afghanistan looks as Taliban take chargeThe "mess" that the Biden administration had made over the Afghanistan withdrawal was exacerbated, according to critics, by the terror attack on Kabul airport which killed 13 US service members, including 10 members of the Marine Corps, many of who were barely in their twenties.US defence secretary Lloyd J Austin III on Wednesday honoured those who died over the course of the war in Afghanistan. "Our forces risked their own lives to save the lives of others, and 13 of our very best, paid the ultimate price," he said, adding that the administration has managed to evacuate around 6,000 American citizens and a total of more than 124,000 civilians from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-general-in-pain-and-anger-over-afghanistan-situation-after-withdrawal-101630539744439.html
02-09-2021||World||One student killed in shooting at North Carolina high school||One student was killed in a shooting at a North Carolina high school Wednesday and authorities were looking for the suspect, officials said.Winston-Salem police Chief Catrina Thompson, fighting back tears, told a news conference that Mount Tabor High School went into immediate lockdown as emergency responders, sheriff's deputies and police officers arrived just after noon to search for the suspect, who she said was believed to be a student at the school.The injured student was taken to a local hospital, where he died, Thompson said.Forsyth County Sheriff Bobby Kimbrough Jr., who joined deputies and officers at the school on the initial call, identified the dead student as William Chavis Raynard Miller Jr.“I haven't cried in a while, but I've been crying since I left the hospital,” Kimbrough said.Sheriff’s office spokeswoman Christina Howell said all other students were safe and authorities were “actively seeking the suspect.”Police blocked roads to the school, which has an enrollment of more than 1,500 students, and numerous emergency vehicles were on the scene. Parents frantic for information parked their cars on the sidewalks several blocks from the school as police directed traffic away from campus. Students and parents could be seen walking toward a nearby shopping center.Christopher Johnson said his son told him that he heard the gunshots while in the school gym and students were told to hide because there was an active shooter on campus.“You see stuff like this in the media,” said Johnson, whose son was still at the school awaiting transportation to a pickup point. “It’s scary to know that it actually reached out and touched you this time. My son’s not a victim, but he’s part of this and he’ll probably remember this forever.”Later, law enforcement vehicles were seen escorting school buses with Mount Tabor students off the campus to be reunited with their parents.The sheriff's office said other schools in the area were on lockdown as a precaution but no other shootings or injuries had been reported.Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement that he has been briefed by law enforcement and noted this was the second school shooting in the state this week. A 15-year-old was charged after a student was shot and wounded during a fight Monday at a Wilmington high school.“We must work to ensure the safety of students and educators, quickly apprehends the shooter and keep guns off school grounds,” Cooper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-student-killed-in-shooting-at-north-carolina-high-school-101630534430786.html
02-09-2021||World||UN committee to discuss Taliban travel sanctions||The UN 1988 sanctions committee, currently chaired by India and responsible for overseeing sanctions on designated Taliban leaders, is set to meet this month to consider the extension of travel exemptions for top Taliban leaders such as Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.Under UN Security Council resolution 1267, adopted about a month after the 9/11 terror attacks in the US, the Taliban and its leadership were subject to various sanctions, including an assets freeze, a travel ban and an arms embargo, for sheltering al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.In 2019, Baradar, the head of the Taliban’s political office in Doha, Qatar, and 14 members of the group’s negotiating team were granted a travel exemption by the UN in early 2019 to join peace talks with the US as part of efforts to end the war in Afghanistan. Those talks led to the signing of a peace deal between the Taliban and the US in February 2020.The Taliban leaders have used the travel exemption, which has been renewed from time to time, to travel to several other countries, including Russia and Central Asian states. Before the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government on August 15, Afghan officials had been pressing the Indian side to tighten the scope of the travel exemption to ensure it wasn’t misused by the Taliban leaders. The 14 members of the Taliban negotiating team include Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, Shahabuddin Delawar, Mullah Abdul Manan Omari, the brother of Taliban founder Mullah Omar, and Anas Haqqani, the brother of Haqqani Network leader Sirajuddin Haqqani. Both Stanekzai and Anas Haqqani have been involved in an informal outreach towards India and are key Taliban negotiators.Though the travel exemption is set to be renewed by September 20, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that it was too early to say what could transpire at the upcoming meeting of the 1988 sanctions committee.There are currently no indications that other restrictions on designated Taliban leaders would be eased, or that some of them would be delisted, the people said.India’s envoy to the UN, TS Tirumurti, is the chair of the 1988 sanctions committee till December 31, and the two vice-chairs are the envoys from Russia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.With Russia and China working closely with the Taliban leadership since the group assumed power on August 15, the stance taken by other permanent members of the Security Council – the US, the UK and France – will set the stage for 1988 sanctions committee’s approach towards the designated Taliban leaders.However, the UN secretary-general’s special representative for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, had suggested in a special Security Council meeting on August 6 that the travel exemption should be used to pressure Taliban leaders to deliver on commitments to ensure peace.Speaking at a time when the Taliban were still fighting Afghan security forces, Lyons had said: “It should be made clear to the Taliban Political Commission that the exemptions to the travel ban and the high protocol with which they have been received by many of the countries were, in fact, predicated on a commitment and progress in the peace process.” Further extension of the exemption, she added, “must be predicated on real progress on peace”.Brian O’Toole, a former senior US treasury department official, wrote in a recent article for the Atlantic Council that the lack of clarity over the Taliban’s sanctions status by the UN may have “serious ramifications” at a time when the group is seeking international legitimacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indialed-un-sanctions-committee-to-decide-travel-exemptions-for-taliban-leaders-101630516202974.html
02-09-2021||India||HT This Day: September 3, 1970 — Princes lose by bare 9 votes||Lok Sabha adopts Constitution Bill (339 to 154)Uneven performance during passageNew Delhi- In an epoch-making decision, the Lok Sabha today accorded its approval to the Constitution (24th Amendment) Bill for the abolition of privy purses and privileges of former rulers. Amidst acclamation from the treasury benches and a sizable section- of the Opposition, the Speaker, Mr G. S. Dhillon, announced that the Bill had been passed by 339 to 154 votes.As Prime Minister Indira Gandhi wound up the two-day debate and the division bell rang, the atmosphere was surcharged with such excitement as never witnessed before in the history of the Indian Parliament.The touch-and-go nature of close voting was picturesquely evident on the electronic device-the essential two-thirds majority for the passage of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill was ensured by mere nine votes.The Congress (0), the Swatantra Party and the Jan Sangh lost the crucial battle despite some BKD and Independent votes. The few Congress princes who exercised their right of conscience failed to materially affect the position.The Speaker declared that the Bill had obtained the support of the majority of the total membership of the House and a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting, as required by Article 368 of the Constitution.The voting pattern was not uniform at all stages of the Bill's passage. It was 336 to 155 on the first reading and two clauses received 339 to 152 and 336 to 153 votes, respectively. Mrs Gandhi's amendment fixing Oct. 15 as the date on which the legislation would come into force was carried by 338 to 152 votes.Different figuresOn every occasion, the machine showed a different set of figures, Later rectified by the Lok Sabha Secretariat staff. The plea advanced by Mr N. G. Ranga (Swa), Mr A. B. Vajpayee (Jan Sangh) and some Congress (0) members that the voting should be recorded in the lobbies was not accepted by the Speaker.Before proceeding with clause-wise consideration of the Bill, the House rejected by a voice vote amendments seeking to elicit public opinion and refer the measure to a select committee and to the Supreme Court under Article 143 of the Constitution.Besides Mrs Gandhi, the Finance Minister, Mr Y. B. Chavan today put forward the Government point of view, tracing the history of the negotiations with the princes. Both maintained that privy purses were not in the nature of private property and the "covenants" were no contractual agreements but merely political settlements which had to change with the changing times.They assured the princes of their desire to sort out the question of "transitional allowance" even after the Bill had been passed.Fervent appealWhile Mr Chavan described Mr Morarji Desai's speech as most "un-Morarjilike", Mrs Gandhi recalled the Mahabharata when the veteran Bhishma Pitamah was made to give a moral facade to the indefensible cause of the Kauravas.Mr Chavan made a fervent appeal to his former partymen sitting opposite, asking them not to forget that the abolition of privy purses and privileges was the decision of the undivided AICC and was reaffirmed at the Ahmedabad session of the Congress (O).Opposition leader, Dr Ram Subhag Singh, seemed to be prepared to respond, provided Mr Chavan could undo all the "unfair" tactics adopted by the Congress (N) since the split.Mrs Gandhi found a remark immediately rebounding when she said that "politics makes strange bedfellows," while commenting on the words of appreciation for Mr P. Ramamurti (CPM) by the Maharaja of Bikaner, Mr Karni Singh (Ind).In derisive laughter, Mr Piloo Mody (Swa) and some others asked her: "It applies to whom?"Mr Ramamoorti supported the Bill but bitterly attacked the Government, alleging that the "transitional allowance" scheme had been deliberately kept a secret so that the princes might be pressurised to serve the political game of the ruling party.He asked the Prime Minister why she did not invoke the provisions of Article 366 (22) of the Constitution which empowered the President not to recognise any succession. An executive order could have thus abolished the princely order.The Prime Minister agreed with the suggestion but argued the Constitution (Amendment) Bill had been brought forward with a view to obtaining the sanction of the highest legislative body in the country.Total oppositionMr Prakash Vir Shastri (BKD) expressed his total opposition to the Bill, while Mr S.N. Dwivedi (PSP) and Mr S. M. Joshi (SSP) showed great enthusiasm in support of it. But Mr Dwivedi agreed with Mr Ramamoorti that there was something fishy about the Government not disclosing its full plans.Two princes spoke in two voices, both recalling their great heritage. The Tourism and Civil Aviation Minister, Dr Karan Singh, (Jammu and Kashmir) asked his brethren to "seize the move of destiny" instead of "being pushed by the change."Mr Karni Singh of Bikaner, told the House that his father, the late Maharaja Sadhu Singh, was the first to sign the document of accession and his role had been applauded by no less a person than Dr Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India. Ironically, Dr Karni Singh's father, Maharaja Hari Singh, was almost the last to do this, causing the country immeasurable difficulties.He challenged the Government to take an opinion poll in the respective area of the princes before coming to any decision.Recounting a number of major problems, Mr Karni Singh said the abolition of privy purses and privileges was only diversionary tactics of the Government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-september-3-1970-princes-lose-by-bare-9-votes-101630606755798.html

This is along with the one they need to do before boarding the flight.According to previous guidelines, passengers arriving from the United Kingdom, Europe and West Asia were required to get their RT-PCR tests done again upon landing at Indian airports.In a letter to all states and Union Territories, the government said that due to new mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, rising number of ‘variants of concern’ and rising number of ‘variants of interest’ across the planet, these nations were added to the list of countries where travelers will have to get another RT-PCR test done after landing at Indian airports along with the one they undergo before boarding the flight.“The states/UTs must also strengthen their Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) activities being coordinated through the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG) network of laboratories, by sending a fixed percentage of samples of positive cases among international travellers for genome sequencing to the respective INSACOG Genome Sequencing Laboratories tagged with them,” read the letter written by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan.NITI Aayog member (health) VK Paul said INSACOG has the capacity to understand the impact of mutants, be it in terms of disease severity or disease transmissibility. “The screening of international travellers from a genetic sequencing point of view is one of the most critical protocols and pillars,” he added. He further urged the authorities to take measures so that these variants are not imported into the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-strains-govt-makes-rt-pcr-mandatory-on-arrival-from-these-7-more-nations-101630604629388.html
02-09-2021||India||Yediyurappa stepped down on his own, BJP will return to power in 2023: Amit Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday heaped praises on Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and his predecessor BS Yediyurappa and said the latter had stepped down voluntarily to make way for new leadership to take over in the state.“Just recently, Yediyurappa took a decision on his own that a new person and leadership should be given the responsibility of Karnataka. And BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) decided that Basavaraj Bommai should be given the responsibility of being the new chief minister and he is the CM today,” Shah said in Davangere, about 260 km from Bengaluru.The bitter battle between Yediyurappa and the national leadership ended with the 78-year-old stepping down on July 26. Yediyurappa made the announcement while desperately trying to hold back tears that suggested that his decision was enforced and not voluntary.More importantly, Shah said that under the leadership of Bommai, the BJP will be re-elected to power with a full mandate, indicating the possibility that the saffron outfit will head into the 2023 assembly polls with the latter leading the party.The remarks come at a time when there appears to be some discomfort between the national leadership of the party and the 78-year-old former chief minister who, according to multiple people aware of the developments, is alleged to be still in charge of the new government.Yediyurappa, who shared a volatile relationship with the national leadership and his own party members in the state during his two years in power, has taken it upon himself to bring back the party to power in 2023 on its own.The trouble, analysts and others said, is the manner in which the BJP and Yediyurappa are trying to attain this so-called common goal with their distinct approaches, Hindustan Times reported on Thursday.The national leadership of the BJP is trying to attain this goal on the platform of Hindutva while Yediyurappa continues to pursue his caste-based politics which has shaped his over four-decade old career and life.This is Shah’s first visit to Karnataka after Yediyurappa was replaced and a day before three major districts -- Belagavi, Kalaburagi and Hubbali -- head for polls for urban local body elections on Friday.Shah’s visit also comes at a time when there is visible discomfort within the BJP in Karnataka. There is a section of core-BJP legislators who nurse a feeling of neglect for being overlooked with the choice of Bommai, who has been with the BJP only for the last 13 years. There is an even bigger section of legislators who have aired their dissent in public after being overlooked for a ministerial berth in favour of those seen to be loyal to Yediyurappa.Lobbying continues within the BJP to fill up the four remaining spots in Bommai’s cabinet.“Bommai has made some small but significant beginnings. He stopped the tradition of receiving police guard of honour, stopped many VVIP practices and has taken certain steps for transparency. It is a very short time since Bommai took over but people who are sitting in Delhi and closely watching the developments in Karnataka, say that the BJP has strengthened its position by installing him as the Chief Minister,” Shah said, firmly standing behind the party’s choice.The BJP also faces a challenge in the yet-to-be announced Zilla and Taluka panchayat elections which is likely to be a good indicator of the mood of the population before 2023.Shah said that Karnataka had done well in terms of vaccination and has almost inoculated 90% of the state’s eligible population.Shah also lamented the existence of vaccine hesitancy among some communities and appealed to his party workers to spread awareness and extend all possible support to ensure wider vaccination coverage against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappa-stepped-down-on-his-own-bjp-will-return-to-power-under-bommai-amit-shah-101630606033947.html

Singh is also the chairman of a nine-member panel formed recently by the Congress president to expose the government’s failure on the economic and other fronts.He said that the Modi government had been pursuing anti-people policies by selling the assets that the country took 70 years to create “An unworthy son rejoices in auctioning the property that he gets in legacy,” said Singh in an apparent dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Accusing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of indulging in anti-people activities, the Congress leader alleged that RSS leaders were instigating farmers against the government when it was executing the Bhambraja Nagal dam project. “The Modi government resorted to demonetisation with the objective to crackdown on black money. But the status is that around ₹27 lakh crore of currency is in circulation against the ₹17 lakh crore before demonstration,” he added.Singh further alleged that the Central government was hardly bothered about the miseries of common people due to unprecedented price rise. “Today the government is realising more than ₹32 as excise duty on per litre petrol and diesel against ₹9.48 and ₹3.50 during the Congress-led regime,” he said.“The country’s debt has risen to ₹100 lakh crore as of now against ₹54.9 lakh crore in 2014. The working hours for labourers have been increased to 12 hours against the previous arrangement of eight hours, as prescribed by the international norms of working,” said the Congress leader.Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) president Madan Mohan Jha, former state chief Chandan Bagchi, CLP leader Ajit Sharma, MLC Premchandra Mishra and BPCC media department head Rajesh Rathore were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digvijaya-singh-slams-modi-government-for-monetisation-policy-101630604774190.html

While in Colombia during September 4-6, Lekhi will meet the country’s top leadership and hold discussions with the vice president and foreign minister, Marta Lucia Ramirez, on regional and international issues. She will also interact with Indian and Colombian companies and the Indian community in the country. India and Colombia celebrated 60 years of diplomatic relations in 2019. Colombia is an important partner for India in Latin America and bilateral ties have been expanding, particularly in the economic and commercial spheres. Bilateral trade during 2020-21 was worth $2.27 billion, up from $1.85 billion in 2019-20 despite disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Lekhi’s visit to Colombia will provide an opportunity to review progress in bilateral relations and expand an important partnership, the external affairs ministry said on Thursday.

We should wait for the results. We hope it’ll be in the next month or two. They’ve made a broad commitment that they’ll supply a significant amount by year-end,” Dr Paul was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Corbevax, the second jab against the virus being made in the country, is an RBD protein sub-unit vaccine. On Wednesday, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) gave permission to Biological E to conduct phase 2/3 clinical trials of Corbevax on children between five-18 years with certain conditions.The permission to the pharmaceutical company was given on the basis of recommendations of the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on Covid-19.Trials will be conducted in 10 locations across India.Last month, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya met Biological E’s managing director Mahima Dalta regarding the progress of the vaccine’s development and assured of full support from the Centre.In June, the Union health ministry had said Biological E would supply 30 crore doses of Corbevax to India by December. The Centre has paid an advance of ₹1,500 crore to the company for the same.“These vaccine doses will be manufactured and stockpiled by M/s Biological-E from August-December 2021. For this purpose, the Union Ministry of Health would be making an advance payment of ₹1,500 crore to M/s Biological-E,” the ministry said in a statement in June.So far, only Zydus Cadila’s needle-free Covid-19 vaccine “ZyCoV-D” has received emergency use authorisation from the drug regulator to vaccinate children between 12-18 years.

02-09-2021||India||SC reconstitutes panel to assess damage caused by oil well explosion||NEW DELHI: Fifteen months after a massive blowout at Oil India Limited’s Baghjan oil well in Assam resulted in damage to environment and displacement of over 9,000 persons, the Supreme Court on Thursday reconstituted an expert committee to assess the damage caused to the environment and suggest a remedial restoration plan within a month.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) set up 10-member committee headed by Assam chief secretary on February 19 which had members from state and central government departments along with Oil India Limited (OIL) managing director to provide a biodiversity restoration roadmap and an assessment of the damage in six months. The tribunal set up the committee on a petition by activist Bonani Kakker.The Baghjan-5 oil well blow-out on May 27 2020 was followed by an explosion that led to extensive damage and destruction of the nearby wetlands and the biodiversity of Dibru-Saikhowa National Park.Kakker approached the top court for reconstituting the panel to include a panel of independent experts to undertake the damage assessment exercise and recommend immediate steps to be taken.The new committee replacing the 10-member committee will be headed by justice (retd) BP Katakey and comprise independent experts Wetlands International (South Asia) director Ritesh Kumar, Wildlife Institute of India’s Professor Qamar Qureshi, former deputy director at Indian Institute of Petroleum (Dehradun) GS Dang and soil expert Bedanga Bordoloi.The names were finalised after the court received suggestions from Kakker and the environment ministry.The court also directed the committee to report within a month the compensation payable by OIL for causing loss to environment and future work on restoration plan. The Union environment ministry was appointed the nodal ministry for facilitating the working of the committee and OIL was directed to deposit ₹50 lakh for meeting the committee’s expenses. The authorities concerned – state government, OIL, Central Pollution Control Board and state pollution control board – have been directed to extend full cooperation to the Committee. The court directed the matter to be listed immediately within a week after submission of the report.The presence of the OIL representative in the committee was held to be in direct “conflict of interest” by the top court.“The presence of representative of OIL as member of Committee will lead to serious conflict of interest and will not contribute to fairness of committee, a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli said.As regards the Committee being headed by chief secretary, the bench noted, “Considering the onerous responsibility of chief secretary, we are of the view that the chief secretary should not be given this task.” The court felt that the Committee had an adjudicatory role that required domain experts with subject knowledge.OIL represented by additional solicitor general (ASG) Aman Lekhi objected to justice Katakey being on the Committee. In June 2020, the NGT involved justice Katakey to examine the extent of damage resulting from the blowout and identify possible causes behind the incident. The committee headed by justice Katakey gave an interim report on July 24, 2020 that found OIL to be at fault as the requisite permission to establish and carrying out drilling and testing of hydrocarbons in Baghjan-5 oil well expired in 2019. These permissions were held necessary and in conformity with the conditions stipulated in the Environmental Clearance granted on May 11, 2020.The report by justice Katakey said, “On the day of (the) blowout of Well Baghjan-5 on May 27 and explosion on June 9, OIL didn’t have the mandatory consents including the consent to establish or the consent to operate under the Water Act, Air Act and/or the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and Trans-boundary Movement) Rules, 2016.” The justice Katakey panel found that the explosion led to a drastic decline in water oxygen level leading to a high mortality rate of marine life in the Maguri-Motapung wetland and flora and fauna of the nearby Dibru Saikhowa National Park and biosphere reserve which is home to the endangered Gangetic dolphins and a variety of mammals and bird species. The panel told NGT that OIL did not carry out a biodiversity impact assessment before operating the oil well.ASG Lekhi told the court that OIL seriously objected to the conclusions of the said report as not all members of the justice Katakey Committee did a site inspection. The bench responded that OIL will be heard by the five-member committee, but cannot be on the panel.Three lives were lost in the incident which required OIL to arrange relief camps for 9,000 persons at a cost of ₹11.17 crore. In addition, the company paid a one-time compensation of ₹30,000 to the 3,000 affected families besides compensation of ₹20 lakh each to 11 families whose houses were burnt. By a letter of December 2020, OIL has accepted its liability to pay a further amount of ₹68.05 crore to 600 affected families who sustained serious or total damage to their houses. In addition to the now-replaced 10-member Committee, the NGT order of February 2021 formed two other committees. These committees were given the task to fix responsibility for non-compliance with statutory provisions and safety protocols. The Supreme Court stayed the NGT order constituting the 10-member committee on July 1 and was surprised to find that despite holding OIL prima facie responsible for the damage caused to the environment, NGT proceeded to add OIL representative to the committee set up for fixing accountability on this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-reconstitutes-panel-to-assess-damage-caused-by-oil-well-explosion-101630596013612.html

A health update from the state government said the state had been seeing over 30,000 cases for the past few days.As many as 21,634 patients recovered and 188 succumbed to the viral disease in the last 24 hours. With this, the cumulative count of recoveries and deaths climbed to 38,60,248 and 21,149, respectively. On Tuesday, the state saw 32,803 cases, 173 deaths and 21,610 recoveries.The test positivity rate currently stood at 18.41 per cent with 1,74,307 samples tested in the last 24 hours. So far, 3,19,01,842 samples have been tested for the virus in the state, the government release added.Of Thursday’s infection count, Thrissur saw the highest number of cases at 4,334, followed by Ernakulam (3,768), Kozhikode (3,531), Palakkad (2,998), Kollam (2,908), Malappuram (2,664) and Thiruvananthapuram (2,440).The new cases in Kerala include 98 health workers, 102 people from outside the state and the remaining 30,456 people have been infected through contact with the source of the contact not being clear in 1,441 cases.Over 5,68,000 people continue to remain under surveillance across districts. Of these 5,34,805 are in home or institutional quarantine and 33,282 in hospitals.Kerala is currently the worst-hit state from the pandemic in India and is contributing the maximum to the country’s caseload. Amid the high test positivity rate in the state, sources in the Centre said the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government would have to implement strict containment measures and a strategic lockdown to bring down the number of infections.“The Covid-19 test positivity rate is high in Kerala, going over 20 per cent in some districts which is evidence of intense virus circulation. As the state is following home quarantine as the key strategy, wider containment and strategic lockdown needs to be implemented to contain the transmission of the disease, especially in view of festivals,” one of the sources was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.They also said with more than 85 per cent of the infected patients being in home isolation, it was crucial to have strict containment measures, adding, in multiple areas, patients are not adhering to the home isolation guidelines properly, which is leading to the increased spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-sees-over-32-000-covid-cases-for-second-straight-day-188-new-deaths-101630595307180.html

02-09-2021||India||'Introspect': Naseeruddin Shah's message for those celebrating Taliban’s return||Actor Naseeruddin Shah warned Muslims in India to not rejoice the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. He said that the Muslim community should "introspect" before engaging in such actions and should bat for "reform and modernity".“It is scary when a section of Indian Muslims are seen celebrating the return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan. Indian Muslims should decide whether they want reform and modernity or they want to follow medieval belief systems and values,” the veteran actor said in a video message released on Wednesday.“I am Indian Muslim. Indian Islam was always different from the rest of the world. May God not bring a time when it changes so much that we don't even recognise it,” he further added.He also referenced to Mirza Ghalib's poem and said that he had an "informal" relationship with the Almighty.The return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan sparked fears among several nations, women’s rights and free press activists. These sections fear that the Taliban will impose medieval laws, like they did when they were in power between 1996-2001, and will not guarantee basic fundamental human rights.Women’s rights activists and world leaders believe that the Taliban may impose restrictions or outright ban women’s education and stop them from working as professionals in a bid to curb their financial independence.World leaders also fear that the Taliban will be intolerant to minorities and will not follow up on the pledge of being ‘moderate’, which they made when they took over Afghanistan within a matter of weeks in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/introspect-naseeruddin-shah-s-message-for-those-celebrating-taliban-s-return-101630590541572.html
02-09-2021||India||India’s primary concern is use of Afghan soil for terrorism, says MEA||India’s main concern in Afghanistan is the use of Afghan soil for terrorism or anti-India activities and it is too early to talk of issues such as any possible recognition of the Taliban regime, the external affairs ministry said on Thursday. New Delhi’s position was outlined by external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi two days after the first officially acknowledged meeting between the Indian side and the Taliban in Doha. India is also focused on the evacuation of its nationals who are still in Afghanistan, he said. Tuesday’s meeting between India’s envoy to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, and Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, head of the Taliban’s political office in Doha, has given rise to questions on whether New Delhi has softened its position on the Taliban and could be considering the recognition of any new set-up created by the group in Kabul. At a regular news briefing, Bagchi ducked all questions on whether India still perceives the Taliban as a terror group and on recognising any government formed by the group, and said: “Our main concern, one of the primary, immediate concerns is that Afghan soil should not be used for anti-Indian activities or terrorism against India. That is one of our main issues.” India’s focus is not on whether the Taliban is a terror organisation, and “the focus, let me reiterate, is that Afghan soil should not be used for terrorist activities of any kind or [for] anti-India activities and we will try to focus on that element”, Bagchi said. The Indian side has seen reports about formation of a government by the Taliban, but has no details regarding the nature of this dispensation, Bagchi said. He said there was “no update” on any invitation being extended to India to participate in the inauguration of such a government. Setting aside questions about recognising a Taliban government, he said, “Let’s just treat the Doha meeting for what it is – it is just a meeting and I think these are still very early days.” India used the meeting in Doha as an opportunity to convey its concerns, including evacuation of its nationals and terrorism, and “received a positive response” from the Taliban side, he added. In response to a question on why the Taliban hadn’t publicly acknowledged the Doha meeting, which was held at the group’s request, and why there were no photographs of the interaction, Bagchi said: “I think it just didn’t happen, it’s just a meeting, it wasn’t really that kind of an event where photos are taken. I don’t think there’s any thought behind it [that] we don’t have a photo of it. I think neither side took a photo.” Bagchi side-stepped a query on whether India has a roadmap for further engagements with the Taliban by saying: “We wouldn’t have done anything without giving it some thought. Let’s see how things move.” As reported by Hindustan Times, the Indian side had opened channels of communication with specific Taliban factions and leaders, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, last year. However, Tuesday’s meeting in Doha was the first time New Delhi has officially acknowledged an interaction with the Taliban. India has not spelt out its position on the Taliban since the group assumed power in Kabul on August 15, following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. Over the past few days, Stanekzai and senior Taliban leader Anas Haqqani have been engaged in an outreach towards India. Bagchi also said India is prioritising the evacuation of Indian nationals and some Afghans, though this issue is linked to the resumption of operations at Kabul airport. “We will have to revisit this issue when the airport is operational, we will have to wait for that. There is no clarity now,” he said. He declined to give a number for the Indian nationals still in Afghanistan, but said the “vast majority” of citizens who wanted to leave had already returned home. “There are very few Indians left, we are in touch with them,” he said. Asked about the status of Afghan nationals coming to India, he said the emergency e-visas being issued since August 16 were valid for six months. Other Afghans who were already in India had had their visas automatically extended during the pandemic, and internal discussions were ongoing on other “specific issues”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-primary-concern-use-of-afghan-soil-for-terrorism-says-mea-101630590433956.html

The reservation Bill had been introduced by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government in February this year to appease its ally Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), a Vanniyar caste-based party, whose founder 81-year-old S Ramadoss was at the forefront of the agitation in the 1980s.In the late 1970s, Ramadoss forged a coalition of Vanniyar community groups, which later came together under the umbrella of the Vanniyar Sangam (Federation of Vanniyars). It continues to be the parent body of the PMK. In the 1980s, the Sangam carried out protests demanding MBC status for Vanniyars. In 1987, when AIADMK’s MG Ramachandran (MGR) was chief minister, 21 people were killed in police firing during one such agitation. The agitation and ensuing violence had paralysed the entire state for at least a week. MGR, at the time, was hospitalised in the United States. When he returned to Tamil Nadu, he held discussions with the group, but passed away later the same year before the talks could come to fruition.The agitations were quelled when the DMK came back to power in 1989 and then chief minister M Karunanidhi created 20% reservation for MBCs. Vanniyars were among the 108 caste groups that were included in the reservation. But the community said that their representation and access to opportunities were still abysmal. Ahead of the assembly elections in April this year, the PMK revived this decades-old demand and threatened to walk out of the alliance with AIADMK if their reservation demands weren’t met. In December 2020, PMK cadre who were on a state-wide protest for the reservation, pelted stones at a train and brought traffic to a standstill as the Chennai Police sealed borders to restrict them from entering the city. Subsequently, then chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami announced that state-wide caste-based data must be collected, and before the model code of conduct came into effect, passed the 10.5% reservation Bill in jobs and education for Vanniyars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-announces-memorial-for-vanniyar-victims-of-police-shooting-during-1987-agitation-101630589592639.html
02-09-2021||India||Visva Bharati faculty writes to PM Modi, seeks probe against vice chancellor||A group of faculty members of Visva Bharati University in West Bengal have written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a probe against the vice chancellor by a serving or retired judge. The university rusticated three students for three years on August 23 for taking part in a campus protest in January this year. Since then, the university’s vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty has been confined to his on-campus residence by a section of students. The impasse continued till Thursday. “We demand an investigation into the complaints against Chakraborty by an independent committee headed by a serving or retired judge of a high court,” stated the letter sent by the Visva Bharati University Faculty Association which represents a majority of the faculty departments. VB is the state’s only Central University and was set up by Rabindranath Tagore at Santiniketan in Birbhum district in 1921. The Prime Minister is its chancellor. While Chakraborty refused to comment saying that the university’s spokesperson would respond to media queries, the latter didn’t respond to calls or messages. The university authorities had on Wednesday moved the Calcutta high court seeking intervention in clearing the impasse created by the students’ agitation against expulsion of students on disciplinary grounds. The petition is likely to be heard on Friday. The Central University has temporarily suspended the admission process and publication of results, confirming that the VC is “under siege” due to the ongoing agitation by a section of students. “We earnestly request the Honourable Chancellor (read the Prime Minister) to take appropriate action to save this august institution from further degeneration … We sincerely hope that Your Honour will take appropriate action quickly to defuse the crisis,” the letter stated adding that it was leading VB into an existential crisis. PM Modi had virtually addressed the centenary celebrations of the university in December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visva-bharati-faculties-write-to-pm-modi-seek-probe-against-vice-chancellor-101630589412981.html

Police said panchayat and villagers complained that Markam beat up students of classes 7 and 8 in the school on Tuesday.Markam’s suspension order was issued on Wednesday by the district administration.Officials said Markam asked his students to raise their hands if they had observed a fast and performed rituals during the Janmashtami festival. Students who said they observed a fast were thrashed.The teacher was suspended after a preliminary inquiry report was received by the district administration.The suspension order said “hurting religious sentiments and spreading hatred in the society” was counted as a serious misconduct. “Your (Markam) act is against the Chhattisgarh Civil Services (Conduct) Rules 1965.”Kondagaon superintendent of police Siddharth Tiwari said the police were yet to register a case against the teacher. “We have got a report from district administration.

The city will commemorate the slain activist’s life on her death anniversary. Lankesh, a journalist-turned-activist, was shot dead outside her home in Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Bengaluru, on September 5, 2017. The decision to commemorate Gauri Lankesh Day was taken during Burnaby City Council on August 30. The proclamation signed by the city mayor, Mike Hurley, announcing the decision was published on the official website of the city administration subsequently. The proclamation hails Lankesh as a courageous Indian journalist who stood up for truth and justice. “Gauri Lankesh through her work encouraged her readers to adopt scientistic temperament and reject religious fanaticism, caste-based discrimination and bigotry,” read the proclamation on the city website.

Also, the city declared a day dedicated to civil rights activist Jaswant Singh Khalra and Sikh Heritage. A word from Lankesh’s sister, Kavitha Lankesh is awaited.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is expected to hear the plea filed by Kavitha Lankesh, challenging the dropping of charges under the Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act 2000 (KCOCA) against one of the accused in the murder case. A bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar had issued notice to Karnataka on the petition filed by Kavitha, in which she appealed against the state high court’s decision in April to quash charges under KCOCA against Mohan Nayak. KCOCA is a law enacted by Karnataka in India since 2000 to combat organised crime and terrorism. The Act was modelled on the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA). According to police, if the charges of KCOCA are dropped against Nayak, it could set a precedence for charges to be dropped against other accused in the case as well. A senior home department official, in the know of the developments, said that the SIT had approached the government to file an appeal against the Karnataka high court decision, however, the government didn’t act on it. The home minister didn’t respond to HT’s call for a comment regarding this allegation. As per the charge sheet, Nayak is accused of providing accommodation to the killers on the outskirts of Bengaluru. He was arrested on July 19, 2018 after the main suspects in the case, including the shooter and the mastermind, were taken into custody. According to Lankesh’s petition, Nayak was also involved in arranging logistics for the killers both before and after the crime. It stated that the high court erred in setting aside the order of the Bengaluru police commissioner passed in August 2018 invoking KCOCA against Nayak and the subsequent supplementary charge sheet filed by the SIT under the provisions of KCOCA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/canadian-city-to-celebrate-gauri-lankesh-day-on-september-5-101630587492330.html
02-09-2021||India||Congress demands probe into Uttarakhand bridge collapse||Opposition Congress has demanded an independent inquiry into the collapse of a bridge on the Jakhan river along the Dehradun-Rishikesh highway that left five people dead on Friday. Former chief minister Harish Rawat, who visited the collapse site on Sunday, blamed “rampant mining near the bridge” for the collapse while seeking the inquiry.The bridge was built in 1964. On Friday, over 20-metre stretch of the bridge collapsed amid a heavy flow of water in the river due to incessant rain.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is trying to make inroads into the poll-bound state, on Wednesday staged a protest near public works department minister Satpal Maharaj’s office demanding his resignation over the collapse. It blamed the negligence of Maharaj’s ministry and illegal mining for it. On Tuesday, AAP’s chief ministerial candidate Ajay Kothiyal asked the government to allow him to “build an alternative bridge in 48 hours”.AAP’s Uttarakhand chief, SS Kaler, said despite the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy, the government has not learnt any lessons. “The process of rehabilitating all people from disaster-affected areas should have been completed by now. What are they waiting for; more disasters claiming more lives? We will continuously highlight this issue and put pressure on the government to immediately shift such families to safer areas.”Also Read | Uttarakhand’s Rajaji Tiger Reserve opens for safaris with Covid-19 curbs in placeCongress leader Suryakant Dhasmana said it was decided that people living in disaster-prone following the 2013 tragedy will be rehabilitated in safer areas. “There has been a lot of talk on rehabilitation of such people but most of the people in over 300 villages are yet to be rehabilitated. If such people are not rehabilitated, we will keep losing people to cloud bursts and landslides. We have demanded an independent inquiry into the collapse of the bridge.”Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) has warned if the state government does not rehabilitate these people, it will launch an agitation. Kashi Singh Airy, the UKD’s state president, said, “Despite such villages having been identified, the state government has not shifted the people living there.”He said people in disaster-prone areas are dying. “Our first priority should be to save the lives of our people.”Ruling Bhartiya Janata Party leader Devendra Bhasin said Congress, AAP and UKD have been silent for the last five years and have suddenly woken up. “The state government has been making all possible efforts to save lives of people in disaster-affected areas and has so far rehabilitated hundreds of families and the process is on.” He said chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami visited Pithoragarh, spoke to disaster-affected people, and gave each ₹4 lakh cash relief. “He also directed officials to conduct a survey of the affected area by geologists to seek suggestions on measures that can be taken for ensuring the safety of people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-demands-probe-into-uttarakhand-bridge-collapse-101630586712452.html

Chila range located in the Pauri Garhwal district and bordering Haridwar is one of the most sought-after ranges of the park. The main wildlife safari route in Chila will be opened after the monsoon season on November 15, but the other track named Andher Track has been opened for visitors as of now. The 24 km long Andher Track, is now open with Covid-19 preventive measures and guidelines in place. Anil Panyuli, ranger of Chila Range said an authorised gypsy service is now available for tourists who want to embark on a safari on this track. He said the charge for the vehicle for a one-time ride has been fixed at ₹1750 with a maximum of seven people in the vehicle. He added that per person charge of ₹150 along with a vehicle registration fee of Rs100 has also been fixed for visitors. The safari will be operated in two shifts from 6.30 to 9.30 am and 2.30 to 4.00 PM, he said. “It is a good move to open the track for tourists as apart from Asian elephants, there are a wide range of wild animals and flora to see in the area Visitors should also adhere to Covid-19 guidelines and ensure cleanliness within the park,” said local Zila Panchayat member Aarti Gaud. The Rajaji Tiger Reserve is spread across the districts of Pauri Garhwal, Haridwar and Dehradun over a 842 sq km area. It is home to elephants, tigers, a variety of birds, deer, and so on.

Tourists and nature lovers can enjoy the safari in its five zones while night stay facilities remain barred. It will only be permitted from October 15 as usual. The Corbett National Park remains closed every year from June 15 in the wake of the monsoon season. Forest roads get washed away or flooded in the rainy season and pose danger to human life therefore it remains closed till October 15. This year it was closed from May 1 due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Park administration had to return money for around 60,000 bookings of tourists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhands-rajaji-tiger-reserve-opens-for-safaris-with-covid-19-curbs-in-place-101630584972330.html
02-09-2021||India||Mass gatherings should be discouraged ahead of upcoming festive season: Centre||The Centre said on Thursday that mass gatherings should be discouraged amid the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, particularly in the upcoming festive season.“Mass gatherings should clearly be discouraged and full vaccination should be a prerequisite if it is absolutely essential and critical to have a gathering of some people,” Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Dr Balram Bhargava said while addressing the health ministry’s press briefing on the pandemic situation in the country. Dr Bhargava also stressed on the fact that people should keep on wearing masks despite being vaccinated against Covid-19.Echoing his concerns, Niti Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul said people have to be careful in the upcoming festive season, adding despite the vaccination programme accelerating in the country, the precautions against Covid-19 must continue.“The time has not yet come to remove masks. This year too, festivals will be celebrated in the same way as they were celebrated last year. We have to wait more for festivals to be celebrated traditionally.” Dr Paul told reporters and urged people to celebrate festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri, Eid etc within their families.“We will not have mass gatherings, we will not move out unnecessarily and we will shop at markets carefully without overcrowding.” Dr Paul further said.Last week, the Union home ministry extended all the Covid-19 related protocols in the country till September 30, and directed states and Union Territories (UTs) to take proactive containment measures ahead of the upcoming festive season. According to the order issued by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, the MHA told states and UTs to ensure that there are no large gatherings and if required, necessary local restrictions should be imposed in potentially crowded places, where people must adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour.The home ministry’s orders are of utmost importance for states such as Kerala and Maharashtra, which have been seeing an uptick in their daily infections and are contributing the most towards India’s caseload.India has so far recorded 32,857,937 cases due to Covid-19 which include 32,028,825 recoveries, 439,529 deaths and 389,583 active cases.

02-09-2021||India||Bihar segregates cops for law & order, investigation; practical problems remain||Bihar may have finally been able to divide its police force into two separate wings on paper, but the situation is far from ideal on the ground. The 2013 policy, coming into effect eight years later, aims at making policing more efficient with personnel at every police station either involved only in investigation of cases or in handling law & order.The state now claims to have segregated work among its personnel at all its 925 police stations and 250 outposts--all the data is available online with the police headquarters. Announced in 2013, the policy aims to streamline functioning so that investigation, now done by a dedicated team, will stand the scrutiny of the court. “A dedicated team for investigation of cases will mean they will not be saddled with routine law & order duty,” said a senior police officer. The move, which faced hiccups since it was announced (mostly due to lack of personnel), will reduce pendency of cases, and the two wings will improve the security mechanism. “In case of a crime, while one team maintain law & order at the spot, the other begins investigation,” said a senior IPS officer. Also Read | Suspended urban and housing development officer raided in Bihar in graft caseHowever, on the ground, the state severely lacks the necessary strength in the force. This has also forced the home department to tweak the proportion of personnel for either duty. “Initially, 50% of the strength in police station was to be devoted to law & order duty and the remaining 50% to investigation. But due to a lack of required strength, it will now be 75% for investigation and 25% for law & order. This can still change as per requirement,” said an official of home department. Bihar still has just 80,000 policemen per 100,000 population against the required 140,000. The government is recruiting more personnel -- last month alone, 17,000 personnel were recruited. But the process is time-taking, and the requirement might not be fulfilled anytime soon. Once the ongoing drive ends, the strength is likely to be around 100,000.Meanwhile, the lack of strength is already showing. Sonepur police station, for instance, which is at the junction of four districts -- Patna, Vaishali, Saran and Muzaffarpur -- has just three policemen for law & order duty. “As a result, we have to deploy our officers dedicated to investigation for law & order duty also, as it covers a whole lot duties, viz. VIP movement, road blockades, traffic jams, crime, and conduct of exams. Three-four policemen are required just for VIP movement,” said another police officer. In Saran, the Bhagwanbazaar police station registers 90 criminal cases every month on an average, but it has just nine police personnel and this impacts investigation. In Danapur police station of Patna, there were 13 personnel dedicated to investigation, only three for law & order duty. “Though the area does not have much of a law & order problem, the officers dedicated for it will never pitch in for investigation and it does not come under their mandate. These are some of the practical difficulties. Those exclusively for investigation also have to maintain a case diary for production in courts. So we cannot deploy our personnel as per the requirement anymore,” said an officer posted there. Additional director general (law&order) Amit Kumar said all the details regarding posting of policemen for law & order duty and investigation were with the police headquarters and the progress was being monitored. “In every police station, one station house officer (SHO) and two additional SHOs have been deployed -- one each for law & order, and investigation. Eventually, even the superintendent of police and deputy inspector general offices will have separate sections. There are 4,775 sub-inspectors (SIs) for investigation, while 2,254 are for law & order duty in the state. The strength will further go up with the induction of 1,600 newly recruited SIs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-segregates-cops-for-law-order-investigation-practical-problems-remain-101630584432266.html

The current 66:34 (Andhra Pradesh-Telangana) ratio will continue, irrigation department officials from both states confirmed.The meeting began at 11am on Wednesday and lasted for about 10 hours as the officials from the two states discussed water sharing and other related issues.“We were unable to convince the board to get a higher share of water from the Krishna.

All lanes leading to Geelani’s residence in Hyderpora were heavily guarded as he was buried at a local graveyard around 4.30am on Thursday amid tight security. Only Geelani’s close relatives and neighbours were allowed to attend his funeral.Mobile phones and the internet were snapped while businesses and shops were shuttered. Only post-paid mobiles of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited were working. Inspector general (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar announced restrictions late Wednesday night as a preventive measure when the news of Geelani’s death broke.Geelani, the face of separatism in Kashmir for over three decades, died at his home in Srinagar on Wednesday after a prolonged illness. He was 91. Geelani spent around two decades in jail. He was largely confined to his residence because of ill-health since 2010.Also Watch | Geelani death: Pak mourns loss of asset in Kashmir as India ramps up securityThe movements of a delegation of journalists from Delhi, which this journalist was a part of, were restricted for three days as Geelani’s condition worsened.

Paramilitary forces guarded the delegation, and the journalists could not even eat out. “You are part of an official visit,” the security in-charge explained when the journalists told him they have come to the Valley in much more challenging situations.To be sure, this correspondent has visited Srinagar and other parts of Kashmir several times independently and faced no troubles.On Thursday morning, the liaison officer for the delegation did not want to wait any longer. “Let us reach the airport as soon as possible,” he said. The receptionist of the hotel, where the delegation was staying, meanwhile, came running. “Sir, another guest has to reach the airport. Can he join your group? He does not want to travel alone,” he said.Outside, there was an uneasy calm. No one knew how long the restrictions will continue. Barely 200 metres from the hotel, the car carrying the journalists was stopped at the first of several check posts en route to the airport. The journalists showed their tickets to security forces as the delegation was allowed to proceed to the airport.

The ED has issued five summons to him but he has, in turn, sought questioning over video conferencing. On Thursday, when the application came up for hearing before the single judge bench of justice Revati Mohite- Dere, she recused and directed Deshmukh’s counsel to approach the alternate bench to get a hearing scheduled. The ED is investigating the alleged illegal gratification to the tune of ₹4.7 crore which Deshmukh received as the home minister from various restaurant and bar owners through arrested API Sachin Vaze who is in police custody for his role in the Ambani bomb threat case. Also Read | CBI arrests a member of Deshmukh’s legal teamAccording to the ED, the amount received through Vaze was laundered through the Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan trust owned by Deshmukh with the help of his son. The ED’s probe was initiated after the CBI started investigating the corruption charges against Deshmukh made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The CBI, after completing the probe, registered a First Information Report on April 21. After being issued five summons by the ED, Deshmukh even approached the Supreme Court, seeking relief against the ED probe. The case was heard on August 16 but the apex court did not grant him any relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deshmukh-plea-in-hc-seeks-quashing-of-edsummons-101630569911205.html

Ultimately, this country is going to get a bad name. Did you ever attempt to regulate these private channels," the Supreme Court bench said."If you go to YouTube, so much is shown in one minute. You can see so how much fake news there is. Web portals are not governed by anything. There is an attempt to give communal colour to news and that is a problem. Ultimately it brings a bad name to the country," the Chief Justice said. to this, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, "Not only communal but also planted news."The new IT rules have made social media intermediaries more accountable, the top law officer of the Union government informed the apex court.The Centre also informed the Supreme Court that the new IT rules have been challenged in various high courts and urged the top court to list the transfer petitions along with present petitions.

02-09-2021||India||Apple hit with antitrust case in India over in-app payments issues||Apple Inc is facing an antitrust challenge in India for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the apps market by forcing developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system, according to a source and documents seen by Reuters.The allegations are similar to a case Apple faces in the European Union, where regulators last year started an investigation into Apple's imposition of an in-app fee of 30% for distribution of paid digital content and other restrictions.The Indian case was filed by a little-known, non-profit group which argues Apple's fee of up to 30% hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers, while also acting as a barrier to market entry."The existence of the 30% commission means that some app developers will never make it to the market ... This could also result in consumer harm," said the filing, which has been seen by Reuters.Unlike Indian court cases, filings and details of cases reviewed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) are not made public. Apple and the CCI did not respond to a request for comment.In the coming weeks, the CCI will review the case and could order its investigations arm to conduct a wider probe, or dismiss it altogether if it finds no merit in it, said a source familiar with the matter."There are high chances that an investigation can be ordered, also because the EU has been probing this," said the person, who declined to be identified as the case details are not public.The complainant, non-profit "Together We Fight Society" which is based in India's western state of Rajasthan, told Reuters in a statement it filed the case in the interest of protecting Indian consumers and startups.In India, though Apple's iOS powered just about 2% of 520 million smartphones by end-2020 - with the rest using Android - Counterpoint Research says the US firm's smartphone base in the country has more than doubled in the last five years.The Apple case in India comes just as South Korea's parliament this week approved a bill that bans major app store operators like Alphabet Inc's Google and Apple from forcing software developers to use their payment systems."MIDDLEMAN IN TRANSACTIONS"Companies like Apple and Google say their fee covers the security and marketing benefits their app stores provide, but many companies disagree.Last year, after Indian startups publicly voiced concern over a similar in-app payments fee charged by Google, the CCI ordered an investigation into it as part of a broader antitrust probe into the company. That investigation is ongoing.The India antitrust case against Apple also alleges that its restrictions on how developers communicate with users to offer payment solutions are anti-competitive, and also hurt the country's payment processors who offer services at lower charges in the range of 1-5%.Apple has hurt competitors by restricting developers from informing users of alternative purchasing possibilities, thereby harming "app developers' relationship with their customers by inserting itself as middleman in every in-app transaction," the filing added.In recent weeks, Apple has loosened some of the restrictions for developers globally, like allowing them to use communications - such as email - to share information about payment alternatives outside of their iOS app.And on Wednesday, it said it would allow some apps to provide customers an in-app link to bypass Apple's purchase system, though the U.S. firm retained a ban on allowing other forms of payment options inside apps.Gautam Shahi, a competition law partner at Indian law firm Dua Associates, said that even if companies change their behaviour after an antitrust case in filed, the CCI still looks at past conduct."The CCI will look at recent years to see if the law was violated and if consumers and competition were harmed," said Shahi.The CCI has plans to speed up all cases involving big technology firms such as Amazon and Google by deploying additional officers and working to more stringent internal deadlines, Reuters reported in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apple-hit-with-antitrust-case-in-india-over-in-app-payments-issues-101630567066180.html

The global hybrid summit will build a dialogue for India's transition to clean energy, according to the organisers of the event.The ICS has partnered with Invest India for the event. The special focus of the summit will be on 'Powering India's Hydrogen Ecosystem'.Policy makers, regulators, industry leaders, experts and scientists from across the globe are going to be a part of the event. Union ministers Bhupendra Yadav and Jitendra Singh, Niti Aayog member Dr V K Saraswat and Sturle Harald Pedersen, Chairman, Greenstat India, Norway are some of the eminent participants.Reliance Industry Chairman Mukesh Ambani will be a keynote speaker at the summit.At a Virtual Leaders’ Summit on Climate in April this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a new partnership with the US for investments and collaborations to tackle climate change.It was the first major global initiative by US President Joe Biden since he assumed office in January.PM Modi said at the event that India and the US are launching the "climate and clean energy agenda 2030 partnership to help mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies, and enable green collaborations”.The Prime Minister also emphasised the importance of lifestyle change in climate action. "Sustainable lifestyles and a guiding philosophy of 'back to basics' must be an important pillar of our economic strategy for the post-Covid era," he said.While India is the third-largest emitter on a country basis, it is also the second-most populous. As a result, emissions per head are extremely low, ranking 134, according to the Global Carbon Atlas project.A major conference on climate change - COP26 - is due to take place in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12, 2021. COP26 President Alok Sharma said last month that it will be the last chance to ensure global temperature increases don’t exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius - the lower limit of the Paris Agreement.Under the 2015 agreement, world leaders agreed to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Average global temperatures have increased by more than 1.1 degree Celsius since 1980, and this has been cited by experts as the cause of severe heat waves, droughts and storms.A report released by the United Nations climate panel said earlier this month that global warming is dangerously close to spiralling out of control. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also said that the world is already certain to face further climate disruptions for decades, if not centuries, to come.The deadly heatwaves, massive hurricanes and other extreme events of weather will become more severe, the report further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-climate-summit-2021-on-friday-focus-on-clean-energy-transition-101630565656992.html

This comes at a time when the country is combating with Covid pandemic and any outbreak of any disease is triggering fear.In Uttar Pradesh, a mystery fever has killed 41, including 32 children, following which the Indian Council of Medical Research is investigating the mystery disease.The BMC data also revealed that the number of malaria cases too has gone up in August from July, marginally."As the number of dengue cases rises from August to September during monsoon, all precautions must be taken to prevent the breeding of mosquitos. Use of bed nets, window screens, proper clothing is advised to avoid mosquito bite," the civic body said urging people to not depend on self-medication. Immediate treatment has been recommended if there is a history of fever, headache, rashes, muscle and joint pain as dengue leads to complications and risk of death, the civic body said.Maximum dengue cases have been reported from FS, B and the HW ward which spans over areas like Bandra, Khar, Santacruz, Parel etc.Every year, around 5,500 dengue and malaria cases are recorded in Mumbai, the highest being reported between June and August. Last year's lockdown brought down the number of mosquito-borne diseases as construction activities were halted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-mystery-fever-in-up-mumbai-reports-surge-in-dengue-cases-101630562457999.html
02-09-2021||India||Obesity correlated to pollution: Study||It is not just what you eat, what you breathe might also cause obesity. Long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution is strongly co-related to obesity, found a study of over 3,000 schoolchildren from Delhi, Kottayam, and Mysuru. This was a surprise finding by the researchers trying to understand the impact of air pollution on the lung health of children in Delhi.The study found 39.8% of the children in Delhi were obese or overweight as compared to 16.4% in Kottayam and Mysuru (which have better air quality). The researchers found the children, who are obese, or overweight, are at a 79% higher risk of developing asthma across all three cities as compared to their healthy weight counterparts. Obese children in Delhi were at a 38% higher risk of developing asthma than their counterparts in Kottayam and Mysuru.“The burden of asthma is also much higher than anticipated. Usually, we say that the prevalence is between 8 to 12%. Some studies have shown a prevalence of up to 20%. But our study shows a prevalence of nearly 40% among boys,” said Arvind Kumar, founder of Lung Care Foundation, which conducted the study in association with Pulmocare Research and Education.“What this essentially means is that pollution not only leads to a higher burden of asthma, but it also correlated to increased obesity which then leads to asthma. The correlation between air pollution and obesity was a surprise finding for us. The question on BMI (body mass index) was included along with all other demographic parameters, but when we looked at the data, we were shocked. That is when we went back to the medical literature and found that a few recent studies have called pollution an obesogen.”The study did not specifically look at the mechanism by which pollution leads to obesity. Kumar said the toxins in the air either act on the fatty cells making them resistant to insulin or they affect endocrine axis leading to binge eating. “Larger studies are needed to conclusively prove the link.”The study also found a very high incidence of asthma in children in Delhi.The prevalence of asthma confirmed through on-the-spot spirometry tests, which determine the amount of air a person breathes out, was found to be 29.3% in Delhi children as compared to 22.6% in those from Kottayam and Mysuru.This was despite a higher prevalence of predisposing factors such as a history of smoking and asthma in the family. Only 29.8% of the children in Delhi had a history of asthma as compared to 33.7% in Kottayam and Mysuru. In Delhi, 13.9% of the children reported smokers in their families as compared to 18.8% in Kottayam and Mysuru, according to the study.“What this shows is pollution has a higher impact on asthma than known risk factors such as the history of the illness in the family or a smoker in the family. We found that boys were twice as likely to have asthma as girls across the cities. What was worse was most of the children were not aware of their asthma and hardly any of them were on proper treatment. One of the reasons for higher diagnosis in the control cities could be that there were more cases of asthma in the family leading to discussions about the disease and health-seeking behaviour. Conversely, with many allergic symptoms already reported in a high proportion of children in Delhi most people think it is part of life,” said Kumar.Only 12% of the Delhi children, who were found to be asthmatics, had been diagnosed and 3% were under treatment. In comparison, 27% in Kottayam and Mysuru had been diagnosed and 8% were under treatment.“This study has shown that around 85% of adolescent children who were found to have asthma in Delhi, did not know that they had asthma, and less than 3% of them were receiving appropriate treatment. Clearly, we need to create more awareness about asthma among parents and teachers, so that under diagnosis and under treatment of asthma can be significantly overcome,” said Anurag Agarwal, one of the authors of the study paper and director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, in a statement.The researchers reported higher allergic symptoms in Delhi children. This included sneezing in 52.8% of children in Delhi over the last 12 months as compared to 39.3% in the control cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/obesity-correlated-to-pollution-study-101630561090313.html

I believe the party is listening to only a handful of BJP leaders of the state... I will definitely talk to the senior leaders over this apathy towards me and some other senior leaders,” said a former lawmaker, who did not want to be named.The three-day meeting is being held to finalise the BJP’s strategy for the 2023 assembly polls.Also Read | Chhattisgarh begins survey for data for quotas announced in 2019Another BJP leader said the party has made a “big mistake” by excluding them. “By not inviting some of the regional leaders and former lawmakers, the party is creating a divide which will damage the party,” said the second leader, requesting anonymity. He too said he will talk to the central leadership.BJP’s Chhattisgarh in-charge D Purandeswari, Union minister Renuka Singh, and former chief minister Raman Singh are among those attending the conclave.The BJP ruled Chhattisgarh for 15 years before it lost power to Congress in 2018. It is holding such an event for the first time in tribal-dominated Bastar. The BJP won just one of the 12 assembly seats in the region. Eleven of the 12 seats in Bastar are reserved for the tribals, who account for the state’s 32% population. The Congress wrested the lone seat BJP won in the region in a by-poll that was necessitated after lawmaker Bhima Mandavi was killed in a Maoist attack in 2019.Congress leader RP Singh said the BJP has no respect for senior leaders and the state’s people. “...14 MLAs (members of legislative assembly) of the BJP (in Chhattisgarh) are divided into four camps and everyone knows about it. Their infighting is clearly visible. The BJP is unable to handle the infighting...” BJP leader Sacchinand Upasane said every leader is important for his party. “There is a criterion for invitation for the Shivir. Hence, those who met this criterion were called. We work as a unit...the Congress has no right to comment as its faces infighting...” said Upasane, referring to the tussle for the chief ministerial post in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rumblings-in-bjp-over-exclusion-of-leaders-from-chhattisgarh-conclave-101630560490515.html

02-09-2021||India||'Vaccinating kids will take up to 9 months...': Dr Randeep Guleria backs reopening of schools||AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria has backed reopening of schools across the country even as questions remain over how students will be kept safe from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as vaccination drive for those under the age of 18 is yet to be announced. Dr Guleria told India Today that it will take up to nine months to vaccinate all the children and schools cannot be kept closed till then.“Schools cannot be kept shut till the middle of next year,” the senior doctor said, adding that educational institutes should not be opened in Kerala, which is reporting more than 30,000 Covid-19 cases daily. However, in places like Delhi where the positivity rate is low, now is the “best time” to reopen schools, he added.Elaborating his stand, Dr Guleria explained, “I support reopening of schools because physical interaction is important for kids. Also, many of them simply do not have the means to avail education online.”The AIIMS director suggested steps to ensure the safety of children in schools. “All staff members should be vaccinated. Steps should be taken to ensure that no crowding takes place when children are entering the campus or leaving it, as well as during lunchbreak. However, a school should be closed if a cluster of cases is reported from there,” Dr Guleria said.He also backed the resumption of physical classes for students in junior standards, who, he said, are not “that vulnerable to Covid-19.” On a vaccine for children, he said Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech will apply for regulatory approval for the use of its jab, Covaxin, on children in the coming days. The firm, Dr Guleria said, is likely to receive approval this month itself.ZyCoV-D, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, is the only shot to have received Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) for an age group below 18, having been approved for beneficiaries aged 12 and above.Dr Guleria’s stand backing the reopening of schools is, meanwhile, in contrast to those taken by his AIIMS colleague Dr Navneet Wig and Medanta chairperson Dr Naresh Trehan.With the second Covid-19 wave declining, schools, for senior classes, restarted in July and August. Those in other states began reopening from September 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-keep-schools-closed-dr-randeep-guleria-says-vaccinating-kids-will-take-9-months-101630556775535.html

Biotech industry in India is projected to become a $150 billion industry by 2025. Shantha Biotechnics was the first company to receive a loan from the TBD. “The banks did not want to invest in new technology and the interest rates were high. The support we received from TBD helped us in developing a low-cost Hepatitis B vaccine that eventually brought down the cost across the globe,” said Reddy. Professor K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific advisor, in a video message said the TDB will now have to support innovations in the upcoming challenges – climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies, cyberphysical systems and super computers, and government schemes such as poshan mission and jal jeevan mission. Dr VK Saraswat, NITI Aayog member (science), said that the Prime Minister’s emphasis on translational research to take benefits of science to the people had led to a transition in the ecosystem leading to setting up of over 5,000 start-ups, 45 of them led by women. “Currently, there are a few technologies that are changing the world, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, virtual reality. There is no sector that will not be affected by these and TDB has a role to play in taking the technologies over the valley of death when the risk is high and the money needed is also high,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-must-proactively-find-support-innovations-startups-science-minister-101630556890091.html

In a statement issued on Wednesday, the group under the banner of Indian Friends of Afghanistan expressed concern over the Afghan situation and called for peace and stability in the country. It said they “stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Afghanistan in these difficult times as they seek to embark on a new road of hope towards peace, national reconciliation, and national reconstruction.”Also Read | Where do Taliban get their money from? ‘Drugs and mysterious sponsors’: ExpertsThe group urged the government to prevent any political party from using the developments in Afghanistan to communally polarise Indian society for electoral gains. “...any such attempts should be dealt with sternly.” The group said the Taliban should ensure that no terrorist organisation is allowed to find sanctuary in Afghanistan and that every Afghan citizen, irrespective of ethnicity, ideology, or political background, should be respected.“The Taliban should also respect the rights of women and safeguard the developmental projects undertaken by Indian entities in Afghanistan.” The group asked the Taliban to protect Hindus, Sikhs, and other non-Muslim minorities, and facilitate the dignified return of those who were forced to leave their country.The group said that no country in the region should be excluded from nor isolate itself from collaborative efforts to bring peace in Afghanistan and promote national reconciliation and reconstruction. “This requires India, Pakistan, China, Russia, Iran, and other countries to evolve and implement a common strategy, in cooperation with the United Nations, USA, EU and other members of the international community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-union-ministers-welcome-indian-envoy-s-meeting-with-taliban-leader-101630555449843.html
02-09-2021||India||Maharashtra may bring curbs back to avert third Covid wave||Amid the possibility of the third wave of Covid-19 infections, the Maharashtra government is mulling reimposing curbs to contain the spread of the virus. Although the restrictions are unlikely to be rolled out immediately, the state government may think of night curfew or restrictions on gatherings after the Ganesh festival, which starts on September 10.The state government expects a rise in Covid-19 cases between September 15 and the first week of October, which could be the beginning of the third wave, according to state health officials. Opening up of activities two weeks ago and crowding during the festivals are expected to lead to a rise in daily cases, which currently hover around 4,800 a day.Also Read | Maharashtra forms Council for Climate Change to prepare action planMumbai’s guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said restrictions could be reimposed by September-end if cases rose significantly. “According to the task force, cases may increase by September-end and it may necessitate the resumption of restrictions. If people follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour rigorously, there would not be a rise in the number of cases,” he said.On Wednesday, the state reported 4,456 new Covid-19 cases and 183 fresh deaths, taking the case tally to 6,469,332 and the toll to 137,496. Mumbai saw a rise in cases with the addition of 415 infections on Wednesday — its highest daily caseload is highest in 44 days. Around 70% of the state’s Covid-19 caseload comes from five western Maharashtra districts of Pune, Ahmednagar, Satara, Solapur, and Sangli. Of the 44,366 cases during August 22-31, 30,888 or 70% are from these districts.The CM is expected to hold a review meeting with the state-appointed task force of doctors and officials from health and other departments in the next few days to discuss the steps in the wake of the possibility of the rise in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-may-bring-curbs-back-to-avert-third-covid-wave-101630555090460.html

Of 6.196 million hectares of farmlands that we targeted, farmers have been able to grow various crops in 5.763 million hectares due to lack of adequate rainwater. But we are prepared to tackle a possible drought,” Sahoo said in assembly while replying to an adjournment motion.He said a contingency plan including water supply through canals, distribution of seeds and mini-kits for vegetable farming was being put in motion along with execution of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme works to ensure continued means of sustenance.Sahoo said till September 1, the state recorded only 666 mm of rainfall, which is 29 % less than normal. 26 districts in the state barring Khordha, Jagatsinghpur, Koraput and Malkangiri have recorded deficient rainfall of 20% or above. Jajpur was the worst affected with 54% less rainfall. Though paddy crop was affected due to the prolonged dry spell, non-paddy crop might not be affected, he said.However, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and the opposition chief whip Mohan Majhi alleged the state had failed drought-stricken farmers and demanded a special package and official declaration of drought in the state.“The state government cannot shy away from its duties by putting the blame on nature. The government has done nothing to alleviate the plight of the farmers in this time of drought. Lift irrigation points are lying defunct in the state. While the water bodies have dried up, the government has completely failed in irrigating the farm lands,” said Majhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-unveils-contingency-plan-with-drought-like-situation-in-213-of-314-blocks-101630554970049.html

Only Geelani’s close relatives and neighbours were allowed to attend his funeral as the security forces sealed the graveyard.Geelani, the face of separatism in Kashmir for over three decades, died at his home in Srinagar on Wednesday after a prolonged illness. He was 91. Geelani spent around two decades in jail. He was largely confined to his residence because of ill-health since 2010. He was put under house arrest again ahead of the controversial nullification of Jammu and Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status in 2019 and released last year.Even journalists were prevented from covering the funeral and stopped from going to Hyderpora while restrictions were imposed across Kashmir and the internet and mobile phones were snapped. Only post-paid mobiles of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited were working in Kashmir.Security forces were deployed across Kashmir and all the roads leading towards Hyderpora were sealed. Officials said additional troops have been deployed especially in Srinagar’s old city and North Kashmir. Vehicles were stopped at several places and prevented from moving to Srinagar or other major towns.Inspector general (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar announced restrictions across Kashmir late last night as a preventive measure when the news of Geelani’s death broke. Officials said police had been conducting mock drills related to Geelani’s funeral as his condition worsened. Geelani’s supporters wanted to bury him at a graveyard in Srinagar’s old city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/geelani-laid-to-rest-in-srinagar-amid-tight-security-101630553410743.html

02-09-2021||India||As 2nd Covid-19 wave recedes, here’s where test positivity rate stands in states||The devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the country, which was at its peak in April and May, has now receded, paving the way for schools across the country to reopen. Over the last few days, daily Covid-19 infections have been in the range of 30,000-45,000, suggesting that the second Covid-19 wave is largely under control.The fall in fresh coronavirus cases means several states are witnessing low test positivity rate (TPR) as well. However, TPR, which is the ratio of the number of samples testing positive out of total samples tested on a given day, is still high in other states. According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, for the pandemic situation to be considered “under control,” this figure should be less than 3%.Here is the positivity ratio in various states, as reported by Hindustan Times’ sister publication Live Hindustan, citing independent tracker covid19india.org:TPR>3%: Kerala, where 32,803 people tested positive on Wednesday, has the highest TPR of 18.6%, followed by Mizoram (11.3%) and Manipur (9.7%). Sikkim and Meghalaya are next at 9% and 6.2% respectively.TPR 1-3%: Nagaland’s TPR stands at exactly 3% followed by 2.7% in Arunachal Pradesh. Maharashtra is at 2.4%, while Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh are at 2.2% each. Puducherry (2.1%), West Bengal (1.7%), Goa (1.7%), Tripura (1.5%), Odisha (1.1%) and Tamil Nadu (1.1%).TPR<1%: At 0.7% each, Karnataka and Assam have the highest positivity under this category, with Lakshadweep next at 0.5%. Both Telangana and Ladakh have TPR of 0.4%, followed by Jammu & Kashmir (0.3%), Uttarakhand (2%) and Chandigarh (0.2%). Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Punjab and Anadaman & Nicobar are at 0.1% each. Meanwhile, it is at 0% in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand.It is to be noted that 0% TPR does not mean that the number of samples returning a positive result in a state is zero, it only means that very less number of people are testing positive in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-2nd-covid-19-wave-recedes-here-s-where-test-positivity-rate-stands-in-states-101630550724126.html

Given this situation, Congress president Sonia Gandhi will take the final call and she has already held discussions with several senior leaders on this issue, sources said to news agency PTI.It has been learnt that G-23, the group of 23 leaders who had written to Sonia Gandhi last year seeking a complete overhaul of the party, has raised objections to Prashant Kishor's joining the party. Reports said they recently met at Kapil Sibal's residence and discussed Prashant Kishor's possible induction into the party.Some Congress leaders are, however, in favour of including the poll strategist who has a stellar track record, the latest being the West Bengal and the Tamil Nadu assembly election, where the parties for which his company campaigned came to power.Whether there will be a separate campaign committee headed by Prashant Kishor or whether he will function under the present system is the bone of contention.Reports said Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi have no problem in working with Kishor as they have worked together in the past in the 2017 UP election when the Congress was in alliance with the Samajwadi Party. The alliance did not work out and that is why a section of Congress insiders consider Prashant Kishor's success as case-specific.After campaigning for the Trinamool and the DMK, Prashant Kishor announced that he doesn't want to continue with the work that he has been doing and since then speculation of his big political plunge has been doing the rounds. Prashant Kishor was part of the JD(U) in the past and has recently quit as Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh's adviser.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-to-take-final-call-on-prashant-kishor-party-leaders-divided-101630546452322.html

He was 91 years old. "Troops are being deployed at sensitive places in Srinagar and other major towns and no vehicular movement is being allowed," a police official said.Geelani was the most senior separatist leader in Kashmir. His family said the elderly politician had been ailing for years and had been under house arrest for the last 12 years after leading several anti-India protests.Watch: Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani dies, PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti sends condolencesA family member told Reuters Geelani developed chest pain and chest congestion on Wednesday afternoon and died late at night at his residence in the region's main city of Srinagar.Police chief Vijay Kumar told Reuters the internet was shut down as down as a precautionary measure and restrictions imposed in the Kashmir valley.The roads leading to Geelani's residence in Srinagar were sealed, another official said.Last year, Geelani quit his hard line Hurriyat Conference faction, saying that it had failed to counter New Delhi's efforts to tighten its grip over Kashmir.Hurriyat Conference was formed by various separatist groups in Kashmir in 1993.Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed grief over Geelani's passing on Twitter and said the nation would observe a day of mourning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-separatist-leader-syed-ali-shah-geelani-dies-troops-deployed-in-srinagar-101630533585417.html
02-09-2021||India||Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani dead at 91||Syed Ali Shah Geelani, an avowedly pro-Pakistan Kashmiri secessionist leader, who passed away at his Hyderpora residence in Srinagar on Wednesday night, was the undisputed leader of separatism in Kashmir and the only one who would publicly raise the cry of Azadi-barai-Islam (Freedom for the sake of Islam).The senior-most separatist leaders held a huge sway over a large number of Valley youth.He left behind his wife and six children and a separatist organisation which had become largely mute after the abrogation of J&K special status on August 5.Watch: Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani dies, PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti sends condolencesKnown for his pro-Pakistan stance, Geelani, wanted the merger of Kashmir with Pakistan and has been seen as the strong voice of Pakistan in the Valley.Among the youth with separatist ideology, he was fondly called “Babb” (grandfather) for his unwavering stand demanding freedom from India.His opponents would call him a hawk and stubborn who was not pragmatic enough to change with the changing situations, even most of the mainstream leaders who are currently in jail blamed him for trouble in Kashmir.During his lifetime, he was a staunch Islamist and for many years, he was seen as the face of Jamaat-e-Islami, a politico-religious organisation now banned by the government in Kashmir and remained as chairman All Party Hurriyat Conference in late 90s. His disliking for some of the politicians saw him forming another faction of the Hurriyat Conference in 2003, which was known as Hurriyat Conference (Geelani), the other faction was seen as a moderate faction led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.He spent around two decades in jails from time to time. From past around 10 years, he wasn’t keeping well and since 2010, the government used to mostly place him under house arrest at his Rawalpora residence, which also houses the office of his faction of Hurriyat Conference. Since August 5, 2019, Geelani was under house arrest and doctors under police protection used to visit him there though he was occasionally shifted to hospital whenever his condition deteriorated.Before his death, the government had already formulated a foolproof security plan and they feared that his death could trigger series of protests in Kashmir, the protests which erupted after the killing of Hizb commander Burhan Wani in 2016. The government was also apprehensive of violence after Hurriyat Conference (G) faction issued a statement from Muzaffarabad asking people to converge at Eidgah martyrs cemetery soon after the death of the leader and funeral should be held on next day.During his lifetime, Geelani openly advocated that the party Jamaat-e-Islami should support militants fighting for Kashmir and treat foreign militants as ‘guest militants’. For the youth who took to gun, Geelani was one of the few leaders whom they see as their inspiration and many local militants once trapped in encounters sensing their death used to sent messages to their families that their last funeral should be led none other than him.Geelani has been author of a number of books and booklets including his three-volume autobiography ‘Wular Kinaray’ that revolved around his personal and political journey.He twice contested elections from Baramulla Lok Sabha seat, but remained unsuccessful as NC candidates always defeated him. After the beginning of militancy in late 80s, he always opposed polls and was the first to announce the boycott calls whenever government used to announce the elections in Kashmir. He even expressed regrets at times when people voted in 2002 and 2008 polls and panchayat elections held in early 2000. Many considered him inflexible who wanted talks with India only, if government of India accepts Kashmir is an international dispute.Geelani had represented Sopore in J&K assembly thrice, last time in 1987 when he was the candidate of Muslim United Front (MUF) and was one of the four candidates who managed to win their seats despite allegation of large scale poll riggings which led the start of militancy in Kashmir two years later. . He twice contested elections from Baramulla Lok Sabha seat, however, remained unsuccessful as NC candidates always defeated him.After the start of militancy in late 80’s, he always opposed polls and was first to announce the boycott calls whenever government used to announce the elections in Kashmir. He even expressed regrets at times when people voted in 2002 and 2008 polls and panchayat elections held in early 2000.However, his critics blamed him for promoting stone pelting and militancy while his relatives joined government ranks as the officers.Though being a staunch Pakistani supporter, but at times he issued statements against Pakistan government; his closeness with the Pakistan earned him a sobriquet “as green lion”. He even asked people to hold funeral prayers for Osama bin Laden.Many people in Kashmir believe that being a veteran politician and tallest separatist leader; he shouldn’t have closed his doors to the delegation of Indian Parliament members who had come to meet him after the killing of Hizb militant Burhan Wani evoked a protest which saw violence and unrest for six months.Infact many saw him as one of the few persons in the J&K leaders who always said no to New Delhi and became biggest hurdle for New Delhi in Kashmir. With Geelani gone, now it remain to be seen who will replace him as there is not a single person in the separatist camp who holds sway on people like Geelani did.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hurriyat-hardliner-syed-ali-shah-geelani-dead-at-91-101630528806087.html
02-09-2021||India||Experts meet Kerala govt as Covid spike continues||Kerala on Wednesday reported 32,803 fresh Covid-19 cases and 173 deaths as medical experts suggested the high infection rate, triggered by Onam festivities, would continue till the second week of September.The experts, mainly epidemiologists, virologists and public health activists, released the statement after a meeting with the state government over the alarming spike in Covid cases across the state.Most of the experts at the meeting also asked the government to vaccinate maximum people to check further damage. After the meeting, the state government came out with a statement claiming that experts expressed satisfaction over the state’s containment strategy and stressed the need to accelerate the ongoing vaccination drive. The government also claimed that many experts agreed that the state Covid data was better than many other states. However, one of the participants, a senior epidemiologist, who did not want to be named, said some experts expressed reservations over the state’s low testing rate, overdependence on antigen tests, hype and overconfidence. Some of the experts who attended the virtual meeting include Dr R R Gangakedkhar, former chief of ICMR, Dr David Peter from Hopkins University, Dr Devi Sreedhar from Edinburg University and Dr Jacob John, former virology head of the Christian Medical College Vellore. The projection report prepared by the pandemic core committee also said the situation would stabilize only after September 10. The government has called another meeting with local body chiefs on Friday to streamline containment measures. The high caseload has invited enough embarrassment to the state as many neighbouring states have put severe restrictions on people travelling from the state. The Union health ministry has also asked Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to increase vaccines in districts bordering Kerala. Meanwhile, Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday said the meeting was another publicity stunt by the left government. “The government is spreading lies. When the Centre rapped it, the state government said it praised it. We have information that many experts criticised it,” said party leader S Suresh. On Wednesday, the test positivity remained high at 18.76 per cent after 174,854 samples were tested. It also reported 173 deaths on Wednesday, taking the total to 20,961. Active caseload also crossed 220k. Two districts reported over 4000 cases, Thrissur 4,424 and Ernakulam 4,324. Statistics show there is a whopping 24 per cent increase in cases after Onam. R factor, which tells how many new cases have been transmitted from an infected person, has gone up from 0.9 per cent to 1.5% after Onam, health ministry statistics show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-meet-kerala-govt-as-covid-spike-continues-101630528698319.html
02-09-2021||India||T’gana reports 21% students on 1st day of school reopening||Telangana on Wednesday reported 21 per cent of total attendance in schools across all districts on the first day of reopening of physical classes, indicating that things are far from normal during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a district-wise report, the total attendance in government schools was a little higher at 27.45% in Telangana. In private (both government-aided and unaided) schools, the total attendance was only 18.35%.The highest percentage of students who turned up for physical classes was reported from the Hanumakonda district at 34.77%, while the same for Hyderabad stood at 22.12%. The lowest attendance of 18.41% was recorded in Nagarkurnool district.In total, out of the state’s 5.2 million schoolchildren, only 1.13 million had attended physical classes on the first day of school reopening. When contacted, officials from the state’s school education department, who did not want to be quoted, said that they are monitoring the situation and refused to comment further.The Telangana government on August 23 announced the reopening of all schools in the state from September 1. However, a high court ruling on 31 August ( based on public interest litigation) put a brake on the government’s plan, stating that while school managements can resume physical classes, they cannot force parents to send their children to school for the same.A bench comprising acting Chief Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and justice Vinod Kumar ruled that students have the option to attend both physical or online classes. The high court’s ruling did not allow the state government to reopen state-run residential, tribal welfare and social welfare schools that have hostels.It also asked the government to submit a report on the preparedness concerning reopening the state-run welfare and residential schools in four weeks. The bench also asked the government to lay down standard operating procedures (SOP) to be followed by all school managements concerning the reopening of the educational institutional institutions in the state.In response to the high court’s ruling on Tuesday, the Telangana School Education department on the same day issued a memo stating that it is now up to school management to have either online or offline classes for children or a combination of both. It added that any undertaking by parents from managements absolving the latter if any child gets infected with Covid-19 would also not have any “legal effect”.When contacted, functionaries from private school managements who did not want to be quoted said that there was a mixed response to the resumption of physical classes. “We had physical classes resuming only for the upper classes, and there was 45% attendance today. So, hopefully, things will be better once parents regain confidence in the coming days,” said an official from the Hyderabad Public School’s management, who requested anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tgana-reports-21-students-on-1st-day-of-school-reopening-101630528697222.html
02-09-2021||India||Karnal SDM who made ‘crack heads of farmers’ remark transferred||CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government on Wednesday transferred Karnal sub-divisional magistrate (SDM-civil) Ayush Sinha, who was recently caught on camera directing police to hit protesting farmers on their head if they breached the security cordon. The 2018-batch IAS officer was transferred out of Karnal and posted as additional secretary of Citizen Resources Information Department (CRID), as per a government order. The CRID has been dealing with some of the flagships programmes of the government, the progress of which is personally monitored by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.Sinha is among 19 IAS officers who were either transferred or given additional charge, the government order read. The transfer order came a day after the state government sought a report from Karnal deputy commissioner on the alleged video that surfaced after police action on protesting farmers at Bastara toll plaza on Saturday. Chief secretary Vijai Vardhan has reportedly asked the deputy commissioner to also take into account Sinha’s version of events while preparing the report. In the video clip, Sinha was heard instructing a group of policemen: “Utha utha ke maarna peeche sabko (hit them hard)…We shall not allow this cordon to be breached. We have enough force available. We haven’t slept for the past two days. But you have come here after taking some sleep…Mere paas ek bhi banda nikal ke nahi aana chahiye. Agar aaye toh sar foota hua hona chahiye uska. Clear hai aapko (No one should break the cordon and reach me. If someone does, make sure he has a broken head. Hope this is clear).”The IAS officer, however, alleged the video was edited and consisted only of selected portions of his overall instructions to the cops.Police had used force on the protesters when farmers allegedly tried to march towards the venue of the BJP meeting, in which the chief minister and other senior BJP leaders from the state were present.While the chief minister admitted that Sinha’s choice of words was wrong, he defended the police action against the protesting farmers. Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala also condemned Sinha’s instructions to the police and assured action against the officer. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmers’ outfits spearheading the stir against the farm laws, had said a murder case should be registered against Sinha and sought his dismissal from service. The Morcha had fixed September 6 as the deadline to meet its demands while threatening to lay siege to the Karnal mini-secretariat.The Congress, meanwhile, called for a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of the high court or a retired judge into the lathicharge incident, in which around 10 farmers were injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnal-sdm-who-made-crack-heads-of-farmers-remark-transferred-101630528687397.html
02-09-2021||India||Visva-Bharati seeks Calcutta high court’s intervention to end students’ protest||Kolkata: Authorities of the West Bengal’s Visva-Bharati University on Wednesday filed a petition before the Calcutta high court seeking intervention in clearing the impasse created by an agitation against expulsion of three students on disciplinary ground, people aware of the development said. The petition is likely to be heard later this week. Visva-Bharati, whose chancellor is the Prime Minister, did not make any official statement. However, lawyers aware of the development said the state’s only central university – which was set up by Rabindranath Tagore at Bolpur in Birbhum district in 1921 – in its petition said that security on campus has been breached by the student agitation that started on August 28. Since then, vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty has been confined to his on-campus residence. Members of the Students Federation of India (SFI), the students’ wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have blocked the gates. The agitators have been sending food items and vegetables for the VC and his family for four days, but he refused to accept these. After Chakraborty lodged a police complaint on August 30, four constables and a sub-inspector were deployed outside his home. On Wednesday, the VC ordered food online. “The VC made a false accusation before some staff members that we are not allowing him to buy food. We have been supplying food thrice a day so that he does not face any inconvenience,” said Rupa Chakraborty, one of the agitating students. Aishe Ghosh, the students’ union president at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) led the agitation on Tuesday. The students’ wing of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) will start a parallel movement on Thursday. The three students, who were suspended in January last year, also took part in agitations against several actions taken by Chakrabarty and visits by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders such as Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta in 2020 and Union home minister Amit Shah before the March-April assembly polls in the state. Demanding Chakrabarty’s removal, Aishe Ghosh said, “He is acting on behalf of the Rashtriya Shayamsevak Sangh (RSS) that wants to establish control over several universities. They tried the same in JNU.” The BJP state leadership on Wednesday reacted to anti-RSS posters put up on the campus. “How can the RSS, which has nothing to do with Visva Bharati, be dragged into this? The VC cannot be harassed in this manner because he expressed his independent opinions,” said Bengal BJP chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya. The central university has temporarily suspended the admission process and publication of results, confirming that the VC is “under siege” due to the ongoing agitation by a section of students. In January last year, there was a protest by students when Swapan Dasgupta was invited by the authorities to speak on the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at a seminar. A month after the incident, Chakrabarty triggered a controversy by saying that those who gather at Delhi’s Rajghat donning white caps on Gandhi Jayanti are “the country’s biggest thieves.” A section of faculty and staff members are also unhappy with the VC as disciplinary action and suspension orders have been passed against many of them over the past two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visvabharati-seeks-calcutta-high-court-s-intervention-to-end-students-protest-101630528686176.html

02-09-2021||India||BJP MLAs from north Bengal skip party meet, leaders ask units to be cautious||Days after two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators from south Bengal returned to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), the saffron camp’s efforts to keep the house in order suffered a jolt on Wednesday when five lawmakers from north Bengal districts skipped an organizational meeting convened in Siliguri town. The meeting was called to discuss a range of issues, including post-poll violence. Among the absentees, Ashok Lahiri, the former chief economic adviser to the Centre and MLA from Balurghat, and Satyendranath Roy, who was elected from Gangarampur, informed the party that they would not be able to attend the meeting. Lahiri was attending a meeting in Delhi, while Roy said his wife, a heart patient, was unwell. “I also mailed a copy of the doctor’s prescription,” Roy told the local media. However, there was no response from the other three MLAs; Gopal Chandra Saha from Old Malda, Joel Murmu from Habibpur and Manoj Oraon from Kumargram. BJP state leaders virtually attended the meeting from Kolkata and state unit president Dilip Ghosh asked the north Bengal units to be cautious, said leaders aware of the development. Leader of the opposition in the assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, claimed in Kolkata that no MLA skipped the meeting. On Monday, Tanmay Ghosh, who won the Bishnupur seat in Bankura district returned to the TMC. Biswajit Das, the lawmaker from Bagdah in North 24 Parganas also followed suit on Tuesday. With these defections, the BJP’s tally in the 294-member Bengal assembly came down from 77 to 72. Mukul Roy, who was a BJP national vice-president, returned to the TMC on June 11 but the legislator from Krishnanagar North has not resigned from the party till now. The BJP has sought his disqualification under the anti-defection law. Roy is still a BJP legislator on paper, just like Ghosh and Das. The BJP outperformed the TMC in north Bengal in all recent polls. In the March-April assembly polls, the BJP bagged 30 of the 54 seats in the eight north Bengal districts although the TMC won 213 of the state’s 294 seats. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP bagged 18 of the state’s 42 seats. In north Bengal, it secured seven of the eight seats. Though the BJP won 30 assembly seats in north Bengal, its total tally came down from 77 to 75 as two MLAs from north Bengal did not take oath and resigned from the assembly to retain their Lok Sabha seats. One of them, Nisith Pramanik, was made Union minister of state for home affairs during the last cabinet reshuffle. Adhikari alleged that the TMC was making desperate efforts to engineer defections. “But Mamata Banerjee will not succeed. I have already sent letters to Ghosh and Das, asking them to explain why they should not be charged under anti-defection law. Rest of our MLAs are united,” said Ghosh. TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh took a potshot at Adhikari. “The BJP inducted leaders from the TMC amid much fanfare before the assembly polls. Now it is realizing the real meaning of the proverb tit for tat,” said Ghosh. In Siliguri, BJP national spokesperson and Darjeeling Lok Sabha member Raju Bista, said, “Our north Bengal MLAs are united. They did not join the BJP to serve vested interests.” Wednesday’s meeting assumed significance as John Barla, a Union minister of state and MP from Alipurduar in north Bengal has raised the demand for a separate state comprising districts in the region. Bista said, “The deprived people of north Bengal want a separate state. This is the people’s demand and in a democratic country people have the constitutional right to raise their voice.” However, when asked if he and the BJP support the demand, Bista did not answer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mlas-from-north-bengal-skip-party-meet-leaders-ask-units-to-be-cautious-101630528625965.html
02-09-2021||India||Kerala HC rejects petition seeking CBI probe in Wayanad tree felling||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into illegal tree felling in Wayanad (north Kerala) observing that there is no need to intervene in the ongoing investigation. The court, however, directed the special investigation team (SIT) to probe all angles of the case and not to spare any one.A native of Thrissur, George Vattikulam, an activist, moved the High Court last month saying that the SIT investigation was dragging and expressed concern that many influential people involved in the case may go scot free and sought a central agency probe. The court said it is satisfied with the present investigation and directed the SIT to spare no one.The division bench headed by Chief Justice S Manikumar, however, said if the investigation was not proper or made public, then the petitioner had every right to move court again for another inquiry. “The SIT should probe the tree felling on assigned land, forest and protected areas,” it observed.The court later accepted the state government’s contention that the case was progressing well and the main accused were arrested. The court also said it did not want to disturb the ongoing probe. Earlier delay in arresting the main accused, three brothers of the Augustin family, had invited sharp criticism from the court. The Kerala government had opposed the CBI probe.In October 2020, the state revenue department had issued an order allowing felling of protected trees like rosewood and teak grown by farmers on the assigned land. Under the guise of this order, wood worth crores of rupees was smuggled from private and forest land. Poor farmers were given paltry amounts after being shown the government order by timber mafia.The tree felling and smuggling of valuable wood came to light in March after an upright forest officer unearthed illegal felling in which 101 rosewood trees, some of them as old as 500 years old had been cut and smuggled. After this many other districts also reported similar cases and green activists claimed that trees worth ₹500 crore were plundered using a weird government order and they suspected a nexus between politicians, officials and the timber mafia. Later the government had constituted a SIT and the Union Environment Ministry also sought a report from the state on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-rejects-petition-seeking-cbi-probe-in-wayanad-tree-felling-101630528572607.html
02-09-2021||India||Yediyurappa charts own plan to tour state to help BJP win 2023 polls||Even as the national leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been undertaking tours in Karnataka as part of its drive to consolidate its support base and iron out problems in its cadre and state leadership, former chief minister BS Yediyurappa, at least until now, is charting out his own plans to tour the state to help bring the BJP to power on it’s own in 2023.Though the intent appears to be the same, the two sides have visible differences and distinct approaches to how this so-called common goal can be achieved.The most conspicuous, analysts said, is how the BJPs national leadership is trying to push for an agenda on the platform of Hindutva while Yediyurappa continues to pursue his tried-and-tested caste-based politics.“Yediyurappa will undergo a state-wide tour and will talk to the BJP state leadership and president (Nalin Kumar Kateel) and then finalise it (tour),” said one person aware of the former chief minister’s plans, requesting anonymity.Arun Singh, the BJPs national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka has been touring parts of Old Mysuru region and is scheduled to head to Hubbali on Thursday and other regions in North Karnataka ahead of the upcoming Urban Local Body (ULB) polls on September 3.CT Ravi, the national general secretary and legislator from Chikmagalur is also on a tour to poll-bound districts. Kalaburagi, Hubballi and Belagavi are headed to the polls on September 3.Professor Chambi Puranik, political analyst and former faculty at Mysuru University said that the BJP cannot afford to “antagonize” Yediyurappa and will need him at the forefront if the saffron outfit has any hope of returning to power in 2023.On Tuesday, Arun Singh said that the party will not stop Yediyurappa’s proposed state-tour after Ganesha Chaturthi. He added that the 78-year-old is an experienced leader and need not seek permission from the top brass to tour the state.“There is some kind of understanding (between the BJP and Yediyurappa). Yesterday’s statement indicate that Yediyurappa is not just indispensable but also defiant. He (Yediyurappa) is an asset as well as a challenge to them,” Professor Puranik said.The state is also likely to witness zilla and taluk panchayat elections later this year which, people aware of the developments said, would provide a good indicator of mood on the ground ahead of the 2023 assembly polls.Leaders like Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah and HD Deve Gowda among others have been part and parcel of Karnataka’s deeply caste-influenced society and politics over the decades that has shaped their careers and the discourse in the state. The Lingayats are believed to back Yediyurappa and the BJP while the backward classes, Dalits and minorities are known to side with the Congress. The JD(S) is believed to derive their strength and numbers in the assembly elections with the backing of the Vokkaligas, another dominant community found in majority in the Old Mysuru region.Yediyurappa stepped down from the top chair after a long and bitter battle between the high command and his own partymen for almost two years on July 26 and was replaced by Basavaraj Bommai, a known loyalist of the former chief minister and who a Lingayat.Yediyurappa, people aware of the developments said, continues to run the government and was able to get his choice of legislators to enter the new Cabinet.More importantly, he kept those particular legislators who challenged his reign at the top post, out.“Yediyurappa has a way to get people to do what he wants,” said a Bengaluru-based analyst, requesting not to be named.The analyst referred to the likes of Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), a firebrand and hardcore Hindutva leader, who was sucked into the caste-reservation row when he became one of the leading faces of the Panchamasali agitation. Panchamasali is the largest sub-sect within the Lingayats, believed to be the most populous and dominant caste group in Karnataka, to which Yediyurappa too belongs.Yediyurappa came under flak by his own party when he refused to join the hardcore right wings assertion to blame Muslims for the spread of Covid- 19 in April last year after the Tablighi Jamaat row in Delhi.Yediyurappa is faced with opposition from the likes of CT Ravi, another aspirant for the top job, known for his right wing views.“Until Hindus are in majority in this country there will be the constitution written by Dr B R Ambedkar. Until Hindus are in majority there will be equal opportunity, once Hindus become minority what happened to Gandara (Afghanistan) will happen here too,”Ravi said in Kalaburagi on Tuesday, news agency PTI reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappa-charts-own-plan-to-tour-state-to-help-bjp-win-2023-polls-101630528570053.html

02-09-2021||India||Vaccinate inmates, staff of mental health facilities in a month, Supreme Court tells states||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the states and Union territories to vaccinate all inmates and staff of mental healthcare facilities against Covid-19 within a month and to set up a dashboard to provide information about rehabilitation homes set up for cured mentally ill patients within the same period.Passing a slew of orders, the bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli said, “All states and UTs are directed to ensure time-bound schedule for vaccination of all persons lodged in mental health institutions and of service providers, health care workers and other staff, not later than one month from the receipt of this order. Progress report should be filed with the Union Ministry of Social Justices and Empowerment on or before October 15 explaining steps taken and the number of persons vaccinated for COVID.”The order came on a contempt petition filed by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, who accused states and UTs of flouting a July 10, 2017 order of the top court requiring states/UTs to establish half-way homes serving as rehabilitation facilities for mentally ill patients who have cured and who were overstaying at the government-run mental hospitals or facilities. On July 6, the top court in the same proceedings directed the Union government to chalk out a plan for vaccinating persons staying in mental health establishments on priority.The court also went through status reports submitted by states and UTs on compliance of its July 2017 order. It said, “We do not find any genuine progress made in that context except different states have set timelines for setting up half-way homes.”Uttar Pradesh, in its report, said the state has re-designated 75 old age homes as half-way homes and shifted 51 patients cured of mental illness to these homes. The bench said, “Merely designating 75 old homes as half-way homes will amount to mere lip service.” The court also commented on the Maharashtra government’s decision to shift 186 cured patients overstaying at mental health institutions to beggar homes, old age homes and other custodial institutions. The bench directed such persons to be relocated in half-way homes by November 30.The bench ordered, “Ultimate task of rehabilitation will not sub-serve by relocation alone.” The bench relied on guidelines issued by the Centre under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act requiring rehabilitation to be a two-step process of relocation and re-integration into society requiring half-way homes to cater medical, social, and psychological needs of inmates besides training in skills.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Madhavi Divan informed the court that progress made by states could be achieved by requiring each state/UT to create a dashboard providing details of these homes, their geographical location, facilities provided, intake capacity, and occupancy. This would not only bring in accountability in the long run but also provide the Centre access to information from states.The bench accordingly directed the Centre to frame a Model Dashboard with the required inputs and circulate it to states/UTs to update information on real time basis within four weeks. The court also directed the Centre to monitor progress by state/UT governments on a monthly basis and file a status report before the court in the last week of December, when the matter is to be heard next.The petitioner apprised the court of a report prepared by the National Institute for Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru in 2016 which highlighted deplorable conditions of living of women inmates in state-run mental health establishments. These included women inmates separated from their child, forceful tonsuring of heads, lack of privacy, lack of sanitary napkins, identity documents and non-issuance of disability certificate or pension to eligible inmates. Gaurav Kumar Bansal, the petitioner in this case, also presented the recommendations of National Commission for Women (NCW) made in 2020 in this regard and pleaded to the court to issue orders as these were clear violations of the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017.The bench directed the Centre to take up these issues with the states/UTs in its monthly meetings and said, “The issues flagged are of serious concern…Necessary directions shall be issued for taking steps to ensure the problems highlighted are alleviated by concerned states/UTs by taking suitable steps.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccinate-inmates-staff-of-mental-health-facilities-in-a-month-supreme-court-tells-states-101630528564169.html

The incident took place after the environmentalist DV Girish tried to object to lewd and obscene comments passed by the perpetrators, police said. The incident came to light after a video, captured by a school teacher, surfaced on social media on Wednesday. In the video, eight persons were seen waylaying a gypsy driven by Girish, pulling out the passengers and assaulting and abusing them in the middle of the road just outside a government school in Shantaveri village in the district. Chikkamagaluru rural police station officials said that an FIR was filed on Tuesday on charges of assault and criminal intimidation of the IPC. Police have also arrested one of the miscreants, identified as Aruna, on Tuesday. Girish on Wednesday said that he was travelling back from a friend’s estate in Kemmangundi to Chikmagaluru when they encountered the miscreants. He said that some youngsters, who were visibly inebriated passed lewd comments on a friend’s 17-year old daughter, seated inside the vehicle. “I just used the brakes but didn’t stop and asked them why they were saying such things (lewd remarks),” Girish said. However, Girsh was persuaded by a local taxi driver not to engage with the miscreants and carry on. “Since she girl was there, we did not engage with them and went off. After another 2 kms, I saw these bikes chasing us in my rear-view mirror,” Girish said. But a few kilometers later, the perpetrators overtook the vehicle and waylaid Girish and his friends, pulled them out of them, assaulted and abused them. Girish said the miscreants fled when they got the whiff that the police had been informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conservationist-assaulted-by-group-in-k-taka-distt-1-arrested-police-101630528456508.html
02-09-2021||India||Madras HC reaffirms ‘queerphobia’, calls for revamp of medical education||The Madras high court (HC) on Tuesday came down heavily on conversion therapies employed by medical professionals to purportedly cure non-normative gender and sexual identities of persons belonging to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ+) community and issued notice to the National Medical Commission and the Indian Psychiatric Society to submit reports before the next date of hearing on how the two medical bodies would help prevent this from happening. The court further directed the police to amend its conduct rules to ensure that activists and other members of Non-Governmental Organisations working with LGBTQ persons are also protected from police harassment. Justice N Anand Venkatesh passed the order, made available on September 1, while hearing the matter on a writ petition filed by a same-sex couple seeking protection from harassment by the police and its families in March. In an unprecedented move, the judge had sought counselling on LGBT issues before passing a slew of orders on June 7, which also directed the police to ensure that other adults in consenting same-sex relationships are not subjected to similar harassment by the police. Justice Venkatesh on Tuesday referred to a report filed by Dr Trinetra Haldar Gummaraju, a transwoman, and said that “queerphobia” – prejudicial and abusive attitudes and behaviours directed at the LGBT community – was rampant in medical education. Gummaraju’s report stated that the curriculum of undergraduate forensic medicine described “sodomy”, “lesbianism” and “oral sex” as sexual offences, and “transvestism” (cross-dressing) as a “sexual perversion”. The court observed that such material reflected queerphobia and added that it was important for the medical and mental health fraternity to be “non-judgmental and free of moral or personal prejudices about their patient’s identity on the gender spectrum or their sexuality”. “Knowledge about a patient’s gender identity and sexuality may be of interest to a doctor, physician and a mental health professional if it is pertinent in cracking the course of the treatment, but the course of the treatment cannot be one which aims to cure their gender identity or sexuality itself,” the court said. “Prescribing anti-depressants, erectile dysfunction drugs and sending a person to cognitive behaviour therapy as “remedy” to their gender identity and sexuality is nothing conversion therapy camouflaged as medical and mental health support.” The court further directed the Additional Solicitor General R Sankaranarayanan to bring this to the notice of the key medical institutions to revamp the curriculum in the MBBS course. “A specific clause is to be added in the Police Conduct Rules specifically providing that any harassment by the police, to the persons belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community and/or to the activists and NGO workers, will be treated as misconduct and will entail a punishment for such misconduct,” the court said, adding that the police department must conduct sensitization programmes involving members of the LGBT community, as well as social workers and activists working in this field. It further directed that the police not harass NGO workers who provide support to members of the queer community. “One of the excuses given by the police authorities while shunning these persons is the lack of an internal circular issued by the higher authorities of the Department,” the court said. “Evidently, the larger excuse seems to be the sheer lack of awareness and the apathy towards arming themselves enough to fight for a community of public belonging to the citizenry of this nation, to whom they swore to be servants.”The Court recalled its June order which had observed that lack of awareness cannot be an excuse to any form of discrimination. And the absence of internal communication and hierarchical orders “is no excuse to deny protection to the community that is vulnerable, susceptible to threat and harassment.” In June, the judge had issued directions to a slew of state and Central agencies such as the NCERT, state education department, National Medical Commission, union ministries of social justice and women and child development, and even the state home department though the agencies were not respondents in the case. The court directed them to frame guidelines that recognise the rights of LGBTQ+ persons (such as his petitioners) and to ensure their safety and security. On Tuesday, the court heard the compliance reports submitted by various state and central departments. “It is necessary to carry on with this momentum and create a congenial atmosphere for the persons belonging to the LGBTQIA+ Community by accepting them as they are,” the court said. “This Court expects the State and the Central Government to give more priority to this issue and come up with some positive actions on their part.” The court also pulled up news media for insensitive commentary, ridicule and sensationalising of lives of LGBTQ persons. “It is high time journalists stick to sensitive and inclusive terms on the gender spectrum,” the court said. The next hearing has been posted to October 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-reaffirms-queerphobia-calls-for-revamp-of-medical-education-101630528455093.html
02-09-2021||India||Schools, more classes reopen across states||New Delhi: Eight states apart from the national capital expanded on Wednesday the resumption of schools for students with strict guidelines on social distancing and sanitising, and each saw low attendance levels on the first day due to hesitancy from parents or lack of readiness of institutions.If in Delhi, classes 9 to 12 opened for the first time since March last year, Haryana, where middle, secondary and senior secondary schools were already functioning, opened its doors students in the primary classes 4 and 5. Madhya Pradesh saw its first school opening after the pandemic, with classes 6 to 12 opening on Wednesday, while in Uttar Pradesh, classes 1 to 5 resumed classroom teaching. In Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan, students of classes 9 to 12 returned to school, while in Telangana all classes except residential schools and tribal welfare schools with hostel facilities were allowed to open. In many of these states, however, online classes remained an option. Schools in Haryana reported an attendance rate of 26%, with officials attributing this to both heavy rain and some measure of Covid-related hesitancy. However, for those children that did make it to school, it was day when they met classmates after nearly 18 months. Ashish Kumar, a student of Class 4 at government school in Rohtak’s Bohar, said, “We faced problems during online classes and missed our friends. We have been asked not to sit on the same bench, and directed not to share water bottles.”Rajbir Siwach, headmaster of the Girls High School in Ishwarwal in Bhiwani, said that only two students out of a total of 26 attended class on Wednesday. In Madhya Pradesh, among the checks put in place by the state administration include schools could only open with 50% attendance, with each student allowed to attend class three times in a week. Under government guidelines, vaccinations of teachers and other staff members have also been made mandatory. Most private schools in the big cities of the state did not reopen on Wednesday, with school administrations saying they were yet to make arrangements as per the guidelines issued. Government schools did open though, and the headmaster of Sarojini Naidu government school in Bhopal, Lakshmi Bhargava, said, “The school has been reopened with proper arrangement of social distancing and santisation. We allowed the students only after receiving the consent letter of parents.” In Uttar Pradesh, while classes 6 to 8 opened from August 24, and 9 to 12 from August 16, classes 1 to 5 opened on Wednesday. They followed the same stipulations as mandated for the senior classes, which include two shifts, and arrangements for hand sanitisers, handwash, thermal scanning, pulse oximeter and first aid kits on the premises. In Tamil Nadu, students from Class 9 to 12 went back to school on Wednesday after March last year. The Tamil Nadu government, however, said that not all students were compelled to attend and they could opt for online classes with the consent of their parents.Most schools in the state did not function beyond lunchtime to prevent a spread while eating. According to the SOP issued by the state, schools should function six days a week and classrooms shouldn’t have more than 20 students to ensure physical distancing. If no additional rooms available, then students should come to school on a rotational basis on alternate days. “Ninety per cent of the teachers and non-teaching staff have received at least one dose, ‘’ school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi told reporters on Wednesday, adding that arrangements were being made to ensure full vaccination of all school staff.Colleges also reopened in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday, and the state asked institutions to ensure that students coming from Kerala, where Covid cases are still on the rise, have been vaccinated or produce RT-PCR negative reports. All students in the state can commute for free without a bus pass in state transport corporation buses. In Rajasthan, too, schools opened for classes 9 to 12 along with regulations that mandate a ban on holding mass prayers, sporting activities, meetings, and distribution of cooked midday meals. Only dry ration will be provided to students, and wearing masks and observance of social distance will be mandatory on campus, senior state official said.While across India different states and UTs have used different timelines for the opening of their schools, Assam, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Manipur, Kerala, West Bengal have so far not opened schools, with decisions to be taken in the next few days. In Kerala, which reported an average of 29,515 cases per day over the last seven days, 69% of the country’s daily tally, government officials said that there were no immediate plans to reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-more-classes-reopen-across-states-101630528394362.html
02-09-2021||India||Rawat conveys rebels’ grievances to Punjab CM as power tussle continues||Congress general secretary in-charge of Punjab, Harish Rawat, met chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday and spoke with him about the grievances that the rival camp led by state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu has aired and asked him to fulfil some of the major demands made by them, like the reduction of electricity rates. Rawat, who is in Chandigarh to iron out the differences between the warring factions led by Singh and Sidhu, also raised the issue of pending election promises and the apprehensions among some dissenting ministers and legislators about alleged attempts to target them in their constituencies by those close to the CM.“I told him about their (disgruntled ministers and MLAs’) grievances. It is his duty to address these,” Rawat told reporters after the meeting. The two leaders met at the CM’s Siswan farmhouse, with Singh summoning top officials, including the advocate general and the director general of police, to brief Rawat on the Bargari sacrilege (the 2015 desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book) and police firing cases, power purchase agreements (PPA), arrest of “big fish” in the drug rackets, cancellation of the three controversial farm laws passed by the Union government, and other pending election promises. These promises are part of an 18-point to-do list prepared by the party’s central leadership based on feedback received from state leaders and handed down to the CM on June 23 for implementation ahead of next year’s assembly elections. Sidhu, who has been seeking action on the agenda, had conveyed to Rawat on Tuesday his dissatisfaction with the state government’s efforts on this front, urging him to get these issues sorted out quickly. The Punjab Congress chief has repeatedly talked about bringing resolutions in the state assembly on PPAs and farm laws.Rawat met Sidhu on Tuesday and offered to quit if he was not being given any say in party affairs, according to people privy to the meeting. This came in the aftermath of Sidhu issuing an ultimatum to the party leadership and the resignation of a key adviser to the state unit chief over his controversial remarks. ‘Give people cheaper power’After discussing the to-do list at length with the chief minister, Rawat, who seemed satisfied with the action taken on some of these issues, said the government would try to find a way to give power to consumers at reduced rates. “On PPAs, the CM said that some actions have been taken. I am hopeful that the state government will extend the facility of 200 units of free power given to SCs (Scheduled Castes) and the poor to consumers of general category also. I have also requested him to give relief to general consumers; how much relief is to be given will be decided by him in consultation with the cabinet and others,” Rawat said. Blaming the previous Akali Dal government for “faulty” PPAs, the Congress general secretary said that it would not be possible to cancel them lock, stock and barrel due to its impact on the power availability and supply situation. “I suggested to him to revisit PPAs for cut in power purchase rates to give maximum benefit to consumers,” said Rawat, the former Himachal Pradesh chief minister. On the three farm laws, Rawat said he told the chief minister to meet the governor regarding the bills already passed by the state government which were pending with him. On the drugs issue, he said the state government had done exemplary work but one person had managed to escape action. “I told him that the government should put its view before the high court so that the fight against drugs enters the decisive phase,” he added. The state affairs in-charge also took up the demand by Sidhu and several party leaders for a full-fledged monsoon session of the state assembly, besides the feeling of insecurity among some disgruntled party leaders, said people aware of the discussions in the Rawat-Singh meeting. The government has convened a special session on September 3 to mark the 400th parkash purab (birth anniversary) of Guru Teg Bahadur. Singh has already stated that his government would consider calling the regular monsoon session in a week or so. Meanwhile, Sidhu reportedly reached Delhi on Wednesday to meet the central leadership of the party. Before he met the chief minister, Rawat also had a one-on-one meeting with Mohammad Mustafa, principal strategic adviser to the PPCC chief, who later said there was a problem in the state unit. “I have suggested a solution that will help,” the retired IPS officer said, refusing to go into details. Gurdaspur MLA Barindermeet Pahra, who also met Rawat, said that the present situation was damaging the party. The party leadership should put a break to infighting and work on fulfilling promises, he added.Last week, four cabinet ministers and several legislators had declared open rebellion and sought the chief minister’s removal, expressing their total lack of faith in his ability to fulfil the pending promises. However, their request was not entertained by Congress’ central leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rawat-conveys-rebels-grievances-to-punjab-cm-as-power-tussle-continues-101630528392536.html
02-09-2021||India||Corruption case: CBI arrests SI for leaking report, detains Deshmukh’s aide||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday arrested one of its own officers in connection with the leaking of the report of it’s preliminary enquiry into the allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. The agency has also detained Nagpur based advocate Anand Daga, who was a part of Deshmukh’s legal team, for attempting to influence the enquiry officers.The central agency registered an offence in connection with leaking of the report and arrested its own sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari. Tiwari is also suspected of having illegal gratification from Deshmukh’s team for purportedly manipulating the report. Daga was detained on the suspicion that he tried to influence a junior CBI officer during the preliminary enquiry into corruption charges against Deshmukh, agency officers familiar with the matter said.The central agency also detained Deshmukh’s son-in-law on Wednesday, but he was allowed to leave after questioning. The lawyer was detained.“Attempt of Anil Deshmukh’s team were in contempt of Bombay high court, which had directed that all concerned should fully cooperate with the CBI while conducting the PE.

02-09-2021||India||Only 6 lodged in K’taka detention centre till now||Two years have passed since the Karnataka government opened a detention centre in Nelamangala in the outskirts of Bengaluru for illegal immigrants staying in the city. Though the construction was completed in 2019, the facility remained locked and only became operational in October 2020. Even though the government had planned this facility as a transit for illegal immigrants, so far only six people had been lodged, who were later deported, Karnataka Police officials said on Wednesday. The centre’s first detainee was a Sudanese national, identified as Omer Altayb Hajahmed, who was arrested in 2019 but was shifted to the detention centre in November 2020.The centre, which is operated by the department of social welfare and secured by the police, has a capacity to lodge 30 to 40 illegal immigrants at a time. Even though the Foreigner Regional Registration Office’s (FRRO) records show there are more than 900 foreigners, whose visas have expired but are still staying in the city, with at least 43 with a criminal case against them, the centre has remained mostly empty since its inauguration. Sharing views on why the facility is being underused, a senior FRRO official on Wednesday pointed out that even though his office is responsible for keeping track of foreigners in the city, the responsibility of identifying and arresting overstaying immigrants is with the local police. “We have provided the details with the police, and they are trying to track them,” said the officer. The detention centre has six rooms to lodge illegal immigrants, along with a common kitchen and a bathroom, while the compound walls are secured by barbed wires on all four sides. The centre also has two watchtowers constructed on two corners and a security room at the entrance, according to the police. “This is not a prison, and it was meant to be a transit center for those awaiting deportation. This is the reason the center comes under the jurisdiction of the social welfare department, we are only providing security,” said a senior IPS officer on Wednesday. The center had come to the limelight after five African women arrested for overstaying escaped from the Government State Home for Women near Nimhans in the early hours on August 19. The five women were arrested as part of the special drive against foreigners overstaying in the city. While three of them are from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, two are Nigerians. Questions were raised during an internal review on why the facility was not used to lodge the detainees. “There are no female staff at the detention center. So, the decision was taken to not to lodge them,” said a senior Bengaluru police officer explaining, why they were kept at the home for women. Karnataka Police chief DG and IGP Praveen Sood on Wednesday said that the police are constantly on the lookout for those illegally staying in the state and special drives are being conducted in Bengaluru. “One of the biggest problems we are facing is that many of those illegally staying in the city are in hiding and many of them have left the state. It is difficult to conduct nationwide searches,” Sood said. Sood added a similar problem is faced with those caught with criminal cases. As many as 70 foreign nationals were arrested in 2020 under Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS) in comparison to 44 in 2018 and 38 in 2019, according to Bengaluru police, while the number of arrested persons in 2020 under the NDPS Act increased by 200% last year, as per police records. “When those who are arrested are produced before the court, it is mandatory that they should stay in the country until the trial is over. Many of them come out on bail and disappear. This is a loophole they have found,” he added. A senior Prisons Department official said at present there are no plans to take over the detention facility even though prisons in the state are overcrowded. “Firstly, the facility is very small. Secondly, it was built with the purpose of being a detention centre. It might take some time for the center to start working smoothly. But at present there are no plans to take over the facility,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-6-lodged-in-k-taka-detention-centre-till-now-101630528273736.html
02-09-2021||India||Telangana adds 4 more mandals to ₹1.75 lakh cr Dalit welfare scheme||The Telangana government on Wednesday added four more mandals to the ₹1.75 lakh crores Dalit Bandhu scheme, each from a constituency represented by a Dalit lawmaker. Under the scheme, each beneficiary will receive financial assistance of ₹10 lakh. A statement from chief minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) office said to understand the intricacies of the scheme, KCR decided to extend the new scheme to the following four mandals: Chintakani mandal (Madhira Constituency, Khammam district), Tirmalgiri mandal (Tungaturthy constituency, Suryapet district), Charakonda Mandal (Achampet, Nagar Kurnool district) and Nizamsagar mandal (Jukkal seat, Kamareddy district).For the initial implementation of the scheme, which is a brainchild of KCR, the Huzurabad Assembly seat was chosen (pilot project). For this, ₹2,000 crores were released in four instalments in August. The move drew criticism from the opposition, which said that Huzurabad was chosen as it is going for a by-election soon. “Telangana Dalit Bandhu Scheme will be implemented for all the Dalit families in these Mandals,” said the statement from KCR’s office. The statement further stated that after his trip to New Delhi, the chief minister would convene a review meeting in Hyderabad with ministers, MLAs, and district collectors from these concerned areas.Decisions taken at this proposed meeting will be implemented in these four mandals. KCR will be in New Delhi on September 2 to inaugurate the new office of his party, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). Under the Dalit Bandhu scheme, all eligible Scheduled Caste (SC) members will receive financial assistance of ₹10 lakh from the state government. Initially, KCR announced that 100 candidates would be chosen from each of the state’s 119 Assembly segments, totalling 11,900 candidates, after a meeting with Dalit leaders of all political parties on June 25.The state sanctioned an initial amount of ₹1,200 crores for the same. However, KCR then decided to extend the scheme to all Dalits and even promised to spend ₹1.75 lakh crore in a phased manner to help uplift Dalits from poverty. “The government may be studying the ground scenario and analysing the response among people for the scheme. The ruling TRS may be seeing how the public responds and what the negatives might be before rolling it out. Or it could be to check the repercussions from other caste groups as well,” said political analyst Palwai Raghavendra Reddy. Reddy opined that the challenge for KCR would be to balance support from other caste groups and other communities. However, he said that the scheme is likely launched with an eye on the 2023 state polls. “After (Malkagiri Lok Sabha MP) Revanth Reddy was chosen as the new Congress chief in July, he has drawn a tremendous response from the public in meetings. So KCR is wary of him,” he added. What is the Dalit Bandhu scheme?KCR’s promise to the Dalit community is that each SC family in Telangana would be given ₹10 lakh to start any business venture of their choice, without any stress to return the money. The money will be deposited into the accounts of Dalit families, which will serve as the seed capital to start a business. The goal here is the economic empowerment of all Dalits.At a high-level meeting on August 27, KCR said that the scheme would continue till every “Dalit family is developed”. A CMO release then stated that a comprehensive family survey pointed out that there are 17 lakh, Dalit families, in Telangana and that the SC population in the state stands at 7.5 million (18 per cent). However, what has raised eyebrows is the fact that the Dalit Bandhu scheme is started on a pilot basis from Huzurabad, which is slated for a by-election. It is being necessitated after former TRS health minister Eatala Rajender was sacked from the cabinet by KCR in May over land-grabbing allegations. Eatala, who has held the seat for over two decades and is a former aide of KCR, resigned as an MLA in June this year and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). BJP’s chief spokesperson in Telangana Krishna Saagar Rao called the scheme a “bribe” to voters by KCR and said that it is being launched only for the by-poll, which analysts think will be a semi-final to the state 2023 state polls. “This is indirect corruption. During the previous Huzurnagar by-election in the state, KCR had announced schemes and released funds for other schemes. Wherever there are polls, KCR launches new schemes. He is scared that he will lose the state elections in 2023,” said Congress spokesperson Syed Nizamuddin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telanganaadds-4-more-mandals-to-1-75-lakh-cr-dalit-welfare-scheme-101630528267442.html
02-09-2021||India||Allow us to appoint our DGP on our own: Bengal govt to Supreme Court||Asserting its “autonomy” and “ultimate power” of superintendence over police officials, the West Bengal government has approached the Supreme Court for dispensing with the need to consult the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for appointing the state’s new director general of police (DGP).The Mamata Banerjee-government has requested the top court to modify its 2018 order in the Prakash Singh case on police reforms which made it mandatory for the state governments to appoint the DGP from a panel of three most senior police officers.“The Constitution of India does not vest UPSC with the power to assess the respective merit of the officers holding the rank of DGP in the state cadre for determining the fitness to be appointed as the DGP/Head of Police Force (HOPF) of the State, since it is the state government which can have the proximate opportunity to assess the fitness of officers of that rank who had rendered service to the state in the state cadre,” said the plea.The application was mentioned before Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana by senior lawyer Sidharth Luthra on behalf of the state government on Wednesday.Luthra pointed out that the 2018 SC order restrains state governments from appointing acting DGP while the incumbent police chief has retired a day ago. The senior counsel made it clear that the state wanted empanelment by UPSC for the post to be done away with, and therefore, the application was required to be heard urgently. The CJI said he will look into the request for hearing the matter sometime next week.The developments come amid a stalemate over appointment of a new DGP in West Bengal, which named Manoj Malviya, the most senior officer in the Indian Police Service cadre in the state, as interim DGP on Tuesday.The West Bengal government’s application emphasised that UPSC had a limited role to provide consultation on the principles to be followed in the appointments to the service of the Union and promotions and transfers of such candidates, but UPSC could not be entrusted with the function of preparing the panel of officers for the appointment of DGP till Parliament makes a new law.Pointing out that police and public order are subjects exclusively within the jurisdiction of the state, the application contended that UPSC had neither the jurisdiction nor the expertise to consider and appoint the DGP.“Each state has, therefore, exclusive power to legislate in regard to its police system and also have full administrative control over the police in the state...the direct involvement of the UPSC in the appointment process of the DGP of a state would tantamount to curtailment of the legislative powers of a state,” stated the plea.The West Bengal government highlighted that even the Supreme Court should not curtail the legislative powers of a state under the principles of judicial review or in exercise of the court’s extraordinary authority under Article 142 (power to issue orders for doing complete justice).“The state government has the autonomy to select and appoint the DGP in the state without having to refer the names for empanelment to the UPSC, and to resultantly appoint the DGP from the panel prepared by the UPSC...the ultimate power to therefore exercise superintendence, extended to the selection of the DGP (HOPF) is therefore vested with the state government and cannot be taken away,” stated the application.Under the 2018 order, states need to send names of DGP candidates to UPSC, which picks three candidates from the eligible names based on seniority, experience, service record and other criteria. The state government then selects any of the top three candidates, provided that the candidate has a minimum of six months of service left.On July 2, the UPSC wrote to Bengal chief secretary HK Dwivedi seeking a list of eligible officers for the post. Roughly 10 days later, Bengal government prepared a list of 21 names for UPSC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-us-to-appoint-our-dgp-on-our-own-bengal-govt-to-sc-101630528208122.html

In an unprecedented move, the judge had sought counselling on LGBT issues before passing a slew of orders on June 7.Justice Venkatesh referred to a report filed by Dr Trinetra Haldar Gummaraju, a transwoman, and said “queerphobia” – prejudicial and abusive attitudes and behaviours directed at the LGBT community – was rampant in medical education.Gummaraju’s report stated that the curriculum of undergraduate forensic medicine described “sodomy”, “lesbianism” and “oral sex” as sexual offences, and “transvestism” (cross-dressing) as a “sexual perversion”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/queerphobia-rampant-in-medical-education-need-revamp-says-madras-high-court-101630526546584.html

Progress report should be filed with the Union Ministry of Social Justices and Empowerment on or before October 15 explaining steps taken and the number of persons vaccinated for Covid.”The court was hearing a contempt petition filed by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, who accused states and UTs of flouting a July 10, 2017 top court order requiring them to establish half-way homes serving as rehabilitation facilities for mentally ill patients who have been cured and were overstaying at government-run mental facilities. On July 6, the court directed the Centre to chalk out a plan for vaccinating inmates of mental health facilities on priority.The court also went through status reports submitted by states on compliance of its July 2017 order. It said: “We do not find any genuine progress made in that context except different states have set timelines for setting up half-way homes.”Uttar Pradesh said it has redesignated 75 old-age homes as half-way homes. “Merely designating 75 old homes as half-way homes will amount to mere lip service,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccinate-inmates-staff-of-mental-health-facilities-in-a-month-top-court-tells-states-101630524446040.html
02-09-2021||India||Back to school: For students it’s goodbye internet woes, hello friends and teachers||Fifteen-year-old Aradhna Kumari, a class 9 student, on Wednesday stepped into a physically distanced school campus for the first time in nearly 17 months. The Greater Kailash-2 resident said she was happy to meet and greet her friends and teachers in person after nearly one-and-a-half years. Recalling her initial pandemic days of 2020, the teenager said like most students, she too was happy when classes were called off in March 2020. Little did she know that the closure was going to continue for as long as it did. “I was excited to meet my classmates and friends after such a long time. It felt nice and different to see people in person and not on a phone screen,” said Kumari, a student of Chirag Enclave-Sarvodaya (Co-ed) Vidyalaya (Kautilya). With two other school-going siblings, Kumari said she struggled with internet and accessibility issues during online classes. “My siblings are studying in classes 6 and 9. Many times, our classes take place at the same time and only one of us is able to attend it,” said Kumari. Vishal Kumar, another class 9 student of the school, said his first day back was largely spent interacting with teachers and checking on the progress in different subjects. The 14-year-old said he was happy to be back, and to be finally free of internet issues. “Sometimes, we are unable to join the online class or are removed from an ongoing class due to technical issues. Online classes are fraught with disturbances since several students tend to unmute at the same time while responding to the teacher,” said Kumar. School principal Chitender Singh Verma said of the nearly 800 students in classes 9, 10, and 12, around 300 were back in school. “The rain did not have much of an impact on our attendance. Students are excited about coming back, and we expect the attendance to pick up,” said Verma. The school has 24 benches in a classroom and only 12 students were permitted in each room. Most of the school staff are vaccinated, said Verma. “We have 67 teachers and all of them have received their first dose vaccine while 75% have got the second dose as well.” To ensure mask compliance, the school has asked both teachers and security guards to monitor students. Pradeep Kumar Dahiya, a science teacher, said, “A guard goes to all classes to enquire if any student requires an extra mask or a new mask.” Since several government schools are also functioning as vaccination and ration distribution centres, schools have demarcated areas for these activities, away from the space for academic activities. At Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya Jogabai in New Friends Colony, while the vaccination drive was taking place on the ground floor, classes were conducted on the first floor. Vice-principal Usha Kiran said,“We are also keeping a strict vigil on students and escorting them to the classroom so that they don’t mingle with beneficiaries,” said Kiran. The number of students in one class at the school has been capped at 15 and classes are being conducted in sessions. On Wednesday, 48 students turned up at the school with written consent from parents, said Kiran, adding that attendance was low due to the rain. Teachers were also happy with the resumption of in-person classes. Manju Gupta, English teacher at the school, said, “While we engage with students during online classes as well, many students hesitate in asking doubts. When students are in front of us, we can gauge from their body language whether they are paying attention or not,” said Gupta. At Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 21, Rohini, students returned to classrooms adorned with welcome posters, balloons and flowers. Sukhbir Singh Yadav, school principal, said that while the attendance was low in comparison to other days, students were happy to receive a warm welcome from teachers. Yadav said classes for grades 10 and 12 will be held on one day, and will alternate with sessions for grades 9 and 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/back-to-school-for-students-it-s-goodbye-internet-woes-hello-friends-and-teachers-101630521783563.html

The right to life is above the right to kill and the right to eat beef can never be considered a fundamental right.”The judge noted that the applicant, after committing theft of the cow, had killed it, beheaded it, and stored its meat.“This is not the first offence of the applicant,” the court said, adding that if the applicant is released on bail, he will again commit the same offence, spoiling communal harmony.The judge also asked the government to pass a legislation declaring “the cow as the national animal” and that enables action “against those who talk about harming the cows” and also those who claim to protect cows but only want to “earn money in the name of cow protection”.This wasn’t about religion, justice Yadav stressed, pointing out that several Muslim rulers of India made a point of protecting cows. “Muslims have also considered the cow as an important part of India’s culture during their reign. For example, slaughter of cows was banned by five Muslim rulers. Babur, Humayun, and Akbar prohibited the sacrifice of cows in their religious festivals. The Nawab of Mysore, Hyder Ali, made cow slaughter a punishable offence”.In India, the slaughter of cow is partially or fully banned by law in 20 states, with the earliest going back almost 70 years. Recent years, however, have seen a spurt in attacks by cow vigilante groups on people transporting cows, including, in several cases, those not doing so for slaughter.Emphasising the usefulness of the cow, the judge further observed: “The cow is useful even when she is old and sick, and her dung and urine are very useful for agriculture, making of medicines”.He added that no one has the right to kill “one who is worshiped as a mother.”Justice Yadav was also critical of cow shelters where cows are not properly cared for, and owners who abandon cows that are no longer productive.“The cow needs to be protected and taken care of... and the government will also have to consider their case seriously. Only when there is welfare of cows, will there be welfare of this country,” justice Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/declare-cow-national-animal-its-protection-a-right-allahabad-hc-101630521729316.html
02-09-2021||India||RSS meet tomorrow to discuss 5 state polls||The Rashtryia Swayamsevak Sangh has summoned an important four-day-long session of its powerful coordination committee starting September 3 to discuss elections in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur due early next year.The meeting of the committee, which ensures coordination between the Sangh, its various affiliates, and the Bharatiya Janata Party, is aimed at assessing preparedness of the Sangh’s cadres and ensuring a smooth road to victory for the BJP. The RSS is the ideological parent of the BJP.The meeting will be attended by organising secretaries of all RSS affiliates including the BJP, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh.Announcing the meeting, RSS senior functionary Arvind Kukde said that around 60 prominent Sangh Parivar leaders representing different organisations, along with RSS central executive committee members, will participate in the conclave. The meeting will be addressed by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, general secretary Dattatreya Hosabole and former general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi.Former RSS swayamsevak and a keen RSS observer Dilip Deodhar said that the meeting will also discuss recent developments in Afghanistan. “The RSS feels that the Taliban’s violent return to power doesn’t augur well for a civilised world and that it may boost the morale of militants in Kashmir,” Deodhar said. The meeting is likely to adopt a resolution in this regard.According to Deodhar, the RSS is pleased with the performance of the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh and has decided to whole-heartedly support his team in the polls.The on-going farmers’ stir in Punjab, UP, Haryana and Delhi may also come up for discussion and the conclave may appeal to the government to resolve the issue. The RSS wants the government to incorporate minimum guarantee price and a formula for remunerative price for agricultural produce in the farm laws which were adopted by the Narendra Modi government last year.Kukde stated that the RSS meeting will strictly adhere to Covid-19 protocols. Earlier, the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha meeting at Bengaluru in March 2020 was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “All the organising secretaries of 34 outfits of the Sangh Parivar and all members of RSS central committee members will attend the meeting. It’s a routine annual meeting,” he added.In an unrelated development, former chief justice of India Sharad Bobde on Tuesday, visited the birthplace of RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar in Mahal area in Nagpur. Bobde, who hails from Nagpur, has been living in the city after his retirement in April. He visited the house in which Hedgewar was born, to see its restoration work. Bobde is believed to have met RSS chief Bhagwat on Tuesday but neither he nor any RSS functionary, has confirmed this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-meet-tomorrow-to-discuss-5-state-polls-101630521367297.html

About 1.5 million people in these states have been affected due to the floods in the past 48 hours alone, the report added.Data released by the disaster management departments of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand said the two states recorded more landslides this year when compared to previous years, even though rainfall has been lower. Although rainfall in Uttarakhand was deficient by around 5% this year, the state reported a 32% increase in landslides, as per data from the state public works department. Over 135 people have been killed in over 1,200 incidents such as landslides and boulder falls, or were washed away in swollen rivers this year.Himachal, which reported 44% deficit in August, reported a 60% increase in landslides this year, according to the state disaster management authority. About 150 deaths were reported from the state so far this rainy season.Assam is witnessing floods despite less than normal rainfall. “For the month of August, the state received 296.3 mm rainfall against the normal of 347.1 mm,” Sumit Das, senior scientist at Guwahati-based regional meteorological office, said. Till August-end, Bihar received 801.9 mm of rain as compared to the normal of 1,027 mm, even as 32 of the total 40 districts remained flooded, displacing over a million people. While half of Odisha is witnessing drought-like conditions, the two neighbouring states of West Bengal and Jharkhand recorded flooding in some districts. Both the states have received up to 8% excess rain, which is considered normal.With inputs from other state bureaus||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/680-dead-in-monsoon-rains-assam-bihar-under-heaving-flooding-101630520222755.html

But on 15 of 31 days of August, usually the wettest month of the monsoon season, it did not rain at all in the national capital. This may well be the emerging trend in India, where short and more intense spells of rain are replacing uniformly distributed rainfall. However, even this phenomenon has several regional variations.

The first two are proposed to be developed in Bengaluru and Chandigarh.The state-run Indian Railways Station Development Corporation Ltd (IRSDC) issued tenders last month to develop the small city centre that will let residents of the two cities and travellers “to engage, use the facilities and spend quality time”.The tender, however, states that potential bidders won’t be allowed sell alcohol, beef and pork at these hubs.The proposed arcade zone for KSR Bengaluru railway station will be spread across 15,550 square feet while Chandigarh railway station’s arcade will be half this size, 7,500 sq ft.“The space is to be developed as an experience zone with presence of brands,” said the tender document issued by IRSDC, the dedicated company set up by the government to upgrade railway stations said. The construction and setting of the Rail Arcades is a part of a larger plan to monetise the national carrier’s land parcels and railway stations in a bid to shore up its falling revenue. The IRSDC is also working to transform railway station areas into a ‘Railopolis’, a mini smart city hub with mixed-use development.According to the tender document, the company that gets the contract will be required to take over the identified space and “undertake remodelling of the entire area for development of commercial, leisure & entertainment space for passengers and other customers (non-passengers).” The successful bidder will also be responsible for bringing in reputed brands in the respective segments and ensure that there are food, refreshment and retail product outlets for the right “customer experience”.The contract to set up the arcade, manage it and operate it on a 24X7 basis will be for a duration of nine years when the arcade will have to be transferred back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-float-tender-to-build-rail-arcades-across-major-stations-101630500600288.html
02-09-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi attacks govt over increase in fuel, cooking gas prices; BJP rebuts||New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday lashed out at the Centre over rising fuel prices, alleging that the government had earned ₹23 lakh crores from increasing prices of gas, petrol and diesel in the last seven years. The Congress leader also said “there’s a new concept of GDP, rising GDP means rise in prices of gas, diesel and petrol”.Hitting back, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) followed the core agenda of ‘CNP’, i.e., ‘corruption, nepotism and policy paralysis’. Addressing reporters at party headquarters here, Gandhi said: “The Prime Minister says the GDP is rising. Then I realised what he meant by GDP. Gas diesel petrol. In 2014, Narendra Modi ji had said that the prices of petrol and diesel are rising. In 2014, ₹410 was the price of the cylinder, when the UPA left office. Today it is ₹885, a rise of 116 per cent. Petrol was ₹71.5/litre in 2014, today it’s ₹101/litre, a rise of 42 per cent. Diesel was priced at ₹57/litre in 2014, it’s ₹88/litre today,” he added. “The Centre has earned ₹23 lakh crores from the GDP, not Gross Domestic Product but Gas, Diesel, Petrol. Now my question to the government is, where did they spend this ₹23 lakh crores? The public should ask the government where is the money which the Centre is snatching away from them going?”Further attacking the government over the rising fuel rates amid falling prices of gas and crude oil in the international market, Gandhi accused the central government of “selling the country’s assets”. “...So, in the international market, the prices of gas and crude oil are declining, and on the contrary, they are sharply increasing in India. On the other hand, the country’s assets are being sold,” the former Congress chief said. The Wayanad MP also alleged the Centre had “demonetised” farmers, labourers, small and medium businesses, salaried class, and honest industrialists through its economic policies. “In the last seven years, we have seen a new economic paradigm. Demonetisation on one side, and monetisation on the other side. First, Modi ji said that he is undertaking demonetisation and the finance minister says that she is undertaking monetisation. The people are asking what is undergoing monetisation, and what is being subjected to demonetisation?” he said. On Monday, the Centre had unveiled a four-year National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) worth an estimated ₹6 trillion to raise ₹88,000 crore this year by leasing infrastructure assets of central government ministries and state-run companies In 2016, as part of its demonetisation move, the Centre had withdrawn ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes as official mode of payment to fight fake currency and tackle black money in the economy. Taking a dig at the Congress leader, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said Gandhi can “never understand the real meaning” of GDP.“Rahul Gandhi spoke about issues of which he didn’t have a clear knowledge. He tried to redefine GDP in the wrong way. The UPA government followed CNP - corruption, nepotism and policy paralysis as their core agenda. They won’t be able to understand the real meaning of GDP,” he said.

02-09-2021||India||Rural economy kept steady during Covid||The rural economy, driven by the farm sector, has been steadily resilient to both the waves of the pandemic, details from India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates for the first quarter released by the government on Tuesday show.Experts have attributed the 20.1% pick-up in overall growth for the first quarter of 2021-22 to a sharp base effect, compared to 1.6% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2020-21.However, the farm sector has hardly seen a dent, as gross value added (GVA) in agriculture remained at 4.5% year on year. GDP is the widest measure of income or output. GVA, in a rough-and-ready sense, is GDP minus taxes.GDP data released on Tuesday show the agriculture sector, which employs half of all Indians, has consistently grown throughout the pandemic.Agricultural GDP, or farm growth, was 3.5% in the first quarter of 2020-21. In the second quarter, it declined marginally to stand at 3%. In the third quarter, just before the pandemic swept in, agricultural growth climbed to a record 4.5%.Agriculture’s resilience is evident in the growth rates, which never turned negative. Compared to positive growth rates in agriculture, Tuesday’s data shows that sectors such as manufacturing grew 49.6% from minus 36% a year ago.“The point is that it is easy for a sector to show sharp growth if previously growth was poor. However, agriculture grew robustly from an already high base,” said analyst Ashok Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.mple rains in the past two years are a key reason for steady growth in the farm sector, analysts say. Nearly 60% of the country’s net-sown area depends on the annual summer monsoon. Farmers are also the only direct recipients of cash transfers, helping to cushion rural incomes.The GDP per worker in agriculture is one-third of the economy-wide GDP per worker. This means productivity in agriculture is too low to lift the overall economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cash-transfers-subsidies-keep-farm-growth-steady-101630494299325.html
02-09-2021||India||Above normal rainfall likely in September: IMD||There is likely to be above normal rainfall activity at over 110% of the so-called long period average or LPA in September, and while this will reduce the current monsoon rain deficiency of 9% over the country, overall monsoon rain (June 1 to September 30) will still be in the “lower end of normal category,” the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its monsoon monthly forecast on Wednesday. The weather office also admitted that its model got the August forecast wrong.The LPA of rainfall during September, based on the data of 1961-2010, is about 170mm. IMD defines as normal for entire country rainfall of 96% to 104% of LPA, and its Wednesday forecast suggests that this year’s overall monsoon rains will be closer to the 4% deficient bound.The LPA for the entire season is 880mm.In September, according to IMD, above normal rainfall activity is likely over many parts of central India, and normal to below normal rainfall is likely over many areas of north-west, north-east and southern most parts of peninsular India.IMD forecast normal rain in August over the country as a whole at 94% to 106% of LPA, but got this wrong. August reported a 24% deficiency due to a subdued monsoon phase till around August 17. In its long-range forecast, IMD said the south-west monsoon seasonal rain (June to September) over the country as a whole is likely to be normal (96% to 104% of LPA) at about 101% of the LPA with an error of ±4%. This assessment has now been downgraded to the lower end of the normal (up to 20% deficient) category on Wednesday.IMD on Wednesday acknowledged that its multi-model ensemble forecasting system got its August rainfall prediction wrong. “Though the model partially picked up the spatial pattern of rains in August, it couldn’t pick up the magnitude of rain in August. We will examine this and endeavour to improve the output,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. The model also couldn’t capture severe rainfall deficiency over Gujarat and Odisha.Long periods of subdued rain in July and August have impacted agriculture. There is deficiency in sowing in many parts of central India, Mohapatra said.The monsoon entered a break or a partial break phase three times this season, with the longest and driest phase between June 29 and July 11. It revived over northwest India on August 19, but weakened again from August 24 onwards and started reviving gradually from August 29.According to IMD, the main reasons for the subdued monsoon in August is what is called a negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) which is normally unfavourable for monsoon; and complete absence of formation of monsoon depressions in August (normally at least two depressions form in August. There was very less typhoon activity over the West Pacific. The remnants of these typhoons move westwards normally and help in creating low pressure areas over Bay of Bengal.IOD is a phenomenon where the western Indian ocean becomes warmer than the eastern one. A positive IOD effect is associated with a better monsoon in India. Now IMD expects La Nina conditions to set in by end of monsoon season.“There will be colder sea surface temperatures across the east equatorial Pacific Ocean which improves monsoon flow over India. At the same time we have negative IOD conditions which subdues monsoon.
