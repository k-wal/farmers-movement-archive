This court will pass an appropriate order if no justification is found in the inaction of the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar... Due to the inaction of the district magistrate, unavoidable litigation is coming to this,” the court ruled on Monday.A bench comprising Acting Chief Justice (ACJ) Munishwar Nath Bhandari, and Justice Piyush Agrawal passed the order in a petition filed by Priya Kapahi, for recovering the advance money for her flat in Eco Village 4 in Greater Noida after the developer failed to give her possession of the flat.The DM allegedly did not take any action in this case for the past 2.5 years.In a separate case, the bench directed the sub-divisional magistrate of Greater Noida, Gautam Budh Nagar, to appear before the court on September 28, to explain why no action has been taken to execute an order of the Rera authority. “It seems to be a deliberate move. An explanation is to be given by the officer, and if the justification is not found to be appropriate, the court will take action against the erring officer,” observed the court.Reacting to this, the DM said, “We have informed the state government that the action in RC cases got delayed due to a delay in e-auction of properties. We will also inform the court about this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-hc-asks-gb-nagar-dm-suhas-ly-to-explain-inaction-in-rera-cases-101632767329541.html

In 27 days, the tally reached 252. Of the 252 cases, 186 patients required admission in hospitals, they said, adding the hospitalisation rate is about 73.8%.According to official figures, the number of dengue cases was 621 in 2016, 232 in 2017, 68 in 2018, 88 in 2019 and 15 in 2020.The number of cases spiked in 2021, with Ghaziabad recording the first 100 cases on September 15, and the next 100 within nine days (by September 24).“The spike in dengue cases this year is mainly due to recurrent heavy rainfall this monsoon. There is heavy waterlogging. Further, this year, we have taken into account all the cases reported by government as well as private hospitals. No case is going unreported,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer.The department is also engaging with various residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to tackle the menace and said that community engagement will help keep dengue cases in check.Officials also praised the Kaushambi RWA for taking up different measures to keep a check on dengue.“The Kaushambi RWA has emerged as a role model for other RWAs as they have put in a lot of systematic and scientific efforts to check the spread of dengue and malaria cases. Similarly, other RWAs should also come forward to do so,” Dr Gupta added.Office bearers of Kaushambi Apartments RWA (Karwa) said that they consulted the National Institute of Malaria Research and the district malaria department, and take regular steps to control the spread of infection.“We work closely with the corporation officials and get them to clean stormwater drains. We get anti-larvae products sprayed in the area weekly, besides infusing burnt motor oil in drains to check the breeding of mosquitoes. Every sixth day, we get bushes and green areas fogged with a special water-based insecticide. Inside our buildings, open spaces, lifts, and corridors we use another kind of insecticide which keeps mosquitoes and insects away for a long duration,” said VK Mittal, president of Karwa.Medical experts agree with officials that dengue and malaria cases will persist till the end of October as the monsoon will end only by the first week of the month.“Cases have shot up this year due to heavy waterlogging, a result of frequent heavy rains. Cases of dengue and malaria generally occur during September and October. So, it is vital that no stagnant water should be present in and around households. This aids the breeding of mosquitoes,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).According to official records, the district had also recorded 15 cases of malaria and 39 cases of scrub typhus by Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-records-252-dengue-cases-highest-since-2016-s-tally-of-621-101632767268440.html

The house owner, Kunwarpal, told the officials that he had rented the house to Ravi,” Mishra said. Police caught the duo red-handed from the spot, as Sushil was administering vaccines to the people and Ravi was holding the vials.Bhuvnesh Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Sector Ecotech 3 police station, said Sushil revealed during interrogation that he works as a ward boy at the urban primary health centre in Ghaziabad on contract. “At the health centre, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), Renu, had given Sushil some vials and syringes. Ravi, who is Renu’s brother-in-law, had arranged for some people to conduct the illegal vaccination drive at his rented accommodation in Greater Noida for ₹250 per dose,” Kumar said.The suspects vaccinated 20 people on Monday, and 25 people at a similar vaccination exercise on September 19 this year, police said. A case has been registered against three persons under sections 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 15 of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.“The duo was produced before a court, and sent to judicial custody on Monday. We have launched a search for the third suspect -- ANM Renu,” Kumar added.Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer (CMO), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that a door-to-door vaccination drive in the district is not in place. “I am yet to receive details of this case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-arrested-for-unauthorised-door-to-door-vaccination-drive-in-greater-noida-101632767028455.html
27-09-2021||Noida||In a first, UP’s Ghaziabad administers over 100,000 Covid vaccine doses in a day||During the sixth mega coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccination drive on Monday, Ghaziabad administered over 100,000 doses in a single day for the first time. According to the CoWIN portal, Ghaziabad was one of three Uttar Pradesh districts to administer over 100,000 doses on Monday. The district administered 107,819 doses till 8.30pm on Monday, while Lucknow and Prayagraj administered 174,340 and 115,726, respectively. During the first mega vaccination drive on August 3, the district administered 79,822 doses and during the second mega vaccination drive on August 16, the district administered 42,444 doses. It administered 67,040 doses during the third mega drive on August 27 and 69,248 doses during the fourth drive held on September 6. During the fifth mega drive on September 17, the district administered 74,635 doses. The state government had given Ghaziabad a target to administer 87,000 vaccine doses on Monday, while officials aimed to administer about 130,000 doses as they had a stock of about 180,000 doses for the sixth mega vaccination drive. “We surpassed the official target easily, but could not touch the figure of 130,000 doses we were aiming for. It was largely attributed to traffic jams on major roads due to the farmers’ protest and the Bharat Bandh call. Still, people turned up in large numbers and got themselves vaccinated. We allowed online slot booking and walk-in facilities for all age groups,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination. “The CoWIN portal was slow for about an hour from 11am to 12pm as well as for some time later in the day. This generally happens when the turnout is high. But our teams still achieved the district’s highest single-day figure ever since the first vaccination drive on January 16,” he added. The officials of the district health department said that they roped in about 800 doctors and medical staff to operate 257 Covid-19 vaccination centres (CVCs), which also included seven malls in Kaushambi, Vaishali, Indirapuram and Ghaziabad city. Malls were roped in for the first time to provide residents with the vaccination facility from 4pm to 8pm. “It was the first time we engaged seven big malls in the city and introduced evening vaccination camps, which started at 4pm and ended by 8pm. Vaccination camps were held in two malls from the morning. Malls were roped in so that people coming there with families after office hours could get themselves vaccinated with ease. This engagement with malls also boosted the vaccination coverage,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer. The Indirapuram Habitat Centre (IHC) CVC saw long queues in the morning as beneficiaries arrived in large numbers from localities like Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Khoda and Sahibabad, among others. “Since morning we had long queues of people who arrived to take the Covid-19 vaccine. Due to heavy rush, we also operated a different queue for women beneficiaries.,” said Sumit Sharma, manager (operations) at IHC. “I had come with my neighbour to get her vaccinated and we arrived at the centre at around 9.30am. However, due to heavy rush and the new token system, our turn came around 1pm. So, I had to take a whole day’s leave from my office. I think the token system and the verification and vaccination process should be simplified,” said Sumit Upadhaya, a resident of Khoda, who was at the IHC. According to CoWIN portal figures till 8.30pm on Monday, Ghaziabad district had administered a total of 2,716,164 doses till Monday, including 738,712 second doses. In Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow is leading with the administration of 3,725,630 doses in total, while Ghaziabad occupies the second spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/in-a-first-up-s-ghaziabad-administers-over-100-000-covid-vaccine-doses-in-a-day-101632766968395.html

Glitches in the CoWIN portal slowed down vaccination pace at several centres, officials said.Monday’s vaccination drive was aimed at inoculating as many people from the 45+ age category, who have not been given the first dose so far, as possible. Officials had said on Sunday that the drive will also focus on administering as many second doses as possible. “A total of 29,775 people were vaccinated at government-run CVCs on Monday. About 16,494 of them were administered the first dose and 13,281 were administered the second dose. Of these, 9,000 people were over the age of 45, with 4,000 receiving their first dose and 5,000 receiving their second dose,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.According to the door-to-door surveillance carried out by the health department from September 7 to 16, a total of 56,489 people over the age of 45 are yet to get Covid-19 vaccine in Gautam Budh Nagar, said officials. The district health department has been instructed to ensure this age group gets vaccinated.“Over 50,000 people in Gautam Budh Nagar above the age of 45 are yet to get vaccinated. While we could not cover all of them in Monday’s vaccination drive, we are sure that within a week they will be vaccinated with at least the first dose. The department’s ASHA workers are ensuring they turn up for vaccinations,” said Dr Tyagi.Meanwhile, some beneficiaries complained that vaccination did not start on time at their nearest CVC.“We reached the CVC at Gaurs International School at 10am but vaccination did not start till 12pm. A huge crowd had gathered at the CVC, and hence we left without getting vaccinated,” said Naval Kishore Singh, a resident of Greater Noida west.Officials said glitches in the CoWIN portal delayed vaccination at some CVCs. “The health officials were facing a lot of problems on the CoWIN portal as it slowed down due to heavy data entry. As a result, most vaccination centres couldn’t achieve their target for the day,” said Dr Tyagi.Chief medical officer Dr Sunil Sharma said that of the 137 CVCs, 54 were the regular ones run by the health department. “Online slot booking as well as walk-in facilities available at the 54 CVCs, while the rest had walk-in facilities. Slot booking is not required at the new CVCs, but registration on the CoWIN portal is still mandatory,” said Sharma.The nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme began on January 16 this year. Since then, Gautam Budh Nagar has administered 2,421,860 jabs, and 735,899 of the beneficiaries have received both doses of the vaccine.During the last mega vaccination drive held on September 17 too, Gautam Budh Nagar had fallen short of its target of 32,000 by managing to inoculate only 25,160 beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cowin-glitches-mar-mega-vaccination-drive-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101632766728426.html
27-09-2021||Chandigarh||Bharat Bandh: ₹15 lakh loss estimated as buses remain stabled in Ludhiana||The hustle and bustle, which is typical at the local bus stand, was conspicuous by its absence on Monday as it wore a deserted look and buses stood inert in response to the farmer unions’ call for a Bharat Bandh in protest of the passage of the three farm laws.  Around 1,000 government and private buses ferry passengers from the Ludhiana bus stand daily. As many as 108 Punjab Roadways buses and Punbus’ run from the Ludhiana bus stand daily, while 100 PRTC buses ferry passengers from the Ludhiana bus depot daily. Tarsem Singh, who is in-charge of the Ludhiana bus stand, said a loss of ₹15 lakh would be incurred per day. “The strike is expected to be lifted around 4pm, but most buses would remain off the road, which will cause a loss of ₹15 lakh to the Ludhiana depot,” said Singh.Passengers stranded A few passengers, who were unaware of the general strike called by the farmers to mark one year of the passage of the contentious laws, were left high and dry, without a means of commuting. Among those stranded at the bus stand was 22-year-old Rajjak of Kolkata. “We were travelling to Palampur but were stranded in Ludhiana. There is no clarity, whether the buses will ply in the evening. Our employer has been calling us repeatedly,” Rajjak said. Dinesh Kumar Sahni of Bihar had reached Ludhiana bus stand at 11pm on Sunday to board a bus to Sri Macchiwara Sahib, to meet his daughter but was stuck at the depot. To prevent any law and order situation, security was beefed up around the local bus stand and the roads leading to it were barricaded early in the morning. While most shops remained closed, a few food joints near and at the bus stand remained open, much to the relief of stranded passengers. Roadways staff to strike from Oct 11 to 13 Hundreds of Punjab Roadways and PRTC contractual employees joined the protesting farmers near MBD Mall, Ludhiana. The union leaders accused central government of being unjustice and demanded immediate withdrawal of the three controversial farm laws.The leaders also demanded immediate regularisation of Punjab Roadways and PRTC contractual staffers. “We will hold a statewide strike from October 11 to October 13 . We have been struggling to get regularised for a long time and we will gherao the house of newly appointed Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi”, said Balkar Singh, a PRTC union leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bharat-bandh-15-lakh-loss-estimated-as-buses-remain-stabled-in-ludhiana-101632766609798.html
27-09-2021||Pune||Police cite crater for road rage and murder in Theur||PUNE: A flare up caused by a crater in the road led to the murder of a man and arrest of the other for it in Theur area of Pune on Friday. The Pune police arrested a 23-year-old man for allegedly beating a bike rider to death after the two-wheeler brushed past the tempo that the accused was driving. The incident happened around 7:10pm on Friday along Theur road in Haveli. The deceased was identified as Sundar Shiva Pawar, a resident of Theur. The arrested was identified as Aditya Sudhir Dharashivarkar (23), a resident of Kamdhenu Estate, Mantri Market in Hadapsar. “The crater in the road is so deep that the tempo truck oscillated a little and touched the bike rider, Pawar. He got enraged and came towards the driver side of the tempo and started hurling abuses and tried to hit the driver, Dharashivarkar. He has a fracture in both his right limbs and could not move. He told us that in order to retaliate to the blows that Pawar was raining on him, he kicked him and it landed on his chest and knocked him unconscious,” said assistant police inspector SR Chiwadshetty of Loni Kalbhor police station who is investigating the case. A complaint in the matter was lodged by Vitthal Pawar (35) a resident of Theur area of Haveli, Pune. The deceased man was a labourer and the accused had recently recovered from another accident. The investigator believes that it was the condition of the road that caused the trigger. “The road is in such a bad condition that using it is a task. The two-wheeler rider did not get hurt but he started abusing the tempo driver who could not move his limbs much. He explained that the tempo was oscillating from left to right due to the potholes and that is why it touched the rider,” said API Chiwadshetty. The truck driver has also registered a complaint and a non-cognisable case was registered against the deceased man for assaulting him. A case under Section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Loni Kalbhor police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/police-cite-crater-for-road-rage-and-murder-in-theur-101632766608511.html

27-09-2021||Delhi||Riots: Delhi HC dismisses bail plea of accused in head constable’s murder||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Monday dismissed the bail application of an accused in the murder of head constable Rattan Lal during the northeast Delhi riots, saying that the riots did not take place in a spur of the moment and the conduct of the protesters showed that it was a calculated attempt to dislocate the functioning of the government as also to disrupt the normal life of the people in the city.The court also said that the systematic disconnection and destruction of the CCTV cameras also confirms the existence of a pre-planned and pre-meditated conspiracy to disturb law and order in the city.“This is also evident from the fact that innumerable rioters ruthlessly descended with sticks, dandas, bats etc. upon a hopelessly outnumbered cohort of police officials,” the judge said in a 19-page order.Justice Subramonium Prasad, while dismissing the bail application of Mohammad Ibrahim, said that even though he cannot be seen at the scene of crime, he clearly was a part of the mob for the sole reason that he had consciously travelled 1.6 km away from his neighbourhood with a sword which could only be used to incite violence and inflict damage.The court said personal liberty in a democratic polity is important, but it is to be categorically noted that individual liberty cannot be misused in a manner that threatens the very fabric of civilised society by attempting to destabilise it and cause hurt to other persons.“In light of this, the footage of the petitioner with the sword is quite egregious, and is therefore sufficient to keep the petitioner in custody…In view of the facts and circumstances of the cases, without commenting on the merits of the matter, this court is of the opinion that the petitioner (Mohammad Ibrahim) is not to be granted bail,” the court said.It said that Ibrahim has been clearly identified on multiple CCTV footages, carrying a sword and instigating the crowd and the clinching evidence that tilts this court towards prolonging his incarceration is that the weapon which is being carried by him is capable of causing grievous injuries and/or death, and is prima facie a dangerous weapon.Meanwhile, Justice Prasad granted bail to Mohammad Saleem Khan in the same case, noting that there are no video recordings or audio recordings placed before him to verify the contention that he was embroiled in disseminating hate speech.“This court is of the opinion that this footage in itself is not sufficient to prolong the incarceration of the petitioner,” the court said.Communal riots had broken out in north east Delhi claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/riotsdelhi-hc-dismisses-bail-plea-of-accused-in-head-constable-s-murder-101632766129614.html

The website will be available in nine languages including international languages French, Spanish, Japanese, besides Indian regional languages. The website will compose information on 350 destinations that are categorized as per themes—beach, forts, hill station, etc.Pawar, who speaking at an event ‘Tourism for Inclusive Growth’ on the occasion of world tourism day, remarked even the three parties have not decided to enter an alliance for local body polls. “The concept of tourism for inclusive development put forth on the world tourism day is not for the leaders or activists of any political party. Ahead of the upcoming local bodies polls, those engaging in political tourism from one party to another party will not get any opportunities. Chief minister, revenue minister [Balasaheb Thorat] and I will ensure this without any doubt,” said Pawar while speaking at the event. Speaking on the occasion, Thackeray said while the tourism department has been hit hardest by the Covid-19, it has drafted the policies to develop the sector in post-Covid. “It created employment opportunities for many. Unfortunately, the tourism department was neglected before this but now we will focus on it in the future,” said Thackeray. He further said that a meeting of the state cabinet will be held in the Deccan Odyssey train, a special luxury train between Mumbai and Pune, to promote it. Aaditya Thackeray, state tourism minister, said, “Each district in Maharashtra has its unique characteristics. In the next few years, we will show Maharashtra to the world in the true sense.” He added that post-pandemic, the state will show what Maharashtra truly is, in terms of what it can offer through tourism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-to-hold-meeting-in-deccan-odyssey-train-101632765888627.html

27-09-2021||Mumbai||After fiasco, Maharashtra announces recruitment exams on October 24 and 31||Three days after the fiasco, the Maharashtra government has declared a fresh schedule for recruitment exams to fill up over 6,000 vacant posts in the state health department. The exams to fill up vacant positions in the Class C category will now be conducted on October 24 and for the Class D category it will be held on October 31, state health minister Rajesh Tope announced on Monday.The health minister held a review meeting with the senior officials after which fresh dates were declared.The state government was in an embarrassing situation when it postponed the recruitment exams at the eleventh hour. It had blamed an outsourced firm — Nyasa Communication Private Limited (NCPL) — for the fiasco.Earlier, the exams were scheduled on September 25 and 26 but owing to lack of preparations the health minister had to declare postponement of examination on late Friday evening, which also led to aggrieved reactions.Nearly 800,000 applicants have enrolled for the recruitment examinations for filling up 6,205 vacant posts for Class C and D categories. The vacant posts under Class C category comprise staff nurses, auxiliary nursing midwives, pharmacists, laboratory technicians, X-Ray technicians, laboratory assistants and others while Class D category posts include ward boys, sweepers and other supporting staff.“We have decided to hold examinations for Class C category positions on October 24 and for Class D category positions on October 31 in a meeting held to discuss preparations and decide the next schedule. Both the dates have been chosen to avoid any risk as they are Sundays and availability of schools won’t be a problem,” Tope told reporters in Jalna on Monday.“We have directed the firm to prepare a dashboard, made available exam centre wise students list and permissions from the schools that are going to be used as exam centres. We have also made it mandatory to provide hall tickets to the students nine days in advance,” he added.NCPL is part of a list of empanelled firms prepared by the state information technology (IT) department. As per the procedure, the departments will have to select the firms from the empanelled list of firms for holding recruitment examinations.On taking action against the firm, the health minister said that the action will be decided by the IT department as they have empanelled it and the role of the health department is limited to setting up exam papers.He assured to hold the examinations transparently and asked students to approach the police if someone offers any help through illegitimate means against money.An audio clip has gone viral in which two people can be heard making various claims related to recruitment exams to be conducted in Amravati.The health minister said they don’t know the authenticity of the audio clip and have asked the police to verify. “I am not aware of the authenticity of the audio clip and the police will verify the same. I have personally spoken to Dr Arti Singh, Amravati police commissioner in this regard and will also write to the home minister Dilip Walse Patil to ensure action is taken against the offenders,” he said in response to a question.The exercise for filling up the vacant positions was started as part of the state’s preparations for the potential third wave that may hit by December or January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-fiasco-maharashtra-announces-recruitment-exams-on-october-24-and-31-101632765770554.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi court imposes ₹5,000 cost on police for seeking adjournment in riots case||New Delhi: A Delhi court has imposed a cost of ₹5000 on the city police for seeking adjournment in a case of northeast Delhi riots and directed an enquiry to decide the responsible officer from whose salary the money was to be deducted.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg, on September 25, fined the police after it failed to comply with an order on April 12 by which the court had directed the investigating officer (IO) to supply a copy of the charge sheet to one of the accused Komal Mishra.The IO submitted before the court that the document has not been supplied till date as he was not aware of the order and sought adjournment to supply it.This irked the court which went to note that special public prosecutors (SPPs), representing the police, and IOs do not appear in the riots cases on the dates fixed and when they appear, after “prodding of senior officers” by the court, they don’t read the files and come.It said that the SPPs and the IOs seek adjournment in a “very casual manner” for compliance of directions passed by the court on the dates on which they had not appeared.“The aforesaid conduct of the police as well as SPPs has already been brought to the notice of senior police officers including SHOs, ACPs, DCP (NE) and Commissioner of Police, Delhi, however, they have failed to ensure that such incidents do not take place anymore,” it noted.The judge said that since the burden of this cost would fall on the public exchequer, hence an enquiry should be conducted within four weeks to fix accountability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-imposes-5-000-cost-on-police-for-seeking-adjournment-in-riots-case-101632765769130.html

I firmly and unequivocally clarify that I hold all judicial institutions in the highest esteem and am also duty-bound to uphold the majesty of the judiciary. I have not told the officers or even remotely intended to convey any message to disregard courts or disrespect court orders as reported. My words have been published out of context,” Deb wrote on his Facebook on Monday.In the meantime, an RTI activist, Saket Gokhale, wrote to advocate general of Tripura High Court Siddhartha Shankar Dey and requested court proceedings against Deb for his comments.Gokhale has joined Trinamool Congress recently.In the letter, he said that no person, including the chief minister of a state, is above law, and the order of the judiciary applies to all.“Your consent is, therefore, sought in this matter to enable the undersigned to initiate proceedings for criminal contempt of court against Sh. Biplab Kumar Deb for the aforementioned comments about the judiciary,” Gokhale wrote in his letter.No petition was apparently known to have been filed in the High Court. However, no comment from the advocate general was made available on the issue.Deb, while speaking at a biennial conference of the Civil Service Officers’ Association on Saturday, said that the officers should work for people without thinking about the contempt of court.His comments went viral on social media, especially after Trinamool Congress general secretary Abhishek Banerjee tagged a video clip of Deb’s speech in his tweet on Sunday.In the video, the CM was seen saying, “Contempt of court is said in such a way as if a tiger is sitting. I am the tiger. The power lies with the person who runs the government. It means that all power lies with the people. We are a ‘by the peoples’ government and not ‘by the court ‘ government.”He made this comment while speaking on the issue of holding back promotions of public servants following a pending court matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/i-hold-judiciary-in-highest-esteem-tripura-cm-after-video-on-contempt-of-court-goes-viral-101632765652263.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||Income tax raids at four major steel rolling mills, unaccounted income of ₹300 crore detected||The investigation wings of the income tax department raided premises of four major steel rolling mills based in Jalna, carried out searches at 32 premises linked to them and detected an unaccounted income of nearly ₹300 crore. The tax agency on Monday without naming the business group said that it carried out a search and seizure operation on a group of four major steel rolling mills based in Jalna, Maharashtra. These companies are engaged in the business of manufacturing steel TMT bars and billets mostly using steel scrap as raw material. The operation that started on September 23 was conducted in more than 32 premises across Jalna, Aurangabad, Pune, Mumbai and Kolkata. “During the operation, many incriminating documents, loose sheets and other digital evidence were found and seized. This evidence indicates the involvement of the companies in large scale unaccounted financial transactions made outside the regular books of accounts, including inflation of purchases using entry providers, unaccounted cash expenses and investments, etc,” the I-T department said in a statement released on Monday. It added that the evidence found also indicate the laundering of a substantial amount of unaccounted income earned by the companies in the guise of share premium and unsecured loans using shell companies. Evidence for unaccounted purchases over ₹200 crore has been found. A huge quantity of unaccounted stock was also found in the factory premises of the companies. The tax officials have also unearthed 12 bank lockers during the search operation. Unaccounted cash of more than ₹2.10 crore and jewellery amounting to ₹1.07 crore have been seized from different premises. “Evidence detected so far, indicates that, unaccounted income is likely to exceed ₹300 crore and the four companies have already disclosed additional income to the extent of ₹71 crore consequent to the search,” stated Surabhi Ahluwalia, commissioner of income tax (Media & Technical Policy) and official spokesperson, Central Board for Direct Taxes, in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/income-tax-raids-at-four-major-steel-rolling-mills-unaccounted-income-of-300-crore-detected-101632765648218.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||Political parties, farmers stage protest across Maharashtra, demand scrapping of farm laws||Various farmers and workers organisations in the state participated in Bharat Bandh responding to the call given by Samyukt Kisan Morcha to condemn the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government’s ‘anti-farmer policies’ and to push for the demand of scrapping the ‘black’ farm laws. Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) actively participated in the protest, while Shiv Sena announced its support.The protests were held in many districts, while in some cities, the protesters resorted to road blockades as part of their agitation. All India Kisan Sabha and other farmers organisations held protests in Solapur, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Thane, Palghar and parts of western, northern Maharashtra and Vidarbha. Congress and NCP leaders participated in the agitations in various districts. Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole led a bike rally in Akola, while its Mumbai unit staged a protest at Sion Circle.Mumbai Youth Congress led by Zeeshan Siddique held a tractor rally at Bandra. NCP’s state unit chief Jayant Patil, state minority welfare minister Nawab Malik participated in the protest rallies in Aurangabad and Mumbai.Ashok Dhawale, president of All India Kisan Sabha said that the protests were held in at least 30 districts of the state. “Not only farmers but students, labourers, workers, politicians supported and participated in the bandh protest in the state. Leaders from all parties had actively participated. Sentiments of the people from all walks of life are strong against the central government. We gave memorandums to district collectors and tehsildars at district and tehsil levels about our demands.”Nawab Malik said, “NCP has actively supported the bandh by participating in the protest in all the districts. We have supported the demand of scrapping the laws. The Modi government is acting adamant on the farmers’ demand.”Patole said that the Modi regime has left all the classes of the society in the lurch. “The policies of the central government are not only against the farmers but also the workers, labourers, poor and the unemployed. Barring a couple of industrialists, the entire country is suffering because of the wrong policies of the government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/political-parties-farmers-stage-protest-across-maharashtra-demand-scrapping-of-farm-laws-101632765591240.html
27-09-2021||Pune||Maha-Metro awaits court order to resume work at Kamgar Putala||PUNE: With a few Kamgar Putala slum dwellers having filed a plea in the Bombay high court and gotten a stay on their shifting in August this year, citing Covid-19 as the reason, the Maharashtra Metro Railway Corporation Limited (Maha-Metro) has stopped work on the civil court (Shivajinagar) multimodal metro hub and is awaiting the court’s permission to resume work. The next court hearing is scheduled in the month of December.The Kamgar Putala slum spans around 6 acre near the civil district court along the Mutha river, and is among the land parcels required for the elevated metro station along the Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor and the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s (PMRDA’s) Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar metro corridor. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) too is considering a development plan (DP) road in the area.Atul Gadgil, director (works) of Maha-Metro, said, “The corporation has shifted around 70% Kamgar Putala slum dwellers with only 30% remaining to be shifted. A few of them have filed cases in the Bombay high court and taken a stay order on the shifting. They have cited Covid-19 as the reason to postpone shifting. In August, the court has given a stay order on shifting the slum dwellers.”“The slum dwellers are ready to rehabilitate however they want to postpone the shifting due to the Covid-19 situation. We are keeping tabs on a possible third wave and will wait till December as the hearing is also scheduled at that time. We will then request the court to give permission to shift the remaining slum dwellers.”The PMC plans to rehabilitate the slum dwellers in Vimannagar and Shinde wasti at Mundhwa. The corporation will provide 25 square metre flats to the slum dwellers in addition to two flats that have a ground-plus-one structure with people already living there.Of the total 1,264 slum dwellers, 923 are eligible for accommodation based on their residential proof. Maha-Metro wants the Kamgar Putala land to develop the civil court (Shivajinagar) multimodal metro hub, and has handed over around Rs40 crore to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) for rehabilitation of the slum dwellers. The work has reached the last stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mahametro-awaits-court-order-to-resume-work-at-kamgar-putala-101632765590049.html
27-09-2021||Gurugram||Zero fatalities at Khandsa Chowk since FOB was opened in July 2020||Construction of a pedestrian bridge has brought down the road fatalities to zero at Khandsa Chowk, earlier classified as a black spot with 22 road fatalities reported between 2016 and 2019, according to the Haryana Vision Zero (HVZ) data.A foot overbridge (FOB) or pedestrian bridge was opened in July 2020 at the spot, which was considered the most dangerous for pedestrians on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway due to the high number of fatalities. The Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway runs right across Khandsa village, dividing it into two halves.According to the HVZ data, 156 accidents took place at the spot between 2016 and 2019 that led to 22 deaths, with 7, 5, 7 and 3 fatalities recorded annually from 2016. In 2020 and 2021 so far, there have been no fatalities, even taking into account January to June 2020, which includes a nationwide lockdown imposed to curtail the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Any 500-metre stretch where more than five fatalities are recorded in a three-year period is termed a black spot.To the left of the expressway, in the direction to Jaipur, residential clusters, schools, banks, ATMs, dispensaries, shops, and grocery stores are located, while on the other side, a smaller section of private offices, warehouses, automobile service centres, industries and a marble market are located.A significant portion of the workforce for the companies comes from the village — which has over 10,000 inhabitants — due to which there is a constant need for residents to cross from one end to the other.According to the village residents, the situation worsened since 2008 as the expressway was expanded to add two additional lanes to the main carriageway. In the absence of any amenity, hundreds of residents crossed the highway amid fast-moving traffic between the gaps in the iron fencing.“Nobody wants to cross the road against vehicles coming at around 100 kilometres per hour. We simply had no other choice but to put our lives in danger and cross the stretch. A few years ago, I had lost two of my friends as they were hit by a speeding truck at night while crossing to the other side,” Vipin Singh, a resident of Khandsa, said.Until 2019, the closest FOB or crossing for Khandsa residents was at either Hero Honda Chowk or Narsinghpur, each of which is located nearly two kilometres away on either side.“Earlier, even if we had a two-hour or three-hour break during work, we would prefer to stay on this side of the highway instead of returning home. Nobody wanted to risk their lives against fast-moving traffic,” Sunil Kumar, who works in the marble market, said.Villagers said that since the construction of the FOB, their work opportunities have also increased.“Besides providing connectivity from one end of the village to the other, a larger number of villagers now get job opportunities in the area. Most private companies earlier preferred hiring residents from Behrampur village, located behind the industrial area, as they didn’t have to cross the highway and could reach offices on time,” Mohit Bharadwaj, a Khandsa resident, said. Following a road safety analysis by HVZ in early 2019, which was shared in a district road safety meeting, the district administration directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to construct a FOB, at a cost of ₹3 crore, and the construction started in September 2019.A district road safety meeting is usually attended by officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority GMDA, NHAI, municipal corporation, public works department, Gurugram police, district administration, transport authority, and road safety experts, to identify problems across Gurugram roads and accordingly implement changes.“The idea behind holding district road safety meetings is to analyse and then implement changes that can make road infrastructure better or safer. Khandsa FOB is one of the major successes arising from it. We will aim to replicate this model across the city,” Dr Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said.Sarika Panda Bhatt, the project director of HVZ, said, “If placed at the ideal locations, FOBs can have a significant impact on road safety. It not only provides pedestrians and cyclists with safe passage but also brings down accidents and improves traffic management. The Khandsa FOB is the best example of the difference such a structure can make on ground.”Sewa Ram, an associate professor and urban transport systems design expert with the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi, said that a FOB can be successful if placed correctly.“The main factor which makes the Khandsa FOB a success is its location. It not only provides pedestrians and cyclists the ability to cross from one side of the highway to the other but it is also located at the exact point at which they used to cross before. Other FOBs in Gurugram are located in far-off distances and as a result, nobody uses them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/zero-fatalities-at-khandsa-chowk-since-fob-was-opened-in-july-2020-101632765588692.html
27-09-2021||Gurugram||Dengue fear: Clear stagnant water, increase fogging, say residents||Amid rising dengue cases, residents from different localities in the city have demanded increased fogging to prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases. Over the past two days, nine new cases of dengue have been reported in Gurugram, taking the tally to 32 this year. Residents said that fogging is being done in their respective localities only after the issue is raised on social media or complaints are filed separately. Mahendra Tiwari, a member of the managing body of Sagar Kunj group housing society in Sector 9A, said that since the starting of monsoon, water has been stagnating around their society that is leading to more chances of breeding of mosquitoes. “Both the front and back sides of our society have stagnant water, which not just stinks but is also a place for mosquitoes to breed. I have complained to the authorities in person, but no action is taken until the matter is raised on social media. Today (Monday), fogging was done in my locality only after I wrote to the authorities on social media,” Tiwari said. MD Goel, a resident of Khushboo Apartments in Sector 9A, expressed similar concerns and said fogging has not been done regularly. “Last year and even this year, during high Covid-19 cases, fogging was done a few times, but since July, fogging has not been done in our locality. Stagnant water is also not cleared out, which keeps accumulating with every spell of rain,” he said. Residents from newer sectors of the city said they have also raised the issue of water stagnating on green belts and roads with authorities several times, through complaint letters, but there has been no action on the ground. Praveen Malik, the vice-president of United Association of New Gurugram, a body of 40 housing societies from sector 77 to 90, said, “Fogging in housing societies here is being done by the RWAs or developers, but in areas outside the societies, nothing has been done this year. Officials, last week, said that they are acquiring machines on a temporary basis, but no action is visible on ground. The cases of dengue are already rising, and we are still witnessing rain, it is high time that authorities start taking action.” Meanwhile, officials from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram said that intensive fogging was carried out before the monsoon season. “Prior to the monsoon season, we had carried out an intensive anti-vector operations, such as fogging, introduction of gambusia fishes in water bodies, simultaneously with sanitising operations during the second Covid-19 wave. Since then, we only carry out fogging operations in areas where we receive complaints from residents, and for other parts of the city, it is done under the supervision of the health department,” a senior MCG official privy to the matter said.The official said that there are over 110 workers, from the MCG and health department, who are executing anti-larvae operations in the city. Gurugram, this year, has reported 32 cases of dengue with officials from the health department stating that more cases are likely to be reported. However the situation is not alarming yet. Last year, Gurugram had reported 52 cases of dengue. Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “We are seeing a rise in dengue cases, and more are likely to be reported over the next few weeks, but a higher positivity rate is not a problem. So far, we have not witnessed any fatalities, so the situation is still under control. But, due to prolonged monsoon, higher cases are likely this season.” At the Civil Hospital in Sector 10, doctors said that around 50% patients in the internal medicine department’s out-patient ward are reporting fever, influenza or similar complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dengue-fear-clear-stagnant-water-increase-fogging-say-residents-101632765469832.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||Over 9,600 applications received for financial aid to Covid-19 victims: Kailash Gahlot||New Delhi:The Delhi government has so far received 9,643 applications seeking ex-gratia relief under the “Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Parivar Arthik Sahayata Yojna” out of which compensation was disbursed in 6,019 cases, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said on Monday.The financial assistance scheme for Covid-19 deaths was notified on June 23 this year, after the second wave of the pandemic took a heavy toll in Delhi. It covers a one-time assistance of ₹50,000 for each Covid-19 death in the family and a monthly assistance of ₹2,500 for families that lost their primary breadwinner and for children orphaned by the viral disease.Gahlot held a review meeting of the scheme on Monday, during which he ordered deploying senior officers on rotation at the government’s call centre located in Noida to handle queries from people about the programmes and assist potential applicants. The Delhi High Court also has been reviewing the scheme on a regular basis and has sought an action taken report from the Delhi government on the same in its hearing scheduled next month. “A list of 25,709 residents of Delhi who died of Covid-19 has been shared by the health department to all the 11 districts of the city. They have been segregated district wise by the revenue department. Till date, around 9,643 applications have been received for grant of the ex-gratia relief, of which 6,995 applications have been approved...and money has been disbursed in 6,019 cases,” said Gahlot. “We are taking utmost care to ensure the grieving families aren’t troubled. Officials have been specifically directed to handle all cases with sensitivity. The number of applications has started to gradually increase as teams of all the SDMs are now physically visiting the homes of each of the affected families. We are aiming to finish all the home visits by the end of this week,” the minister said. Records showed that till Sunday, more than 10,000 families from the list provided by the state health department were visited by officials from the SDMs’ offices.On September 21, the Delhi government waived off the need to submit a surviving member certificate (SMC) to claim financial assistance in case of the death of a spouse due to Covid-19. However, SMC is still needed in all other cases. In cases where the deceased was a single parent, the surviving children are entitled to the ex-gratia, which is to be equally distributed among all children. Similarly if the deceased is unmarried or is a minor son/daughter, the father or mother of the deceased will get relief under the scheme subject to their name appearing in the SMC, the government said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-9-600-applications-received-for-financial-aid-to-covid-19-victims-kailash-gahlot-101632765408780.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC preparing list of unvaccinated HCWs in Mumbai||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is preparing a list of 130,000 healthcare workers (HCWs), who haven’t been vaccinated yet. The civic body claims 273,249 HCWs registered themselves on the centralised Co-Win portal, but 48% of them are yet to get jabbed. As HCWs work in direct contact with Covid-19 patients, they are vulnerable to contracting the infection. On January 16, when the mass immunisation programme was launched across India, HCWs were the first ones to get the jab. The move will also help them clear duplicate data and get the number of unvaccinated HCWs, said officials. The civic body also plans to personally contact and convince HCWs to get immunised. “We are preparing a list of HCWs who haven’t taken the jabs. We will contact them to find out the reason for shying away from vaccination. HCWs, who are qualified for vaccination, will be encouraged to get vaccinated,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.However, Kakani claims the total number of registered HCWs may be inflated due to duplication. “Once, we have the data ready, we will be able to clear the names from multiple registrations which may then give an idea of unvaccinated HCWs,” he added.When HT contacted major civic hospitals, many shared that almost 90% of their HCWs have been vaccinated. “We sensitised our staff on the need to get vaccinated. We have even adjusted their working days and duty hours to facilitate the process. Most HCWs in our hospital have been vaccinated,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair hospital.The BMC has administered over 10,000,000 Covid-19 vaccines in the state, followed by Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-preparing-list-of-unvaccinated-hcws-in-mumbai-101632765348306.html
27-09-2021||Pune||Sena sets focus on Pune ahead of civic polls||PUNE: The Shiv Sena seems to have included the upcoming Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) polls on its priority list as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that rules the civic body poses a major challenge ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls in Mumbai. Since the past few months, Sena leader and party’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut has been visiting the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad cities regularly and appealing to workers to work hard for the upcoming polls, likely to be held in February next year. On Sunday, Sena turned Raut’s visit to Pune city into a major event. Raut said it will be good move if the alliance of three parties (Sena, NCP and Congress) fights civic polls together, however, even if it does not work out, Sena will be prepared to fight polls. After Raut’s visit on Sunday, Sena leader and cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray will be visiting Pune on Tuesday. Thackeray will be visiting Pune Municipal Corporation where he is scheduled to meet municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar along with elected members of the party to discuss civic issues. It is the first time that a member from Thackeray family will meet Pune municipal commissioner to discuss issues related to the city. During the past few years, Sena had largely ignored Pune as it could not manage a better tally in the civic polls. In the house of 164 members, BJP currently rules PMC with 99 corporators while NCP has 42, Congress 10, Sena 10 and MNS 2. While Sena does not have any representative from the city in the state assembly or in the parliament, it has an MP from Maval which also covers Pimpri-Chinchwad. After returning to power in Maharashtra as a part of Maha Vikas Aghadhi, Sena has shown keen interest in Pune. While the Congress has shown reluctance to strike an alliance for local body polls, NCP and Sena are likely to come together in Pune. Congress leaders said the party might contest the elections solo considering that alliance may not help them get adequate seats.

27-09-2021||Delhi||Plea seeks permission to switch to Covaxin for second dose, HC asks Centre response||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Monday sought the Centre’s response on a plea by a cancer patient seeking permission to take Covaxin as the second vaccine dose, as advised by his doctor, instead of Covishield, which was administered to him as the first dose.Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and asked the authorities to file a response to the petition while considering it as a case of special need.“He is a cancer patient and has special needs. Experts should also consider this,” the court said while listing the matter for further hearing on October 28.Central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia accepted the notice on behalf of the ministry.Petitioner Madhur Mittal said in September last year, he was diagnosed with cancer (stage four renal cell carcinoma) and was advised for urgent operation for removal of infected organs, that is, kidney, and lymph nodes, and in October 2020, he was operated on and the infected organs were removed.Advocate Nitesh Jain, representing the petitioner, said on March 13 this year, he got his first dose of Covishield vaccine and soon after, he developed a severe reaction and had to be hospitalised for four days.The plea said it has been advised to the petitioner to get himself checked from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre New York, USA, for cancer treatment and he approached the institution for an appointment.The petition, filed through advocate Sanjay S Chhabra, said Mittal wanted to get himself vaccinated with both the doses of Covid-19 vaccination, and, as per the doctor’s advice and prior complications of Covidshield vaccine, he wanted Covaxin as the second dose.The plea said when the man tried to book a slot for Covaxin as the second dose on the COWIN website, he was unable to do so as the application only books slots in the same category of the vaccine.“As per the government advisory, respondent has advised the public at large to take both the Covid-19 vaccine doses of the same company, but there are also many cases, where they are mixing Covid-19 vaccines for better results. There is no other recognised way for the petitioner to get Covaxin as the second dose, hence the petitioner is filing the present writ petition,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plea-seeks-permission-to-switch-to-covaxin-for-second-dose-hc-asks-centre-response-101632765109558.html
27-09-2021||Lucknow||Yogi ministry expansion shows BJP intent on grooming homegrown leadership||The expansion of the Yogi Adityanath ministry on Sunday showed that the BJP is intent on creating its own homegrown leadership among the marginalised castes such as the most backward of the Other Backward Castes (OBCs) and Dalits.The BJP, despite sealing a pre-poll pact with Nishad party and making its leader Sanjay Nishad an MLC, preferred to appoint its own leader Sangeeta Balwant Bind, a 41-year-old woman politician from riverine community, as a minister of state. She is a postgraduate lawmaker from Ghazipur in eastern UP. “I was never hankering after ministership. I will raise the voice of the marginalised classes in the Upper House and I thank the BJP for nominating me,” said Sanjay Nishad in his first reaction after the swearing-in of the seven ministers in UP. This isn’t the first occasion when the BJP indicated its desire to create its own homegrown leadership among various castes, despite the party sealing alliances ahead of the 2022 UP polls with two OBC-based smaller parties, and indicating the desire to ink pre-poll pacts with more. Its current pre-poll allies include Apna Dal, largely considered to be a party of Kurmis (OBCs) and the Nishad party, which wields influence among community of boatmen and fishermen. In July, while appointing Apna Dal leader Anupriya Patel as a minister of state in the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, the BJP also appointed its own Lok Sabha MP from Maharajganj Pankaj Choudhary, who too is an OBC (Kurmi), as Union minister. “To balance Anupriya, the BJP also appointed its own Kurmi MP Pankaj Choudhary in the Union ministry and a similar template was followed in the expansion of the Yogi Adityanath government,” a party leader said.Apart from preferring its own leader in the UP ministry, the BJP also appointed its lawmaker from Baheri, Bareilly, Chhattrapal Gangwar, an Kurmi (OBC). While this was also seen as an attempt to politically balance the exit of party veteran and Bareilly MP Santosh Gangwar, from union government, the BJP leaders said the basic idea is to ensure that the party develops its own leadership among castes where it has no or marginal representation. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, too, belongs to the Kurmi subcaste. In 2019, after its ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, an OBC belonging to Rajbhar subcaste which wields significant influence in several east UP assembly segments, fell out with the BJP, the ruling party promptly promoted Anil Rajbhar, making him a cabinet minister of the backward classes welfare department which Om Prakash handled prior to his exit. “The BJP still doesn’t have a Rajbhar community leader, who has the same appeal as Om Prakash among his community. But there is a visible effort to create our own leadership among castes where we don’t have it,” a BJP leader said. As for the induction of former Congress leader Jitin Prasada as cabinet minister into the Yogi ministry, a BJP leader said, though the party has several Brahmin leaders, Prasada, too, is part of the BJP. Jitin was made a minister five months after quitting the Congress. Regional balanceAfter Sunday’s expansion, the strength of the Yogi ministry is now 60. These ministers now represent 41 of the 75 districts and offer a diverse caste bouquet. Lucknow, the state capital and Lok Sabha constituency of defence minister Rajnath Singh now has the maximum six ministers. They include deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon (Gopal), Mahendra Singh, Brijesh Pathak, Swati Singh and Mohsin Raza. While Dinesh Sharma, Mahendra Singh and Mohsin Raza are MLCs, the remaining are lawmakers from Lucknow assembly segments. Prayagraj accounts for three ministers – deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya (MLC), Sidharth Nath Singh and Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’. Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too has three ministers – Anil Rajbhar, Neelkanth Tiwari and Ravindra Jaiswal. Sidharthnagar has two ministers — Satish Dwivedi and Jai Pratap Singh. After Jitin Prasada’s appointment as cabinet minister, Shahjahanpur now has two ministers – the other being party veteran Suresh Khanna. Prasada met Khanna over breakfast at the latter’s Kalidas Marg residence on Monday. Prasada too has reportedly been allotted a bungalow on Kalidas Marg by the estate department. Fatehpur has Jai Kumar Jacky (Apna Dal) and Ranvendra Pratap Singh as ministers while Mathura too has two ministers – Chaudhary Laxmi Narain and Srikant Sharma. Kanpur too has two ministers – Satish Mahana and Neelima Katiyar. The other districts that have representation in the Yogi ministry include Gorakhpur, Gonda, Kushinagar, Lalitpur, Chitrakoot, Jaunpur, Ballia, Pratapgarh, Bahraich, Mirzapur, Mau, Amethi, Balrampur, Moradabad, Bijnor, Agra, Meerut, Aligarh, Auraiya, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Muzaffarnagar, Mainpuri, Sambhal, Rampur, Badaun, Saharanpur, Sonbhadra and Ghazipur.Caste compositionThe Yogi council of ministers now has 24 cabinet ministers, nine ministers of state (independent charge) and 27 ministers of state. Of these, there are 27 upper castes, 23 OBCs, 8 scheduled castes, one scheduled tribe and one Muslim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-ministry-expansion-shows-bjp-intent-on-grooming-homegrown-leadership-101632765108305.html
27-09-2021||Lucknow||Narendra Giri death: CBI probe continues, team records statements||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team continued with its probe into the death of Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) chief Mahant Narendra Giri at Baghambari Gaddi Math here for the third consecutive day on Sunday.Accompanied by Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) members, the CBI team reached the Math in the morning and yet again recreated the circumstances under which Mahant’s body was found hanging from the ceiling fan hook on September 20. The team later hanged 85 kilogram of weight with a nylon rope from the ceiling fan and asked the disciples to push open the door of the room where Mahant Narendra Giri’s body was found hanging. Another team of CBI officials recorded statements of disciples, sewadaars (servitors) and others who were at the Math at the time of the incident.The CBI officials are also matching the handwriting of Mahant Narendra Giri in the suicide note with his signature available in other documents to establish the authenticity of the purported suicide note.Meanwhile, it has come to fore that all 16 CCTV cameras installed at Baghambari Gaddi Math were not functioning on September 20 evening for around 45 minutes during which the incident occurred. The Math authorities claimed that the CCTV cameras got defunct during that period of time due to power disruption in the area. A twitter account being run in Mahant Narendra Giri’s name is also under scanner. Mahant Narendra Giri had lodged an FIR with Daraganj police station a week before his death in which he had alleged that some unidentified people had created a fake twitter account in his name. He had informed police that he did not have any account on social media platforms. Moreover, Niranjani Akhada general secretary Ravindra Puri claimed that Mahant Narendra Giri’s religious band and chain etc were not found on his body and were found later in his room.“Anant (religious band) is worn by seers and is taken out only on special occasions. I have seen some parts of the video which Mahant Narendra Giri had shot from his mobile before his death. Although I watched only 30 seconds of over 4-minute video, he was saying the same things written in the suicide note,” Puri claimed. Meanwhile, after taking remand of Swami Anand Giri, Aadya Tiwari and his son Sandeep, CBI may question them about their relations with Mahant Narendra Giri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/narendra-giri-death-cbi-probe-continues-team-records-statements-101632764992445.html

The district has been set a target of administering polio drops to 359,648 children between the ages of zero to five. Officials said that 100,127 children were given the polio drops on Monday. Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “Both on first day and second day of the pulse polio, campaign we have received a good response. We hope to achieve the complete target by Tuesday as remaining children will be covered on the third day of the campaign.” For the campaign, the district administration has deployed as many as 112 mobile teams, with over 400 areas identified as high-risk areas. In the district, a total of 5,184 vaccinators are participating in the campaign, along with the deployment of 29 transit teams and 240 supervisors. Meanwhile, on Monday, 11,253 people were vaccinated against Covid-19 in the district across 78 centres, with 4,289 people being given the first dose and 6,964 the second dose.

27-09-2021||Delhi||With record rain in September, Delhi reports rise in dengue cases||With record rainfall in September this year, Delhi is reporting an increase in the number of dengue cases, as it added 62 infections in a week, showed data from the city’s civic bodies. The Capital registered 273 cases of the vector-borne disease till September 25. In comparison, the city recorded 212 cases of the infection in the same period last year. To be sure, doctors say fewer dengue patients reported to hospitals last year due to a fear of Covid-19. In 2019, Delhi logged 282 dengue cases in the same period. Municipal officials warned that the breeding is on the rise. “This is the peak time for breeding. Additionally, the city also received record rainfall at unexpected time, which will lead to more breeding. It does, however, seem less than 2010, when there was a lot of rain and Delhi saw one of the worst dengue outbreaks,” said a senior official from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. An official from the East corporation said, “Nowadays, we see cases being reported well into November. Earlier, the number of cases used to go down mid-October, as temperatures started dropping, but now we see that the mosquitoes start breeding indoors, especially in rooms where people switch on heaters during the winters.” Even though the treatment for dengue is symptomatic, people must seek a doctor’s opinion said Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) during a public lecture. “Some people who get dengue may develop severe disease. If they receive timely care and support they will be okay. Not everyone needs platelet transfusion. We have done a study, which shows that even with as little 10,000-20,000 platelets, people can recover on their own without any transfusion.” He said, almost 70 to 80% of the deaths due to dengue happens in people with comorbid conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes. “The children and the old, the people with comorbid conditions like BP and diabetes, those with chronic infections like TB, those with supressed immunity, the pregnant, and those with a history of dengue are at risk of developing severe disease,” said Dr Biswas. Unlike many disease where a previous infection confers immunity, in dengue a previous infection might increase the risk of severe disease. This is because there are four serotypes – the same virus with different make – that can cause the infection and the antibody against one serotype can increase risk of severe disease by another.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-record-rain-in-september-delhi-reports-rise-in-dengue-cases-101632764989515.html
27-09-2021||Gurugram||Bharat Bandh: Barricading by Delhi Police causes 2-km vehicle backlog in Gurugram||Heavy barricading by the Delhi Police at the Sirhaul toll plaza on Monday morning triggered a massive backlog of vehicles for around two kilometres, up to Shankar Chowk, in the city. It took commuters around 30-45 minutes to cross the stretch during the peak hour.The barricading was done by Delhi Police in view of a Bharat Bandh, organised by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a farmers’ organisation, against the three farm laws introduced by the Centre in September last year.Checking was at its peak for about an hour between 9.30am and 10.30 am, as only two lanes of the carriageway were available for vehicles to pass through. The Delhi Police was assisted by its Gurugram counterparts as well as paramilitary forces.“To keep a check on law and order due to the Bharat Bandh, we barricaded a section of Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway at the Sirhaul toll plaza. There was no fixed time for setting up the barricades as such and we could have continued with it for the rest of the day had there not been heavy traffic congestion arising on the national highway from it. We opened more lanes for traffic movement around 10.30am and reduced the barricades,” Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police (south-west), Delhi Police, said.Singh said that they would keep vigil at the border till Tuesday morning and closely monitor the state of affairs.After the Delhi Police opened most of the carriageway, traffic started returning to normalcy. However, traffic movement on the opposite carriageway, leading from Delhi to Gurugram, was unaffected throughout the day.It is not the first time traffic on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway has been severely affected due to barricading by Delhi Police.On September 17, Delhi traffic police had set up multilayered barricades at the Sirhaul toll plaza due to a protest march by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders in central Delhi against the three farm laws. On the day, it took commuters nearly 30 minutes to cross the stretch. On two separate occasions, agitating farmers had gathered at the Sirhaul toll plaza and blocked the movement of vehicles on the carriageway heading towards Delhi.However, there was no gathering of protesters or any disruption on Monday, according to the Gurugram police.“There was no disruption or protest anywhere on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. Delhi Police had set up barricades due to Bharat Bandh protests around 9.30am, due to which there was temporary congestion on the highway. We informed Delhi Police officials that agitating farmers had been stopped behind by Haryana Police at Jaisinghpur Khera and there was no need for intensive checking. Mutually, it was decided to open the barricades,” Ravinder Singh Tomar, DCP (traffic), Gurugram police, said.Jaisinghpur Khera is located in Rewari district, around 65 kilometres from the Kherki Daula toll plaza.Commuters said that vehicles were stacked in a beeline up to Shankar Chowk.“It took me nearly two hours to reach central Delhi from my house. I was stuck at the Sirhaul toll for nearly 40 minutes. There was heavy barricading by Delhi Police, and at a time, only two to three vehicles were allowed to pass through,” Vinayak Rungta, a resident of Sector 47, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bharat-bandh-barricading-by-delhi-police-causes-2-km-vehicle-backlog-in-gurugram-101632764988361.html
27-09-2021||Pune||Pune hoteliers seek deadline extension till 1 am||Pune: Pune hoteliers and bar owners have sought closing extension till 1 am from the existing timings of 10 pm. The representatives of the Pune hoteliers’ association have written to the district authorities for timings of restaurants and bars till 1 am, like pre-Covid days. “We submitted the letter to the district authorities last week and will also request deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to consider it during the meeting scheduled this Friday,” said Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (Praha), that has around 8,500 members. According to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) order issued on August 8, the dine-in timings for restaurants have been set till 10 pm. With reported drop in Covid cases, the state government has taken steps to ease curbs. Post Covid review meeting last week, Pawar said that Pune district may see fewer curbs, giving hope to hoteliers to have extended timings. “The decision will be taken after next Friday’s Covid review meet,” Pawar had said. “As the dine-in is allowed only till 10 pm, we cannot accept customers after 9.15 pm-9.30 pm. Post 10 pm, police authorities visit us to check if the deadline is followed. Home delivery is allowed till late,” said Shetty. Many restaurant owners cited financial loss during the lockdown period. “In metro cities, bars and restaurants are allowed to remain open till 1 am. However, every restaurant owner chooses the operation timings suitable to the business. The lockdowns have severely hit our business. With drop in Covid cases, we expect to see businesses back on track and recover losses,” said Arun Shinde, a restaurant owner in Baner. “The request would be considered and a final decision would be taken and announced after discussion with all stakeholders,” said Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol. Pune municipal commissioner and divisional commissioner did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-hoteliers-seek-deadline-extension-till-1-am-101632764869682.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||‘Gangster got live updates in jail as courtroom gunfight erupted’||Sitting inside Mandoli jail in Delhi, alleged gangster Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuriya was allegedly getting live updates on a mobile phone from the four men at the Rohini district court complex who were about to execute the plan to kill his arch rival Jitender Maan, alias Gogi, the investigation into Friday’s sensational and shocking courtroom shooting has revealed, police officers privy to the probe told HT.Tajpuriya has emerged as the prime conspirator in the sensational murder, which, the police officers cited above said on condition of anonymity, capped a decade-long violent rivalry between two of Delhi’s most powerful criminal gangs. They said at about 15 people, including Gogi, have so far been killed by the gangs in several shootings across the city over the years.Gogi was shot dead inside courtroom 207 at Rohini court complex on Friday by two assailants. Security personnel gunned the two shooters down as they were trying to escape through a door used by judges.Police officers aware of the investigation on Monday said that Tajpuriya had in his possession a mobile phone for over a week on wich he would get information about the progress in the plan to eliminate Gogi.To be sure, mobile phones for inmates are banned inside the jail complex.Delhi Prisons (Tihar) administration has initiated an inquiry to look into the allegations that Tajpuriya was using a phone in Mandoli jail, officials said, The inquiry is also aimed at ascertaining if there was any security lapse or connivance of any jail staffers who helped Tajpuriya get access to the phone.When asked about the allegations, Delhi Prisons director general (DG), Sandeep Goel said, “We are looking into it. It will not be proper to give any details on this, since it may have a bearing on the investigation.”A photograph showing Tajpuriya and one of the Gogi’s killers (Jagdeep alias Jagga), which appears to be a screenshot taken during a video call, also surfaced on social media on Monday. Police are trying to ascertain whether the photograph is genuine, or if it was altered digitally. They are also trying to find out the photo’s source. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the photograph.HT reported on Friday that Gogi and Sunil Maan (before he came to be known as Tillu Tajpuriya) were childhood friends who got sucked into the college politics at Delhi University’s Swami Shradhanand College in Alipur. During the 2007 university elections, the two friends ended up supporting two different candidates for the post of the vice president for the college, which is considered the beginning of their decade-long rivalry.were was once a teenager who excelled in sport (volleyball and athletics), represented his schools at several competitions, and got admitted to Delhi University (DU) on the sports quota. There, he and his closest childhood friend, Sunil Maan, got sucked into student politics. Maan is now better known as gangster Tillu Tajpuria in police records.The two went on to become deadly rivals, and for more than a decade, their names can be found together in police files and case papers that detail how they have fought a bloody turf war that spilled blood on the streets of Haryana and the national Capital.Besides the two killers – Rahul Tyagi and Jagga – who were shot dead in the courtroom, two others – Umang Yadav and Vinay Yadav – who accompanied them to the court in a Hyundai i-10 car, were arrested on Sunday by a special cell team.Dressed as lawyers, Tyagi and Jagga walked inside the court complex from gate number 4, and Umang, who was also wearing a black jacket, drove to the court campus. Vinay could not go inside as he was wearing jeans, a police officer associated with the case said.“Since the four men left the Haiderpur flat where they had been staying since September 20, Tajpuriya was constantly on a video call with them. He was taking updates on where they had reached, how far they were from Rohini court, and who was present where in the court premises. Before disconnecting, Tajpuriya asked Umang and Vinay to leave the premises,” the officer said.Senior police officers said that they will soon get Tajpuriya’s custody from Mandoli jail to interrogate him and ascertain his role in Gogi’s murder conspiracy. During questioning, Umang and Vinay told the police about Tajpuriya’s alleged role in the murder. They also indicated that jailed gangsters Naveen Dabas, better known as Naveen Bali, and Sunil Rathi, who is from Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat played a role in the conspiracy. Both are close associates of Tajpuriya, and their names have emerged in several revenge killings executed in the past few years by his gang members.A second investigator said they were also probing if one of the shooters, Rahul Tyagi alias Nitin, was associated with Rathi’s gang. He said that Tyagi was from Meerut, and was involved in a murder case in Sonepat, apart from a few cases in Delhi. “He carried a reward of ₹50,000 on his arrest. If required, we will also seek custody of Bali and Rathi,” the second officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gogi-shooting-delhi-gangster-got-live-updates-in-jail-as-gunfight-erupted-in-rohini-court-say-police-101632764688435.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||High court stays order to implement Delhi CM Kejriwal’s promise on rent payment||The Delhi high court on Monday stayed an order by the single judge bench that had directed the Delhi government to formulate a policy on the implementation of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s promise, made on March 29, 2020,that if a poor tenant couldn’t pay the rent, the state would pay it.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said irreparable loss will be caused to the appellant (the government) if an order of stay is not passed.“There is a prima facie case in favour of the appellant. Balance of convenience is in favour of the appellant and irreparable loss shall be caused. We stay the operation, implementation, and execution of the order of the single judge till the next date of hearing,” said the bench.The court, however, sought to know from the Delhi government counsel whether they had any intention to implement the promise.“So you have no intention to make the payment? Are you willing to pay 5 %... even 1% or pay nothing?” the court said.When the Delhi government counsel, senior advocate Manish Vashisht, said no one has come before them (the government) until now with such a demand, the bench remarked, “You draft a policy and there will be thousands of people before you.” On July 22, the single judge bench of justice Prathiba M Singh ruled that a chief minister’s promise to the citizens was enforceable and directed the Delhi government to take a decision within six weeks on Kejriwal’s announcement in a presser on March 29, 2020, that his government would pay the rent on behalf of poor tenants who were unable to do so owing to Covid-19.The court directed the Delhi government to formulate a policy regarding this, saying it was not a “political promise” made during an election rally. It said statements made by people in power are trusted by the public and so “puffing”, which may be permissible in commercial advertising, ought not to be recognisable and permissible in governance. The judgment came on a plea by five daily wagers who were unable to pay their monthly rent and wanted Kejriwal to come good on his promise, which was also an appeal to landlords to not coerce poor tenants to pay up during the Covid-induced national lockdown.Challenging this decision, the Delhi government on Monday contended that in the backdrop of the outbreak of the pandemic, a “fervent appeal” was made by the chief minister to the public at large not to coerce tenants into paying rent; however, the same was “found” to be “a sort of a promise” by the single judge.“Accordingly to me, there was no promise at all. We only said please follow the statement of the Prime Minister. We said to landlords (that) do not coerce tenants to pay rent..and if, to some extent, the poor do not find the means to pay, the government will look into it,” Vashisht said.In its appeal, the Delhi government submitted that expecting a government to “implement a truncated sentence from the press conference held by the chief minister, devoid of its context and in the face of developments which demonstrate that the eventuality for which the assurance was made never actually transpired, is grossly inequitable”.Appearing for the daily wagers, advocate Gaurav Jain opposed the plea and said his clients have no means to pay the rent.The court issued notice to the daily wagers and granted them time to file their replies.The matter will be heard next on November 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-court-stays-order-to-implement-delhi-cm-kejriwal-s-promise-on-rent-payment-101632764508145.html
27-09-2021||Lucknow||After wrestling, athletics needs govt patronage in Uttar Pradesh||The Uttar Pradesh government has already adopted wrestling till the 2032 Olympics but athletics also requires government patronage at least for the next 10 years, according to those associated with sport here.Recently, Athletics Federation of India termed Uttar Pradesh’s walk-racer Priyanka Goswami’s performance “excellent” among all the Indian athletes at the Tokyo Olympics even though she finished 17th. This wasn’t all as AFI, in its post-Tokyo analysis, also chose Uttar Pradesh as the hub for junior athletes and decided to run its talent search programme along with four other states Punjab, Haryana, Kerala and Karnataka.Daughter of a “suspended” bus conductor with UP State Road Transport Corporation, Goswami, who along with three throwers Shivpal Singh (javelin, Varanasi), Annu Rani (javelin, Meerut) and Seema Punia (discus, Meerut), represented India at the Summer Olympics, clocked 1 hr 32 minutes 36 seconds, well outside her personal best of 1:28:45, which she had come up with during the National Open Race Walk Championship at Ranchi this February.Before athletics in Uttar Pradesh could start in an effective manner in the 1980s even though the state body was affiliated to the national federation in 1965, Agra’s Vijay Singh Chauhan had won a decathlon gold at the 1974 Asian Games after becoming the first athlete from the state to participate in the 1972 Munich Olympics.Almost 20 years later, middle distance runner Bahadur Prasad then went to consecutive Olympics in 1992 at Barcelona and in 1996 at Atlanta. Thereafter, athletes like Mau’s Jatashanker (4x400m relay, Sydney Olympics), Agra’s Ram Singh (marathon, Beijing Olympics), Sudha Singh from Rae Bareli (steeplechase, London and Rio Olympics) and Chandauli’s Sanjay Rai (long jumper), who was the first Indian athlete to cross 8-metre mark at 2000 Sydney Olympics kept trying their luck for a medal at the quadrennial Games.Over two dozen athletes from the state, including Madhuri Saxena, mother of India’s new middle distance running queen Harmilan Kaur Bains, Gulab Chand, Ajay Kumar Saroj, Shivpal Singh, Seema Punia, Annu Rani, Priyanka Goswami, Hridayanand, Suresh Patel, Suman Devi. Pramod Tewari etc., continued to make their presence felt at the Asian Games, Asian Championships and even at the World Championships.Surprisingly, a force to reckon with in middle distance, marathon and to some extent in throws, especially hammer and discus, Uttar Pradesh athletes did everything on their own as they didn’t get any support from either the state government or the UP Athletics Association.In real terms, even now they don’t have adequate international facilities for the sport. The only synthetic track with limited facilities at Lucknow’s Guru Gobind Singh Sports College is far from the reach of the athletes. The other centre in Saifai is almost locked. Two other facilities i.e. at the Sports Authority of India centre and at the 35th Battalion, PAC Stadium in the state capital, are not meant for everyone.Former India coach in throws, Rustam Khan, too, does not have adequate facilities at Kaushambi, but his sports stadium is flooded with over 100 athletes, including 60 from Haryana, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.“It’s been too hectic for me nowadays as I have over two dozen javelin throwers, including 8-10 youngsters in the age group of 7-12 and they all want to follow the passion of Neeraj Chopra,” said Khan under whose tutelage four Indians had medals, including two in javelin and two in hammer at the 2008 Youth Commonwealth Games.He, however, said that for the youngsters he has managed javelin of 300g and 400g, whereas 15 other seniors are training with either their own or government sponsored javelins at the centre. “We need to have imported javelins in an adequate numbers and even in the past, we had this facility when I was posted at Jaunpur last year,” said Khan, a sports officer with UP Sports Directorate.UP’s first Olympian athlete Vijay Singh Chauhan, too, advocates facilities for athletes in the state.“If we had adequate facilities in our time, we could have won many medals at Olympics. Even now, athletes in Uttar Pradesh struggle for facilities and even then we have good results at the national and international levels,” he said.He supported the request of the UP Athletics Association to the UP government to adopt athletics for the next 10 years.“I have been told that there is a mad rush of young athletes, seeking training in throws, especially in javelin, since Neeraj Chopra’s success at the Tokyo Olympics, at various locations across the state and the government should cash in on this enthusiasm by adopting the sport as it has adopted wrestling,” said Chauhan, who was named the “Iron Man of Asia” for his superlative show at the 1974 Asian Games.“Uttar Pradesh has no dearth of talent in athletics and has produced athletes who have brought laurels for the state and for the nation too. Unfortunately, these athletes have no modern facilities to train,” UPAA’s secretary PK Srivastava writes to CM Yogi Adityanath while urging the government to adopt the sport for the next 10 years.“The limited existing facilities in the state are can be used for basic training purposes. Uttar Pradesh needs at least 10 tracks at places like Meerut, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Lucknow, Aligarh, Moradabad, Ayodhyay, Jhansi, etc,” said Srivastava.While presenting a comparative study in support of his demand to the CM, Srivastava mentioned the availability of sport facilities at Haryana (20 tracks) and Kerala (10 tracks), said that UP’s future in athletics was bright, but it needs the government’s patronage now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/after-wrestling-athletics-needs-govt-patronage-in-uttar-pradesh-101632764328342.html

Civic activists Sarang Yadwadkar, Vivek Velankar, Vijay Kumbhar, Sujit Patwardhan, Narendra Chugh, Shailaja Deshpande and Qaneez Sukhrani have jointly written to the municipal commissioner demanding verification of building permissions issued along riverside after November 2011. Yadwadkar and Velankar said, “We found details that the PMC had approved a multistorey building at Wadgaon Budruk on survey number 13/1A/P which is inside the floodline. There are many such permissions issued by authorities.” “All rivers must be free from encroachments and impediments, all building permissions issued along riverbanks after November 2011 should be reviewed and projects falling inside the floodline should be revoked and inquiry initiated against officers concerned,” Velankar said. Yadwadkar said, “Earlier, the PMC did not earmark the floodlines after publishing the draft development plan in 2013. Irrigation department handed over the floodline details in March 2015. On the basis of the irrigation department’s report, the urban development department marked floodlines on the maps in February 2018. Despite instructions from the irrigation department, PMC kept approving building plans on floodlines.” Activists said that such building constructions will affect the natural flow of river leading to rise in flood levels posing risk to human lives. The municipal commissioner should act against such illegal works which may put citizens’ life in danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/probe-permissions-given-for-buildings-on-floodlines-in-pune-civic-activists-101632764148469.html

27-09-2021||Kolkata||Suvendu Adhikari moves Calcutta HC seeking Mukul Roy’s disqualification as Bengal MLA||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari on Monday moved the Calcutta high court seeking disqualification of the party’s former national vice-president Mukul Roy as a member of the West Bengal legislative assembly. Roy, who joined the BJP in 2017 and returned to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on June 11 this year, has not yet officially resigned from the BJP. He has been made chairman of the public accounts committee (PAC) of the assembly, a post traditionally enjoyed by an Opposition party legislator. “We want Roy to be disqualified under anti-defection law. Our petition cites a verdict of the Supreme Court which gave speakers three months to take a decision on petitions for disqualification,” Adhikari, who is leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, said after filing the petition. “In our case, four months have passed,” he added. On June 18, Adhikari, submitted a petition to the speaker saying Roy, the legislator from Kishnanagar North constituency in Nadia district, should be disqualified under anti-defection law. Roy was appointed as PAC chairman by speaker Biman Banerjee on July 9. Mukul Roy, who is unwell, could not be contacted. Transport minister Firhad Hakim said, “Adhikari has moved court to seek publicity. He should know that in parliamentary affairs only the speaker takes these decisions.” Adhikari is not the first BJP leader to move the Calcutta high court on this issue. On August 24, BJP legislator Ambika Roy told the court that Mukul Roy’s appointment as PAC chairman violates a five-decade-old convention under which opposition party members get the post. While hearing Ambika Roy’s petition last month, the two-judge division bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj said the appeal for Mukul Roy’s disqualification was lying before the speaker and not the court. Appearing for Ambika Roy, senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan told the court that the speaker incorrectly assumed that Mukul Roy was in the BJP when he filed his nomination papers on June 25 for the chairmanship of the PAC. “Power exercised by the speaker must not be arbitrary. I will proceed on the assumption that Mukul Roy has defected from the BJP. A disqualification petition filed in June should not be delayed unnecessarily,” Vaidyanathan told the court on August 24. Vaidyanathan also told the court that in January last year a three-judge Supreme Court bench, comprising Justice RF Nariman, Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice V Ramasubramaniam, ruled that speakers of assemblies and the Parliament must declare their decisions on disqualification petitions within three months. The decision to disqualify a member is taken only by the speaker. The Constitution does not specify any time frame for the process which involves inquiry and setting up of a committee. The Bengal assembly speaker has already initiated the process and four hearings have taken place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/suvendu-adhikari-moves-calcutta-hc-seeking-mukul-roy-s-disqualification-as-bengal-mla-101632763430104.html

27-09-2021||Lucknow||Sugarcane price hike: It’s “insufficient”, say Tikait, oppn parties||Leaders of various opposition parties, farmers and their leaders have termed the increase of ₹25 in the purchase price of sugarcane in Uttar Pradesh “insufficient” while claiming that the cost of growing this cash crop has increased manifold in the past few years. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had on Sunday announced a ₹25 per quintal hike in the purchase prices of sugarcane in the state, taking it to ₹350 per quintal.“The hike of ₹25 per quintal is not acceptable to farmers. It is a big joke by the Uttar Pradesh government on the farmers,” Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said in a statement issued by BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik in Muzaffarnagar.The BKU leader claimed the purchase price of sugarcane was higher and diesel cheaper in neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh. “Due to diesel being expensive in Uttar Pradesh, the state government’s hike is inadequate,” he added.“They promised to increase sugarcane price to ₹375 per quintal in their ‘Sankalp Patra’ but the price announced is less than what it is in Haryana and Punjab. We demand that the sugarcane purchase price be increased to ₹425 per quintal amid growing prices of commodities used in farming,” he demanded.“Farmers have been protesting for adequate price of their crops for over 10 months now and such a little increase in sugarcane price is a joke on farmers,” Tikait claimed.Samajwadi Party leader and former member of state planning commission prof Sudhir Panwar alleged that such a little increase had exposed the BJP government’s claim of being number one.Senior Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Rajkumar Sangwan said the increase was insufficient because cost of growing sugarcane had increased manifold. He further said such a little increase in the purchase price was an insult to farmers and that they would teach the government a lesson in the forthcoming assembly election.“We were expecting an increase of at least ₹40 per quintal but an increment of ₹25 in four years has disappointed farmers,” said Manoj Malik, the former pradhan and a sugarcane farmer of Paswara village in Meerut district. Meanwhile, BJP district president Vimal Sharma said farmers’ welfare was the priority of the government.

She will discuss with workers and leaders preparations for rallies, setting up of war rooms in assembly constituencies and points that the party may incorporate in its manifesto for the polls. “Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will review preparations for the party’s rallies and yatras. We have set up war rooms in 100 of the 403 assembly constituencies of UP. She will review progress of setting up of war rooms in the rest of the constituencies. A war room is already functioning at UPCC headquarters for the past six months,” said a leader. This was her second visit to Lucknow this month. Priyanka, who was scheduled to hold interactions with party leaders at the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) headquarters over the next five days, had reviewed Congress’ preparations for 2022 assembly elections in the state capital earlier this month. “The Congress general secretary is expected to discuss with party leaders the finer points about the party’s Pratigya Yatra scheduled to be launched soon. The yatra will cover a distance of about 12,000 km to connect with people in all the major cities and assembly constituencies of the state,” said another leader. Later this week, Priyanka was expected to discuss with party leaders some major points that the Congress proposes to incorporate in its election manifesto. Former union minister and senior party leader Salman Khurshid had been appointed chairman of the party’s manifesto committee. As Priyanka had her own priorities for the manifesto she was likely to hold discussions in this regard with the manifesto committee. Khurshid, who is likely to reach here on Thursday, was holding interactions at various levels to get feedback and give final shape to the party’s manifesto. He was scheduled to hold another interaction on the manifesto with people in Lucknow on Sunday. “We have had about 30 virtual interactions and also held interactions in Faizabad, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Aligarh, Bahraich and Jhansi to get feedback on the manifesto. The last such interaction will be held in Lucknow on Sunday,” said Khurshid. Various wings and departments of the state Congress were bringing out ‘Sankalp Patras’ to reach out to people of different sections of society.

The court also ordered that the plaque be covered till the final judgement,” said, MPS Raghuvanshi, a lawyer representing the government in the case.Gwalior, superintendent of police, Amit Sanghi said, “More than 150 people of a community tried to unveil the plaque and created ruckus in front of the statute in Kampoo area on Saturday night. We have decided to enhance the security cover to avoid any untoward incident.”As many as 20 police personnel have been deployed around the statue with riot control vehicles. Police personnel will guard the statue 24x7, the Gwalior SP said, adding restrictions under section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure has been imposed in Morena and Gwalior, and people told not to put out any provocative posts on social media.

In the panchayats, the villagers are being informed about the consequences of the clash and also about the controversy as many don’t know the actual reason behind the tension but they are attacking each other over social media.”A controversy also erupted 300 km away in Uttar Pradesh’s Dadri over a statue of the ninth-century ruler over the past week after some members of the Gurjar community complained that an earlier version of the statue’s plaque acknowledged that he was a Gurjar king and were offended that this reference was removed.The organisers explained that they removed the name of the caste from the plaque installed below the statue after they realised that including either of the castes, Gurjar or Rajput, would lead to protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/20-police-personnel-deployed-near-mihir-bhoj-statute-in-gwalior-after-clash-101632760187729.html

Several students highlighted on social media that the exam paper pattern followed this year was different, and they were not notified about it. CET is the entrance test for admissions to professional undergraduate degree programmes, including engineering, management, architecture, hotel management, pharmacy, agriculture and allied courses, among others. After an initial delay due to the pandemic, these exams have been conducted in multiple sessions starting September 20 and will go on till October 10. As per the official CET website, MCA aspirants’ entrance exam has a total of 100 questions divided among four topics — mathematics and statistics (30 questions), logical/abstract reasoning (30 questions), English comprehension and verbal ability (20 questions) and computer concepts (20 questions). Each question carries two marks and candidates get 90 minutes to attempt. “The exam should have had questions under four topics but what we got was a jumbled question paper format. Students who usually attempt the sections they are comfortable or confident about were forced to solve questions at random, which is unfair,” said a student, requesting anonymity. This means, students did not have the choice to attempt all questions of a particular section and make up the marks, which is otherwise a common practice. While students have approached the state CET cell with these complaints, officials at the state CET cell said they haven’t received any complaints of this nature. “We will look into the matter when we receive any complaints,” said a senior official. Meanwhile, MBA aspirants have sought clarification from the MBA CET exam paper setters. An official from the state CET cell told HT. “Students, through a law firm, have sought a written clarification from the exam paper setters.

27-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body holds Covid vaccination drive for women only||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday held its second women-only Covid-19 vaccination drive at all public vaccination centres in the city. The first such drive was held on September 17, with a total of 127,000 women getting vaccinated at public and private centres through the day. The BMC decided to conduct a special women-only vaccination drive to reduce the gender disparity in vaccination.On Tuesday, the drive will be held exclusively for students and teachers during the first half of the day between 9am and 2pm, and for citizens due to get their second dose in the second half of the day between 3pm and 8pm. In the afternoon session, no one will be given a first dose at any public vaccination centres. Students and teachers are required to carry their identity cards along with a government-issued identity proof.According to information available on the CO-WIN portal, as of Monday morning, for every 13 men who have got vaccinated in Mumbai, 10 women have been vaccinated. While a total of 5,218,652 women have been vaccinated, 7,000,944 men have been vaccinated in the city so far; 2,900 other citizens have been vaccinated.Authorities have attributed the lower vaccination rate in women in Mumbai to women being more busy managing both work from home and household and partly to the government leaving out lactating mothers and pregnant women from the vaccination drive in the initial months of the drive. While vaccination began on January 16 for health care and frontline workers, and for citizens above the age of 18 from May 1, it was started for pregnant women and lactating mothers by the end of May.A senior civic officer from BMC’s public health department said, “That can be one of the reasons why more men are vaccinated in comparison to women in Mumbai. But the other reason is also that women, during the pandemic lockdown, are simply more busy. Stepping out for vaccination means they have to consider the travel time, the wait time at the vaccination centre for their turn, while managing work from home, and the household. That is why BMC held the special drive to encourage more women to come, with shorter wait time and no uncertainty of vaccine doses getting over mid-way.” BMC received 300,000 vaccine doses on Saturday.“In Mumbai, in some cases it also holds true that digital literacy and lack of public transport during lockdown affected women’s turnout for vaccination,” an educator in gender studies and health, from a reputed Mumbai based education institute said. She did not wish to be named.During Monday’s special drive, 113,935 women were vaccinated at public vaccination centres in the city, and a total of 126,419 women were vaccinated, including private centres’ vaccination figures. So far, 7,987,510 beneficiaries have received their first dose, and 3,898,711 beneficiaries have received their second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-holds-covid-vaccination-drive-for-women-only-101632759895559.html

He secured victory from Nighasan assembly seat on BSP ticket in the 2002 assembly election and was minister in the BSP government (2007-12). Later, he became member of the legislative assembly. In the 2009 Lok Sabha election, Kushwaha contested on BSP ticket against Congress leader Sonia Gandhi on Rae Bareli seat.Though Kushwaha held the post of national general secretary, but was sidelined in the party after the 2019 LS election. Terming the meeting with SP chief a “courtesy meeting”, Kushwaha said talks were held on the coming assembly election and political scenario in the state. The dates of joining SP will be announced later, he said. Earlier on Friday, two expelled BSP leaders – Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar – met SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, leading to speculation of the duo joining the Samajwadi Party. Verma and Rajbhar had stated that dates of their joining SP would be announced later.On June 3, BSP chief Mayawati had expelled Verma and Rajbhar on the charge of indulging in anti-party activities during the recently concluded panchayat elections.

27-09-2021||Mumbai||Thane pile-up brings traffic to a standstill||A pile-up on the busy Ghodbunder Road on Sunday night brought traffic in Thane to a standstill, with the snarls stretching out well into Monday morning and the queues running into kilometres. The accident took place at 11.10pm on Sunday, when a speeding oil tanker, which was travelling towards Thane, lost control and hit the divider. Police officials said the tanker did not stop even after hitting the divider. The momentum of the tanker caused its container to break off from the driver’s cabin and carried it over to the other side of the road, where it finally stopped. “A Hyundai i10, which was coming from the opposite lane, collided with the tanker’s container, and was in turn crushed after being hit from behind by a truck. Three occupants of the car were trapped inside. The tanker’s container also hit two more vehicles, a Baleno and an Ertiga, causing injuries to their drivers,” senior police inspector Kishore Khairnar, Kasarwadavli police station said. Personnel from the police station, Thane traffic police, Thane fire brigade and regional disaster management cell of Thane Municipal Corporation were rushed to the spot, along with ambulances, three hydra vehicles, a crane and a JCB demolition vehicle. The three occupants of the i10, identified as Vinod Kharat, 45, Srushti Patil, 18, and Pandurang Patil, 45, were rescued from inside the mangled remains of their car and admitted to Bhaktivedanta Hospital in Mira Road. “The spot where the accident took place is on an uphill slope and traffic is slow moving there. We first had to arrange for hydra vehicles so the container could be removed, which took several hours. Further, the oil spill on the road made it impossible to navigate safely and sand was poured on it,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Vinaykumar Rathod, Thane Police said. The container was straightened and lifted off the road around 6.30am, after which sand was poured on the spilled oil. This process got over around 8 am on Monday and traffic started moving slowly thereafter. However, the backlog took around two more hours to clear. The driver of the oil tanker is still at large, and the police are trying to identify and apprehend him. Based on the damage to his vehicle, the police suspect he might have been driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. The police have booked him for causing injury and endangering life due to rash and negligent driving under the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-pile-up-brings-traffic-to-a-standstill-101632759708248.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||Consider pacemaker implant for Rakesh Wadawan in hospital, Bombay high court tells state||Taking note of the serious condition of Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) promoter Rakesh Wadhawan, who has been arrested on charges of money laundering in the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank fraud, the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday asked the prison authorities to inform it whether any government hospital in Mumbai has the facility to carry out pacemaker implantation on him. The court sought the information after noticing that the dean of KEM Hospital in his report has stated that Wadhawan had a fluctuating heart rate and was advised to go for dual chamber pacemaker implantation. The report also stated that the hospital did not have the facility after which the court suggested that if the same was not available in any government hospital then the authorities should consider permitting him to undergo the implant at a private hospital at his own cost. The single judge bench of justice Bharati Dangre while hearing the bail application of Wadhawan seeking release on health grounds on September 24 was informed by additional public prosecutor Prajakta Shinde that as per court directions a current clinical report on the condition of Wadhawan was being submitted. Apart from heart fluctuations the report also stated that Wadhawan was suffering from chronic kidney disease.Senior advocate Aabad Ponda representing Wadhawan also placed the report of a Consultant Cardiologist, who had examined Wadhawan following the September 17 permission granted by the HC. The consultant’s report concurred with the opinion of KEM Hospital and advised a multidisciplinary team approach for patient recovery. After perusing the medical reports, the bench noted in the order, “The medical reports of the patient reflect that he requires immediate medical treatment of acute nature... The question then arises is when and where it will have to be medically ascertained, whether the applicant is fit for this implantation or he will have to wait and another question that arises is where the procedure can be carried out.” In light of KEM Hospital stating that it did not have the facility to carry out pacemaker implant the court directed APP Shinde to take instructions on whether any government hospital in Mumbai had the facility. “If not, take instructions to offer an alternate solution as per prayer made by senior counsel Ponda that the procedure on the applicant can be carried out by Private Hospital of his own choice and at his expenses, while in custody,” noted justice Dangre in the order and posted hearing of the bail application on September 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/consider-pacemaker-implant-for-rakesh-wadawan-in-hospital-bombay-high-court-tells-state-101632759408233.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||Build Mumbai-Nagpur bullet train along proposed expressway: Uddhav tells PM||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveying the state government’s willingness to accommodate the proposed Mumbai-Nashik-Nagpur high-speed rail (HSR) corridor along the under-construction Nagpur-Mumbai Super Communication Expressway or the Samruddhi Mahamarg. The chief minister also proposed that the Centre should take up Mumbai-Hyderabad high-speed rail corridor via Jalna-Nanded using the proposed Jalna-Nanded expressway. The CM also requested that the railways should build a high-speed corridor between Pune-Aurangabad.The letter came over a week after Thackeray, at a public function, pledged support for the Mumbai-Nagpur high-speed rail project to the minister of state for railway Raosaheb Danve. “Yes, there are expectations from each other. Raosaheb, I give you my word in front of everyone here that if you are going to take initiative for a Mumbai-Nagpur bullet train [project], then this government will stand firmly by you in every step,” Thackeray had said. He added that a bullet train between Mumbai and Nagpur is “our wish, expectation, and dream.”According to the two-page letter, Thackeray said that if Centre and State governments can “collaborate”, the proposed bullet train project between Mumbai and its winter capital can be executed “at the earliest”. He wrote, “If the Government of India and the Government of Maharashtra collaborate along the Samruddhi Mahamarg the execution of the Mumbai-Nashik-Nagpur HSR can be started at the earliest. GoM further proposes that since Mumbai-Nagpur HSR will be within the Samruddhi Mahamarg right of way (RoW) up to Jalna the same may be extended to Hyderabad.” The state government has already planned an expressway between Nanded and Jalna.Thackeray further said that using the “logic” of incorporating high-speed rail with Expressways, a corridor between Hyderabad and Mumbai can also be built through Nanded. “If the same logic of accommodating the HSR within the RoW of an expressway, as is proposed by the NHSRC between Nagpur and Mumbai, the Mumbai-Hyderabad HSR can also be planned along Mumbai-Nanded Expressway via Jalna and further within the RoW of proposed expressway between Nanded and Hyderabad. It is also felt that an HSR route between Pune and Aurangabad also needs to be planned. It should be noted that Mumbai-Nagpur connects Mumbai-Nashik-Aurangabad,” the letter stated.The state government has planned a semi-high speed corridor between Pune and Nashik, and connectivity between Pune and Aurangabad will complete the -quadrilateral, which is the industrial belt of Pune-Nashik-Aurangabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/build-mumbai-nagpur-bullet-train-along-proposed-expressway-uddhav-tells-pm-101632759107725.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||ED searches office of Shiv Sena leader Anandrao Adsul||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday carried out searches on the office premises and visited Kandivli residence of former Shiv Sena member of Parlaiment (MP) Anandrao Adsul on Monday. The central agency, which had summoned him to appear before them, intended to bring him in for questioning over misappropriation of funds in City Co-operative Bank, which he headed. However, the Sena leader complained of chest pain and was rushed to a suburban hospital.ED suspects that Adsul has received some benefits from the misappropriation of funds in connection with the alleged fraud at City Co-operative Bank. And in connection with the same the central anti-money laundering agency wish to grill the Sena leader, who was the chairperson of the bank. ED’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case is based on the FIR registered by the Mumbai Police economic offences wing (EOW) last year. Interestingly, Adsul is the complainant in this case. The EOW had then booked several auditors, valuers and employees of the City Co-operative bank for allegedly causing a loss of ₹98 crore to the bank by granting loans in an unruly and illegal manner. The accused did not properly calculate the value of mortgaged property for loan, in a few cases, even nothing was mortgaged against the loan. There are 56 applicants who, had received loans but failed to repay it. One of the shareholders of this bank had earlier claimed that the amount of fraudulently sanctioned loan is over ₹2,500 crore, but police’s preliminary probe found that ₹98 crore worth loans were sanctioned illegally. The EOW still awaiting a report from the forensic auditor to present their findings. ED is trying to collect more evidence and documents to prove the allegations that Adsul benefitted from the said illegal loan.Adsul becomes the fourth Sena leader after Sena member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Pratap Sarnaik, transport minister Anil Parab, MP Bhavana Gawali to get ED notice or face action from the Central agency. Senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s wife too had got a notice from ED in the past.Shiv Sena, meanwhile, said that ED against Sena leaders has become a routine. Sena chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said that the action from ED is not final, and the courts decide whether a person is guilty of any wrongdoing or not. Sawant while speaking to media persons, “Summons are a daily thing from ED. But those who are levelling allegations, are they saints?... Is Adsul the only person involved in the bank? This is nothing but defaming Shiv Sena and its leaders.” The south Mumbai MP further said, “ED is not the courts. There are courts still in this country by the grace of God. This has been happening only to gain power; defame the government to topple it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-searches-office-of-shiv-sena-leader-anandrao-adsul-101632758987586.html

Protesting farmers, however, stopped a train going to Delhi from Bathinda at the Tapa railway station, 23km from district headquarters. They served tea to passengers, while also telling them that it was the Centre’s stand against farmers’ demands that had led them to give a call for Bharat Bandh. Usha, 60, a passenger, said that she had to visit Ambala from Bathinda and the train was scheduled to reach there at 9am, but it was stopped on the way. “I booked a ticket online, but the department didn’t inform us about the possibility that farmers could block tracks. Now, it is learnt that the train will return to Bathinda,” she added.“The government is responsible for this harassment; if it would have accepted the demands of farmers, we would not be in this situation,” said another passenger.A protester Sikander Singh said the Modi government had been cruel and insensitive towards farmers. “Farmers, women and children are staging an indefinite protest against the farm laws on the borders of Delhi. We have also stopped a train en route Delhi from Sri Ganganagar. Farmers will arrange food for passengers, but the government should have cancelled such trains to avoid harassment to passengers. The trains will not be allowed to move till 4pm,” he added.BKU (EKTA-UGRAHAN) CHIEF LASHES OUT AT CHANNIIn Sunam, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan lashed out at the new Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for his announcement that he would be visiting protesting farmers. Ugrahan claimed that the previous CM Capt Amarinder Singh had done nothing for farmers and Channi would face the anger of farmers. “Have we invited Channi? If people oppose him or any untoward incident happens, then what? The Congress had promised complete debt waiver; this was not done. Has drug menace been ended? The CM promised jobs, has he provided employment? Why will Channi visit there? What will he answer there? We have no hopes from Channi. I advise him to first save his home (the Congress party),” said Ugrahan, in response to a query from media persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-stop-train-in-barnala-offer-tea-to-passengers-101632758687686.html

27-09-2021||Patna||Bihar drops demand for special status||In a sharp departure from its long-held stand, Bihar has dropped its demand for special status but will be seeking special packages for all sectors, planning minister Bijendra Yadav said on Monday, prompting the Opposition to accuse the Nitish Kumar government of “surrendering” before the Bhartiya Janata Party which is part of the ruling coalition in the state.Yadav, however, took strong objection to the Niti Aayog’s way of evaluating the ranking of the states based on the index of sustainable development goals (SDGs) and said the state needed special assistance from the Centre for accelerated and holistic development. “We have dropped the demand for special status as we are now tired of asking for it from the Centre. But we are now seeking special package for all sectors,” Yadav said in his remarks on the Niti Aayog’s report that ranked Bihar at the bottom of grown in the year 2020-21. Taking exception to the way of evaluation of progress of the state’s, Yadav said that the state government had sent a formal memorandum to the Niti Aayog, asking for change in the modalities. “The state registered remarkable growth in 10 out of 15 SDG index as compared to the last year. But, there are some areas, which the state can’t compete with other states owing to its natural limitations for which the state required special package,” said the minister. The minister said that Bihar stood among the front ranking states with respect to progress in health sector. “Bihar ranked the 5th in case of potable water and sanitation sector. In per capital development expenditure index, the state grew by 17.9% over the last year as compared to the national average of 11.6%. Total fertility rate has come down to 3 (2019-20) vis-à-vis 3.8 in 2011. Still, the state’s progress was adjudged at the bottom,” said Yadav, adding that life expectancy has also improved considerably in the state. The minister alleged that the Niti Aayog chose the unrealistic data to assess Bihar on the index based on percentage of population below poverty line. “The state can’t help improve on the index for quality employment and economic development based on the number of automated teller machines (ATMs) as it depended on the discretion of banks. Moreover, the index that assess the state based on the percentage of the forest cover to development was not justifiable. The state did well when assessed on the index of change in forest cover, which was done away with in the lasted assessment,” the minister pointed out. Through the memorandum, the minister also demanded that the index and objectives of development to assess the status of states by Niti Aayog should be finalised in consultation with the states. “Special assistance should be given to states which are backward but striving to grow faste,” the memorandum said. This is the second time in the recent past when the state government has put a dissenting note with the Central government. Taking exception to the Centre’s no to the caste-based census, the demand for which an all party delegation to the PM Narnedra Modi made on August 23, CM Nitish Kumar urged the Central government to rethink its decision. Kumar’s party Janata Dal (United) has been demanding special status for Bihar since 2012 and it was a main political agenda of the party for the state’s polls last year. The state legislature had passed resolutions, unanimously, asking for the special state’s status to Bihar in the past and submitted it to the Centre. However, the same was not considered by the Centre. “Even the special package promised by the PM Modi during 2019 election rallies was not considered,” said Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra. Meanwhile, Opposition RJD accused JD(U) of surrendering before the BJP. “The Nitish Kumar government has bowed down before the BJP. It has no concern for development of Bihar and prosperity of its people. They just love to stay in power and are not bothered for anything else,” said RJD chief spokesman and MLA Bhai Birendra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-drops-demand-for-special-status-101632758028765.html

However, no farmers were seen taking part in the bandh.Besides, as many as 125 political leaders and workers were detained from Patna, Nalanda and Jamui for disrupting law and order, additional director general (headquarters) J S Gangwar said. He, however, asserted that the bandh was peaceful and no untoward incident was reported from any part of the state. Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at borders of the national capital for the past 10 months, demanding that the farm laws, enacted by the central government in September last year, be scrapped.In Bihar, no major incident was reported during the bandh. Leaders and MLAs of opposition parties, including RJD, Left and Congress, came out on streets at many places and appealed to people to express solidarity with farmers.Tyres were burnt on National Highways, state highways, GT Road and other key roads to prevent movement of vehicles. Supporters of RJD and Left parties fanned out to various parts of state, including capital city Patna, forcing shopkeepers to down shutters, and deflating tyres of vehicles plying on roads. Hundreds of party supporters--among whom children could also be seen--stormed private vehicles and bus stands carrying sticks and party flags, but they were chased away by police personnel. Demonstrations were reported from Jehanabad, Darbhanga, Begusarai , Nawada, Saran, Sheikhpura, Lakhisarai, Bhagalpur and Khagaria, where protestors forcibly stooped train movement, while protestors squatted on railway tracks. “Movement of trains resumed after the GRP removed protestors from tracks,” said Patna Rail superintendent of police Bikash Burman. However, most private schools in Patna, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Gaya and other districts were closed, while normal business establishments, including eateries, functioned as usual. In Patna, student organizations of Patna University blocked Ashok Rajpath, burnt tyres and raised slogans in support of the bandh. At the Patna junction roundabout, supporters of the Communist party were seen attacking buses. In Bodh Gaya town, normal traffic was seen on the roads and markets remained open due to Pitra Paksha Mela. A large number of police personnel were deployed across the state to prevent any untoward incident. Despite this, protesters on major routes, including the Mahatma Gandhi Setu connecting North Bihar and the state capital, affected vehicular traffic leading to long queues of vehicles due to blockade by RJD supporters led by MLA Mukesh Roushan. The RJD leaders demanded withdrawal of the three farm bills Reports from BhojpurSupporters of Left parties led by MLA Sudama Prasad blocked Ara-Patna-Sasaram highways, held public meetings and raised anti-government slogans. The bandh evoked mixed response in Purnia and Kosi divisions, consisting of eight districts.Bandh supporters blocked NH-31 near RN Shaw roundabout in Purnia for two hours. Similarly, protesters blocked Katihar-Purnia road at Mirchairari in Katihar. In Araria, the protest witnessed almost no response. However, in Kishanganj, protesters blocked Kishanganj-Siliguri road for a few hours, affecting traffic movement.In Saharsa, Madhepura and Supaul, RJD leaders and their supporters took out the march, shouting slogans against both the state and the Union government. They later accompanied bandh supporters and blocked roads at various places. However, the blockade was lifted within two hours as leaders left the protest due to scorching heat.(With inputs from Prashant Ranjan, Aditya Nath Jha)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bharat-bandh-farmers-largely-absent-oppn-parties-hit-streets-in-bihar-101632757969180.html

27-09-2021||Patna||Heavy losses force Bihar power firm to resort to stern measures||The South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited (SBPDCL), one of the two government-owned discoms in Bihar, supplying power to 17 of its 38 districts, including capital Patna, is billing consumers for around 65% of the electricity that goes into its distribution system, say officials. The remaining 35% is lost as aggregate transmission and commercial (AT&C) loss when the regulator approves of only 15%. Officials monitoring the loss have assessed that power pilferage by consumers, either with the connivance of discom staff or without them, contributes to the bulk of the AT&C loss. The SBPDCL has now stepped up the heat to curb its losses by launching a spirited anti-power theft drive before the regulator undertakes the true-up exercise (sort of reconciliation of accounts based on power purchased and power sold) to revise the state’s power tariff, due in April next year. As per data accessed by the Hindustan Times, ₹7.30 crore was realised in Patna by way of penalty from January this year till September 25, of which ₹5.29 crore was generated in August. This was after a record 1,036 FIRs were registered that month against errant consumers. That was followed up by another 460 FIRs, leading to the realisation of ₹2.52 crore in September (till September 25). “We decided to utilise our revenue engineers in special checking drive after our billing software reported a snag between July 29 and September 1,” said Sanjiwan Sinha, managing director, SBPDCL. “We found that despite billing almost 100% consumers, we were able to recover only around 65% of our input cost. This meant that many consumers were surreptitiously bypassing their energy meters and availing of our power to run air-conditioners and other heavy voltage items, adding to our losses. That is when we realised that the bulk of our AT&C loss was due to power pilferage by consumers,” said Sinha. “We then chalked out a plan and began anti-power theft drive in a concerted manner in August. Our team identified areas prone to power pilferage and began inspecting every household in the locality concerned, without any exception, leading to huge evasion of power charges,” he added. Dilip Kumar Singh, general manager, Patna Electricity Supply Undertaking (PESU) said, “On an average, 8% of the 1,000-odd houses our team inspects in a day are found to be pilfering power in Patna,” said Dilip Kumar Singh, general manager, Patna Electricity Supply Undertaking (PESU). In most cases, consumers were by-passing the energy meter, he added. To curb power theft, the discoms have also begun replacing old post-paid energy meters with smart pre-paid ones. Officials in the raiding team said resistance to the installation of smart pre-paid meters, which are sensitive, was more in areas where power theft was rampant. “In urban Patna, 1.09 lakh smart pre-paid energy meters have already been installed against its 6.07 lakh consumers,” said Singh. All post-paid electricity connections would be converted into smart pre-paid energy meters by 2023, said Sinha. “We want to get our AT&C losses down to the limit prescribed by the regulator. We have decided to keep up the tempo and continue with our anti-power theft drive,” said Sanjeev Hans, Bihar’s energy secretary-cum-chairman and managing director, Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/heavy-losses-force-bihar-power-firm-to-resort-to-stern-measures-101632757907683.html

A consortium comprising Ashdan Properties, Classic Promoters and Builders and Atul Builders will take over the debt-ridden group through the insolvency process.DS Kulkarni Developers Limited (DSKDL) owners are accused of cheating more than 30,000 investors of more than ₹2,000 crore. The case is being investigated by the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Pune police.DSK investor Sanjay Ashrit said, “All those who have invested in DSKDL properties stand to gain due to the latest development. However, other investors like us who invested in DSK shell companies will also get back their money provided the case is handed over to the Enforcement Directorate. We are very positive about the entire process and investors will get their money back.” Complainant Jitendra Mulekar, who had lodged an FIR against the DSK group, said, “Currently only DSKDL investors will get back their money while those investors who have invested in the shell companies will have to wait for a while. We want the refunds to be initiated at the earliest.” Investor Manjusha Kulkarni said, “We want the ED to probe the transfer of funds to brokers and money lenders from DSK. Through ED the money can be retrieved and the investors can be refunded in real time.” DSK’s lawyer advocate Ashish Patankar said, “The plan put forth by the consortium has been duly accepted and is awaiting NCALT approval subject to no objections raised either by the committee of creditors or by corporate debtors.” Manoj Kumar Agarwal, a resolution professional, on August 13 informed the listing compliance department of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange about the approval of the resolution plan involving DS Kulkarni Developers.Agrawal in his letter stated: “The Committee of Creditors (CoC) has approved the resolution plan submitted by Ashdan Properties Pvt Ltd, Classic Promoters & Builders Pvt Ltd and Atul Builders, with a requisite majority of the voting share as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016.

27-09-2021||Mumbai||Remnants of cyclonic storm Gulab to bring heavy rain to Mumbai today||The city is likely to experience a final spell of heavy rain on Tuesday, before the end of the monsoon, experts and officials cautioned on Monday. This is due to the passage of the remnants of cyclonic storm Gulab, which made landfall over Andhra Pradhesh on Sunday. The weakened weather system has since been travelling westward, and is expected to bring thunderstorms with lightning and gusty winds to parts of Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan as it crosses the region. Mumbai has been placed under an orange category weather alert for September 28, indicating chances of very heavy rain at isolated places, while Thane and Palghar districts have been placed under a red category weather alert, indicating chances of extremely heavy rain at isolated places. “Citizens should pay attention to these alerts and plan their activities accordingly, as there may be chances of waterlogging in some parts of the city,” said a meteorologist with the India Meteorological Department’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. The IMD has also forecast that some affected districts may see strong winds between 30kmph and 40kmph, gusting at 50kmph in isolated places. In a statement to the press on Monday, the met department stated: “The Deep Depression over south Odisha and adjoining north Andhra Pradesh moved westwards with a speed of 08 kmph during last 06 hours, lay centered at 0830 hrs... over south Odisha and adjoining south Chhattisgarh and 65 km east – northeast of Malkangiri (Odisha). It is likely to move nearly westwards and weaken into a Depression during next 06 hours and into a well-marked low pressure area during subsequent 24 hours.” Should the weather system cross over into the Arabian Sea, it may pick up in intensity into a strong low-pressure system and lead to formation of another tropical cyclone, experts have warned. While Mumbai is expected to narrowly miss heavy rain, regions in north Konkan, such as Dahanu, Vasai-Virar, Thane, and Kalyan-Dombivli are expected to be affected to a larger degree. The most intense showers have been predicted between 5pm on Tuesday and 5pm on Wednesday. “As the weather system moves toward Arabian Sea and picks up moisture, the intensity of rainfall will increase over Konkan and central Maharashtra. There is already an active east-west monsoon trough running through the north Konkan region. Hence there is certainly going to be a spike in rainfall. There will be rough weather as much as 75km from the coast of Maharashtra and fishermen have also been warned from venturing out,” said the meteorologist with the IMD. With Mumbai receiving 39mm of rain during the day on Tuesday, the total rainfall for the entire season (from June 1) stands at 3,036mm, against the seasonal normal of 2,205mm. This is an excess of about 37%, and marks the third consecutive year that Mumbai has received seasonal rainfall in excess of 3,000mm. Counting rains brought by Cyclone Tauktae in May, the total rain for the entire year stands around 3,400mm. Between June and September last year, the city recorded a total 3,687mm of rain, stopping just 70mm short of 2020 being the wettest monsoon on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/remnants-of-cyclonic-storm-gulab-to-bring-heavy-rain-to-mumbai-today-101632757067642.html

27-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai doctors see a spurt in chikungunya cases||City doctors are seeing a spurt in cases of chikungunya – a viral infection spread by an infected Aedes Aegypti mosquito, with people coming to the medical clinics with acute joint pain and other symptoms such as fever and rashes. “We have seen 20 confirmed cases of the infection in the past fortnight,” said Dr Shalini Suralkar, a consultant physician with Powai’s LH Hiranandani Hospital. “The patients are in the age group of 30-50. None of them required hospitalisation,” said Suralkar, citing a case of a 45-year-old woman who came in with a history of fever, rashes and joint pain. While her fever and rashes subsided, the pain in her foot, ankles and hands persisted. The patient has to be eventually put on a course of steroids.Chikungunya is caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). In addition to excruciating joint pain, fever and rashes, the infection also causes joint swelling, headache, nausea and fatigue. Its pain-related symptoms are similar to rheumatoid arthritis. According to Suralkar, chikungunya arthritis can last up to three to six months. In such cases, patients are put on steroids and their doses are tapered gradually. If patients don’t get relief, they are prescribed immunomodulatory treatment in the form of hydroxychloroquine. “In chikungunya, patients generally do not require hospitalisation and mortality is very rare. But it can be a very morbid condition in which patients are unable to do their daily activities and are in extreme pain,” said Suralkar, adding that in mild cases, patients generally respond to anti-inflammatory medication, and sometimes with a short course of steroids. The clinical signs of chikungunya are similar to dengue, thus there is a chance of misdiagnosis if timely testing is not done. Doctors said patients are seeking medical help within one of two days of symptoms because of the fear of Covid-19, and this has helped in the early diagnosis of other diseases. “There is no direct treatment for chikungunya and all interventions are mostly for symptom relief,” said physician Dr Gautam Bhansali, who has been seeing two to three confirmed cases every day since the past two weeks. “It is a viral disease that leads to reduced platelet count and causes severe dehydration. We advise patients to increase their fluid intake if they are not hospitalised, and some other medications are given for fever and pain relief,” he said. Consultant internist Dr Samrat Shah from Bhatia Hospital has also been seeing two to three confirmed cases every day. “Only one or two patients in a week have required hospitalisation due to severe joint pain and high-grade fever,” said Shah, adding the treatment includes intravenous fluids, antipyretics, anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-doctors-see-a-spurt-in-chikungunya-cases-101632754547226.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||NIA opposes Sachin Vaze’s plea for 3 months house arrest||A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Monday asked Wockhardt Hospital at Mumbai Central to file a report on the health condition and discharge date of dismissed police inspector Sachin Vaze while hearing his plea to be kept under house arrest for three months for post-surgery recovery. The NIA has opposed his plea. Judge AT Wankhede asked the hospital to file a report on the health conditions of Vaze who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The court also directed the hospital to inform it 48 hours before Vaze’s discharge from the hospital. Vaze has filed a plea through counsel Sajal Yadav and Aarti Kalekar post bypass surgery that was conducted on September 13. In his plea he had argued that he will be discharged on September 28, and that he underwent a complex cardiac surgery with five grafts. In his petition he had claimed that it is a known medical fact that post-surgery there is a high likelihood to contract infection in a non-sterile environment. Jail has a higher rate of tuberculosis and skin infection due to unhygienic conditions and overcrowding, the plea stated.Vaze had also taken reference of the case of Telegu poet Varavara Rao arrested in the Elgaar Parishad case who was granted temporary bail for six months on medical grounds by the Bombay high court.Vaze’s plea seeks that he be allowed to be placed in house custody for three months with a permission to visit his doctors for routine medical check-ups.However, the NIA opposed the Vaze application and filed a reply opposing it. The NIA stated that the grounds stated by the under trial prisoner in the case of Dr P V Varavara Rao’s case are totally different to the facts as stated by the present applicant accused.It is further submitted that the judicial custody of the applicant accused under section 309 of CrPC cannot be converted into section 767 of CrPC as the investigation against him was already completed and charge-sheet filed. The grant of house arrest to the accused at this stage is totally against the settled position of law and justice. The hospitals attached to Taloja jail are modern and capable of handling such conditions. It is further submitted that great prejudice would be caused to the case of the prosecution at hand as there is every possibility that the applicant accused will abscond, if house arrest is granted to said accused. The jail authorities need to be heard on the issue, the NIA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nia-opposes-sachin-vaze-s-plea-for-3-months-house-arrest-101632754367162.html

The impact of the collision caused the container truck to skid over to the opposite lane and turn over on its side, blocking most of the lane, while the oil tanker, too, careened out of control and spilt its cargo. Meanwhile, three cars were also hit, but their occupants were rescued safely and no fatalities were reported.“The spot where the accident occurred is on an uphill slope and traffic is anyway slow-moving there. The accident caused all the traffic to come to a standstill. We first had to arrange for a Hydra vehicle so that the container truck could be removed, which took several hours. Further, the oil spilt on the road made it impossible to navigate safely and mud was poured on it,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Vinaykumar Rathod, Thane Police said.He added that the process of pouring mud was completed around 8 am on Monday and traffic started moving slowly thereafter. However, the heavy backlog that has accumulated over the entire night will still take some more time to clear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/collision-between-oil-tanker-and-container-truck-causes-massive-traffic-jam-at-thane-s-ghodbunder-road-101632754189049.html

27-09-2021||Patna||Why Bihar ranks bottom in Niti Aayog SDG index? Minister blames unrealistic data||PATNA: Bihar’s planning minister Bijendra Yadav on Monday objected to Niti Aayog’s way of ranking states on the index of sustainable development goals (SDGs), and said the eastern state needed special assistance from the Centre for faster development.“We have dropped the demand for the status of a special state (special category status), as we are now tired of asking for it from the Centre. But now we are seeking special packages for all sectors,” Yadav, an influential member of chief minister Nitish Kumar’s cabinet, said in his remarks on the government think tank’s 2020-21 report that ranked Bihar at the bottom of the table.Yadav said the state government has asked Niti Aayog to change the way it evaluates progress. “The state registered remarkable growth in 10 out of 15 SDG index as compared to last year. But there are some areas, which the state can’t compete with other states owing to its natural limitations, for which the state requires a special package,” the minister said.Buttressing his claim, Yadav said Bihar stands at the front on progress in health care.“Bihar ranked the 5th in case of potable water and sanitation sector. In the per capita development expenditure index, the state grew by 17.9% over the last year as compared to the national average of 11.6%. The total fertility rate has come down to 3 (2019-20) vis-à-vis 3.8 in 2011. Still, the state’s progress was adjudged to the bottom,” said Yadav, adding that life expectancy has also improved considerably in the province.Niti Aayog chose unrealistic data to assess Bihar on the index based on the percentage of population below the poverty line, Yadav alleged. “The state can’t help improve on the index for quality employment and economic development based on the number of automated teller machines (ATMs), as it depended on the discretion of banks. Moreover, the index that assesses the state based on the percentage of the forest cover to development was not justifiable. The state did well when assessed on the index of change in forest cover, which was done away within the latest assessment,” the minister pointed out.Through the memorandum, the minister demanded that the index and objectives of development to assess the status of states by Niti Aayog should be finalised in consultation with the states. “Special assistance shall be doled out to those states, which are backwards but striving to grow faster. The Niti Aayog shall frame short, medium and long-term strategies for different states depending on their limitations to achieve the SDGs for progress,” the memorandum said.This is the second time in the recent past when the state government has sounded a dissenting note with the central government. Taking exception to the Centre’s refusal to a caste-based census, the demand for which an all-party delegation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi made on August 23, chief minister Nitish Kumar urged the central government to rethink its decision.The ruling Janata Dal (United) has been demanding special status for Bihar since 2012. It was also the main political agenda of the party during the state’s assembly polls last year. The state legislature in the past passed unanimous resolutions, asking for the special status to Bihar.However, it was not considered by the Centre. “Even the special package promised by Prime Minister Modi during 2019 election rallies were not considered,” said Prem Chandra Mishra, a leader of the opposition Congress party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/tired-of-asking-bihar-minister-explains-why-jdu-dropped-special-status-demand-101632754012399.html

Tiwari said the MP was scheduled to reach the venue around 12pm while Congress MLA Mishra had given a programme to reach there at 3pm. But the BJP MP reached late and entered the auditorium with 14 to 15 people. The MP was welcomed and the CLP leader vacated her chair for him. One of his supporters snatched the mike and slogans were raised in favour of the MP, said Tiwari.Mishra said this slogan shouting was countered by those sitting in the audience and the MP made no efforts to bring the situation under control. The BJP MP could not be reached for his comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/upcc-to-stage-statewide-protests-today-seeking-withdrawal-of-cases-against-party-leaders-101632753287167.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||Owaisi behind the scenes facilitator for BJP; starts religious polarisation in Uttar Pradesh: Sena slams AIMIM chief||Shiv Sena on Monday attacked All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi saying that he is acting as “behind the scenes facilitator” for the successful journey of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the country. An editorial in Saamana said that religious polarisation has begun in Uttar Pradesh ahead of next year’s Assembly polls.In an editorial in Sena mouthpiece, the party came down heavily on the “provocative speeches” by Owaisi in Prayagraj during his campaigning, where slogans of hailing Pakistan were given allegedly by his supporters. “With Assembly elections approaching in Uttar Pradesh, it looks like Owaisi, who has long been a facilitator for the BJP, has made all preparations to raise communal and religious tensions there... Can’t the BJP’s politics progress without using Pakistan’s name?” the editorial asked. The Sena mouthpiece raised questions over the timing of the slogans in Uttar Pradesh, saying that there were no such incidents before his visit. “How is it that when Owaisi comes to UP ahead of the polls, his supporters begin chanting provocative ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans when there is no record of any such sloganeering before this,” it said.Attacking Owaisi, the editorial said that he would forever be regarded as the “undergarment” of the BJP unless he had the courage to tell the Muslim community to join the country’s mainstream and abide by the Constitution. “Till the time Owaisi cannot show the courage to say that Muslim society cannot be ignored in the politics of the country, and without Muslims coming into the mainstream of the nation, they will not get their rights, “Till the time Owaisi does not show the courage to say that Muslims are a part of this country and will have to pave their way as per the Constitution until then, he will not be regarded as a national leader. Otherwise, he will be an undergarment of a national party like BJP,” it said, adding that, “Till then Owaisi’s leadership would be seen as one of those who help their ‘suparibaaz’ parents by dividing votes.”It added that a similar trend of the religious divide was seen in the West Bengal and Bihar elections which helped the BJP. While it failed to work in Bengal where the Muslim community voted in large numbers to Mamata Banerjee. The editorial said that had Owaisi not used the divisive strategy in the Bihar election, Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Tejashwi Yadav would have been the chief minister. “If Owaisi had not preached his politics of bigotry in Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav would have been holding the reins of power today,” the editorial remarked.Reacting to the criticism, AIMIM MP Imtiaz Jaleel from Aurangabad, Maharashtra said that his party has been accepted unlike Sena which has remain constrained in Maharashtra. Over the criticism that Owaisi is a behind the scene player for BJP, Jaleel said, “Let them say whatever they please. These remarks are made by political parties, not by the people. The people have accepted us in Bihar, in Maharashtra and we are not a party restricted to Hyderabad. Shiv Sena call themselves tigers but they are only limited to Maharashtra.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/owaisi-behind-the-scenes-facilitator-for-bjp-starts-religious-polarisation-in-uttar-pradesh-sena-slams-aimim-chief-101632753107311.html

Additional sessions judge AA Joglekar granted them bail. The three were arrested in January 2021. Advocate Taraq Sayyed who appeared for the accused had argued the substances seized from Khan were only tobacco and herbal products and not covered under the NDPS Act. He had further stated that there is nothing to show that he had financed illicit trafficking of drugs to be charged under the provisions of the NDPS Act. Public prosecutor for NCB, Atul Sarpande had argued that around 200kg marijuana was seized from Sejnani’s residence in Khar in January. The material was sent to a forensic laboratory in Gujarat, of which 83kg had tested positive for narcotic drugs and psychedelic substances. Sejnani, in his statement to the agency, alleged that he had supplied marijuana to city’s famous paan vendor Muchhad Paanwala alias Ram Kumar Tiwari. The agency then conducted searches at Tiwari’s shop and warehouse in Kemps Corner in south Mumbai and recovered curated marijuana.During further probe, the agency found Sejnani’s connection with Khan and he was summoned for inquiry on January 13. After questioning for almost 10 hours, NCB arrested Khan in the case for allegedly financing the racket.The case was registered after actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ndps-court-grants-bail-to-nawab-malik-s-son-in-law-two-others-in-drug-cases-101632752567314.html

He reiterated his previous comments saying that the ‘bandhs’ should not disturb the people who are trying to recover from the impact of Covid-19.“People are struggling to recover from the adverse impact of Covid-19 on economic activities. They should not be disturbed by such 'bandhs'. I appeal to protesters not to disturb normal life. 'Bharat Bandh' needs a different ideological approach,” news agency ANI quoted Bommai as saying on Monday.Click here to read our complete coverage of the Bharat BandhEarlier on Sunday, the Karnataka chief minister sought the cooperation of the farmers union in the state after they extended support for the Bharat Bandh. However, farmers unions in the state have said that every effort was taken to make the bandh a success and also said that around 8,000 people were expected to participate. The state’s minister for transport B Sriramulu said that the buses would continue to operate on Monday. “Under any circumstances there is no question of supporting the bandh. Our buses will ply without any problems and the public will not be inconvenienced,” Sriramulu said, according to a report in HT on Sunday.Meanwhile, the protesting farmer organisations have assured that arrangements have been made for emergency and essential services to be allowed during the strike. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which had called for the strike, said that while offices, educational institutions and commercial establishments would be closed during the bandh, emergency establishments and essential services, including hospitals, medical stores, relief and rescue work and people attending to personal emergencies have been allowed.Also read | Bharat Bandh successful, says Tikait.

The hideout was revealed based on the interrogation of the “last wanted Maoist leader” of Uttarakhand, Bhaskar Pandey, by police, officials said.Thirty-six-year-old Pandey, who was wanted with a bounty of ₹20,000 in a case registered during the 2017 state assembly elections, was arrested in Almora on September 13 in a joint operation by the special task force (STF) of Uttarakhand police and the Almora district police.“Police found the hideout on Sunday from a cave located inside deep and dense forests of Buda Jageshwar area after Pandey revealed its location during his interrogation while in police remand. He used to often used the hideout to stay away from police,” said Pankaj Bhatt, senior superintendent of police, Almora.Bhatt informed, “After tracing the hideout, police found several items from there including some Maoist publicity material, survival kit, tents, sleeping bag and other items of daily need.”Bhatt said that Pandey was taken in police remand for two days on Friday for interrogation. “On Sunday, he revealed his hideout in Hariya top forests in Buda Jageshwar area.”Earlier, when he was arrested, police claimed that he was in touch with the members of the Politburo of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) (CPI(M)) to revive the Maoist movement in the Himalayan state. Pandey, who was in hiding since 2017 after being booked in three cases for trying to provoke the public against the government by putting anti-government posters and burning a government vehicle in an attempt to disrupt the 2017 state assembly polls, was nabbed on September 13 near Haridutt Pethshali Inter-college in Almora. Director general of police, Ashok Kumar, said, “During interrogation, Police came to know that he was in touch with the Politburo members of CPI(M) to revive the Maoist movement in Uttarakhand.”“After trying to disrupt the previous assembly elections, he had plans to do the same in the upcoming assembly polls in 2022 with unlawful activities under Maoist movement. But, before he could succeed, he was nabbed by the police which was planning the dragnet on him for the last few days after getting input about his presence in Almora,” said Kumar. The state top cop also claimed that Pandey had “taken arms training in the jungles of north Bihar in 2012.”“He was the right hand of senior Maoist leader Khin Singh Bora who was the Uttarakhand area commander for CPI(M) who is presently in jail after being arrested in Uttar Pradesh police STF. After his arrest, Pandey was in hiding and visited the state occasionally but was not completely off,” said Kumar, adding that he was also active during the recent farmers’ agitation. “However, he was not found trying to influence the farmers in the Maoist movement,” he added.Kumar also informed that Pandey had joined the banned Maoist organisation in 2006 and was active in the state along with two of his close aides Devendra Chamyal and Bhagwati Bhoj who were already arrested a few years ago from Haldwani. “The names of the Maoist leaders in Uttarakhand had come into light after police busted an arms training camp by the Maoist Communist Centre of India in 2004. Since then, 24 Maoist leaders from the state have been arrested including three in jail, one in police custody, four out on bail, 11 acquitted and four dead. Three of the state Maoist leaders were also arrested in other states including two in Maharashtra and one in UP,” said Kumar. After his arrest, the police recovered two pen drives, two voter IDs, a mobile phone, an Aadhaar card, two books and ₹32,265.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/almora-police-unearth-maoist-hideout-in-cave-inside-forest-101632751127760.html

During the investigation, police found that a 14-year-old girl gave birth to her and threw her in a well. Police apprehended her under Section 302 (murder) of IPC,” said Raghuvansh Bhadoria.During her interrogation, the girl broke down and told the police that she was repeatedly raped by the five between October 2020 and May 2021.The girl’s mother died three years ago and her father is a migrant labourer.Bhadoria said the girl was mostly alone at her village house and her 21-year-old cousin was a frequent visitor. In October 2020, he raped her for the first time. “Later, the brother along with his four friends including two minors raped her many times and threatened her with dire consequences,” the senior police officer said, citing the rape survivor’s statement.One day when she suffered from abdominal pain, she told her cousin that she might be pregnant. He took her to a quack. “The quack confirmed the pregnancy and also gave pills to abort the baby…. She gave birth to a premature baby at home… Later, the main accused helped her in throwing the baby in the well,” the district SP said. Police are trying to verify if anyone helped her deliver the baby at home. Her medical report has indicated that she may have had medical assistance for the delivery.

Inspite of many requests from BJP U hvn't come. As a friend wish your success wherever u r. World is too small.Hope those days will return again when u started your political innings.Responding to Ghosh's tweet, the former actor-turned-BJP MP wrote, “You should focus on ensuring that Mamata Banerjee doesn’t lose from Bhabanipur.”Locket Chatterjee, who forayed into politics on Mamata Banerjee's invitation, left the Trinamool Congress to join the BJP in 2015.She said she was busy focussing on the upcoming assembly polls Uttarakhand as BJP's election in-charge. “There are star campaigners like Dilip Ghosh and Suvendu Adhikari for Bhabanipur bypolls. This election is doubtful for Mamata Banerjee. This is why this fake news is surfacing,” the BJP MP was quoted as saying by news agency.However, going step ahead in replying back to Locket Chatterjee on Twitter, Kunal Ghosh remarked that the BJP MP wishes for chief minister Mamata Banerjee to win the assembly seat with a huge margin.Ha Ha!Don't worry.Mamatadi will win with large margin. U want this also.I know that u hv to write in favour of yr party. But still I thank u that even in this reply also u didn't mention the name of the bjp candidate.कहि पे निगाहे, कहि पे निशाना।Well done. https://t.co/3ew8YnUfP4Chatterjee retorted to Ghosh's jibe by saying, “I think Kunal Ghosh isn't well. He must get well soon and then talk.”The bypoll in Bhabanipur assembly constituency was neccessiated after Trinamool Congress leader Sovandeb Chattopadhyay vacated it recently so that Mamata Banerjee, who became the chief minister despite not winning any seat in the latest assembly election, could contest. Banerjee lost to her former aide Suvendu Adhikari by a thin margin of 1,956 votes from Nandigram constituency. The ballots cast in the bypolls will be counted on October 3.

27-09-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal govt bans cheap sale of fossil souvenirs in Spiti valley||After years of destruction, Himachal Pradesh government has finally banned the cheap sale of marine fossils, dating back to hundreds of years, to tourists visiting the scenic Spiti valley. Marine fossils are found in the hills near Lalung, Mud, Komic, Hikkim and Langza villages of Spiti Valley and sold at rates as low as ₹50 to ₹5,000. The common fossils on sale include coral reefs of the Triassic period (250 to 199 million years old), and ammonoids of the Triassic-Jurassic period (199 to 145 million years old).“Rise in tourist footfall, including from foreign countries, has been leading to the destruction of geological artefacts. Many tourists visiting the valley are aware of the availability of fossils. Some of these are displayed for sale at various eateries and restaurants. Spiti fossil souvenirs are even promoted through blogs, travel sites and other internet platforms and there is a high demand for these,” said Lara Tsering, a travel operator and hotelier in Kaza.Tsering added, “A lot of fossils were also destroyed during the construction of roads and other buildings. State geologist Piyush Guleria said, “Majority of the fossils found in Spiti are marine ones. It’s very significant; it helps to provide details of ancient geography. Steps have to be taken to preserve them.” “The fossils are older than the Himalayas. A lot of studies have been conducted on these fossils. Geologists from the region have been studying the isolation of Indian plate, its collusion and evolution. This provides the geological history of the country,” he said.Spiti valley contains almost a continuous succession, ranging from the Cambrian (542 million to 488 million years old) to the Cretaceous (between 145 million and 65 million year old), making it a popular destination for paleontologists.“We have to stop the exploitation of fossils. Locals promote the sale of fossils. So we have passed an order to prevent the sale of fossils. These will be preserved in the museum; if someone wants to study it, we will allow them to take it on the condition that they return it,” said Mahender Pratap Singh Rana, Kaza sub-divisional magistrate. A museum construction is underway and will be completed by the next year, he added.Some locals too have been making efforts at the preservation of fossils. “We hold camps from time to time to spread awareness among locals about preserving the heritage,” said Rajinder Bodh, a hotelier from Spiti. How the fossils were destroyed over the yearsGiant scorpion trace fossils along with trilobite traces found in Parahio valley have been destroyed during the construction of a road to Pin valley. Giant scorpion traces are unique and found only in Antarctica, Australia and Spiti Valley.During the construction of a canal, the Middle Norian coral reef in Ratangnala, a tributary of the Spiti river, was mined to provide building materials. The excavated earth has covered what is left of the reef.Another geologically significant feature belonging to the era when continents first stabilised, a paleoproterozoic paleosol in Sutlej valley, was exposed during the construction of the Hindustan-Tibet Road in Himachal Pradesh. Walls have been constructed on either side and nothing can be observed now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-govt-bans-cheap-sale-of-fossil-souvenirs-in-spiti-valley-101632748666940.html
27-09-2021||Dehradun||Wadia institute to explore hydrocarbons, study seismic threats in Indian Himalayas||Dehradun-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) is carrying a six-year project named Characterisation and Assessment of surface and sub-surface Processes in the Himalayas (CAP-Himalayas) to study the various aspects of the Himalayas including exploration of hydrocarbons and seismic threats. The project was started in 2020 and will conclude in 2025. It comprises all 55 scientists of the premier institute involved in various studies under the project in various groups depending on the “gravity” of the study they are involved in. Study of surface and sub-surface Himalayan areas Director, WIHG, Kalachand Sain, who is leading the project, informed that the project will help in a “comprehensive study of the surface and sub-surface areas of the Himalayas.”“The project will comprise the Indian Himalayas which covers Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh in the north-western Himalayas and Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh in the north-eastern Himalayas. It is not possible to cover complete areas of the Indian Himalayas, hence we would undertake the study through various stations set up in these states,” said Sain.Sain added, “The scientists will study the surface as well as sub-surface areas of the Himalayas under which the team of scientists will analyse the seismic activities underneath causing earthquakes. The scientists will also study other hazards like landslides and glacial lake outbursts on the surface areas which cause a significant amount of damage to life and property.”Analysing the “one big” possible earthquake in the HimalayasEmphasising the importance of the studies under the six-year project, Sain informed about the possible ‘one big’ earthquake in the Himalayas comprising both Garhwal and Kumaon regions.“In the sub-surface of the Himalayas, the tectonic plates are moving due to which huge amount of energy is being accumulated. However, this energy is unable to get released resulting in the locking of pressure. It is feared that this energy will one day fully get released causing a huge earthquake which has not happened in the last about 600 years in this region comprising Garhwal and Kumaon,” Sain said.“The study will help us understand whether the possible big earthquake will happen or not and what are the other geological processes going on in the sub-surface as the areas where the energy is getting accumulated is about 80-100km in Garhwal and Kumaon. The study will also help in analyse the situation wherein the locked energy is released and in what quantity will it be released and other factors related to it,” said Sain.Exploring hydrocarbons and mineralsThe senior scientist also informed that apart from the study to understand the seismic threats, the scientists will also conduct a study for the exploration of hydrocarbons and minerals in the Himalayas.“One of the major aspects of the project is the exploration of hydrocarbons, minerals or other important natural resources which will help in the country’s development. One group of scientists is involved for the same. They will not only tell whether there is any hydrocarbon available or not but will also inform about its amount. Based on that, other agencies involved in extraction will then work for it,” said Sain.Mitigation of hazards in Uttarakhand HimalayasOne of the important aspects of the undergoing project is to identify the regions vulnerable and susceptible to hazards in the Himalayas like earthquake, landslides and glacial lake outbursts.“This will help in mitigation of natural disasters and minimise the loss of life and property. When we will be aware of the most vulnerable areas to earthquakes or landslides, then we will be able to take the necessary steps to limit the damage. We would then also be able to suggest the building techniques needed to be implemented in those areas so that they could stand to a certain extent in case of an earthquake or landslide, giving time to people to reach a safe place,” said a senior scientist involved in the project.The senior scientist also informed that the extensive project will also cover the study of the biodiversity present millions of years ago in the Himalayas.“This would be done by analysing the sediments and fossils found on the surface of the Himalayas. This will also help in studying the climate and temperature during that period supporting the organisms living there,” said the scientist.Sain, while terming all the above-mentioned aspects as very important, said, “The ultimate goal of the project is to have secured living and meet the societal requirements of the population living in the Himalayas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/wadia-institute-to-explore-hydrocarbons-study-seismic-threats-in-indian-himalayas-101632747946688.html

27-09-2021||Chandigarh||A mother’s prayer of love, ray of hope in bleak times||When my daughter was born, I chose to name her Sehar, the Arabic word for morning. I was exhausted, in a lot of pain and sleep deprived but I did manage to whisper in her ears, “My dawn has arrived in the midst of a cold January night.” I could not sleep that night and for many more nights because raising a child is no child’s play. My groggy eyes and weary body spoke of an ordeal only new mothers can identify with. It was fun to watch her play and gurgle, but it was also challenging to contain her wailing. Sometimes, I was clueless and would look into her eyes for answers only to find none. Together, we would look out for cures and remedies. Thus, we sailed on together. Sehar is twelve and a half now. “A pre-teen!” she tells me with a glint of pride in her eyes. The Covid-19 pandemic brought a new passion in her life: Painting. She always loved to draw and colour but the forced break from school made her take it up in a determined way. She started experimenting with style and texture, improving with every step by watching tutorials on YouTube. Now she goes to school but makes sure that she continues to paint every day, so evenings are reserved for creativity. She is as tall as me and often stakes claim to the prettiest of my dresses, making me relinquish them with a smile. She gives me impromptu hugs on some days and admonishes me on others, particularly if I repeat an instruction. She reminds me of my mom, who is miles apart in Canada and whom I’ve not seen for two years because of the pandemic. I’m grateful for Sehar’s presence in my life. A senior colleague, who is a mother to two college-going daughters, is mindful of every moment she spends with them. “Soon, they will leave the nest to study and see the world. I’ll be left with memories,” she shared the other day. This painful realisation that my daughter will be out there to navigate her own course makes me hold on to her tighter. While I try to conquer my fears, Sehar is engrossed in her colourful world as she lifts the brush from the canvas to dab it in paint. A bright yellow sun, tall coconut trees standing like sentries watching dolphins frolic in the calm, iridescent sea. A morning scene as fresh as her name, coupled with imagination is being created on the canvas. I marvel at this magic of colours and whisper a silent prayer for her. No matter what life holds for her, for me, for us, she will always be my daughter. This thought comforts me and allays my fears. Though distances might separate us, challenges of life might become mammoth on some days, darkness might try to dim the brightness, but the dawn of her name will always shine like a beacon in the bleakest of times. The sound of her name whispered on my lips will be enough to brighten up my mornings. With this ray of hope, I’d like to carry on being a mother to my darling daughter and usher in every new day into our life with love and optimism. ranagill261212@gmail.com The writer is a Hoshiarpur-based veterinarian and author||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-mother-s-prayer-of-love-ray-of-hope-in-bleak-times-101632745186308.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||Court seeks Centre’s stand on cancer patient’s plea to take Covaxin as 2nd dose||The Delhi high court on Monday asked for the Centre response to a plea filed by a cancer patient, seeking instructions to authorities to allow him to get inoculated with Covaxin as the second Covid-19 dose instead of Covishield – which was administered to him as the first one. Mix and match of vaccines against the Covid-19 has lately been a topic of discussion, but the Indian government hasn’t provided any official nod on the same.The petition has been filed by counsel Madhur Mittal – an Opdivo Nivolumab Cancer patient — who is currently undergoing immunotherapy. According to the plea, Mittal was inoculated with Covishield as the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine in March – but developed a severe reaction soon after and was hospitalised for four days.The petitioner further stated that he wished to be fully vaccinated (with both doses of coronavirus vaccine), and owing to prior complications to Covishield administration and as per his doctor’s advice, he has been asked to be jabbed with Covaxin shot as the second dose. However, when Mittal tried to book a slot for the second dose as Covaxin on CoWin, he failed to do so as the web application only allows to book slots in the same Covid-19 vaccine category. This is the case with other coronavirus vaccines approved in India as well, including Covishield.Also Read | 'Mix and match' of Covid-19 vaccines generate robust immune response: Oxford studyThe petitioner mentioned in the plea that he wants to be fully-vaccinated as he wishes to fly to the US for the further treatment of cancer.Mittal was represented in court by lawyers Nitesh Jain, Sanjay S Chhabra and Deepak Agarwal. Delhi High Court Justice Rekha Palli has issued a notice to the Centre asking for its reply and listed the matter for October 28. India is yet to take any stand on the mixing of Covid-19 vaccines, with studies currently underway in Christian Medical College in Vellore, Tamil Nadu to evaluate the results of mixing one dose each of Covishield and Covaxin. Earlier this month, Renu Swaroop, secretary of the Centre's department of biotechnology, had said that more data is required to get a better clarity on the mixing of coronavirus vaccines. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had in August revealed that mix and match of Covishield and Covaxin can produce better results. However, the deduction was achieved after a study was conducted on 18 individuals of Uttar Pradesh, who by mistake got two different vaccines. (With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-seeks-centre-s-stand-on-cancer-patient-s-plea-to-take-covaxin-as-2nd-dose-101632742941368.html
27-09-2021||Pune||Countdown to PMC polls: Kothrud, microcosm of Pune’s macro civic issues||PUNE When Pune began to expand in the 1990s, as residents of the city’s peth areas relocated to Kothrud in search of the “urban upgrade”. A migration of predominantly Maharashtrian families followed, IT employees making up the bulk of the populace.Today, Kothrud, along with Karvenagar, Baner and Bavdhan, faces several issues that are, in a sense, a snapshot of the problems the mega-urban populace of Pune is dealing with.K for KothrudLocal residents say real estate prices have gone up manifold. The Kothrud assembly segment, which covers Karvengar-Warje-Kothrud and Aundh ward offices under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), is mainly dominated by the BJP, with 18 corporators in Kothrud from the BJP and six from other parties Tanmayee Joshi, a 21-year-old IT student and resident of Mahatma Society, says: “The traffic problem eased out in the past one year, but that was mainly due to Covid-19 when roads were mostly deserted. Besides traffic, there is a need for proper garbage disposal.” When residents here gave the decisive mandate to the BJP from these parts, the party wresting power from the NCP in 2017, they thought many of their problems will ease. However, problems like traffic and the slow pace of the multi-level flyover at Chandani chowk, are still worries. The Metro work on the Vanaz to Nal-stop route offers some hope in terms of the robust public transport infrastructure missing in Kothrud (also across the city). Although the Metro trials from Vanaz to Idea colony are currently underway, Maha-Metro officials say commercial operations on this stretch will take time to get going. “The Metro rail option is really good and we are all eagerly waiting for it to start operations,” said Joshi. For Vishal Shelke, an IT professional living near Gandhi Bhavan in Dahanukar Colony , the situation in his ward is more or less same as it used to be five years ago. “As a citizen, if I am paying taxes, I expect good roads, footpaths and cleanliness in my area. Sadly, it is all missing as roads are dug up all the time. Five years ago we hoped to see some transformation. What we have witnessed is more or less the same situation that unfolded between 2012-2017,” said Shelke.For many elected members the Metro in their area, built by state government with Centre and PMC contributing financially, is the future. The second major achievement highlighted by members is the under-construction multi-level flyover at Chandani chowk. It is being executed by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) after Union minister Nitin Gadkari pushed for it with former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also expediting approvals at the local levels. The project has been delayed as the PMC was not able to acquire the required land in time. The BJP leaders defended the work saying corporators have done a remarkable job in the past five years. Sandeep Khardekar, BJP spokesperson, said, “the situation in Kothrud has definitely improved in the past five years with major projects like Metro rail, flyovers at Chandani chowk and Nal stop coming up. It’s going to ease traffic on a large scale.” In parts of Baner, Balewadi and Aundh, PMC has carried out various projects to improve the localities, including smart footpaths, roads and beautification of public spots. These projects were carried out mostly under the Smart City mission. Citizens, however, are confused by roads and footpaths being dug up repeatedly, besides hawkers are seen encroaching on the roads. Citizens claim that the municipal corporation not carrying out any action against the hawkers. Dinesh Kelkar, a resident of Mayur colony area said, “I work with a multinational company and travel abroad frequently. However, I have seen repeated road digging work. Even in Mumbai there is less road and footpath digging.” Another problem faced by citizens is encroachments and illegal constructions. A senior citizens retired from government service, asking that his name be withheld, said, “The PMC is doing an injustice to the middle class, which voted for it. If you roam around, in many areas, illegal construction activity exists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/countdown-to-pmc-polls-kothrud-microcosm-of-pune-s-macro-civic-issues-101632743508316.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||Residents of Maharashtra’s Badlapur wake up to strong smell of chemicals||Residents of Badlapur in Maharashtra’s Thane district woke up once again to the foul stench of chemicals which was being released in several parts of the city since Sunday night. Officials are yet to identify the cause of the smell. Residents of areas like Katrap, Manjarli, Belavli complained of a strong smell of chemicals in the area leading to suffocation throughout the night, officials said. Followed by several complaints, a fire brigade team of Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council (KBMC) examined the industrial area and other regions. “We did not find any discharge into the waterbody or emission of gas from any company but there was a strong smell in the air. Our team kept checking all the areas till late night,” said Bhagwat Sonone, fire officer, Badlapur. Sharda Narekar, 24, a resident of Patil Nagar, Majarli (West) said, “The smell was very strong from 9 to 12 pm and it was very suffocating. These incidents are repeated often in Badlapur and we have complained about it several times in the past.” “We are checking the cause of the smell and are yet to come to a conclusion. If there is any violation, action will be taken,” said an officer of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Kalyan division. Earlier in June, followed by a gas leak in Badlapur, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) Kalyan division sent closure directions to a private company. The sudden gas leak spread across three kilometres and caused panic among the residents of Shirgaon Badlapur MIDC area. The gas leak led to suffocation and eye irritation among many residents following which they moved out of their houses and complained of suffocation, coughing, and eye irritation. The gas leak was caused by overheating of sulphuric acid and benzene acid which led to a chemical reaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/residents-of-maharashtra-s-badlapur-wake-up-to-strong-smell-of-chemicals-101632741887525.html

The Hisar-Chandigarh highway was blocked near Kandela village in Jind and the Hisar-Rohtak highway was blocked near Madina toll plaza in Meham. The protesters sat on rail tracks in Jhajjar, Bahadurgarh, Fatehgarh in Dadri and at Ramayana toll plaza in Hisar. Bus stands of Hisar, Rohtak, Jind and Sonepat wore a deserted look, and many buses were seen parked at the bus terminus itself. Commuters used village link roads to reach their destinations. SKM leader Inderjit Singh said, “Shopkeepers and small factory owners also shut their establishments in support of farmers till 4pm. We occupied highways and rail tracks to raise our voice though medical staff and ambulances were allowed passage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bharat-bandh-farmers-hold-peaceful-protest-in-haryana-101632741706078.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||World Tourism Day: Knocking at Delhi’s gateway to history||The Delhi government’s plan to beautify entry points of the Capital, in order to make the city more aesthetically appealing, is finally set to take off. As part of this, five entry points will be beautified, and sculptures as well as large LCD screens will be placed on 200 metre stretches here. These points will include the borders at Gurugram, Tikri Kalan, Ghazipur, Apsara, and Anand Vihar near Kaushambi. But when has Delhi ever been a stranger to entry point/gates (darwaza)? An integral part of the city’s history and architecture, its gates have often piqued the interest of denizens as well as tourists. Back in 1911, when the British Empire shifted the Capital from then Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi, it’s recorded that the city was surrounded by 14 gates! Out of these, only four have survived the test of time. These are namely — Kashmere Gate, Delhi Gate, Ajmeri Gate and Turkman Gate.“A European merchant from 17th century, William Finch described Delhi as the city of 7 cities and 52 gates,” exclaims Eshan Sharma, founder of a student led heritage exploration initiative named Karwaan. He adds, “The walled city of Shahjahanabad had, for example, 14 gates! One would leave from the Delhi Darwaza to reach straight to the original Delhi, which was Mehrauli. Similarly, Lahori Gate (Darwaza) led to Lahore. Such was the orientation of these two gates of Red Fort.”All these gates have their own narratives seeped in history, which comes together to shape what’s today known as Delhi’s rich cultural heritage. The 19th and 20th century historians refer to Shahjahanabad as modern or New Delhi. Author and historian Rana Safvi has explored the historicity of Delhi’s gates in her book Where Stones Speak: Historical Trails in Mehrauli, the First City of Delhi. She says, “When Shah Jahan built Shahjahanabad, he built the city’s gates and named them after the areas they led to — Lahori Gate, Kashmiri Gate, Ajmeri Gate, Kabuli Gate. In fact, there still is one gate, that is Delhi Gate, which was the odd one out, and that’s when you realise that the Delhi here refers to the old city of Mehrauli, and not Shahjahanabad!” Similarly, the Turkman Gate also has a rather interesting anecdote behind its name. “Turkman Darwaza was the only one of the 13 gates that gave access into the walled city of Shahjahanabad, which was named after a saint and not the city that the road led to,” informs Safvi, adding, “Shah Turkman Bayabani, also known as Dada Pir, was a very famous saint who died in 1240. As his name indicates, he lived in the then unin (bayaban) habited part of the city, which we know now as Delhi and thus the term. Today, that area is densely populated and his dargah is lost somewhere inside an area called Mohalla Qabristan. A smaller dargah adjacent to the Chandni Mahal police chowki is wrongfully attributed to him. People flock it thinking it’s the shrine of the famous 13th century saint. The Dada Pir meanwhile sleeps a little further ahead and deep inside the residential area. Gone is his bayaban!” These gates of Delhi have been such an intriguing subject for not just Delhiites but also tourists. And that has inspired some special heritage walks which talk about the history of multiple gates during their course. Ramit Mitra from DelhiByFoot, who conducts one such walk, shares, “There’s a nearly four hours walk where we talk about gates of Delhi and their structures. We start at Ajmeri Gate and make the participants touch three gates during the walk. After Ajmeri Gate, we go along the walls and enter the city for a brief while. Then, we go to the Turkman Gate, and later we again go into the city for a bit, and finally we exit towards Delhi Gate.... Participants of this walk often get to know the now forgotten or lesser known lifestyle and culture of Delhi.” The Four Gates of Delhi, today!Kashmere Gate: This gate was attacked when the British conquered Delhi again, during the Indian Uprising of 1857. The British stormed Kashmere Gate and entered the city of Delhi. Delhi Gate: It’ believed that two criminals were killed, and their bodies were buried in the foundation of the Delhi Gate. This is one of 14 gates that was originally built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.Ajmeri Gate: This gate was named Ajmeri Gate because of the road from it that led straight to Ajmer in Rajasthan. Ajmer was renowned for being a Sufi pilgrimage town, back in those days. Turkman Gate: This gate was named after Sufi saint Hazrat Shah Turkman Bayabani. And it’s this historical place that played a major role during the emergency of 1975. A massive demolition drive took place here.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/world-tourism-day-knocking-at-delhi-s-gateway-to-history-101632740543849.html
27-09-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: A hill replaced by a garden or park is lost for ever||PUNE Around 10 years ago, when the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and forest department put up a proposal to construct an open air amphitheatre and bird watching post near the quarry at Vetal Tekdi, it met with a stiff resistance. Those opposing the proposal were citizens from Deccan and nearby areas, and regular tekdi goers. The proposal could not move forward. Since then many such proposals were moved to artificially develop Pune’s hills, with some of them getting cleared, and the others bringing locals at loggerheads with the civic administration. The latest getting the attention – and opposition – is the Development Plan for Taljai hills. Located in the southern part of Pune, Taljai hill has a rich biodiversity, wildlife and is one of the biggest that the city has. The proposed development plan that involves beautification of the hill has attracted opposition from residents who say the move has posed a great danger to the ecology of the hill, located in Sahakarnagar, and visited by morning and evening-goers in large numbers. The hills in Pune - be it Taljai, Chaturshrungi hill, Vetal tekdi or Hanuman tekdi, - should be retained as hills are an extended part of forests. Turning them into gardens may make them aesthetically beautiful, but it will take away their soul and ecological sanctity.Already the PMC has constructed a stadium on five acres of Taljai hill. The project worth ₹120 crore also includes seven theme-based gardens such as Nakshatra, bamboo, local species (Ran Mewa), another cricket stadium for women, gymnasium, study room and solar panel covered parking lot on 120 acres of area. The project was originally proposed around two years ago when locals along with some politicos opposed it. The issue has resurfaced now as a detailed project report has been submitted to PMC standing committee, whose nod will facilitate work at the hill. To oppose the project, locals carried out signature campaign. The signature campaign carried out by locals under the banner of Taljai Bachav Abhiyan received a good response on Sunday, an indication that a large number of people, for whom PMC is claiming to be developing the hill, are not happy with the proposal. The locals want the hill to be retained as a hill, as an additional development work will further increase human activity and would frighten the birds. The project will no doubt attract more crowd, noise and litter in the area, that has already seen large number of vehicles every day. Besides crowding, the project threatens soil erosion too. Already, the PMC and state administration has failed to save hills surrounding Pune, which is surrounded by the Katraj ghats on the southern side and Dive ghat on its east. Most areas on hills at Katraj are dotted with unauthorised construction of hutments. The PMC, forest department or district administration neither have the machinery nor the funds to stop the mushrooming of illegal constructions. The 978 hectares of land on the hills around Pune which constitute the biodiversity park (BDP) zone of Pune, is considered to serve as the lungs for the city. The state government has entrusted PMC to retain the greenery on these hills by implementing a Bio-Diversity Park (BDP), even as the civic body is finding it difficult. The city has already lost hill after hill in the construction boom over the last few decades. Pune’s topography stands defined by the majesty of the Sahyadri hills around it. The politicians and bureaucrats along with people have taken them granted as they witness various activities. If we do not protect whatever is left, the future generations won’t forgive us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-a-hill-replaced-by-a-garden-or-park-is-lost-for-ever-101632740086461.html

He appealed to protesters to remain peaceful. Rajewal, who is sitting on protest at the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway near Delhi, said that other than the north-eastern states, there are reports of support to the bandh from the country. Consensus eludes Centre, farmers Seeking withdrawal of the laws, farmer unions have been protesting since September last year and on November 26, they moved to the Tikri and Singhu borders of the national capital to build pressure on the Centre. Subsequently, 32 farmer outfits formed the SKM that is now driving the protest. Several rounds of talks between Union ministers and the SKM have failed to reach a consensus over the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bharat-bandh-blockades-at-500-sites-bring-life-to-halt-in-punjab-101632733125358.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||Bharat Bandh: No impact in Mumbai, extra force not deployed, say police||The Mumbai Police said that Monday's Bharat Bandh showed no significant impact in the city, with shops, commercial establishments and local transport operating as usual. The police also said that they did not deploy an extra security force at key junctions and roads.The 10-hour Bharat Bandh has been called by Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella organisation of 40 farmer unions, to mark the first anniversary of the passage of three farm laws by Parliament. The farmers have been protesting near national capital Delhi since November last year, demanding that the three laws be scrapped.They have tried to intensify the agitation by undertaking different exercises, like Republic Day rally etc. Bharat Bandh is the latest attempt by the protesters to push their demand of the withdrawal of the three central laws.A few Congress workers, holding placards, assembled at some places like Andheri and Jogeshwari and shouted slogans against the farm bills, but other than that there was no impact of the bandh in the city so far, news agency PTI reported quoting a Mumbai Police official."Till now, no extra force has been been deployed, but it may be placed as per local requirement," the official said.The Centre and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers' protest. But the impasse is still continuing with the farmers refusing to end their protest.The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 - came into existence as laws after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent on September 27 last year.Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the 'mandi' and the MSP (minimum support price) procurement systems and leave cultivators at the mercy of big corporates. The government, however, has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced and asserted that these steps will help increase farmers' income.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bharat-bandh-no-impact-in-mumbai-extra-force-not-deployed-say-police-101632731816169.html

This time also we are in support of genuine farmers but not on strike because our members are in deep distress due to shrinking earnings in pandemic times," said Rajender Soni, general secretary of the Delhi Auto Taxi Union.The Sarvoday Driver Association of Delhi, representing many drivers of cab aggregator platforms, also supported the farmers but did not join the strike."We are in support of the farmers but our work was affected due to the pandemic and we cannot afford to go in their support by striking," said Kamaljeet Gill, president of the Association.Other auto and taxi unions expressed the same sentiment."We fully support the farmers. But in view of the financial crisis faced by us due to Covid, we are extending our moral and in-principle support to them and their demand while working normally," said Anuj Rathor, secretary of the Rashtriya Rajdhani Kshetra Auto Drivers Association.Markets and shops in the city were open as farmers have not contacted our associations for any strike, said Brijesh Goyal, chairman of the Chamber of Trade and Industry(CTI)."Also, the festival season is approaching and its time for traders to recover some of the losses they faced due to the pandemic and lockdown. Although we support the farmers and urge the government to meet their demand," he said.The traders support farmers and their demands but they were not in a position to close down shops because they were already in trouble due to the adverse impact of the pandemic on their trade and businesses, he added.The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers' protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.The three laws -- The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- were passed by Parliament in September last year.Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the 'mandi' and the MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced and asserted that these steps will help increase farmers' income.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bharat-bandh-auto-taxis-operate-normally-in-delhi-shops-open-101632721924349.html

27-09-2021||Chandigarh||Charanjit Channi-led new Punjab cabinet bears Rahul Gandhi’s stamp||When the Congress high command effected a change of guard to give Punjab its first Scheduled Caste chief minister in Charanjit Singh Channi, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s stamp was unmistakable. The cabinet expansion undertaken by the new chief minister is no different. Rahul’s signature is instantly recognisable in the induction of the six new faces into the council of ministers even though it comes with just six months to go for the state elections. The induction of Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Gurkirat Singh Kotli, Randeep Singh Nabha, Pargat Singh and Raj Kumar Verka in Channi’s team with Navjot Singh Sidhu as the state Congress president is being seen as a move towards generational shift in the party - the former Congress chief’s favourite mantra. The names of the six new entrants – four of whom have direct access to Rahul – after Channi’s flying visits to Delhi for back-to-back meetings with the former Congress chief, general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other central leaders. All of them, except Gilzian, are below 60 and their entry is expected to bring fresh energy into the party left divided by a bitter tussle between Capt Amarinder and Sidhu. “He (Rahul) likes to make his moves and backed Sunil Jakhar for the chief minister’s post. When his bold move faced opposition from a section of the party, he pushed Channi. The induction is his way of bringing change,” says a Rahul admirer. However, several party leaders also see Sidhu’s hand behind these changes as he was pushing four of the six fresh inductees were critics of his bête noire Capt Amarinder Singh. Besides Pargat who is his close confidant, Warring, Gilzian and Kotli had sided with him. “Sidhu has had his say, but not much as he would have liked. The high command has done some tightrope walking and retained several ministers who were close to Amarinder in an attempt to keep its flock together,” said a senior party leader who did not want to be named. The caste and regional were other factors at play in the induction of new ministers. Of the six fresh faces, four – Warring, Nabha, Pargat and Kotli are Jat Sikhs whereas Verka is a Valmiki and Gilzian is from the other backward classes (OBCs). There was no OBC minister in the Amarinder Singh cabinet and Gilzian’s induction has filled the gap. The new cabinet has 9 ministers are from Malwa, six from Majha and three from Doaba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charanjit-channi-led-new-punjab-cabinet-bears-rahul-gandhi-s-stamp-101632690101408.html
27-09-2021||Chandigarh||The six new faces in Punjab cabinet and the comeback man||SANGAT SINGH GILZIAN (68) Constituency: UrmarThe three-time legislator from the Urmar assembly segment in the Doaba region has had quite a long political journey, rising from a sarpanch to minister. Gilzian, who belongs to the Lubana community, was the first to publicly oppose then chief minister Capt Amarinder by quitting all party posts over lack of representation to other backward classes (OBCs) in the sate cabinet and remained one of his most vocal critics throughout. Gilzian was appointed Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) working president two months ago. He had met Rahul and requested for his induction in the cabinet. PARGAT SINGH (57) Constituency: Jalandhar CanttThe two-time MLA from Jalandhar Cantt and former India hockey captain is general secretary (organisation) of the Punjab Congress. A confidant of former cricketer and state party president Navjot Singh Sidhu, Pargat kept attacking the erstwhile chief minister Amarinder Singh over alleged gaps in governance. Pargat was director, sports, when he was persuaded by Akalis to take the political plunge. He won the election on Shiromani Akali Dal ticket but joined the Congress before the 2017 assembly elections. The biggest strength of Pargat, seen as the “voice of reason” in Sidhu’s team, is his levelheadedness. RANA GURJIT SINGH (69) Constituency: Kapurthala The businessman-turned-politician represents the Kapurthala assembly segment. The three-time MLA was power and irrigation minister in the Amarinder Singh-led government for 10 months but was forced to resign after his name figured in a sand mine auction controversy. Rana was considered close to former chief minister Amarinder Singh and has had access to several central leaders of the Congress all along. He was the richest candidate in the 2017 state assembly elections. The Kapurthala MLA has also represented the Jalandhar Lok Sabha constituency from 2004 to 2009.AMRINDER SINGH RAJA WARRING (43) Constituency: Gidderbaha Known for being vocal on different issues, the two-time MLA was initially handpicked by senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Warring, who has remained national president of the Youth Congress, won for two consecutive terms in 2012 and 2017 from Gidderbaha, earlier an Akali stronghold that was represented by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal for five terms and Manpreet Singh Badal four times. In 2012, he defeated Manpreet, then a Peoples Party of Punjab (PPP) candidate. Warring unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Bathinda against Harsimrat Kaur Badal. He has questioned Manpreet’s functioning as finance minister and is considered close to state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu. RAJ KUMAR VERKA (58) Constituency: Amritsar West (reserved)The three-time MLA has been representing the Amritsar West (reserved) constituency since 2012. Verka, who was a strong contender for a ministerial berth when the Congress led by Capt Amarinder Singh came to power in 2017, was made chairman of the Punjab State Warehousing Corporation in 2019 with a cabinet rank. Also, he remained vice-chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes from 2010 to 2016. He started his political career in 2002 when he won from the Verka assembly constituency. He, however, lost in the 2007 assembly polls and shifted to the Amritsar West segment in 2012. GURKIRAT SINGH KOTLI (47) Constituency: KhannaHailing from a staunch Congress family, Gurkirat Singh Kotli is grandson of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh. His father Tej Parkash Singh remained transport minister in the Congress government in the state from 2002 to 2007. Kotli is two-time MLA from the Khanna constituency and heads the Vidhan Sabha’s petitions committee. A loyalist of former CM Capt Amarinder Singh, Kotli shifted towards Navjot Singh Sidhu when the high command appointed the latter as the state Congress president. In 2019, he opposed the Centre’s move to commute death sentence of his grandfather’s assassin Balwant Singh Rajoana. RANDEEP SINGH NABHA (54) Constituency: Amloh Nabha, who has been a legislator for four consecutive terms, represents the Amloh constituency since 2012. He won from the Nabha constituency, where he hails from, in 2002 and 2007. He shifted to the Amloh segment after Nabha was declared a reserved seat due to delimitation. Son of former revenue minister Gurdarshan Singh, Randeep is a keen golfer and was in race for cabinet berth since the Congress formed government in 2017. Even as he has had good terms with Lok Sabha MP and former Union minister Preneet Kaur, Randeep could not get into the good books of former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/the-six-new-faces-in-punjab-cabinet-and-the-comeback-man-101632689621453.html
27-09-2021||Chandigarh||Congress govt in Punjab delivered on most poll promises: Deputy CM Soni||Newly appointed Punjab deputy chief minister OP Soni on Sunday said the Congress government in the state has delivered on most of the promises made in the run-up to the 2017 assembly elections. Addressing traders in Amritsar, Soni, who held the medical education and research portfolio in the erstwhile Captain Amarinder Singh cabinet, said, “We will deliver on the remaining promises in the coming months. We will form government in 2022 again and work for the welfare of the people of Punjab.” Now, the industrialists and traders don’t need to stage protests as the government will fix their problems within stipulated time, he added. The Amritsar Distributors’ Association apprised the deputy CM of various problems the traders were facing. On this, Soni said, “All kind of facilities will be provided to the traders under one roof and they don’t need to make rounds of government offices.” The last one-and-a-half years, he said, have been challenging for all sections of society, but the state government extended all possible help to people during this period. “The role of the industrialists and traders has been praiseworthy as they helped people when needed. Also, they make a major contribution to the taxes collected by the government which is duty-bound not to let them face any problem,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-govt-in-punjab-delivered-on-most-poll-promises-deputy-cm-soni-101632689503568.html
27-09-2021||Chandigarh||6 Punjab Congress MLAs oppose tainted MLA Rana Gurjit Singh’s comeback as minister||Hours before the swearing-in of the new Punjab cabinet, six MLAs from Doaba on Sunday shot off a letter to state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, demanding that Kapurthala MLA Rana Gurjit Singh be dropped from the list of ministers over his alleged involvement in corruption. A copy of the letter was also marked to chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, it is learnt. The ruling party legislators said the cabinet berth instead should be given to a Dalit leader from the region. The party, however, went ahead with Rana Gurjit’s swearing-in as minister. The six MLAs are Navtej Singh Cheema (Sultanpur Lodhi), Sukhpal Singh Khaira (Bholath), Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal (Phagwara), Bawa Henry (Jalandhar North) and Pawan Adiya (Sham Chaurasi). Though they claimed that former Punjab Congress unit chief Mohinder Singh Kaypee was also part of the dissenting group, the latter said he had not signed the letter. An MLA, who didn’t wish to be named, said the group also met Sidhu over the issue in Patiala on Sunday afternoon.In 2018, Rana Gurjit, who then held power and irrigation portfolios in the Amarinder Singh cabinet, was dropped as minister amid a controversy over sand mining auction. In the letter, the MLAs said he was dropped due to a mining scandal involving him, his family and his companies. “The Punjab government had forfeited ₹25 crore deposited by his front company Rajbir Enterprises for the auction of 3 sand-mining sites in Punjab. The Justice Narang commission brought out a startling fact that Rajbir Enterprises had received ₹5 crore gratification for the said mining auction from Gurinder Singh, who was charged by the vigilance bureau in an alleged irrigation scam,” the letter read. “It is amusing that the three ministers proposed to be included in the cabinet from Doaba were Jat Sikhs and an OBC (Other Backward Caste) Sikh, whereas there is approximately 38% Dalit population in the belt. We all request you to immediately drop Rana Gurjit’s name and instead include a clean Dalit face in view of the upcoming elections,” the letter concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/6-punjab-congress-mlas-oppose-tainted-mla-rana-gurjit-singh-s-comeback-as-minister-101632689381903.html
27-09-2021||Chandigarh||Team Channi: 15 take oath in Punjab cabinet rejig, Rana Gurjit in despite protest||Chandigarh Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi inducted 15 ministers on Sunday to expand his cabinet amid an outpouring of dissent against some of those selected for ministerial berths. Channi, who took charge along with two deputies in a sudden change of guard a week ago, inducted six new faces in his cabinet and retained eight, mostly senior ones, from the Capt Amarinder Singh-led setup, besides bringing back former minister Rana Gurjit Singh whose inclusion triggered protests by some party leaders. The new entrants have come in place of five ministers who were embroiled in controversies during the previous administration and have been dropped. The ministers, all in the cabinet rank – were administered the oath of office and secrecy by governor Banwarilal Purohit in the presence of the chief minister and his two deputies Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni at a ceremony held at Raj Bhavan here. Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu were also present whereas former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh stayed away. The shake-up, carried out after several rounds of discussions, is being seen as a step towards a generational shift under former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who approved the new team, and Navjot Singh Sidhu with several relatively young legislators making it to the new cabinet sworn in less than five months before the state assembly polls. The new faces inducted into the cabinet include Randeep Singh Nabha, Raj Kumar Verka, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Pargat Singh, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Gurkirat Singh Kotli. Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat said this exercise has been done to bring in young faces and strike a social and regional balance. However, there was drama till the eleventh hour and the party high command made a last-minute change among the new faces approved a day earlier after Randeep Singh Nabha, a four-time MLA, lodged a strong protest against his non-inclusion, citing his seniority. The Amloh MLA was added to the list in place of Punjab Congress working president Kuljit Singh Nagra, a two-time MLA from Fatehgarh Sahib. “I have decided not to be part of the cabinet, as I had earlier submitted my resignation on farmer’s issue. I stand with farmers’ agitation,” Kujit Nagra tweeted after his name was dropped.There were also vociferous protests by some party MLAs and other leaders against Kapurthala MLA Rana Gurjit’s inclusion before the oath-taking ceremony. Six legislators from Doaba, the region to which he belongs, shot off a letter to Sidhu, demanding that he should not be sworn in due to his alleged involvement in corruption. His proposed cabinet slot should go to a Dalit leader from the region instead, the protesting MLAs said, claiming his inclusion would give a wrong message. They also met Sidhu at his Patiala residence. Ferozepur City MLA Parminder Singh Pinky also opposed the induction of those facing allegations and holding posting in the party. However, the Congress leadership went ahead with his induction to complete the new chief minister’s team. In the 18-member state cabinet, 9 ministers are from Malwa, six from Majha and three from Doaba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/team-channi-15-take-oath-in-punjab-cabinet-rejig-rana-gurjit-in-despite-protest-101632687401304.html

According to police, some people broke into the office and took away air conditioners, almirahs and other material. A few suspects have been rounded up for questioning. In an open letter to the investors, the GBP management stated that due to the pandemic outbreak and countrywide lockdown, they were forced to abandon the projects. “There is a temporary liquidity crunch in the company, mostly due to the onslaught of Covid,” the letter reads.Admitting that they are out of the country to meet probable investors and seek investments, the management stated that the operations will be back on track soon and they are fully committed to fulfil promises made to the investors.The realty firm has several ongoing projects in Mohali. Among them, Camelia, offering both residential and commercial units, in Kharar, and GBP Centrum (commercial) in Zirakpur have been under construction since 2016.At two other projects – Athens (residential and commercial) and Aeroze (residential) – both on the Airport Road, construction has not progressed for years, and at a residential colony in New Chandigarh, where plots have been sold, construction has not even begun.Last week, Global conglomerate SRAM & MRAM Group pulled out its ₹700-crore investment committed to the GBP Group.

It will come up on 3.5 acres of MC land at Industrial Area in Phase-8-B. The agenda will be tabled for approval at the General House meeting on September 28. Deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi said that this step in being taken as the mayor had promised a stray cattle free city. He added that it has been observed that local dairy owners let their cattle stray out on roads for grazing after milking them, which inconveniences the public. “We have earmarked 3.5 acres of land to set up the shed, where local dairy owners will be given space to tie their cattle and milk them. Space will be allotted as per the number of cattle owned by them. They won’t be allowed to let the cattle out in the open ,” he added. Mohali mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu said, “We have pledged to make Mohali roads free of stray cattle, because of which we have expedited the cattle catching activity and imposed penalty to the tune of ₹10,000 on repeat offenders. The penalty will be imposed as per the Model Punjab Municipal (Registration, proper Control of Stray Animals and compensation to the Victim of Animal Attack) Bye-Laws, 2020.” In 2016, the then mayors of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula had met and set up a co-ordination committee to work out cross border problems, especially relating to stray dogs.

It stated that even two decades ago, water supply hours were 4am to 9am and 4pm to 9pm and around two hours in the afternoon. However, for the last five years, it has been reduced to 5am to 9am and 5pm to 9pm, without any supply in the afternoon. The pressure is so low that water hardly reaches ground floor, it stated. SK Nayar, president of the association, said, “Areas receiving water from Industrial Area Phase 1 water works (Sector 12A and parts of Sectors 14 15 and 19; Phases 1 and 2) are becoming difficult for residents to live in.” He said that there has been no water supply to first and second floors of houses and shops for the last decade. Nayar said that they have made requests to officials like chief administrator, chief engineer and superintending engineer of HSVP and Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta to get the issues resolved, but there has been no improvement. However, Gupta has denied any such problem of water shortage. He said, “Since the time we have started getting water supply from Kajauli water works, there has been no shortage of water in the district. Rather, we have ample supply. Only those residents are complaining of low pressure at third floor, who have motors in their houses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-residents-decry-water-shortage-101632685428640.html

27-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Monsoon retreat expected in first week of October||Monsoon withdrawal from Chandigarh is likely to begin in the first week of October and heavy showers, like those seen in the past few days, will remain unlikely, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The normal date for monsoon’s retreat from the city is September 23, but over the past few years, it has been getting delayed frequently.Last year, it was announced on September 30. “This time around, monsoon may vacate the region only in the first week of October. The delay is due to the recent formation of the low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal and a cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan, which brought rains over the entire region,” said Manmohan Singh, director, IMD, Chandigarh.According to the IMD, monsoon withdrawal is announced when no rain is recorded in the whole region for four to five days in a row and an anticyclonic movement starts to form over the region. In the past decade, it was most delayed in 2013 when it was declared on October 17. According to Singh, chances of light rain up to 20mm can continue till the end of September, but the intensity will be low. The maximum temperature will hover between 33°C and 34°C, and the minimum temperature will remain around 25-26°C. Since the onset of monsoon in June, the city has recorded around 600mm rain, which is about 30% deficient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-monsoon-retreat-expected-in-first-week-of-october-101632685240914.html

It was seen as a major initiative to bring people closer to renewable energy resources.Officials said since March this year, PEDA invited bidders at least twice for solar photovoltaic (SPV) power plant in Bathinda, but there has been no progress. Chief executive officer of PEDA NPS Wadhwa and additional director, off-grid rooftop solar power scheme, Jaspal Singh declined to comment.Manpreet’s media coordinator Harjot Sidhu said he is unaware of the development in the mega project.Bathinda municipal commissioner Bikram Shergill said last year, the local body did a survey of urban slums for the installation of rooftop solar panels. “But neither the Bathinda district administration nor the corporation has made any list of the proposed beneficiaries under the project that was conceptualised by the finance minister,” said Shergill.Officials said at the time of preparing a blueprint, it was planned that the state government will provide ₹60 crore and the remaining ₹40 crore will be demanded from the Centre to boost the alternative source of energy.Requesting anonymity, a senior functionary of PEDA said the proposal is “too political to implement”.“Depending upon the power consumption requirement and space available for the installation of panels, PEDA will provide the infrastructure to households. Identifying beneficiaries in a transparent manner will be important as assembly elections are around the corner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/7-months-on-rs-100-crore-solar-power-project-for-ews-households-in-bathinda-fails-to-take-off-101632684760714.html

Sukhbir, who addressed party functions across three assembly constituencies in Ludhiana, said if voted to power, the SAD-BSP will review all decisions taken by the Congress government in the next three months “as every step taken in the current scenario is questionable”. “We will establish a special commission to look into their misdeeds. King of sand mafia Rana Gurjeet Singh has been made a minister in the state cabinet. Similarly, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring courted controversy when his brother-in-law was booked for abetment to suicide. Former Punjab CM Beant Singh’s grandson Gurkirat Singh Kotli was involved in molesting a French tourist, Katia,” said Sukhbir. He added that the reason behind the Congress appointing tainted ministers is very clear as they are in a hurry to grab and loot money from the people in three months before the assembly elections. Earlier, Sukhbir visited Jain School at the Daresi ground and the Shanglawala Shivala Mandir and the Gyan Sthal Mandir in Ludhiana (Central) constituency. He also visited various localities in the Ludhiana West constituency, besides attending an interaction with industrialists and doctors in Model town. He also met residents in Atam Nagar. Answering a query, the SAD president said the party had welcomed the appointment of Charanjit Singh Channi as the CM. “But it is painful to see that the new CM is being overshadowed by state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu as well as deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. It is also unfortunate that Channi does not have any say in the governance. All decisions – be it choosing the cabinet or the chief secretary, State police chief and the advocate general, are being taken by others. Files are only put before Channi for his signatures. This is not befitting the dignity of the high office. The Congress should respect the office of the chief minister by allowing Channi take his own decisions and not treat him as a rubber stamp.” “Bharat Bhushan Ashu was known to be the most corrupt food and civil supplies minister in the history of the state. Besides indulging in corruption involving government purchase of wheat from outside the state, the minister has presided over the disappearance of stored food grain. In Ludhiana city also, Ashu is known to have taken over all government tenders,” Sukhbir alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-accuses-cong-of-appointing-tainted-legislators-as-minsters-101632684222737.html
27-09-2021||Chandigarh||Turf war with Channi cost Balbir Sidhu his cabinet berth, say party insiders||Former health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, who failed to find a place in the new Punjab cabinet on Sunday, paid the price for his closeness to former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and strained relations with the incumbent, Charanjit Singh Channi, according to party insiders.Channi and Sidhu have been engaged in a turf war for two decades, which first surfaced when the former was the Kharar MC president and latter had contested the assembly elections from Kharar in 2002. The rift only widened with time, say sources within the party. Since 2007, Sidhu has won the Mohali seat three times in a row, and after the Congress formed the government in 2017, he was awarded with a cabinet berth. His clout kept increasing under Amarinder’s tutelage, and even his brother Amarjit Singh Sidhu managed to get elected as the Mohali mayor this year.However, the municipal polls again pitted Sidhu against Channi, who too had fielded his brother Sukhwant Singh Sukha from Kharar. After Sukha’s loss, Channi apparently blamed Sidhu, said a senior Congress leader, who did not wish to be named. “Why will Channi now make two power centres in Mohali by inducting Sidhu in the cabinet,” said the party leader.‘Paid price for closeness to Capt’Former Congress district president Rajinder Singh Rana said: “Sidhu’s closeness to Capt Amarinder cost him the cabinet berth. But, the high command should consider seniority and not personal grudges.”Deepinder Singh Dhillon, president, district Congress committee, Mohali, said Sidhu led from the front as the health minister, and looking at his seniority, he should have been included in the cabinet.Mohali deputy mayor Kuljeet Singh Bedi said: “How can the high command ignore a senior person, who has done exemplary work as a minister and played an important role in Mohali’s development. His exclusion is Mohali’s loss.”Addressing the media on Sunday, Sidhu too got emotional and said: “What was my fault? I have worked hard as a minister during Covid-19.” He said he may not be a minister anymore, but the people of Mohali will remain his strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/turf-war-with-channi-cost-balbir-sidhu-his-cabinet-berth-say-party-insiders-101632684220645.html

Also, around 50 new members of the managing committee were welcomed, and discussions regarding the future projects/working of the association were held during the meeting. After president DS Chawla announced the appointment of the chairman, six executive members of the Sachdeva-led group opposed it, stating it as unconstitutional. An argument regarding the same was also held between both groups. As per information, the rift started after Chawla allegedly ignored the six executive members of the Sachdeva group while forming the sub-committees of the association for resolving the disputes of the members a few days back. No member of the Sachdeva group was given a place in the sub-committees. Satnam Makkar, vice-president of the association, said that forming sub-committees comes under the jurisdiction of the president but he should have consulted the other executive members before finalising the list.“We can work for the betterment of the association and its members only if we stand united but, the president seems to be ignoring some members,” he said.Sachdeva said,“In the previous tenures, the chairman was appointed unanimously but it wasn’t so this time. As per the constitution of the association, the chairman cannot be appointed without unanimous voting. If the president remains adamant, we will move the Company Law Board against the appointment.”Despite attempts made to reach Chawla, he was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-cycle-body-s-rival-factions-at-loggerheads-over-appointment-of-chairman-101632683861101.html

The second wave in Chandigarh was recorded in April and May, and the immunity of those infected will now start decreasing with each passing week. At this time, if people stop following Covid-19 guidelines, especially wearing of face masks, the cases will start increasing again,” said Dr Kang, who is set to retire on September 30.Dr Kang said the third wave could be witnessed after Diwali as people start moving out in crowded places and markets in the festival season.“The variants of coronavirus are also believed to be more transmittable. The only way to boost our immunity is to get vaccinated at the earliest. As more and more people are getting fully vaccinated in Chandigarh, the infection is spreading at a slower rate among the community,” she said.Amid the possibility of another surge, the UT health department is ramping up medical facilities and infrastructure in government hospitals.“The department is already installing oxygen generation plants at government hospitals, and private hospitals are also following suit. The number of ICU beds and ventilators has also been increased. Essential drugs and equipment are being procured in advance.

The government is fully prepared to handle the serious situation. The agriculture department has been asked to ensure ample supply of pesticides to farmers,” he told reporters.Pink bollworm has mainly affected the cotton-growing districts of Bathinda and Mansa, while a few parts of Sangrur are also infested with the pest attack.State agriculture department said there has been no report of infestation on 96,000 hectares in Fazilka while limited pest attack was spotted in 3-4 fields in a couple of Muktsar villages. During field inspection, Channi asked the state agriculture director to establish laboratories at the block-level to ensure the quality and effectiveness of pesticides provided to farmers.Officials informed the CM that the demand for 1 lakh litres of insecticides prescribed for pink bollworm has already been placed and Bathinda district got a supply of 500 litres to cater to 5,000 hectares.

27-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A jeweller’s pride||Jeweller Meharchand’s shop is in the Millennium City of Gurugram. But the vibes of this small cozy establishment in the town’s Sadar Bazar goes far beyond this millennium. Here’s the glass counter, this afternoon, filled with boxes containing gold rings and gold necklaces. And behind is Meharchand, dresssed in a safari suit. He is sitting cross-legged, a light smile is playing about his lips. “I opened Vinay Jewellers in 1985.” It’s named after his son, who isn’t here at the moment.Despite the distraction of the gold, a visitor’s attention is more likely to be claimed by the tijori, the mobile metal closet in the corner. The shop’s most stately object, it is a thing rare to spot these days. In old Hindi movies one would see a family matriarch keeping the money in such a tijori. “These days you don’t need a tijori to keep your cash, there’s the ATM,” Meharchand remarks. Gesturing towards the gold things in the counter, he explains he keeps them in the tijori while closing the shop at night.Possessively touching the front face of the metal chest, the way a book collector holds a prized edition, Meharchand recalls that this iron heavyweight symbolises the many struggles his family has overcome. His father too was a sunar, his grandfather and great-grandfather were also sunar. But there was a break in the continuity due to the partition in 1947. If the forces of history hadn’t uprooted its victims so abruptly, Meharchand might still had the tijori that his family owned in their original hometown in Dera Ghazi Khan (in present-day Pakistan). “We had to leave everything behind.” Meharchand is talking of the partition as if it were something he personally experienced. He is in fact 65, and his account comprises of the stories told to him by the family elders.“This tijori is newer but continues our family traditions.” Painted in grey, its doors are in pale green. “We got it from (Old Delhi’s) Chandni Chowk for 6,000 rupees… there are no shops in Gurgaon that sell these.” The tijori is sacrosanct to the jeweller. A niche on the wall, just above the locker, is filled with idols of gods and goddesses, including a copy of the Hanuman Chalisa. “Every morning and evening I ignite a dhoop batti on the top of the tijori, I also ignite the Bhagwan Jyot, and then I pray.”Again placing his hand on the locker, respectfully, Meharchand says, “Tijori sunar ki shobha hoti hain (it is sunar’s pride).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-jeweller-s-pride-101632683411310.html

27-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ready to continue fight for 10 years, says Rakesh Tikait||A day before Bharat Bandh against the three agriculture laws, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday said farmers will continue this fight for even 10 years until the government accepted their demands.Addressing a “Kisan Mahapanchayat” on the completion of 10 months of the farmers’ agitation in the country, Tikait said repealing the laws was the only solution to end this agitation: “I want to make it clear that the government will have to repeal these laws as we will not allow their implementation at any cost.” “Had the government read farmers’ history, it would not have brought these laws. We are sons of the soil and can force the government’s face into it to compel it to meet our demands,” he added.Tikait also accused the government of spreading misinformation about farmers through its IT cell, by giving religious and caste colours to the agitation. “We are strong enough to fight them if they fight from the front. But they are attacking from the back with the help of their IT cell to spread propaganda against farmer leaders,” he said, urging young farmers of the country to join this fight and counter these tactics. “This is a fight between the poor and the rich, the villages and Delhi. We need support from the youth to counter their false information on social media platforms,” he stressed. Warns BJP in poll-bound statesThe farmer leader from Uttar Pradesh also warned the ruling BJP that the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) will go to all poll-bound states and launch a campaign against the party if the laws were not repealed.“We again request them to repeal these laws at the earliest, otherwise the SKM leaders will visit every poll-bound state, including Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, to oppose your candidates in the coming elections,” he said, adding that the BJP had lost its ground. ‘Talk to Centre to open roads’Reacting over Haryana government’s panel, formed to open roads blocked on the Delhi-Haryana borders, Tikait said, “There was no need to form a committee to talk with farmers, as these roads were blocked by the Union government.”The Haryana government should instead talk to the Centre, as the roads were blocked by the Delhi police to stop farmers from going to the Parliament for protest, he said.‘Tractors ready to reach Delhi anytime’Hinting at another tractor march in Delhi, Tikait urged farmers to keep their tractors ready as they may get a call for another tractor march from the SKM. He also thanked farmers from Uttar Pradesh for not attending a “parallel rally” in Muzaffarnagar and coming to Panipat.Another farmer leader from Haryana Gurnam Singh Charuni threatened to start a protest at the Prime Minister’s residence if the demands were not met soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ready-to-continue-fight-for-10-years-says-rakesh-tikait-101632683563302.html

27-09-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali medical college to begin admissions this year||With the National Medical Commission (NMC) issuing a letter of intent for 100 MBBS seats to Dr BR Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences in Phase 6, Mohali, the admission will begin from this academic session. The college is affiliated to Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Faridkot. Two weeks back, the NMC had inspected the college, following which the letter of intent has been issued. Now, the college has been asked to submit an undertaking within two weeks, stating it will comply with all instructions and guidelines of the NMC. Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi said that it is a red-letter day in the history of Punjab as with operationalisation of this institute, medical education in the state will get a major push and people will get quality health facilities. He also expressed gratitude to the NMC for granting the letter of intent. Channi asked the officials concerned to complete the necessary formalities at the earliest for starting the academic session in the institute at the earliest. The institute being set up under the aegis of an autonomous society — Dr BR Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences Society — is the fourth government medical college in Punjab, and the first to come up in 48 years. The other colleges are in Amritsar, Patiala and Faridkot.At present, there are 1,400 MBBS seats across private and government medical colleges in Punjab, which will go up to 1,500 with 100 more seats at the medical college in Mohali.In the letter of intent, it has been stated that the NMC’s medical assessment and rating board examined the assessor’s report and remarks of expert groups on the college infrastructure and staff, following which 100 MBBS seats have been approved. However, there is 8% shortage in faculty, which has to be recruited, the letter said. Dr Bhavneet Bharti, director principal of the medical college, said: “We have received the letter of Intent and will giving an undertaking to the NMC. Our admission process will begin this academic year, probably in October after the result of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test that was held on September 12.” Though the state government was planning to start the academic session last year, the NMC had denied permission, citing certain shortcomings. The ₹300-crore project was sanctioned during the Akali Dal regime in 2012 under the central-state partnership with funding in the ratio of 60:40. The Punjab government had finalised the site of the existing civil hospital in Phase 6, Mohali, to set up the institute, which will be eventually upgraded to 220 seats. The state government had also announced funding of ₹157 crore for the construction of the college in its 2020-21 financial budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-medical-college-to-begin-admissions-this-year-101632683500788.html

The PMC has selected two plants in the first phase on an experimental basis. A private company has already chosen the Wadgaon budruk (Sinhagad road) biogas plant to use new technology to process 40 tonne of wet garbage per day without charging any tipping fee. And now, the PMC has received response from four private players for the Sarasbaug biogas plant.Sanket Jadhav, junior engineer of the solid waste department, said, “Earlier, we were using small composting, bio-CNG plants to process garbage. But in the current scenario, these technologies have become outdated. We have to now use new technology to process garbage. We have selected two old biogas plants on an experimental basis to be handed over to private players to run on new technology. The Wadgaon (Sinhagad road) plant has already started running on new technology that will process wet garbage and convert into biomass briquettes.”“In the second plant of Sarasbaug, we have received response from four private players that are ready to run it with new technology. In the coming three to four days, the companies will present to the PMC. Thereafter, we will discuss and take the final decision,” Jadhav said.Of the total 25 biogas plants, the Wadgaon plant is spread across 10,000 square feet of land. The plant was processing 10 tonne per day of wet garbage however it stopped working in September 2019 after suffering damage due to heavy rain. The PMC tried to repair it but it was unable to process an adequate amount of garbage. Also, the plant was about to become non-viable in June 2020.Meanwhile, Pune city-based garbage processing company, Mithras Green Technologies, approached the solid waste department and evinced interest in running the plant with new technology without taking any tipping fee from the PMC. The corporation signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) and handed over the plant to the company which agreed to set up the infrastructure and run the plant on its own.Meanwhile, PMC has decided to decommission 12 out of the total 25 biogas plants in a phased manner in the coming days. The PMC wants to hand over the biogas plants to private players on a design-build-finance-operate and transfer (DBFOT) basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-private-players-ready-to-run-sarasbaug-biogas-plant-with-new-technology-101632682780500.html

Around two lakh bricks are lying underneath a tin shed at Ramghat workshop in Ayodhya. These bricks were collected by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) during its Ram Mandir movement, including shiladan, between 1987 and 1989. Around 3.5 lakh bricks were collected in this movement. Some bricks were used in the shila pujan in Ayodhya carried out after the nationwide shila pujan campaign in 1989. Around 50,000 bricks were used to construct a scaffold in 1992 near the then disputed site at Ram Janmabhoomi. Now, around two lakh bricks are left.The Supreme Court had ruled in favour of Ram temple on November 9, 2019, ending the decades old Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute. According to Champat Rai, general secretary of the Trust, optimum use of these bricks will be made. However, it is not clear how this will be done.The Trust has already made it clear that bricks will not be used in construction of the Ram temple as they are not durable and their longevity cannot be guaranteed.According to a member of the Trust, these bricks will be preserved and displayed at the Ram Janmabhoomi after the construction of Ram Mandir is over. “Bricks will not be used in construction of Ram Mandir as they are not durable. But the shilas (bricks) donated by devotees during the Ram Mandir movement are of immense importance for us. They are likely to be preserved and displayed at Ram Janmabhoomi,” said the Trust member. The shila pujan was carried out not only in villages across India, but also in about 55 countries from where the shilas were sent to Ayodhya. These countries include Suriname, Nepal, South Africa, Sri Lanka, the United States, Bangladesh, Canada, Myanmar and Germany, among other nations.These bricks have the words “Sri Ram” inscribed on them in the languages of their respective countries. The Ram temple’s foundation work has been completed in Ayodhya and the next phase of the construction work will start soon. Larsen and Toubro is carrying out the construction and Tata Consulting Engineers is the project management consultant. Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over the bhoomi pujan of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on August 5, 2020.

The floods claimed the lives of 26 people and damaged ₹200 crore worth of goods and property.However, even after two years, residents are still waiting for the financial aid from promised by the state government and also for redevelopment of the area by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to be completed.The state government had committed ₹15,000 to residents of the area whose houses were damaged in the floods in 2019. Residents claim they have not received any financial aid yet.Work on safety walls and the culvert is still on going.“The two Covid waves delayed the issuing of the tender (for constructing safety walls). This is the reason for work slowing down in the safety walls along the Ambil stream. All these works will be completed soon,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol.Encroachment and illegal constructions over the stream is one factor which caused the flooding. The PMC had conducted an anti-encroachment drive on June 25, 2021, which drew protests from residents in the area. The PMC court stayed the action.As per the law, nine metres of land on both sides of the stream are considered a green zone, and no development activities are permitted in this area. Widening the stream from eight metres to 24 metres is a must to avert flash floods however residents who have their houses in the green zone are still opposing the PMC.“There are many illegal shops over the nullah in Gururaj society, Padmavati, on which action is yet to be taken by the PMC. They (PMC) have built the wall, but these shops need to be removed for the safe passage of water,” said Yogesh Gulhane, a resident of Gururajnagar.The PMC had appointed a private agency PriMove which identified 77 illegal constructions along the Ambil odha, which caused the flash floods.The firm was given the task to carry out the survey of Ambil Odha and the reports were submitted to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) The PMC later issued notices to all the owners of these encroachments. According to PMC officials, PriMove has considered 20 metres as the width of the stream while conducting the survey.“PMC needs to speed up the work. At many places the safety wall is not completed. Civic body should also find a solution to the land encroached on by residents living illegally,” said Nitin Kadam, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and president of the Parvati constituency.The safety wall will run along the Ambil odha protecting Katraj crematorium, Katraj-Kondhwa road, Rajas society, Balajinagar, Bramhachaitnya Ashram, Arnaywshwar temple, Tangewala chowk, Tawre colony, Bagul garden, Ramabai-Ambedkar colony, and Sane guruji colony||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/delay-in-construction-of-safety-wall-along-ambil-odha-in-pune-has-residents-worried-101632682361023.html

27-09-2021||Bangalore||Ahead of Bharat Bandh, Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai urges farmers to ‘cooperate’||The Karnataka government on Sunday appealed to the farming community to “cooperate” after union leaders supported the call for a Bharat Bandh on Monday. Appealing to farmer organizations to cooperate, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said, “Due to Covid (lockdowns), business and economic activities have just restarted after struggling for 1.5 years. In such times, I would request the farmers organizations to cooperate,” he said on Sunday. The statements come a day ahead of the proposed Bharat Bandh for which farmers unions in Karnataka have extended support. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Karnataka said that there would be no stoppage of any services. “Under any circumstances there is no question of supporting the bandh. Our buses will ply without any problems and the public will not be inconvenienced,” B Sriramulu, Karnataka’s minister for transport and scheduled tribes welfare said on Sunday. He added that it was the Congress party that was misleading farmers for its own benefit over the contentious farm laws. Kodihalli Chandrashekar, the president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) on Sunday said that the farmer organisations are doing everything possible to make the bandh a success.He said that there would be several people participating in the bandh who would come in from different directions into Bengaluru and end the rally in Mysuru bank circle near the central business district. Chandrashekar even estimated that around 8,000-10,000 people would participate in the Bandh. Several other farmer organisations and activist groups have also made plans to join the bandh. The Karnataka government on Friday had decided to relax some restrictions and said that it would allow for 100% occupancy in cinema halls from October 1 in places where the Covid positivity rate is lower than 1%. The Basavaraj Bommai government has said that in places where the positivity rate is higher than 1%, cinema halls would have only 50% occupancy permission and closure if it is higher than 2%. The same rules will apply to pubs from October 3. The government has also allowed five days of school for students of classes 6 to 12 with 100% occupancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ahead-of-bharat-bandh-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai-urges-farmers-to-cooperate-101632682062043.html

According to police, a 27-year-old woman officer from Delhi had reportedly raised the issue of sexual assault with authorities at the institute around the first week of September when the alleged incident took place. Since no action was taken, she met Coimbatore’s commissioner of police, Deepak M Damor, on September 20. “The institute had initiated inquiry proceedings but she was probably not happy about it which is why she came to the police,” said a senior police officer in Coimbatore. Based on her complaint, the All Women’s Police Station in Gandhipuram carried out preliminary enquiries, registered a case against the accused and arrested him on Saturday, said the official. Police have also informed authorities in Delhi about the incident. Around the first week of September, the woman officer sustained a leg injury while undergoing sports training on campus. She took medication for the injury before going to sleep. On the night of September 10, the accused allegedly came into her hostel room and committed the crime, police said. The accused has been booked under IPC section 376 (rape). He was remanded in judicial custody and sent to the Udumalpet sub jail in Tirupur district on Sunday, police said. Reacting to the developments, a spokesperson of the institute said, “We are cooperating with the police investigation and are also conducting an (internal) inquiry to ascertain the facts.” About 30 personnel from across India have been undergoing training at the institute since August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/flight-lieutenant-held-for-raping-colleague-at-institute-in-coimbatore-101632681940796.html

Maoists are now confined to only two districts -- Visakhapatnam and East Godavari.”Many Maoists are leaving their ranks in the state. Their number has come down from earlier 150 to 50 now, she said, adding that the reduction in Maoist activities was the result of several development activities being undertaken in the state.To ensure development projects reach remote parts of the Maoist-hit areas, Sucharita said, “We have asked the central government to improve road connection and remove hurdles like forest clearance for developing roads, among others.”The state government has also demanded increase in the number of Ekalavya schools and improved mobile and internet network with 4G coverage, besides setting up post offices.The minister said the state’s Nadu-Nedu and Amma Vodi schemes to provide education, medical facilities and empower women are being implemented through village-level committees successfully.“The improvement in basic facilities with successful implementation of various schemes is yielding results even in Maoist-hit areas,” she said, adding that the schemes are helping in providing economic stability and reducing poverty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/andhra-seeks-better-roads-telecom-network-meeting-with-shah-on-maoist-insurgency-101632681881876.html

It is a fact that it has been the Centre’s policy for decades, but this is “not correct,” he said in a statement.The reasons listed by the central government for carrying out a count of Scheduled Castes and Tribes in the Census applied equally for Other Backward Classes and such data is sought by several high courts and the Supreme Court, he said. If caste-wise data is not collected, there is a “danger” of reservation for OBCs “disappearing” over the next few years and hence, caste-wise enumeration in Census is necessary and cannot be avoided.The Centre’s contention that “while working towards a casteless society, a caste-wise enumeration is not needed” only showed that it has not understood the subject.Only an egalitarian society could help create a casteless society and to make sure that it happened, all castes should witness development. For that, reservation is the foundation and to ensure it, caste-wise enumeration in Census is necessary and the Union government should realise this, Ramadoss said. On Union government’s claims on practical difficulties, he said the Britishers had carried out the exercise during an era -- between 1881 and 1931-- when there were no developments in science and technology as seen today and the enumeration had a “99 per cent accuracy,” and only based on such data, reservation for OBCs is provided. “It is to be pointed out that Karnataka had undertaken a caste wise enumeration four years ago.” The Centre also pointed that its list of OBCs differed from that of states, Ramadoss said adding it is not a problem. Even if a headcount was done based on Centre’s OBC list, it could be used in accordance with the requirements of state governments. “Necessity is the mother of invention. In India, there is an unavoidable necessity for a caste wise enumeration in Census. Considering it, if a decision is taken to carry it out, all practical problems can be addressed.” The central government should hence, carry out the 2021 Census by including caste wise enumeration, he said. Days ago, the Centre had told the Supreme Court that caste Census of Backward Classes is administratively difficult and cumbersome” and excluding such information from the purview of Census is a “conscious policy decision”. PMK is part of the National Democratic Alliance in Tamil Nadu. The PMK’s cadre base is predominantly, Vanniya Kula Kshatriyas, falling under the Most Backward Classes (MBC) category in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/castebased-census-should-be-conducted-pmk-chief-ramadoss-tells-centre-101632681822377.html

Gautam Budh Nagar has three assembly constituencies -- Noida, Dadri and Jewar, all represented by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders. Residents were hoping that at least one MLA from the district may be inducted into the cabinet. The MLA from Noida is Pankaj Singh, son of defence minister Rajnath Singh; Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar is a teacher by profession and Jewar MLA is Dhirendra Singh, who played a key role in convincing farmers to give their land for the construction of the Noida international airport at Jewar.“Noida remained a strong bastion of the BJP since 2012, when this constituency was created and won over by the saffron party. It was the first time in 2017 that all the three seats in the district were won by the BJP. Noida is a well-planned world-class city, the economic powerhouse of Uttar Pradesh. If an MLA was inducted into the state cabinet, it would have greatly benefited not only the party, but also residents,” said R Sahay, general secretary of Noida federation of apartment owners association (NFAOA), an umbrella body of apartment owners association in Noida.Just a day before cabinet expansion, rumours were rife that Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar may be inducted into the cabinet so that the party can influence the disgruntled Gurjar community in the upcoming 2022 polls.“It was surprising for me that in this reshuffle, no one from GB Nagar could make it to the cabinet. This district is an urban region. A minister from this place would have acted as a bridge between people and the state government. The move is disappointing for us as we were hoping to see at least one MLA from Gautam Budh Nagar in the cabinet,” said Deepika Chauhan, a resident of Noida’s Sector 135.Dr Mahesh Sharma, GB Nagar MP and former Union minister, was not available for comments on the reshuffle despite repeated attempts.Vijay Bhati, BJP’s president for Gautam Budh Nagar district, said, “It is the party that takes a call on these issues. Our job is to work on the ground and not to think of reshuffle. We are here to obey commands and not demand berths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gbnagar-residents-disappointed-as-none-of-its-mlas-find-place-in-up-cabinet-expansion-101632681702137.html

The farmer leaders claimed that traders, students, lawyers, opposition parties and other sections of the society had responded well to their appeal to support their call of ‘ Bharat Bandh’ to push their demands for repealing the three contentious farm laws and guarantee to purchase crops at minimum support price. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) member and president of BKU (Asli) Harpal Singh Bilari claimed that the bandh call was eliciting good response from farmers, lawyers, traders and other sections of society. “We had approached people in the past few months to share that this was not the battle of farmers alone. These draconian laws will adversely affect lives of people,” said Bilari and claimed that amid soaring inflation, people understood this and made up their minds to support the ‘ Bharat Bandh’ in their respective areas. Bilari claimed that all national highways would be blocked during the bandh to ensure the success of the call given by SKM. Bharatiya Kisan Union’s media in charge Dharmendra Malik said that teams had been formed in all districts across the state which would block movement of traffic on national highways at designated locations. He said the national highways would be blocked at 14 places in Bijnor, 8 places in Meerut, three places in Ghaziabad, 10 places in Muzaffarnagar and also other districts across the state. He said that appeals had been made to traders, students, labour organisations, lawyers and other social organisations to extend support to the bandh.” We have received affirmative response from various organizations,” said Malik and shared that almost all opposition parties had extended their support to the bandh and its impact would be visible on roads and markets on Monday. Meanwhile, the Meerut Bar Association passed a resolution that lawyers would abstain from work in courts on Monday to support the SKM bandh call. The resolution said that farmers were protesting against the farm laws for over 10 months and the government should resolve the issue through dialogue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bharat-bandh-farmers-form-teams-to-block-traffic-movement-on-highways-101632681700659.html

Thousands of eyes were glued towards the sky over Dal Lake in Srinagar on Sunday morning as Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots and their fighter jets, helicopters and para-motors mesmerised people with their aerobatics and formation flying. Organised by the Air Force Station in Srinagar in collaboration with the Jammu and Kashmir government as part of the “Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav”, the air show was witnessed from the Sher-e-Kashmir International Conference Centre.It commenced with the para-motor and hang-glider displays, followed by the MiG 21 Bisons flying in a triangular formation.IAF’s skydiving team Akashganga enthralled the audience by jumping from a Mil Mi-17 helicopter over the lake, while the Sukhoi Su-30MKI showcased its maneuverability with a low-level aerobatic display.The star attraction of the event was IAF’s Surya Kiran aerobatics team that performed a syncronised aerial ballet with nine highly versatile Hawk Mk132s.The manoeuvres by the Boeing Chinook heavy-lift helicopter created waves over the otherwise serene Dal Lake, much to the delight of the audience. A symphony orchestra of the IAF added glitter to the event.Coined “Give Wings to Your Dreams”, the event was also IAF’s effort to inspire the youth to join the forces.“Such a show was organised in Srinagar after 14 years. The air display was especially tailored for the younger audience,” said Col Emron Musavi, public relations officer, defence, Srinagar.He said thousands of people witnessed the event, including students from local schools.“I have seen such displays on TV, but I am watching it in real life for the first time,” said 20-year-old Adil Ahmad, a college student from Srinagar.J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha was the chief guest and Air Marshal BR Krishna, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Air Command, was the chief host.“For a moment it appeared that we were transposed to New Delhi’s Rajpath on Republic Day. I am happy to have witnessed this event, which will motivate the younger generation to join the air force in greater numbers,” said Sinha.He also made a case for environment conservation, stating that it was as much the people’s responsibility as the administration’s or government’s.Mehbooba terms it GOI’s normalcy acrobaticsCriticising the central government, People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti termed the air show “PR antics” to showcase normalcy when the economy had suffered heavy losses in Jammu and Kashmir. “Amused that GOI continues its normalcy acrobatics in J&K.

27-09-2021||Noida||Noida residents write to fire department over safety lapses||A residents’ group in Noida has shot a letter to the city’s fire department, pointing out the lapses in fire control measures in several group housing societies and high-rises in the city and emphasising on the need to take a follow-up on the previous audits of the housing complexes. Officials, however, said they are already conducting a drive to inspect the fire safety measures in high-rises since the past three months. “There are several lapses when it comes to fire safety measures in the city’s high rises, especially the 7X sectors where there are over 50,000 flats. While many builders obtain no objection certificate (NOC) despite fire safety lapses, such as defunct sprinklers in certain towers, etc., even the fire department doesn’t do much on the follow ups. Last year, there was a meeting between the fire department and residents, after which audits were done and lapses were found as mentioned in the audit reports. Yet not much has been done to work on the lapses,” said Amit Gupta, a member of Progressive community foundation, a residents’ group, who undersigned the letter. A few pointed out that the audits in their high rises were done “silently and without talking to the residents”. “In our high rise, the internal towers are not connected through 6m roads as proposed in the plan. The 6m road is essential for the movement of fire tenders. A team from the fire department came to our high rise last month but left without taking audit or talking to the residents,” said Ranjan Samant Ray, a resident of Antriksh Golf View 2 in Sector 78.“There are many lapses on the builder’s part as well. For instance, if proper fire safety devices cost around ₹50 lakh, the builders will put in places devices worth ₹25 lakh and somehow obtain the NOC. The responsibility of getting the remaining work done falls on the residents. Almost every high rise in the city has some kind of lapses in fire safety and needs follow ups from the department ,” said Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA).In their letter to the fire department, residents also urged the fire department to set up a fire station in 7X and make arrangements for a fire tender, which can reach the higher floors. “Currently, the tenders based in the city can only reach upto 14 floors,” said Gupta.Meanwhile, officials said that the auditing drive is already under process and lapses have been identified in the housing complexes. “ We have been inspecting several high-rises since past three months in Noida alone. Since there are so many high-rises, the process is taking some time. Lapses in fire safety measures were found in many societies, and action was taken against them. We have also sent the report of around 11 or 12 high-rises to the chief judicial magistrate office,” said Arun Kumar, chief fire officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.“We urge residents to tell us directly if there are issues related to fire safety in any high rise or housing society, if become very difficult if just a general complaint is raised. We are also working on getting a 72m high fire tender, that can reach up to 24 floors. Currently, the maximum height a fire tender can reach in Noida is up to 42 metres,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-residents-write-to-fire-department-over-safety-lapses-101632681343505.html

Investigators also said that the attackers planned to surrender before the judge after killing Gogi, but before they could move towards the judge’s seat, the security personnel who accompanied Gogi to the court killed them, apprehending they might harm the judge, and others present inside the courtroom. They added that they were yet to ascertain this and other details that were emerging during the investigation.“We did not get their custody so far, and will be interrogating them at length once we do,” said Alok Kumar, Joint Commissioner (Crime). A senior special cell official said the handover formalities regarding one of the accused, Umang Yadav were not ready. Uman and Mota were picked up by the special cell from a house in Haiderpur, based on the CCTV footage from the court complex that showed them moving about in an “unusual” manner. The house belongs to Umang, said a special cell officer.The police suspect that gangster Tillu Tajpuriya, the main rival of Gogi, hatched the plan to eliminate him. Tillu is currently lodged in the Mandoli jai. The missing ‘third attacker’Investigators have an alleged member of Tillu’s gang, Naresh Kumar alias Sonu, was a part of the shoot-out plan. It was Sonu who roped in Umang and told him to bring the two attackers -- Rahul Tyagi and Jagdeep Jagga -- to the court. During questioning, Umang told the police Tyagi and Jagga were in touch with him. He mentioned that though he was asked to wait outside in a car, three people -- Tyagi, Jagga and unidentified person -- were to go inside the court and kill Gogi. However, he said, that since they could not arrange a lawyer’s attire for the third person, only Tyagi and Jagga went inside the court room, where they shot Gogi dead, an investigator said. “They reached the court around 10.15 am on Friday. All four of them then went inside the court to show the attackers the courtroom, after which Umang and another person came out and waited in their car. However, as soon as they realised that Tyagi and Jagga have been killed in the retaliatory fire by the police, they fled,” the investigator said. Police said that they were establishing the identity of the person, who waited outside in the car with Umang. Mota and Umang have also told the police that Tyagi and Jagga came to Delhi on September 20, and the next day they bought white trousers and black jackets that are worn by lawyers. Probable inter-gang plotThe police suspect that more than one gang could be involved in the killing since one of the attackers, Tyagi was a member of Sunil Rathi gang while Jagga belonged to Tillu’s gang. The possible third attacker, who waited outside with Uman, is suspected to be a member of Naveen Bali gang, investigators said. Since Tillu is also considered close to gang leaders Neeraj Bawana, Sunil Rathi, Naveen Bali and Kaushal, all of whom are also under the police radar for any possible involvement in Gogi’s murder.All of the alleged conspirators are currently lodged in jails in the national capital and neighbouring states. Officials said they may also be taken into custody for questioning. Post-mortem examinationOn Sunday, a board of doctors conducted a post-mortem examination of Gogi’s body at Maulana Azad Medical college. The procedure was recorded on video, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gogi-shootout-two-arrested-delhi-police-commissioner-rakesh-asthana-visits-rohini-court-and-crime-scene-101632680023249.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Civic bodies aim to mechanise waste collection points before polls||The project of mechanising garbage collection points (dhalao) in the city has now entered its final leg with civic officials setting March 2022 as the deadline for phasing out all the remaining operational dhalaos and trying to complete the project before the municipal elections scheduled to be held next year.The mechanization project was started in October 2016 with the inauguration of five fixed compactor transfer stations (FCTS) by L G Najeeb Jung. Delhi has over 1,209 primary garbage receptacle points with 550 such points under the jurisdiction of North MCD (municipal corporation of Delhi), 350 points with the South municipal body and 309 receptacles in the East Delhi Municipal CorporationTraditionally a three walled open structure, an open dhalao is used as a primary municipal waste collection for a colony or a locality. A fixed garbage compactor station works on a hydraulically operated garbage compression system, which reduces the volume of garbage and turns it into highly compressed cakes of mixed waste. It usually comprises a garbage input bin, tipcart, loading shovel bucket, compressor and a hook loader.

The police have arrested 31 people in connection with the case and sent two minors to a juvenile remand home in Bhiwandi. The survivor had approached the police on September 22 and accused 33 men of intimidation, blackmail and prolonged sexual abuse between January and September.According to the survivor, one of the accused posted a compromising video of her on a WhatsApp group, when she refused to meet him in May. “Ever since they got access to the video recorded in January, in which the main accused was sexually assaulting the victim, the accused had repeatedly been calling the victim. They would ask her to come to various locations, where several of them would force themselves on her,” the Manpada police officer said.The survivor has alleged that the main accused, with whom she was in a relationship, allegedly took ₹500 from each of his friends for committing the crime. “The victim has claimed that she saw the main accused taking ₹500 in cash from the men assaulting her,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dombivli-rape-case-two-more-arrested-tally-now-31-101632680020557.html

Police said the woman, identified as Ravneet Kaur (40), a resident of Model Town 3, was rushed to a private hospital by her daughter and parents-in-law around 5.30am on Tuesday, where she was declared brought dead. The post-mortem report, which arrived on Saturday, confirmed she was strangulated and that there were no external injury marks. Police said since Kaur was a yoga trainer and used to go to the gym twice a day, her husband Paramjeet Singh suspected her of having an affair with someone at the gym. He had been keeping a watch on her for quite a few days. On Tuesday, Kaur, who was on a call with someone, did not respond to Singh when he was talking to her. In a fit of rage, Singh strangulated her till she died. Police said the couple was married for over 20 years. While their elder daughter was in Pune, their younger daughter and Singh’s parents were at home but in different rooms when the incident took place. Singh runs a car accessories shop in Kashmiri Gate, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-strangles-wife-to-death-in-model-town-101632679780206.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Godown owners in agri lands want DDA to relax rules||Despite an amendment in the Master Plan of Delhi (MPD)-2021 three years ago to regularise godowns in non-conforming areas, its owners are struggling to get their properties legalised and have demanded further relaxation in the norms set by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021 to protect existing structures from sealing.According to the amended MPD-2021 norms, a 30m RoW -- the minimum width of the road leading to the property -- is mandatory for regularisation but traders claim that most godowns in non-conforming areas (agricultural land and villages) have a road width of only around 10-15m.Sumit Agarwal, general secretary, Marble Dealers Association South Delhi, who has a godown in Chattarpur, said, “There is a need to reduce the RoW requirement to 15m or less to make regularisation of godowns possible.”Godowns were initially banned in non-conforming areas but with many such facilities mushrooming across villages, especially in north Delhi, over the years, the DDA amended MPD-2021 in June 2018 to regularise all existing godowns in such areas in order to protect them from sealing. The amendment however makes it clear that no new godowns are allowed in non-conforming areas. The deadline for regularisation, which was supposed to end in December, has now been extended to December 31, 2023.In the Capital, godowns are located in north Delhi’s Alipur and Narela, Najafgarh in southwest Delhi, and Chhatarpur in south Delhi, among other areas.Naresh Gupta, president of Delhi Grain Merchants’ Association, said, “For the past three years, the policy is just on paper. No effort has been made by government agencies to expedite the implementation of the policy. We have godowns in 10-12 villages near GT Karnal road, but plans of not a single godown have been passed by the civic agency.”A senior North Delhi Municipal Corporation official, who is aware of the issue, said, “There are around 7,000 godowns in our jurisdiction. But we have not been able to regularise any so far due to the stringent norms. The right of way, parking and other clauses on the norms are difficult to meet, as these godowns have come up haphazardly. There is a need to relax the norms.”Similarly, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has not been able to process many applications. “We have got very few applications as, in most cases, they are unable to meet the criteria. We have regularised only one godown so far,” said an official, requesting anonymity.The official said that the North corporation has submitted its recommendation to the DDA regarding the need to relax development control norms for regularisation of godowns in non-conforming areas.A senior DDA official said, “We are examining the recommendations submitted by the North corporation. As of now no decision has been taken.”Meanwhile, the traders have also raised other demands, including allowing new godowns in non-conforming areas and urbanised villages, and reduction in external development charges (which traders will have to pay for developing the area).Agarwal further said that there is a need to clarify that sale and purchase of marble is permitted in godowns. “Marble traders, especially in Chhatarpur, are having difficulty in getting their properties de-sealed (which were shut for alleged misuse during the 2017 sealing drive in non-conforming areas). We want the DDA to clarify in the norms that sale and dispatch of marble be considered as permissible and valid under the godown policy,” said Agarwal, who is also the national secretary of Confederation of All India Traders.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-godown-owners-in-agri-lands-want-dda-to-relax-rules-101632679720482.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: DDA to start e-auction of 474 commercial and residential sites||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will start e-auction of 474 commercial and residential sites from Monday. The list of plots includes 25 sites for organising functions and seven group housing plots.The agency has also postponed till October 10, the auction of seven sites for CNG fuel stations.In 2020, DDA approved two proposals to put on sale sites for functions and group housing plots.DDA officials said that the idea behind the decision to auction group housing plots was to gradually allow private developers or group housing societies to develop housing in the city. Currently, the housing plots are allotted to cooperative group housing societies.The seven group housing plots that have been put on sale are located in Rohini, Dwarka and Vishwas Nagar measuring 7,000-40,000 sq.m. DDA officials said that these plots will be given on a freehold basis.Similarly, the 25 function sites will be given for a period of 10 months. These sites are located in Pitampura, Rohini, Shahdara, Vikaspuri etc. DDA officials said that the decision to auction function sites was taken in order to protect them from encroachment. While these 25 sites will be auctioned, the booking of other sites will continue as per the current process—sites are booked for each function.Apart from this, DDA has put on auction 76 institutional plots, 25 mobile towers, 150 shops, 36 residential plots, 56 kiosks and restaurant units etc. While the shops and residential plots are on freehold basis, institutional plots, mobile towers and kiosks/restaurants are on leasehold and licence fee basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-dda-to-start-e-auction-of-474-commercial-and-residential-sites-101632679360224.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||386 waterlogging spots, 291 landslide-prone spots in Mumbai, finds BMC mapping||A total of 386 waterlogging spots, 74 vulnerable settlements and 291 landslide-prone areas have been identified in the city, as part of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) project to map natural disaster-prone zones. As the ward-wise mapping for each of the 24 administrative wards is now complete, the civic body has integrated this data with its annual Flood Preparedness Guidelines 2021 and started to act upon them. Mapped as part of this initiative are vulnerable settlements due to their proximity to the sea, to a landslide-prone area, to a high-tension wire, those settled along the creeks in Mumbai, or at foothills of hillocks, and those with proximity to BMC reservoirs; flooding-prone spots in each ward, including chronic flooding-prone spots, localised flooding-prone spots, temporary ones due to ongoing metro construction or other development works. Of the 386 waterlogging spots, 178 have already been tackled by the civic body and 164 have work going on to mitigate flooding, as per its survey. Eleven spots have not been tackled by the civic body, stated the survey. While landslide-prone areas have been categorised into high-, medium- and low-risk spots, with estimates of the affected population in each area, flooding-prone spots have been categorised on the basis of spots which have already been tackled, spots where work is presently going on, and those that are under Railways’, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s or Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd’s (MMRCL) jurisdiction. The BMC has also identified emergency assembly points in each ward such as municipal school buildings, along with how many people can be accommodated in each building. There are a total of 130 emergency assembly points across 24 wards. These have been identified keeping in mind the affected population in case of the above-mentioned emergencies. The maximum number of landslide-prone spots – 152 – is in the S ward corresponding to Bhandup; the area has 10 emergency assembly points. It is followed by N ward in Ghatkopar, which has 32 spots and 8 emergency assembly points. L ward, corresponding to Kurla, has 11 emergency assembly spots, due to proximity to settlements to Mithi River, which swells almost every monsoon, prompting the BMC ward authorities to arrange for temporary evacuation of 400-600 residents. The information has been uploaded on the BMC’s website and is accessible to citizens. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner who is in charge of the civic disaster management department, said, “It is the need of the hour to mitigate casualty and property damage due to natural disasters. Creating awareness among residents is the most impactful way to do this. The BMC began ward-wise mapping of disaster-prone areas in the city. The crucial phase of the project is education of citizens, sharing knowledge with elected representatives and then giving them tools to deal with such disasters in an emergency. That is why this information is online.” The BMC has already begun workshops with citizens, local leaders and elected representatives at its Parel-based City Disaster Management Institute. However, these were halted due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Kakani said. For over a decade, the BMC has been preparing Flood Preparedness Guidelines every year. It is a handbook of ward-wise details of disasters, with standard operating procedure outlining the roles and responsibilities of each of the first responding agencies in case of disasters. A senior civic official said, “We update the Flood Preparedness Guidelines handbook every year, adding components to it, elaborating roles of first responders as our SOP gets finetuned.” In a mid-monsoon review meeting in July, the BMC also decided to appoint a consultant to survey landslide-prone sites and suggest corrective measures. Kakani said, “As per an earlier survey conducted by the Geographical Survey of India (GSI), landslide-prone spots across Mumbai have been categorised into light, moderate and critical. There are 20 such critical spots that BMC has decided to focus on for immediate corrective measures. These spots are mostly in the eastern suburbs, in S (Bhandup) and L (Kurla) wards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/386-waterlogging-spots-291-landslide-prone-spots-in-mumbai-finds-bmcmapping-101632679300170.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro earns ₹19.5 crore by selling 3.55 million carbon credits||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has earned ₹19.5 crore from the sale of the 3.55 million carbon credits that it collected over a period of six years (2012-18) by investing in clean development mechanism projects.Delhi Metro has registered four of its projects with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). The projects are: regenerative braking, Modal Shift, MRTS Program of Activities and solar project.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC said, “All these projects are first of their kind in the world. Delhi Metro is the first Metro or railway project in the world to be registered by the United Nations under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to claim carbon credits for its Regenerative Braking Project in 2007.”The CDM is a project-based Green House Gas (GHG) offset mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol, allowing the public and private sector in high-income nations the opportunity to purchase carbon credits from greenhouse gas emissions-reducing projects in low or middle-income nations as part of their efforts to meet international emissions targets under the Kyoto protocol.The DMRC earned ₹9.55 crore from the sale of carbon credits it generated from the regenerative braking project—DMRC’s first CDM project. In the regenerative braking project, whenever trains on the Metro network apply brakes, three phase - traction motors installed on these trains act as generators to produce electrical energy which goes back into the Over Head Electricity (OHE) lines. The regenerated electrical energy that is supplied back to the OHE is used by other accelerating trains in the same service line, thus saving overall energy in the system as about 30% of electricity requirement is reduced.The second important CDM project is about modal shift in Delhi ever since DMRC started its operations. Dayal said, “The essence of this project is that the carbon footprint of people travelling by metro is much lesser than that of the same journeys performed by other modes of transport.”Then there is a solar project and Program of Activities. Under PoA, DMRC has been providing CDM consultancy service to other Metro systems in India since 2015. “DMRC is enabling them to earn carbon credits from their project. Already Gujarat Metro, Mumbai Metro and Chennai Metro etc. have registered their projects under the Delhi Metro’s Program of Activities (PoA) project,” said Dayal.In 2014, Delhi Metro registered with the prestigious ‘Gold Standard Foundation’, Switzerland, which is also a globally accepted certification standard for carbon mitigation projects. The Metro has registered four projects with the Gold Standard Foundation.Dayal said, “Total revenue generation from CDM and Gold Standard projects since inception has been ₹29.05 crore.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-earns-19-5-crore-by-selling-3-55-million-carbon-credits-101632679060521.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||Plan to flatten landfills in Delhi may be delayed after record monsoon||The heavy monsoon in the national capital this year may interfere with the Delhi municipal corporations’ target of flattening their three major garbage dumps by September 24, officials of the civic bodies said.According to reports submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the three corporations expect to clear one landfill each over the next three years.A senior official overseeing the sanitation department in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation said trommel and bio-mining work has been halted for the past two months due to the rain.“Waste cannot be sieved when wet. So, various components of waste cannot be separated using trommels,” the official explained.
27-09-2021||Delhi||Record rains in Delhi help raise groundwater along Yamuna floodplains by 2.5m||Devices installed by the Delhi government to measure groundwater level in a four-square kilometre area around a reservoir created along the Yamuna floodplains near Palla neighbourhood, located in the northern peripheries of the city, recorded a rise of 2.5 metres this year, the highest in three years with the Capital witnessing record rainfall this monsoon.With the project completing three monsoons since its pilot run in 2019, the government will now start drafting a report from October 1, which is supposed to be submitted to a committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), said a senior government official. “The government is supposed to take a call on further continuation of the project, expansion of the 26-acre reservoir and acquisition of more farmlands for that in the time to come, only after getting the tribunal’s nod,” said the official. In July 2019, the Delhi government launched a water conservation project along the Yamuna river, which, the official said, aimed at recharging the depleting groundwater levels in the national capital. The project involved creating a reservoir to collect excess water from the Yamuna as it floods during the monsoon and giving it adequate time to recharge groundwater levels. The government was supposed to record developments of the project for three monsoons and prepare a report, that is to be shared with the NGT-appointed panel, for taking further call. The government acquired 40 acres of land along the Yamuna floodplains near Palla – not very far from the Delhi-Haryana border in Singhu village – in 2019 for the project. Of the 40 acres, 10 belonged to gram sabhas in the area and 30 acres were acquired from farmers on three-year lease agreements. The government then created a reservoir of 17.6 acres.The next year, the size of the reservoir was increased to 26 acres. In a four square metre area around the reservoir, which includes Palla, Bakhtawarpur, Tigipur, Sungarpur, Bakner, Mamorpur and a few other villages with vast stretches of paddy fields, the government set up a network of 33 piezometers — devices that can measure the depth of groundwater.“In 2019, the devices showed that the groundwater levels have risen upto 1.3 metres, and last year, the maximum rise recorded was 2 metres. This year, the devices recorded a maximum rise of 2.5 metres,” said the senior government official, who did not wish to be identified.The reservoir is estimated to have contributed 4,350 million litres to the groundwater aquifer collectively in 2019 and 2020. “Assessment for 2021 is yet to be done. It will be incorporated in the final report. The government plans to submit the report to the NGT-appointed committee in another two months,” said the official. The government has plans to expand the project to a 1,000-acre area stretching till Wazirabad, said a second official in the government’s irrigation and flood control department “To understand why the project is evidently bearing fruit, one has to look at rainfall data, because rain plays the primary role here,” said the official. According to the data of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi usually receives 653.6mm of rainfall during the monsoon season. In 2020, the city recorded 648.9mm of precipitation and 404mm rain in 2019. This monsoon, Delhi has received 1,169.7mm rainfall till 8pm on Sunday, the highest since 1964 (1,190.9 mm).“The idea of the reservoir sounds feasible considering the soil type in Delhi, which allows quick percolation of water. If the government does not take measures to recharge groundwater levels now, things can get worse. Chennai has a severe groundwater depletion problem. Delhi should not become another Chennai,” said Sanjay Singh, national coordinator of Jan Jal Jodo Abhiyan, an advocacy group that works on access to water, conservation of water bodies, groundwater recharge and water security through community participation.Farmers in the area, however, highlighted some concerns. “There are issues pertaining to payment of rent in accordance with the lease. Those have to be resolved. The farmers who have given their lands have no other source of income,” said Ritesh Rana, a farmer and a resident of Bakhtawarpur village.When HT visited the villages close to the reservoir this week, several farmers stressed on why they were unsure about the efficacy of the project.“Most farmers have water pumps and pipes that go 40 feet down. During monsoon, they face no problem anyway. We are not very sure about the changes in the groundwater level. We learn about the changes through data that is occasionally shared by government teams visiting the site,” said Pappan Singh Gahlot, a farmer and resident of Tigipur village.There are also a lot of uncertainties. “What happens if the government plans to drop the project next year? The whole area has been dug up and farmers cannot cultivate this land without help from the government. Also, if they plan to expand it, they should inform farmers before the sowing season. Last time, they had to cut half-grown paddy to make space for the reservoir. Farmers in the area still feel that they have not been compensated adequately for the crop loss,” said Rai Singh Tanwar, a farmer from Sungarpur.Office of Delhi’s water minister Satyendar Jain said: “The impact assessment of the project is being done by the Joint Committee appointed by NGT. All the data pertaining to ground water levels, amount of water being recharged and rainfall in the local area is being shared with the Joint Committee. The study of water table is being done with piezometers network in the alignment of pond area and non- pond area and the requisite information will be available... It is expected that the Joint Committee shall submit its report to the NGT by the end of this year.”On land lease amount concerns worrying farmers, Jain’s office said, “The lease rent of land owners are being paid timely... according to the lease agreement by l&FC department for development of pilot project at village Sungerpur. The lease rent upto 2nd year has already been paid through online payment and 3rd year 1st quarter payment is under process . However. there was an issue with some farmers due to merger of banks and change in IFSC details , which has been sort out with concern land owners.”On what will happen to the land if the project is dropped and other uncertainties, an officer in Jain’s office, who is also in charge of the irrigation and flood department, said: “As per the terms and conditions of the lease agreement, if the project is not continued then the land of the farmers shall be returned to them by filling the land with the excavated earth and bringing it to the same elevation as the soil near the reservoir site. The lease is being paid to the farmers from the day their land was taken for the project. This means that the crop of the first year is also compensated. The lease was fixed by a multi department committee of the Delhi Government and has taken into account all the contingencies as far as possible. Otherwise on the success of project, the lease period will be increased accordingly or as directed by the Delhi government.”Manoj Misra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, a civil society consortium working for the Yamuna’s protection, however, flagged some concerns largely regarding challenges to fair assessment of the project.“The project has been created in a floodplain. Floodplains have an organic relationship with rivers. During the monsoons, the rivers feeds on the floodplains. The water percolates and recharges aquifers, which can stretch for kilometres. During dry months, the aquifers feed the rivers and help them maintain a base flow. Being a perennial river, Yamuna is one such case. So, a large part of the water recharging process is automatic here,” said Mishra. “Secondly, in the absence of wells in the area and residents always getting access to water with the help of water pumps during monsoon, they would find it difficult to see any changes in the groundwater levels and the assessment would become completely dependent on government readings taken to piezometers. Also, 40 acres of land is too less an area for executing such a project and recording visible changes in water levels,” said Misra.He further said, “For fair and more efficient assessment, the government should consider creating a reservoir in the passive floodplains, ideally on the other side of the river embankment, instead of the active floodplains. This process will not work with the natural overflow of the river and will feed the reservoir automatically during monsoons and would require the government to set up arrangements to fill it up. It can give better results in terms of assessment of such a project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/record-rains-in-delhi-help-raise-groundwater-along-yamuna-floodplains-by-25m-101632678580199.html
27-09-2021||Delhi||Ramlila a non-starter in the land of Ravana worshippers||Like last year, this year too Ramlilas are either being cancelled or are likely to be low-key events due to the continuing restrictions on large gatherings. It may have disappointed millions across the country, but for residents of Bisrakh it would not mean so much since no Ramlilas means no burning of the effigy of the Ravana, who they believe is the son of the soil.“ Ravana was born here in our village. Nothing has been more painful for us than see effigies of Ravana burn every year. We do not hold any Ramlila in our village, ” says Manchand Bhati, 71, sitting at his shop in Bisrakh village.Indeed, Bisrakh—a village in Gautam Budh Nagar, about 30 km from Connaught Place, does not organise Ramlila or celebrate Dussehra, which is in fact the day of mourning for villagers.Local legend has it that Bisrakh is the birthplace of Ravana, the demon king and the ruler of Lanka. The village derives its name from sage Vishrava, Ravana’s father, who is believed to have built a temple here to house a Shiva Lingam that he came across in a forest grove. It was this temple where, the villagers will tell you, as a child, Ravana used to offer prayers to Lord Shiva along with his father.Mange Ram Bhati, another villager, says the village has never celebrated Ramlila, except once about 50 years ago when a group of few young men broke the age-old village tradition by organising it.The consequences, Mange Ram says, turned out to be frightful.A few days after Ramlila was held, Bhati says, two of the youngsters who participated in it as actors passed away. “ We believe that Ravana unleashed his wrath on the village. The was the last time anyone ever tried to hold a Ramlila here,” says Mange Ram. “Everyone believes that if we ever tried to celebrate Ramlila again, a bigger calamity may befall the village,” he says. “We are determined to not repeat that mistake of 50 years ago and so far we have done fine.”In the past decade, Bisrakh, which today has a population of about 10,000, has been transformed into an urban village with palatial houses boasting gleaming SUVs. In the late 2000s, most of the village land was acquired by Greater Noida Authority to develop what is today known as Greater Noida West.What has not changed is the villagers’ reverence for Ravana. Many elderly refer to him as ‘Maha Brahman’ and every Dussehra gather at the local Shiva temple to observe a day of mourning. “ Many houses do not cook on the day and gather here to mourn his demise,” says Mahant Ramdas, the priest of the Shiva temple that is believed to have been built by Vishrava, Ravan’s father. “This is the Shiva Lingam that they both worshipped”.The mahant, who came to the village 40 years ago, says that people from all over the country and, at times even foreigners, visit the temple. “In the four decades, I have not seen the villagers celebrating Ramlia, and their regard for the Ravana has only increased,” says the mahant, giving us a guided tour of the temple, which has the idols of Vishrava, the Ravan’s father and Kubera, his brother. The temple gate, built about a decade back, has the carved image of the Ravana.Villagers say that a few people in the village wanted to build a Ravana temple, but faced opposition from people outside of their village. In August 2016, Ashokanand, a self-styled yoga guru, installed an idol of Ravana inside his yoga ashram in the village, which he seeks to promote as Bisrakh Dham. There are a few large billboards around the village announcing it as Bisrakh Dham, the birthplace of the Ravana to visitors. But the idol was vandalised, which Ashoknand blames on the supporters of the priest of a temple in Ghaziabad.“Another idol is ready, which I am determined to install soon, no matter what. I want to promote a better understanding of Ravana. He was the biggest devotee of Lord Shiva and the greatest scholar. Perhaps his life needs to be seen in totality. He had many more positive than negative qualities, ” says Ashokanand.He says that he is now working to set up a museum celebrating the life and times of Ravana in the village. “I have done a lot of research on Ravana and even travelled to Sri Lanka. A few people from the island country who worship Ravana also visited our village after I told them that our village is the birthplace of Ravana”.Mange Ram Bhati says some young parents, under pressure from their children, would sneak into other places to enjoy Ramlila, but last year they were saved this trouble as Ramilias were cancelled everywhere. “Perhaps this year too, thankfully there would be no Ramlila and they would not have to take the risk of visiting a Ramlila elsewhere, ” says Bhati. A risk? “Though some of them concede to the wishes of their children to see Ramlila, they fear that Ravana might become angry again and punish them for their secret trip to a Ramlila.”Shyam Lal, 73, is a rare voice who is sceptical about his village’s relationship with Ravana. “It is a myth more than anything else, but I do not mind people propagating it as long as it is keeping our village in the limelight, and attracting visitors, ” he says cryptically, not wanting to field any more questions on the subject.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/residents-of-bisrakh-who-revere-ravana-say-they-will-not-miss-ramlila-amid-covid-restrictions-101632678280682.html
27-09-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath announces hike in sugarcane price||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday announced ₹25 per quintal hike in the sugarcane purchase price in Uttar Pradesh about five months ahead of the state assembly election due in early 2022.Yogi Adityanath made the announcement about the sugarcane price at a meeting of farmers (Kisan Sammelan) convened by party’s farmers’ cell in Lucknow on the eve of the Bharat Bandh called by such farmers’ organisations which are demanding withdrawal of the Centre’s three new farm laws. “We have decided that the price of the sugarcane variety for which ₹325 per quintal was paid to farmers would be increased to ₹350,” Adityanath said amid applause from farmers who, UP BJP farmers’ wing chief Kameshwar Singh, said had come from all across the state. “My government has also decided to increase the price of ordinary sugarcane variety to ₹340 (per quintal),” Adityanath said. Previously, farmers were paid ₹315 per quintal for this variety of sugarcane. “The government has also decided to hike the value of the less yielding variety of sugarcane by ₹25 per quintal,” he added. The chief minister said these decisions would help the sugarcane farmers to increase their income by 8 per cent. “Effectively, it will transform the lives of 45 lakh farmers,” chief minister said. He also said 119 sugar mills will be operated and they will be linked with ethanol. He attacked the previous Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party governments (BSP) for the closure and sale of sugar mills. The BJP has already concluded farmers’ meetings at 298 places in 95 assembly constituencies with a sizeable presence of sugarcane farmers. “We selected those assembly segments which had a substantial presence of sugarcane farmers. In these meetings, we interacted with nearly 60,000 farmers,” the UP BJP farmers’ wing chief said. He said nearly 20000 farmers were present at the farmers’ meet. The farmers’ wing had felicitated 71 farmers at each district centre on September 17, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 71st birthday. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev, party’s national farmers’ wing chief Rajkumar Chachar, party’s UP in-charge and national vice president of BJP Radha Mohan Singh, UP agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi were among those leaders present on the occasion. The ruling BJP has sought to distinguish between the “real farmers and the ones agitating for political reasons.” “Theirs is not a farmers’ agitation, it’s a political agitation,” said the state’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya while referring to the ongoing agitation demanding rollback of the Centre’s three farm reform laws. “We have so many achievements to talk about. As many as 2.50 crore farmers in UP are benefitting through the Kisan Samman Nidhi, soil health cards, crop insurance, kisan credit card, 50 per cent discount on farm equipment. These are some of the many achievements that we will talk about,” the farmers’ wing chief said. In a major pro-farmer outreach initiative in August, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced cases against farmers for burning crop residue would be withdrawn and a decision would be taken to reimburse monetary penalties levied on such farmers. Also, orders were issued to not disconnect the power connections of farmers due to pending bills. However, these announcements failed to impress Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait who cited his list of demands, primary of them being the withdrawal of farm laws. “Scams have been conducted in the name of MSP (minimum support price) and there are districts where procurement has been done in the name of fake farmers. The BJP government had promised that farmers’ income would be doubled. Well, the government should ideally have declared sugarcane MSP at ₹650 per quintal, paddy at ₹3700 per quintal and wheat at ₹4100 per quintal,” Rakesh Tikait said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-announces-hike-in-sugarcane-price-101632676480103.html
27-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Climate Adaptation Plan: Designing the city for water||Mumbai’s climate has changed. The cyclones, cloud bursts and very heavy rain days of this past monsoon season have made clear that human-caused climate change is not just something to anticipate in the future, but is already part of our everyday environment. Amidst this emergency, the city has begun drafting Mumbai’s Climate Adaptation Plan (MCAP). Much will depend on how the plan is able to fundamentally reimagine and reorganize the city’s relationship with water. On August 27, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) launched its Climate Adaptation Planning process in a widely publicised event. The administrative and political leadership present was unequivocal about the urgency of climate change planning for the city. Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal spoke of multiple severe flooding events this past year. Maharashtra’s environment minister Aaditya Thackeray insisted that the planning exercise cannot remain an environmental wishlist on paper. “We don’t have time,” he said. The BMC, working with not-for-profit environmental groups, World Resources Institute (WRI) India and Waatavaran solicited inputs from experts on key aspects of urban development: waste, energy and buildings, urban flooding and water, air pollution and urban greening. With these inputs, and in consultation with the C40 network of sustainable cities, the city has charged WRI to help it draft a climate action plan. The draft of the plan should be ready in a month, for another round of public feedback. The plan’s success will depend not only on its expansive vision but also on how well it would serve as an instrument of coordination across different urban bureaucracies and sectors. The process will also need to be broad-based and consultative to ensure the plan will address vulnerabilities of the marginalized. And if it seeks to reduce flooding, it requires nothing less than a complete reimagination of the relation between land and water in the city. Not an island but an estuary In their pioneering work from 2009, Soak: Rethinking Mumbai in an Estuary, Anuradha Mathur and Dilip Da Cunha have identified the city’s hostile relationship to its different waters as a prime reason for much of the flooding in the city. They call for the city to move from urban planning projects that exacerbate the city’s adversarial relationship with its rains and sea, towards practices that recognise and accommodate water. The city, they remind us, is not built on seven islands. The city is placed in an estuary. For the last 300 years, the city has been made solid and dry through relentless projects of land filling. The floods that have regularly visited the city from its earliest days are a direct consequence of this land-making. Rain and tidal waters simply return every year to occupy the same grounds that were once khadi (wetlands), creek, or talab (pond). As a result, the city’s residents have long been accustomed to living with regular floods. With the intensification of the rains, the increase of cyclones and the rise in sea levels however, flooding is now more severe, more frequent and more widespread. It now occurs in parts of the city that never used to flood. The city’s near future depends on how it plans for and adapts to the persistent and increasing presence of water in the city. Inhabited Sea is a transdisciplinary, collaborative research project that I was involved with, sought to produce new imaginations of how we may live in cities with water. Started in 2019, the project brought together natural and social science researchers, architects, designers and artists in the United States and in India, to study what it might mean to design Mumbai amidst two gradients of wetness, the sea and the monsoon. From this research, we find that if Mumbai’s Climate Action Plan proceeds as planning traditionally has in the city, the floods will only get worse. This is because of important blind spots in traditional urban planning processes. Cities Partitioned and Dried First, urban plans are siloed and solid. They are narrow, top-down initiatives that divide up urban life into discrete parts of urban space, each addressed in different sections of the plan and in city bureaucracies. In Mumbai, for instance, storm water drains, sewage and roads are all managed by different departments in the city. Yet, Rhea Shah in her Inhabited Sea project, Drawing on Wetness, found, waters are always mixing: nalas hold sewage, rivers hold storm waters, the sea enters rivers and wetlands, and leaking pipes recharge aquifers. While conventional planning and even Mumbai’s climate planning process treats these as distinct, they need to recognise that different waters (drinking, rain, sewage and sea) are part of a single interconnected urban waterscape. Accordingly, planning processes like the MCAP need to integrate landscape architecture perspectives that consider the relations of different waters, air and land use systemically, and not as different sectors. Second, urban planning assumes that the city can be dried. Yet Mumbai is always wet — with the tides, wetlands, humidity, creeks, wells and rain. Rather than dealing with the impossibility of dewatering the city, planners need to see and support existing infrastructures that effectively hold water for some part of every day, month or year. Fortunately, the city still has a wealth of natural infrastructures — creeks, wetlands, nalas, and talabs — which provide considerable service to the city. Even at the MCAP climate consultations, the WRI quantified the significant economic benefit of mangroves that reduce the risks and costs of flooding, hold excess water during rain events, and also pull carbon out of the atmosphere. They are a mitigation as well as an adaptation infrastructure for the city. Yet, because the value of natural infrastructures is neither recognised nor calculated in urban planning or development processes, their loss is assumed to not cost the city. Thus, large infrastructure projects, like the coastal road or metros are proposed and constructed without studying how much the loss of trees or permeable ground will cost the city in future flooding. As Thackeray said at the launch, there has to be a climate lens for every infrastructural development. A road that floods the city cannot be called development. Valuing natural infrastructure Natural infrastructures need to be more accurately valued when making development decisions. To some extent, this is happening with mangroves. But the rate fixed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2009 is a gross underestimate of the ecosystem services provided by mangroves. The value assigned, at approximately ₹10 lakh per hectare, does not even cover the cost of land in Mumbai! The compensation for natural infrastructure loss, like mangrove habitat loss, needs to incorporate both the costs of land and the environmental services provided. Similarly rates, possibly payable to the city environment department, should be fixed for other natural infrastructures such as wetlands, intertidal regions and creeks and river floodplains, whose benefits — carbon sequestration, recreational spaces, flood adaptation and infrastructure — make the city a suitable place to live. Natural infrastructures are generally more cost effective (they are free) and can better complement costly engineering solutions such as storm water drains and water retention tanks. Natural infrastructures are also more spatially efficient. They are often valuable commons that are used by many of the city’s more marginalized populations for work. As such, the Mumbai adaptation plan needs to recognise and support multiply-used urban commons that serve as recreation areas, permeable water holding infrastructures and carbon mitigation spaces at different times of year. This is especially critical for a congested city like Mumbai. Maintaining water infrastructure Since the 1920s, when the city constructed the massive Tansa dam, it has been found that adding new supply does not solve Mumbai’s water problems. Instead, new source development constructs new problems. New dams caused deforestation and the displacement of adivasis in Thane district, Bharat Kaushal Punjabi pointed out in his 2015 thesis on the politics of water contestation in Mumbai-Thane region. New desalination plants consume lots of energy, raise sea temperatures and pollute water, causing harm to marine biodiversity. Neither deforestation and displacement, nor pollution and energy use are in line with Mumbai’s mitigation and adaptation goals. The city also has underground water sources it is not adequately using. For a long time, we have heard that Mumbai’s ground water is contaminated and cannot be used. Yet, many residents of the city are already using well water, obtained through its private water tanker network. Can these resources be made available for the public? Following a year of low rainfall in 2009, the BMC found, renovated, and used water from 12,531 wells in the city in one month alone. With adequate maintenance, Mumbai’s wells can continue to hydrate the city. Necessary policy changes can make everyday water insecurity and vulnerability, particularly for Mumbai’s informal residents, a thing of the past. The MCAP assessment on flooding and water resources points to the need to augment water sources in the city through desalination plants. This activity is fraught for all sorts of reasons, not least because new sources are totally unnecessary. As I show in my book, Hydraulic City: Water and the Infrastructures of Politics in Mumbai (2017), there is no water scarcity in city. All of the data points to the fact that the city receives enough water from its sources. The problem has to do with the significant inefficiencies of water distribution and leakages. According to one BMC report in 2009, these account for approximately 30% of water “lost” in the city. A new paradigm Following the catastrophic floods of July 26, 2005 the Chitale Committee Report pointed out that the rain event was an exceedingly rare, one-in-a-hundred-year event and that expanding the city’s existing storm water infrastructure was necessary. Together with other interventions in the city, these would ensure that the network would work during normal times. But normal times are a thing of the past now. The extremely heavy rainfall of July 2005 has happened several times since, including this year. Rainfall intensity no longer meets our historical expectations. The city of Houston, for example experienced three one-in-500 year flood events in the span of just two years! As such fforts to manage the city’s rains in the present and future, based on 100-year-old technologies will always come up short, and more so because we are living in climate changed times. Storm water engineers working at MCGM confess that the storm water improvements made in the last 10 years are already insufficient for the new normal. City officials cannot expect to drain the seas, intense rains and storms of the present and near future through conventional technologies. With new water and landscape approaches, however, they can find ways for all the city’s residents to live better with water.

Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will head an interagency delegation to the gathering, which follows an initial meeting in July at which little progress was made. The first meeting took place after Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin agreed at a summit in June to restart talks.The State Department said the two side intended “to have a deliberate and robust dialogue that will seek to lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures.” It gave no additional details but said Sherman would travel from Geneva to Bern and then to Uzbekistan and wrap her trip up in nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan.After the first round of talks in July, the US said the discussions with the Russian delegation headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov had been “substantive and professional” but had produced little in the way of substantive results except for an agreement to meet again.A senior State Department official who participated in those talks said the U.S. was pleased with the initial exchange and hopeful that it would be the start of a “sustained and productive dialogue” on arms control and other strategic issues.The official told reporters the agenda was not strictly confined to traditional nuclear arms control, but also delved into the use of space and artificial intelligence as well as cyber matters, although the cyber discussion was focused on strategic issues and nuclear weapons and not ransomware or hacking.The official said the Russians, as expected, raised concerns about American missile defenses, and the American side responded with Washington’s usual argument that those systems are not aimed at Russia but rather at threats posed by Iran and North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2nd-round-of-strategic-talks-between-us-russia-to-be-held-this-week-101632763286721.html

Jaafar Numeiry, Lebanese President Suleman Franjieh, Kuwait's ruler Sheikh Sabah al Salem al Sabah and Yemen's President Qadi Abdulla Iriani.South Yemen President Salem Rabia returned home before today’s session.The heads of State met for 90 minutes and then resumed after a 15-minute break.Conference sources said the short interval was to allow bilateral consultations among delegates.Armed police ringed the hotel as leaders carried on the crucial confrontation.King Hussein had faced accusations by the Arab leaders of deliberately trying to annihilate the Palestinian people. He completely denied these charges before flying here today.The King was accompanied by his Defence Minister, Maj.-Gen. Akkash al-Zabin, and top officials, President Nasser and Tunisian Premier Bahi Ladgam received him at the airport.Amman: Jordanian Crown Prince, the Emir Hassan, will act in King Hussein's place during the King’s current visit to Cairo, Radio Amman stated today. The radio said the newly-formed Jordanian Cabinet decided at its first meeting to give priority to re-opening the city’s water and electricity supplies.Military Governor Habes Majali formed a special committee under the Minister of National Economy to channel aid to the wounded.Shelling in Amman Beirut: A Palestinian guerilla spokesman here said Jordanian forces shelled parts of Amman, and the towns of Zarka and Salt early today. The Fatah guerilla spokesman said commandos still controlled the Roman city of Jerash and were "liquidating pockets of Jordanian troops trying to open fire I on civilians." People who arrived in Beirut from Amman aboard a Red Cross plane this morning said there was still some firing going on in the Jordanian Capital. The spokesman accused Jordanian authorities of waging a "war of hunger" against their people by preventing food, water and medical supplies from reaching revolutionary strongholds in Amman. In yet another attack on the Jordanian regime following the ceasefire agreement, they demanded that King Hussein stand trial 'for the annihilation of the human race." The tone of the statement gave little encouragement to observers here who had hoped that an end was in sight to the Jordanian crisis after 10 days of tank, artillery, infantry and air attack. Washington: President Nixon has authorised an initial $5 million relief aid for Jordan and said the United States will replace arms lost by King Hussein's forces. Under-Secretary of State John Irwin announced yesterday that the U.S. embassies in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon had been ordered to make immediate purchases of relief supplies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-sept-28-1975-hussein-arafat-sign-peace-agreement-101632763695585.html
27-09-2021||World||Qatar Airways says it lost $4.1 billion due to Covid-19||Qatar Airways said Monday it received $3 billion in state aid to weather the coronavirus travel downturn and to offset losses it blamed on the cost of grounding aircraft.The airline reported an overall loss of $4.1 billion for the year to March 31, double the figure for the same period the year before.Without the cost of grounding its Airbus A380 and A330 aircraft, Qatar Airways reported an underlying operating loss for the year of $228.3 million compared with $310 million the previous year.The Gulf carrier did report a slight uptick in overall earnings and a 4.6 percent increase in the amount of cargo carried in the last 12=month period.Qatar is among several governments that have stepped in to support their national carriers through the coronavirus shutdown, which has pummelled global travel and the aviation industry.In September 2020 the airline reported it had received $2 billion in state aid after its annual losses exceeded 50 percent of share capital."We adapted our entire commercial operation to respond to ever-evolving travel restrictions and never stopped flying," Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar al-Baker said in a statement, calling the last 12-month period "difficult"."While our organisation did not receive any subsidies in the form of salary support or grants, (the Qatari government) did provide an equity injection of 11 billion riyals ($3 billion) to support the business's continuity."Monday's results are the first full year numbers since the United Arab Emirates, a key market for the Gulf carrier, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, ended a boycott of Qatar in place since June 2017.They had accused Doha of links to extremist groups and being too close to Iran, Riyadh's regional arch-rival -- charges Qatar denied -- closing their airspace, borders and markets to Doha until a deal was struck in January.Qatar Airways is the second largest airline in the Middle East after Dubai-based Emirates, operating a fleet of 253 aircraft -- although some remain grounded during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qatar-airways-says-it-lost-4-1-billion-due-to-covid19-101632761884258.html
27-09-2021||World||‘Crossed all red lines’: Bennett vows not to allow Iran acquire a nuclear weapon||Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Monday that Iran had crossed "all red lines" in its nuclear program and vowed that Israel would not allow Tehran to acquire a nuclear weapon.In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Bennett said Iran sought to dominate the Middle East under a "nuclear umbrella" and urged a more concerted international effort to halt Iran's nuclear activities.But he also hinted at the potential for Israel to act on its own against Iran, something it has repeatedly threatened in the past."Iran's nuclear program has hit a watershed moment, and so has our tolerance. Words do not stop centrifuges from spinning," Bennett said. "Israel will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon."While there was no immediate response from Iran, Bennett, a far-right politician who opposes Palestinian statehood, drew an angry Palestinian reaction after he failed to mention the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his speech.Bennett, who ended Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year run as prime minister in June, wants US President Joe Biden to harden his stance against Iran, Israel's regional arch-foe. He opposes US efforts to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, abandoned in 2018.Indirect U.S.-Iran talks in Vienna have stalled as Washington awaits the next move by Iran's new hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi.Bennett struck a less combative tone at the United Nations than Netanyahu, who often relied on props to dramatize his accusations against Iran, an approach that critics derided as political stunts.But Bennett has been just as adamant as Netanyahu was in pledging to do whatever is necessary to prevent Iran, which Israel views as an existential threat, from building a nuclear weapon. Iran consistently denies it is seeking a bomb."Iran's nuclear weapons program is at a critical point. All red lines have been crossed, inspections ignored," Bennett said. "They're getting away with it."He called for international action. "If we put our heads to it, if we're serious about stopping it, if we use our resourcefulness, we can prevail," Bennett said.Biden told Bennett in White House talks in August that he was putting "diplomacy first" with Iran but if negotiations fail he would be prepared to turn to other unspecified options.Bennett also took aim at Raisi, referring to him as the "butcher of Tehran" and accusing him of human rights abuses against his own people over the years. Raisi, a Shi'ite cleric, is under U.S. sanctions over allegations of human rights abuses when he was a judge.Ignores Israeli-Palestinian conflictBennett made not a single direct mention of the Palestinians in his remarks, except to accuse Iran of backing anti-Israel militant groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad.Bennett, who sits atop an ideologically diverse coalition, was formerly the leader of the main settler movement in the occupied West Bank."Deliberately omitting a reference to Palestine reflects his fear of it, and once again proves to the international community that he is not and will not be a partner for Palestinians in the peace and negotiation process," Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki told Reuters.Biden, in his UN speech last week, declared renewed U.S. support for a two-state solution, after Trump distanced himself from that longstanding tenet of U.S. policy, but said Israel and the Palestinians were a long way from achieving it.Biden’s aides are mindful that US pressure for a resumption of long-dormant peace talks could destabilize the fragile Israeli coalition.Addressing the General Assembly on Friday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel of destroying the two-state solution with actions he said could lead Palestinians to demand equal rights within one binational state comprising Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.Bennett focused instead on Israel’s landmark normalization agreements brokered by the Trump administration last year with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. "More is to come," he said.Israel has trumpeted its new diplomatic relations as helping to forge a regional bulwark against their shared foe, Iran.Palestinian officials said they felt betrayed by their Arab brethren for reaching deals with Israel without first demanding progress toward the creation of a Palestinian state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crossed-all-red-lines-bennett-vows-not-to-allow-iran-acquire-a-nuclear-weapon-101632761145101.html

South Korean animal protection laws are intended to prevent cruelty but not dog meat consumption itself, according to Yonhap News Agency.The public has turned away from dog meat, with consumption dropping sharply over the past several years. Meanwhile, there has been a surge in dog and cat ownership, especially among younger Koreans who welcome the animals into their homes and see them as family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-president-moon-jae-in-considers-ban-on-dog-meat-consumption-101632749153981.html

The event was scheduled for 1:00 pm (1700 GMT).American health authorities have recommended boosters for three categories of people: those 65 and older, those 18-64 with an underlying medical condition such as diabetes or obesity, and those who are especially exposed to the virus because of their work or where they live.About 60 million people in the United States are eligible for a Pfizer booster shot, Biden said last week.Biden received his first Pfizer dose last December and a second in January, when he was still president-elect.He said people who have received Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccinations could get booster shots once studies have been completed and he expected that all Americans would be eligible "in the near term."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Friday that data on Moderna and J&J boosters would be evaluated "in the coming weeks."Biden had wanted to launch a mass campaign of Pfizer and Moderna booster shots this week for all Americans.But the move was put on hold by the US health authorities, dividing medical experts and triggering confusion about booster policy.The CDC on Friday overruled its own panel of health experts to back Pfizer booster shots for individuals at high risk of exposure to Covid-19 because of their jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-booster-shot-white-house-101632756710724.html

Ghulam Isaczai, the UN ambassador representing the ousted Afghan government, was due to speak on the final day of the General Assembly session but withdrew his name late on Sunday, news agencies reported."The country withdraws its participation in the general debate," AFP quoted Monica Grayley, a spokesperson for the UNGA president as saying.The withdrawal comes amid competing claims for Afghanistan’s UN seat in New York. Isaczai had earlier written to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, urging to allow him to retain his New York seat despite the Taliban’s rule in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the foreign minister in the Taliban’s interim government had nominated Suhail Shaheen, the spokesperson for the Islamist group, to address the gathering of world leaders.Also Read | ICC prosecutor seeks approval to resume war crimes probe in Afghanistan; focus on Taliban, ISIS-KWhile the rivals fight for accreditation at the UN, the committee that assesses the credentials of all UN members traditionally meets in October or November. The credentials committee usually operates with consensus, setting up for a possible showdown as this year’s UN committee includes Bahamas, Bhutan, Chile, China, Namibia, Russia, Sierra Leone, Sweden and the United States.While Isaczai has withdrawn his name from the speakers’ list at the UN General Assembly, he is likely to remain in the New York seat until a decision is made. The Taliban didn’t get a seat at the UN during their previous rule in Afghanistan as the credentials committee deferred its decision. The committee report had stated that the decision was deferred "on the understanding that the current representatives of Afghanistan accredited to the United Nations would continue to participate in the work of the General Assembly."(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-envoy-of-ousted-ghani-led-govt-withdraws-from-un-general-assembly-debate-101632754228745.html

While the company said that it stands by the “need” for the app, the project has been paused to consult with the parents and other stakeholders and explain to them its importance.Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s head of Instagram made the announcement in a blog post on Monday. “While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we’ve decided to pause this project,” Mosseri said. “This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today,” he added.We’re pausing “Instagram Kids”, although we believe building it is the right thing to do. More here: https://t.co/bwCyUn97SoHowever, the company has also assured that it will continue to build parental supervision tools to enable parents to oversee their children’s accounts, especially to teen accounts (aged 13 and above). “These new features, which parents and teens can opt into, will give parents the tools to meaningfully shape their teen's experience. We’ll have more to share on this in the coming months,” Mosseri said.Further, the company also stressed that pausing the programme does not imply that the idea was bad and said that kids are already online.“Critics of “Instagram Kids” will see this as an acknowledgement that the project is a bad idea. That’s not the case. The reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today,” Mosseri said.Also read | US court orders Facebook to release data related to violence against RohingyaInstagram KidsKnown commonly as “Instagram Kids”, the project was started to give parents the option of providing their children with a version of Instagram which is designed specifically for them.Mosseri, in his blog post, said that more and more younger children are having access to phones and are downloading apps that are not meant for children under 13. The project, however, could help the parents to supervise and control the experience of their children, he added.Several news reports showed mounting criticism for the project after it was announced back in March this year. In May, a group of bipartisan attorneys in the US wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking him to abandon the project considering the well-being of children, according to a news report by the Associated Press.Also read | Facebook apologises after AI feature mistakenly labels Black men as ‘primates’‘Instagram toxic for teen girls’The controversy surrounding the issue started with a report in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that claimed Facebook had failed to fix the “ill effects” of the platform which its researchers had identified.The WSJ cited a review of internal company documents, research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management for its report, according to several news agencies.Among major issues, the report said that Facebook played down the negative effects of Instagram on young users, according to a news report by Reuters. Meanwhile, HT has not independently verified the WSJ report.Also read | A different set of rules for ‘special’ Facebook users: ReportFacebook’s retortOn September 26, Facebook issued a detailed response from its head of research Pratiti Raychoudhury to the WSJ article where it denied the report and also provided a point-by-point reply to some key concerns.“It is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is “toxic” for teen girls. The research actually demonstrated that many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced,” the statement showed.The WSJ had reported that a slide from one of Facebook’s internal presentations in 2019, titled ‘We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls’, showed the research about teen girls who experienced the issues.In response, Raychoudhury shared the slide in question and said “While the headline in the internal slide does not explicitly state it, the research shows one in three of those teenage girls who told us they were experiencing body image issues reported that using Instagram made them feel worse — not one in three of all teenage girls.” The statement also said WSJ had not shared the slide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/instagram-kids-facebook-pauses-project-after-criticism-says-will-listen-to-concerns-101632753486941.html
27-09-2021||World||India increasingly important for Germany due to Indo-Pacific role, says envoy||India is an increasingly important partner for Germany because of its strategic role in the Indo-Pacific and the next government in Berlin is expected to continue a policy of working closely with New Delhi, German ambassador Walter Lindner said on Monday.Speaking shortly after the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) claimed victory in Germany’s federal election by securing an edge over Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, Lindner said all German political parties have largely similar security, global strategic and environmental interests in which the “importance of India is obvious”.With India set to become the world’s most populous country, major global issues – including global warming, climate change, population growth, vaccines, trade and terrorism – cannot be resolved without India, both at the multilateral and bilateral level, Lindner told a group of journalists.India and the Indo-Pacific may seem far away from Germany, but the region is increasingly taking on a central role in the German government’s vision because of its importance to global trade. Noting that a significant chunk of trade routes used by an export-driven economy such as Germany pass through the Indo-Pacific, Lindner said these routes could be “blocked by turmoil” or affected by states that don’t follow international rules.Germany’s focus on the Indo-Pacific is not a military strategy but part of an overall effort to protect the country’s interests, the ambassador said. As a part of these initiatives, Germany has sent a frigate to the Indo-Pacific, with the warship making stops in several countries.This was done despite some resistance to the move in Germany because of the increased interest in the Indo-Pacific and the frigate will also travel to Mumbai, Lindner said. The enhanced cooperation between the militaries of the two countries has dovetailed with the increased interest in the Indo-Pacific, he added.The two sides have also had a very strong strategic partnership for 12 years and bilateral trade is currently worth more than $20 billion. Some 2,000 German companies have a presence in India with 600,000 jobs and Germany is one of India’s biggest development partners. Germany is also home to about 25,000 Indian students, one of the largest concentrations in Europe.Lindner was confident that the next German chancellor would have enough advisers to help steer relations with India. Relations between France and Germany, which are the “motor of the European Union”, too will be crucial, he said. Responding to questions on the situation in Afghanistan, Lindner said Germany and other countries will have to talk to the Taliban to ensure the preservation of human rights and formation of an inclusive government, to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid, to ensure the evacuation of those who wish to leave, and to prevent any “fostering of terrorism”.“Do we talk to the Taliban? Yes, we do [like others] but not to establish relations, but to get those people out whom we still have there...we still have people there who worked for us,” he said.States will also have to talk to the Taliban to provide immediate relief through the UN and “so that we have some sort of influence” on issues such as human rights, guaranteeing the rights of women and children, inclusiveness of the government, and “no more fostering of terrorism”, he said.Lindner acknowledged that there was a “misjudgement of the Taliban and the velocity of the spread of the Taliban everywhere” by most countries. “No one predicted this outcome, everyone thought it would take longer and there would be more time to get people out,” he said about the fall of Kabul on August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-increasingly-important-for-germany-because-of-role-in-indo-pacific-german-envoy-101632753469356.html

"Please don't panic buy: if people drain the network then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."Royal Dutch Shell said it had seen higher than usual demand for fuel across its British network and that some sites were running low on some grades of fuel.Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was no shortage of fuel, urged people to stop panic buying and said there were no plans to get the army to drive trucks, though the Ministry of Defence would help with trucker testing.Hauliers, gas stations and retailers warned that there were no quick fixes, however, as the shortfall of truck drivers - estimated to be around 100,000 - was so acute, and because transporting fuel demands additional training and licensing.Brexit crunch ?For months, supermarkets, processors and farmers have warned that a shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers was straining supply chains to breaking point - making it harder to get goods onto shelves.Amid warnings of a dire winter ahead, some politicians in the European Union linked the supply chain stress to the 2016 Brexit referendum and Britain's subsequent decision to seek a distant relationship with the bloc."The free movement of labour is part of the European Union, and we tried very hard to convince the British not to leave the Union," said Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrat candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor."They decided differently. I hope they will manage the problems coming from that," Scholz said.British ministers have insisted that Brexit is nothing to do with the current trucker shortage, though around 25,000 truckers returned to Europe before Brexit. Britain was also unable to test 40,000 drivers during Covid-19 lockdowns.The government on Sunday announced a plan to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers.Edwin Atema, the head of research and enforcement at the Netherlands-based FNV union, told the BBC that EU drivers were unlikely to flock to Britain given the conditions on offer."The EU workers we speak to will not go to the UK for a short-term visa to help UK out of the shit they created themselves," Atema said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pumps-run-dry-at-british-gas-stations-as-shortage-of-truckers-strain-supply-101632747990020.html

Last year, the office of the prosecutor received approval from ICC’s Appeals Chamber to investigate the alleged atrocity crimes in Afghanistan since July 2002 but the investigation was deferred on request of now-ousted Afghanistan’s government.Karim Asad Ahmad Khan QC, a British lawyer and a specialist in international criminal law, commended the Ashraf Ghani-led government for constructive engagement with his office and the efforts aimed at “discharging its Rome Statute obligations.” Referring to the Taliban’s capture of Kabul, Khan said in a statement that the recent development and change in regime represent a significant change of circumstances impacting the “ongoing assessment of the deferral request”.“After reviewing matters carefully, I have reached the conclusion that, at this time, there is no longer the prospect of genuine and effective domestic investigations into Article 5 crimes within Afghanistan. It is this finding that has necessitated the present application,” he stated.The prosecutor said the investigation will focus on crimes allegedly committed by the Taliban and the Khorasan branch of the Islamic State (ISIS-K) given the “limited resource available” to his office and will deprioritise other aspects of this investigation. Khan mentioned the recent suicide attack outside the Hamid Karzai Internation Airport in Kabul that killed dozens of civilians and 13 US soldiers as one of the reasons to prioritise the crimes by ISIS-K for the investigation.“In relation to those aspects of the investigation that have not been prioritised, my Office will remain alive to its evidence preservation responsibilities, to the extent they arise, and promote accountability efforts within the framework of the principle of complementarity,” Khan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/icc-prosecutor-seeks-approval-to-resume-war-crimes-probe-in-afghanistan-focus-on-taliban-isisk-101632741378142.html

The Facebook post from Ghani’s account also urged the international community to help the movement of the Sunni Pashtun group and unfreeze Afghan assets, according to news agencies.The former Afghan president, who fled Kabul on August 15, wrote on Twitter that his official Facebook page has been hacked since yesterday and any content published afterwards are invalid until the account is retrieved.“The official Facebook page of Dr. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani has been hacked. Until it is retrieved, the content published from yesterday onwards on the Facebook page is no longer valid,” Ghani tweeted in Pashto.The Facebook post has since been deleted and the content couldn't be verified independently.Ghani fled to the United Arab Emirates after the Taliban laid siege on Kabul last month. While the Islamist fundamentalists are not seeking Ghani’s extradition, the group has accused the former president of taking four cars and a chopper full of cash amount of money along with him, demanding that he returns it back to the Taliban government. Ghani has categorically denied the allegations.Also Read | Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan with 4 cars, chopper full of cash: ReportIn a statement released on September 8, Ghani said he and his wife have been “scrupulous” in their personal finances and have declared all the assets.

Jinnah’s statue, which was erected earlier this year, was blown up by an explosive device place beneath it, according to Pakistan’s English daily. The blast was claimed by the banned Baloch Liberation Army.Gwadar Deputy Commissioner Major (retd) Abdul Kabir Khan said that the militants had entered the area, considered a safe zone, masquerading as tourists, reported BBC Urdu. While no arrest has been made so far, Khan told the Urdu language station that police are looking into the matter from all angles, assuring that the culprits will be caught soon."The demolition of Quaid-e-Azam's statue in #Gwadar is an attack on Ideology of Pakistan. I request authorities to punish the perpetrators in the same way as we did with those behind the attack on Quaid-e-Azam residency in Ziarat,” Balochistan’s former home minister and current Senator Sarfraz Bugti tweeted.Bugti was referring to a 121-year-old building, which the Baloch militants blasted and raked with gunfire. Jinnah had spent his last days of life and was later declared a national monument. The building caught fire due to the blast and gunfire, destroying furniture and memorabilia.Balochistan has been witnessing a spate of violence for several years, mostly due to the activities of the Baloch National Army. Recently, the BLA had targeted a motorcade of Chinese engineers at the Gwadar East Bay Expressway project in which two local children were killed and a Chinese national was injured."The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan strongly condemns this act of terrorism, extends its sincere sympathies to the injured of both countries, and expresses its deep condolences to the innocent victims in Pakistan," the embassy said in a statement after the attack.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jinnahs-statue-destroyed-in-blast-in-pakistan-s-balochistan-101632734079831.html

The agreement with federal prosecutors ended an almost three-year extradition battle in Canada as the US sought her prosecution. At the same time, China released Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were detained on spying charges in what critics in the US and Canada denounced as “hostage diplomacy.” On Monday, Hua asserted that the two cases weren’t connected, saying the Canadians’ release was “totally different.” “It is thanks to the relentless efforts of the party and the government and the full support of all the Chinese people nationwide that Meng Wanzhou is able to come back safe and sound,” Hua said. “This once again proves that Chinese citizens can rely on a strong China under the leadership of the CPC to have their back.”Meng’s return meets one of China’s key demands to improve relations that have soured since a trade war erupted during the Trump administration. The deal comes two weeks after President Joe Biden called Xi in frustration over Beijing’s move to link progress on climate change with other demands, including her release as well as lifting sanctions and removing punitive tariffs.Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau told Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that Ottawa learned a deal for Meng’s release was likely about two weeks ago.“The fact that a deferred prosecution agreement proposal had been arrived at between the Department of Justice, which operates independently, and Huawei lawyers, and that Meng Wanzhou was ready to sign it and that it seemed acceptable to the Department of Justice, that sort of unlocked the whole process and things happened extremely rapidly after that,” he said.China had insisted the US take the first step to improving ties, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi saying earlier this month that America “should meet China halfway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-case-xi-personally-gave-order-ensured-safe-return-of-meng-says-china-101632733685568.html
27-09-2021||World||Nasa's Landsat-9 to launch today with CUTE, CuPID missions | 10 points||American space agency Nasa is launching the Landsat-9 satellite, which has been developed in collaboration with US Geological Survey (USGS), on Monday. The space agency said that the launch is scheduled to take place at 2.11pm EDT (11.41pm IST).The satellite will be launched on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V 401 rocket from Space Launch Complex 3 at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.Nasa said in a release that Landsat-9 will continue the legacy of monitoring Earth's land and coastal regions that began with the first satellite in the series in 1972.Here are the key points about the Landsat-9 launch today:• According to Nasa, Landsat-9 will join its sister satellite, Landsat 8, in orbit in collecting images from across the planet every eight days.• The US Space Force’s Space Launch Delta 30 has predicted a 90 per cent chance of favourable weather conditions for the launch. The primary weather concerns are ground winds.• Landsat-9 will carry two instruments: the Operational Land Imager 2, which collects images of Earth’s landscapes in visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared light, and the Thermal Infrared Sensor 2, which measures the temperature of land surfaces.• Images from Landsat-9 will be added to nearly 50 years of free and publicly available data from the mission - the longest data record of Earth's landscapes taken from space.• The advance equipment onboard Landsat-9 will give a boost to space scientists' ability to measure changes on the global land surface, said Nasa. It will allow the scientists to separate human-induced and natural causes of change on land surface, the agency added.• Two small research satellites will also hitch a ride in the spacecraft's secondary payload adapter.• The Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE) from the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Cusp Plasma Imaging Detector (CuPID) from Boston University, are shoebox-sized spacecraft, each measuring approximately 8 inches by 4 inches by 13 inches.• Nasa said that CUTE aims to provide a better understanding of atmospheric loss on all types of planets by measuring atmospheric escape rates from giant exoplanets.• CUTE will target 10 to 12 exoplanets during its eight-month science mission, conducting a survey of heavy elements, such as iron and magnesium, escaping from the atmospheres of the most extreme planets in the galaxy.• CuPID, meanwhile, will study how energy from the Sun is deposited into the Earth’s magnetosphere - a protective bubble around our home planet, the space agency added. This mission could solve long-standing questions on space weather and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, said Nasa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-landsat-9-to-launch-today-with-cute-cupid-missions-10-points-101632730813575.html
27-09-2021||World||Social Democrats narrowly beat Angela Merkel's bloc in German vote||Germany's center-left Social Democrats won the biggest share of the vote in a national election Sunday, narrowly beating outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel 's center-right Union bloc in a closely fought race that will determine who succeeds the long-time leader at the helm of Europe's biggest economy.The Social Democrats' candidate Olaf Scholz, the outgoing vice chancellor and finance minister who pulled his party out of a years-long slump, said the outcome was “a very clear mandate to ensure now that we put together a good, pragmatic government for Germany.”Despite getting its worst-ever result in a federal contest, the Union bloc said it too would reach out to smaller parties to discuss forming a government, while Merkel stays on in a caretaker role until a successor is sworn in.Election officials said early Monday that a count of all 299 constituencies showed the Social Democrats received 25.9% of the vote, ahead of 24.1% for the Union bloc. No winning party in a German national election had previously taken less than 31% of the vote.Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state who outmaneuvered a more popular rival to secure the nomination of Merkel's Union bloc, had struggled to motivate the party's base and suffered a series of missteps.“Of course, this is a loss of votes that isn't pretty,” Laschet said of results that looked set to undercut by some measure the Union's previous worst showing of 31% in 1949. But he added that with Merkel departing after 16 years in power, “no one had an incumbent bonus in this election.”Laschet told supporters that “we will do everything we can to form a government under the Union's leadership, because Germany now needs a coalition for the future that modernizes our country.”Both Laschet and Scholz will be courting the same two parties: the environmentalist Greens, who were third with 14.8%; and the pro-business Free Democrats, who took 11.5% of the vote.The Greens traditionally lean toward the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats toward the Union, but neither ruled out going the other way.The other option was a repeat of the outgoing “grand coalition” of the Union and Social Democrats that has run Germany for 12 of Merkel's 16 years in power, but there was little obvious appetite for that after years of government squabbling.“Everyone thinks that ... this grand coalition' isn't promising for the future, regardless of who is No. 1 and No. 2,” Laschet said. “We need a real new beginning.”The Free Democrats' leader, Christian Lindner, appeared keen to govern, suggesting that his party and the Greens should make the first move.“About 75% of Germans didn't vote for the next chancellor's party,” Lindner said in a post-election debate with all parties' leaders on public broadcaster ZDF. “So it might be advisable ... that the Greens and Free Democrats first speak to each other to structure everything that follows.”Baerbock insisted that “the climate crisis ... is the leading issue of the next government, and that is for us the basis for any talks ... even if we aren't totally satisfied with our result.”While the Greens improved their support from the last election in 2017, they had higher expectations for Sunday's vote.The Left Party was projected to win only 4.9% of the vote and risked being kicked out of parliament entirely. The far-right Alternative for Germany — which no one else wants to work with — received 10.3%. This was about 2 percentage points less than in 2017, when it first entered parliament.Due to Germany's complicated electoral system, a full breakdown of the result by seats in parliament was still pending.Merkel, who has won plaudits for steering Germany through several major crises, won't be an easy leader to follow. Her successor will have to oversee the country's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which Germany so far has weathered relatively well thanks to large rescue programs.Germany's leading parties have significant differences when it comes to taxation and tackling climate change.Foreign policy didn't feature much in the campaign, although the Greens favor a tougher stance toward China and Russia.Whichever parties form the next German government, the Free Democrats' Lindner said it was “good news” that it would have a majority with centrist parties.“All of those in Europe and beyond who were worried about Germany's stability can now see: Germany will be stable in any case,” he said.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez sent early congratulations to Scholz.“Spain and Germany will continue to work together for a stronger Europe and for a fair and green recovery that leaves no one behind,” he wrote on Twitter.In two regional elections also held Sunday, the Social Democrats looked set to defend the post of Berlin mayor that they have held for two decades. The party was also on course for a strong win in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania.For the first time since 1949, the Danish minority party SSW was set to win a seat in parliament, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-democrats-narrowly-beat-angela-merkel-s-bloc-in-german-vote-101632719494630.html

The study showed that life expectancy dropped by more than six months compared with 2019 in 22 countries and reductions in life expectancy were seen in 27 countries out of the 29, including the United States, Europe and Chile. According to data by worldometers.com, 4,761,895 people have succumbed to Covid-19 till now across the world and the US continues to top the death toll at 706,317, followed by Brazil and India.The study revealed that there was a greater reduction in life expectancy for men than women in the majority of the countries. The largest reduction was seen in men from the United States, who saw life expectancy drop by 2.2 years relative to 2019. "The fact that our results highlight such a large impact that is directly attributable to Covid-19 shows how devastating a shock it has been for many countries," said Dr Ridhi Kashyap, co-lead author of the paper, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. Dr Kashyap appealed to more countries, including those in the bracket of low and middle incomeIn the US, the surge in mortality was largely seen in people of working age and those below 60 years. On the other hand, deaths due to Covid-19 among people over 60 years contributed more significantly towards the increase in mortality, the Oxford University study also showed.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) is seeking to revive its probe into the origins of the coronavirus disease, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. A team of 20 scientists is being formed to carry out the investigation. The revival comes after an initial inquiry by the United Nations (UN) body found out that the data provided by Chinese scientists is insufficient to answer important queries about Covid-19 origin.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-slashed-life-expectancy-by-most-since-world-war-ii-oxford-study-101632713223576.html

27-09-2021||World||Two women, political opposites, vying in race for next Japanese PM||The inclusion of two women among the four candidates vying to become the next prime minister seems like a big step forward for Japan's notoriously sexist politics. But their fate is in the hands of a conservative, mostly male governing party — and the leading female candidate has been criticized by observers for her right-wing gender policies.Sanae Takaichi and Seiko Noda are the first women in 13 years seeking the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in an election Wednesday. The winner is certain to become the next prime minister because of a parliamentary majority held by the LDP and its coalition partner.While both are LDP members, they are political opposites in many ways. The ultra-conservative Takaichi advocates a kind of paternalistic nationalism and a stronger military, while the liberal-leaning, pacifist Noda supports women's advancement and sexual diversity.“As tiny minorities in Japanese politics, women have limited choices to survive and succeed; they can confront the boys' club politics or they can be loyal to them,” said Mayumi Taniguchi, an expert on women's roles in society and politics at the Osaka University of Arts.Takaichi apparently chose loyalty while Noda appears to work outside the mainstream but without being confrontational, Taniguchi said.“They are quite different”In the race to pick a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the women are competing against vaccinations minister Taro Kono and former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. Kono and Kishida are considered the top candidates; both are from well-known political families and belong to powerful party factions.But Takaichi is seen by some as a fast-rising candidate, with the crucial backing of former leader Shinzo Abe, whose arch-conservative vision she supports. The latest media surveys of party lawmakers show she is beginning to rake in support from party conservatives, while Noda remains firmly in fourth place.The only other earlier female candidate was Yuriko Koike, currently serving as Tokyo governor, who made a run in 2008.While it's unlikely either Takaichi or Noda will become prime minister, having two women try for the top job is considered progress for the ruling party. Some experts, however, have criticized Takaichi's gender policies.“She will most likely not promote women's advancements if she wins,” said Sophia University political science professor Mari Miura.“She will emphasize her achievement in breaking the glass ceiling and declare that Japan is already a gender equal country, even that it is ahead of the United States."Japan ranked worst among the Group of Seven advanced nations — 120th in a 156-nation gender gap ranking survey of the World Economic Forum in 2021.Women comprise only about 10 per cent of Japan's parliament, and analysts say many tend to try to advance by showing party loyalty rather than pursuing gender equality.Takaichi has supported women's health and fertility issues, in line with the LDP policy of having women serve in their traditional roles of being good mothers and wives, but she is unlikely to promote women's rights or sexual diversity, Miura said.Takaichi, 60, was first elected to parliament in 1993 and her role model is Margaret Thatcher. She has served in key party and government posts, including ministers of internal affairs and gender equality.A drummer in a heavy-metal band and a motorbike rider as a student, she supports the imperial family's male-only succession, and opposes same-sex marriage and a revision to the 19th-century civil law that could allow women to keep their maiden name.Taniguchi, the analyst, says Takaichi's backing of the party majority is "unfortunate as her success could make many women think that speaking and acting on behalf of men is the way to be successful in this country.”Takaichi, who shares Abe's revisionist views on Japan's wartime atrocities, regularly visits the Yasukuni shrine, which honors war criminals among the war dead and is viewed by China and the Koreas as proof of Japan's lack of remorse.Her security policies include developing a preemptive strike capability to counter threats from China and North Korea.Political watchers say Abe's backing of Takaichi was made partly because he's aware of the need to improve the party's sexist image, and also to divert votes from Kono, the current front-runner and considered something of a maverick.Abe had promoted women's advancement, but his party made little progress and failed to meet a goal to have women represent 30 per cent of decision-making positions by 2020, postponing it by as long as a decade.Having a leader who prioritizes loyalty to men instead of fighting for other women's advancement, like Takaichi, could counter efforts to eliminate gender gaps, Miura, the professor, said.While Noda would push for more equality and diversity, her gender-equal policy is likely to be opposed by conservatives.Noda, 61, supports same-sex marriage and has campaigned for a quota system to increase the number of female lawmakers. She has promised to appoint women to half of her Cabinet if she wins.Noda had her first child, who is disabled, at age 50 after fertility treatment.Japan's rapidly shrinking population is a serious national security risk because Japan won't have enough troops or police in coming decades, she said in a recent campaign speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-women-political-opposites-vying-in-race-for-next-japanese-pm-101632710272052.html
27-09-2021||World||Germany polls: Country heads into unknown as rivals scramble to lead next govt||Germany headed into a period of unpredictability Monday after a close election saw both main parties claim the right to lead Europe's biggest economy, leaving the question of who will succeed Angela Merkel wide open.Partial results early Monday narrowly put the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) in the lead at 25-26 percent, followed by Merkel's centre-right CDU-CSU bloc with a record-low score of around 24 percent. The Green party placed third with around 14 percent.The SPD's chancellor candidate, Finance Minister and Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and his rival Armin Laschet from Merkel's conservative camp each claimed a mandate to govern, setting off a scramble for potential coalition partners.For a country used to political stability after 16 years of Merkel's steady leadership, the coming weeks and months promise to be a rocky ride.Western allies are watching closely, aware that domestic preoccupations could blunt Germany's role on the international stage and create a leadership vacuum in Europe.Laschet, 60, and Scholz, 63, both said their goal was to have a new government in place before Christmas.Citizens "want a change in government," said Scholz, who ran an error-free campaign that cast him as a safe pair of hands, contrasting sharply with Laschet's series of gaffes.Poker game"Scholz wants to be in power, so does Laschet. The poker game begins: who holds the better cards?" asked the best-selling Bild newspaper.In the fractured political landscape of the post-Merkel era, the most likely outcome will be a three-way alliance, ending the post-war tradition of two-party coalition governments.Scholz and Laschet will be looking to the Greens and the liberal, pro-business FDP party (11.5 percent) to make up the numbers needed for a parliamentary majority.The kingmakers however are not natural bedfellows, diverging strongly on issues like tax hikes and public investment in climate protection.Green chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock -- whose party hoped to do better with the climate crisis a top voter concern this year -- stayed vague about her preferred tie-up, saying only it was time for "a fresh start" in Germany.FDP leader Christian Lindner suggested sitting down with the Greens first before starting exploratory talks with the two bigger parties to speed up the process."Europe is waiting for Germany to have a new government," he said on Sunday evening.Lindner has signalled a preference for a "Jamaica" coalition with the CDU-CSU and the Greens -- named after those parties' black, green and yellow colours -- but has not ruled out a "traffic light" constellation with the SPD and the Greens.OptionsLaschet also evoked a sense of urgency on Sunday, saying Germany's stint as president of the G7 club of rich nations next year meant the country needed to have a government in place capable of taking action."The new government must come into office soon," he said, "definitely before Christmas".Neither the SPD nor the CDU-CSU want a repeat of the left-right "grand coalition" that has featured in three of Merkel's four governments.And no party will team up with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), whose score fell to 10.5 percent from nearly 13 percent at the last election in 2017 as its pet topic, immigration, fell off the agenda.The far-left Linke party also lost support and was teetering on the edge of the five-percent threshold needed to enter parliament.Until the complex negotiations are settled, Merkel will remain in her role in a caretaker capacity.Should the talks last beyond December 17, Merkel will overtake Helmut Kohl's record as Germany's longest-serving chancellor.'Hurts a lot'Merkel is still Germany's most popular politician, whose voluntary departure marks a watershed moment for the country of 83 million people.Her legacy risks being tarnished however by the CDU-CSU's poor showing in Sunday's election, which saw the bloc fall below 30 percent for the first time in its seven-decade-long history.In a painful illustration of the CDU's downfall, Merkel's own Baltic coast constituency -- which she had held since 1990 -- was taken by the Social Democrats.At the CDU's headquarters on Sunday, Alfons Thesing, 84, put his finger on the problem."It hurts a lot that Merkel is no longer there," he told AFP.Merkel, 67, will be likely be missed beyond Germany's borders too, having helped steer the European Union through years of turbulence that included a financial crisis, a migrant influx, Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic.While all Germany's main parties are pro-EU, none of her would-be successors can match her political gravitas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-polls-country-heads-into-unknown-as-rivals-scramble-to-lead-next-govt-101632709488724.html
27-09-2021||World||Taliban ban barbers from trimming beards in Afghanistan's Helmand province||The Taliban have banned hairdressers in Afghanistan's Helmand province from shaving or trimming beards, a media report said."The Taliban have banned stylish hairstyles and shaving beards in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan," The The Frontier Post reported citing the Taliban's letter.The publication further stated that officials from the Ministry of Islamic Orientation, at a meeting with representatives of men's hairdressing salons in the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, advised against styling hair and shaving beards.The order, distributed on social networks, also contains a request not to play music or hymns on the premises of hairdressing salons, The Frontier Post reported.Meanwhile, the Taliban is re-imposing repressive laws and retrograde policies. They are imposing laws that defined its 1996-2001 rule when they enforced their version of Islamic Sharia law.Amid reports of large-scale human rights violations by the Taliban in Afghanistan, the outfit earlier had put on public display the bodies of four people who were killed after they allegedly carried out a kidnapping in the western city of Herat.It is been over a month since the Taliban captured Kabul after an aggressive and rapid advance against Afghanistan government forces amid the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from the country.The country plunged into crisis last month after Kabul fell to the Taliban and the democratically elected government of former president Ashraf Ghani collapsed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-ban-barbers-from-trimming-beards-in-afghanistan-s-helmand-province-101632707662988.html
27-09-2021||World||German Social Democrats beat conservatives in vote to decide Merkel successor||Germany's Social Democrats narrowly won Sunday's national election, projected results showed, and claimed a "clear mandate" to lead a government for the first time since 2005 and to end 16 years of conservative-led rule under Angela Merkel.The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) were on track for 26.0% of the vote, ahead of 24.5% for Merkel's CDU/CSU conservative bloc, projections for broadcaster ZDF showed, but both groups believed they could lead the next government.With neither major bloc commanding a majority, and both reluctant to repeat their awkward "grand coalition" of the past four years, the most likely outcome is a three-way alliance led by either the Social Democrats or Merkel's conservatives.Agreeing a new coalition could take months, and will likely involve the smaller Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP)."We are ahead in all the surveys now," the Social Democrats' chancellor candidate, Olaf Scholz https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-leadership-race-boring-olaf-bets-craving-stability-2021-09-21, said in a round table discussion with other candidates after the vote."It is an encouraging message and a clear mandate to make sure that we get a good, pragmatic government for Germany," he added after earlier addressing jubilant SPD supporters.The SPD's rise heralds a swing left for Germany and marks a remarkable comeback for the party, which has recovered some 10 points in support in just three months to improve on its 20.5% result in the 2017 national election.Scholz, 63, would become the fourth post-war SPD chancellor after Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schroeder. Finance minister in Merkel's cabinet, he is a former mayor of Hamburg.Scholz's conservative rival Armin Laschet, signalled his bloc was not ready yet to concede, though his supporters were subdued."It hasn't always been the first-placed party that provided the chancellor," Laschet, 60, told the round table. "I want a government where every partner is involved, where everyone is visible - not one where only the chancellor gets to shine," he said in an early attempt to woo smaller parties.Schmidt ruled in the late 1970s and early 1980s in coalition with the FDP even though his Social Democrats had fewer parliamentary seats than the conservative bloc.COALITION FOR CHRISTMAS?Attention will now shift to informal discussions followed by more formal coalition negotiations https://reut.rs/2ZeqYw3, which could take months, leaving Merkel in charge in a caretaker role.Scholz and Laschet both said they would aim to strike a coalition deal before Christmas.Merkel plans to step down after the election, making the vote an era-changing event to set the future course of Europe's largest economy.She has stood large on the European stage almost since taking office in 2005 - when George W. Bush was U.S. president, Jacques Chirac in the Elysee Palace in Paris and Tony Blair British prime minister.After a domestic-focused election campaign, Berlin's allies in Europe and beyond may have to wait for months before they can see whether the new German government is ready to engage on foreign issues to the extent they would like.A row between Washington and Paris over a deal for Australia to buy U.S. instead of French submarines has put Germany in an awkward spot between allies, but also gives Berlin the chance to help heal relations and rethink their common stance on China.On hearing that the SPD were slightly ahead in polls, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters in Washington: "I'll be darned... They're solid."On economic policy, French President Emmanuel Macron is eager to forge a common European fiscal policy, which the Greens support but the CDU/CSU and FDP reject. The Greens also want “a massive expansion offensive for renewables”."Germany will end up with a rather weak chancellor who will struggle to get behind any kind of ambitious fiscal reform at the EU level," said Naz Masraff at political risk consultancy Eurasia.Whatever coalition ends up in power, Germany's friends can at least take heart that moderate centrism has prevailed, and the populism that has taken hold in other European countries failed to break through.The projected results for ZDF showed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) on track for 10.5%, worse than four years ago when they stormed into the national parliament with 12.6% of the vote, and with all mainstream groupings ruling out a coalition with the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-social-democrats-beat-conservatives-in-vote-to-decide-merkel-successor-101632705308272.html

The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) is an United Nations’ agency responsible for the promotion of responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism.History of World Tourism DayUNWTO was established on this day in 1980 to create awareness on how tourism affects social-cultural, political and economic values globally and the role of tourism within the international community.Significance of World Tourism DayOn World Tourism Day, UNWTO urges people to highlight the ability of tourism. “By celebrating this day, we state our commitment that, as tourism grows, the benefits that come will be felt at every level of our broad and diverse sector, from the biggest airline to the smallest family business,” Zurab Pololikashvili, UNWTO’s secretary general, said in his official message.UN secretary general António Guterres said the tourism sector touches almost every part of the global economy and societies, enabling historically marginalised people and those at risk of being left behind to benefit from development that is local and direct. “On World Tourism Day, we recognise the power and potential of tourism to advance prosperity and drive inclusive sustainable development,” he added.Theme of World Tourism Day 2021This year the theme of World Tourism Day is 'Tourism for Inclusive Growth'. It aims to help people associated with the tourism sector in every possible way.

Harbin raised risk levels to “mid-level” for five residential complexes and the province’s official Weibo account described the coronavirus situation as “severe and complex”.South Korea is preparing to offer booster shots to people over 60, medical workers and other high-risk groups.Australia’s Prime Minister called on states to open their borders. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said state premiers must not keep borders closed once the 80% of eligible Australians are vaccinated, a threshold he expects to reach by the end of the year. “I can’t see any reason why Australians should be kept from each other,” the leader said on a Sunday television programme. “That puts a heavy, heavy responsibility on those who would seek to prevent that from happening.”Rowdy celebrations in Norway as curbs endPolice in Norway on Sunday reported dozens of disturbances and violent clashes including mass brawls in the Nordic country’s big cities after streets, bars, restaurants and nightclubs were filled with people celebrating the end of Covid-19 restrictions that lasted for more than a year.The Norwegian government abruptly announced on Friday that most of the remaining coronavirus restrictions would be scrapped beginning Saturday and that life in the nation of 5.3 million would return to normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-donate-120mn-vaccines-to-poor-nations-prez-101632697155400.html
27-09-2021||World||German polls: Laschet commits ballot blunder||The conservative candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany’s general elections, Armin Laschet, on Sunday folded his ballot with his choices visible in a final blunder of a rocky campaign.Laschet voted in the normally secret polls for his and Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in his hometown of Aachen.The election rules dictate that the ballot “must be folded in a way so that the choices cannot be seen” so as not to influence other voters.The faux pas before live cameras set off a Twitter storm, with some calling it an “own goal” for Laschet, although electoral commission chief Georg Thiel later said the ballot was still valid.“A nationally known politician voted, as expected, for his own party,” Thiel tweeted. “This would not influence voters.”Greens Party candidate hopeful of more votesThe environmentalist Greens’ candidate to be the next German chancellor says she’s hoping for “a few more votes” than pre-election polls showed her party getting.Annalena Baerbock is the party’s first candidate for chancellor. It led in polls after she was nominated in the spring but recent surveys have shown it in third place, several points behind the center-left Social Democrats and outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Union bloc.Baerbock said as she voted in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, that “we are of course hoping for a few more votes, with a view to the poll results, so that we can achieve a real new departure in this country”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-polls-laschet-commits-ballot-blunder-101632697010840.html
27-09-2021||World||Race for Merkel’s successor too close to call: German exit polls||ermany’s Social Democrats and the conservatives are locked together in the national election exit polls, leaving the decision over Chancellor Angela Merkel’s successor hanging in the balance.Officials from both parties said they hope to lead Germany’s next government and have their candidates succeed Merkel, who has been in power since 2005.Olaf Scholz’s SPD, the front-runner over the final weeks of the campaign, had 25% of the votes, according to exit polls from broadcaster ARD on Sunday, which gave Merkel’s bloc -- led by Christian Democratic boss Armin Laschet -- the same result. A second poll by ZDF gave Scholz a narrow advantage of 26% to 24%.If support remains neck-and-neck, neither Scholz nor Laschet have a clear path to the chancellorship, setting up a messy post-election scramble. The control of the chancellery would likely be determined by the battle to sign up coalition partners to forge a majority.Nevertheless, the mood was upbeat at the SPD headquarters in Berlin and bleak at the CDU, where supporters were digesting the prospect of their worst ever election result.The general secretary of the Social Democrats Lars Klingbeil said he believes his party has been given a “mandate” to form a ruling coalition.In the CDU camp, several people covered their mouths in apparent disbelief when the exit polls were released. CDU general secretary Paul Ziemiak said after the publication of the ARD poll: “That hurts”.Party secretary Paul Ziemiak tried to maintain morale, telling his members they are in for a long night and they shouldn’t give up yet. “With this result, there would be a chance for a coalition” with the Greens and the Free Democrats, he said.“We cannot be satisfied with the results of the election,” Laschet told his supporters. “We will do everything possible to build a conservative-led government because Germans now need a future coalition that modernises our country.”After 16 years under Merkel’s pragmatic centrist leadership, the outcome of the vote will have wide-ranging implications for Europe and the West. The exit polls could prove less reliable than in past years because of the large share of mail-in ballots. Counting will proceed into the night. The fragmented political landscape means three parties would be needed to secure a majority in the German parliament for the first time in decades.The Greens, which are the SPD’s favoured partner, came in third with ARD projecting 15% -- their best ever results. The party is likely to play a kingmaking-role alongside the pro-business Free Democrats, which got 11% of the votes.The anti-capitalist Left, on 5%, could also potentially play a role in a coalition with the SPD.Whatever coalition formation ends up in power, Germany’s friends can at least take heart from an election campaign in which moderate centrism prevailed, and the populism that has taken hold in other European countries failed to break through. The far-right Alternative for Germany got 11% and will take a role in the opposition.The deadlock underscores the uncertainty facing Europe’s largest economy. Germany’s industrial model is under threat as value shifts away from mechanical engineering, while the country’s exporters risk getting caught up in geopolitical tensions, especially between the US and China.A new government will need to address the issues Merkel left behind, including aging infrastructure and a lack of investment in digital technologies. The most pressing issue is weaning its auto industry and its energy system off fossil fuels.Merkel and her current government, including Scholz as finance minister and vice chancellor, will serve until a new regime is sworn in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/race-for-merkel-s-successor-too-close-to-call-german-exit-polls-101632681754751.html
27-09-2021||World||Taliban appeal int’l airlines to resume flights||The Taliban government in Afghanistan appealed on Sunday for international flights to be resumed, promising full cooperation with airlines and saying that problems at Kabul airport had been resolved.The statement from their foreign affairs ministry comes as the new administration has stepped up efforts to open up the country and gain international acceptance following the collapse of the Western-backed government last month.A limited number of aid and passenger flights have been operating from the airport.But normal commercial services have yet to resume since it was closed in the wake of the chaotic evacuation of tens of thousands of foreigners and vulnerable Afghans that followed the Taliban’s seizure of the capital.The airport, which was damaged during the evacuation, has since been reopened partially with the assistance of technical teams from Qatar and Turkey.While some airlines including Pakistan International Airlines have been offering limited services and some people have been able to get places on flights, prices have been reported to be many times higher than normal. At present, airlines such as PIA and Afghanistan’s Kam Air are charging more than $1,200 for a one-way, 40-minute flight from Kabul to Islamabad. Even at that price -- the result of war insurance, according to the airlines -- the irregular flights are heavily oversubscribed.Foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi said the suspension of international flights had left many Afghans stranded abroad and also prevented people from travelling for work or study. “Many Afghan citizens were stuck outside and unable to return to their homeland,” he said in a statement.“Moreover, many Afghan citizens who have international employment or pursue education abroad are now facing difficulties in reaching their destinations,” Balkhi said.“As the problems at Kabul International Airport have been resolved and the airport is fully operational for domestic and international flights, the IEA assures all airlines of its full cooperation,” he said, using an abbreviation for Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the Taliban’s term for their new government.Since the Taliban overran Kabul on August 15 and seized control of the country, the Taliban have grappled with a severe economic crisis and have faced pressure on issues ranging from girls’ education to allegations of reprisals against former officials and others associated with the previous government.Despite international condemnation, the Taliban have said they will continue to impose swift and severe punishments on lawbreakers to stop crimes like robbery, murder and kidnapping that had become widespread in Afghanistan. On Saturday, Taliban authorities in the western Afghan city of Herat killed four alleged kidnappers and hung their bodies up in public to deter others.New passports, IDsThe Taliban on Saturday hintted they may decide on issuing new passports and national identity cards (IDs) for Afghans, and these may have written on them, the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan”, according to a report.Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesperson and deputy minister of information and culture, told The Khaama Press News Agency, it is possible that these new documents may be issued by the new administration. However, the existing identity documents remain valid for now, the Taliban-led government had announced last week. Khaama confirmed this to the news agency. Currently, the passport and NID departments are still closed in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-appeal-int-l-airlines-to-resume-flights-101632680936913.html

The chief minister’s assertion came in response to a suggestion by a lawmaker of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, Kalyani Roy, who insisted that there was a need to introduce a law to control the population.Biplab Deb cited data from the National Family Health Survey-5 2019-20 to underline that Tripura’s total fertility rate is 1.7, which is well below the replacement level of fertility.“In the current situation, there is no sign of unnatural growth of population in the state. Still, we have taken several steps like ligation camps for women, free distribution of birth control pills among women, non-scapale vasectomy camps for men to control the population. Despite this, the state will take timely decision on population control law, if required, “ said Biplab Deb.Also Read: The past and present of two-child policies in IndiaThe chief minister’s statement came after his party’s Kalyani Roy said Tripura, which had a population of 36 lakh in 2011, was estimated to have increased to more than 41 lakhs in 2021 on the basis of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), or UIDAI data. She claimed the population could rise to 47 lakh in the next 10 years, and cross 1 crore by 2091 that will create problems of food, living space, unemployment due to limited resources within the state. Ray, whose notice was supported by party colleague Sudhanshu Das, cited the steps taken by Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and sought similar measures“Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma introduced legislation on two children policies. Like Assam, this kind of legislation is required in Tripura, “ said Roy.To be sure, Assam hasn’t enacted a law to control population, but it does have a population policy in place. In 2017, the Assam assembly passed a population and women empowerment policy that barred people with more than two children from securing government jobs.

The policy is yet to be implemented.But top BJP leaders in the Assam government do frequently spotlight the rise in population, sometimes linking the rising cases of land encroachment with population explosion, especially among the Muslim population. ‘If the population explosion continues, one day even the Kamakhya temple land will be encroached upon,’ Sarma told reporters in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biplab-deb-rebuts-demand-for-population-law-in-tripura-says-no-unnatural-growth-101632767208431.html
27-09-2021||India||Three BJP nominees unanimously elected to Rajya Sabha||New Delhi: Three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders -- including former Assam chief minister and Union minister Sarbanand Sonowal, minister of state for information and broadcasting L Murugan, and senior leader from Puducherry S Selvaganabathy -- were unanimously elected to the Rajya Sabha on Monday, taking the party’s tally in the Upper House from 94 to 97. The BJP remains the single-largest party in the Rajya Sabha, whose strength at present stood at 231. Expressing his gratitude towards people, Sonowal tweeted, “With the blessings of the people of Assam, I have been elected to the Rajya Sabha from Assam.” He also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP national president JP Nadda, Union home minister Amit Shah and party general secretary BL Santhosh for giving him the opportunity to serve the state and the nation. Selvaganabathy, who was elected unopposed to the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Puducheery, became the BJP’s first MP from the Union territory. Murugan, a former president of the BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit, was elected uncontested to the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh on the last day of withdrawal of papers as the Opposition Congress didn’t field a candidate against him for the October 4 bypoll. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, BJP’s Sanjay Upadhyay had to withdraw his nomination as the party accepted the Congress’s request to allow an unopposed election for its candidate Rajni Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-bjp-nominees-unanimously-elected-to-rajya-sabha-101632767088790.html

Senior politicians like state Congress president K Sudhakaran and deputy inspector general of police S Surendran figure in some of the photos and videos. HT could not verify the authenticity of these photos and videos but later Sudhakaran said he knew him well and went to him for skin treatment.Mavunkal runs a big museum in the port city and many VIPs were frequent visitors there. Police said he promised a partnership for gullible investors in the upcoming archaeological museum in Kochi and collected money from many businessmen. There are also complaints that he gifted antiques to many VIPs and collected money from them later saying his payments were delayed due to some technical glitches abroad. But the police later found that he did not have any foreign bank account and his doctorate and medical degrees were also fictitious.There were many attempts to hush up cases against him and some of them (six victims) later approached chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who later directed a special team to investigate complaints against him which later led to his arrest. He was reportedly close to many senior police officers also. He is in judicial custody now. In his YouTube videos, Mavunkal claimed to have possessed many antique pieces like Mysore emperor Tipu Sultan’s throne, silver coins Judas received for betraying Jesus Christ, Soloman-era gold coins and rare books on Maratha warrior Shivaji and Mughal emperor Aurangazeb. He also claimed that he is a German-trained cosmetologist and treated many VIPs.There are also reports that many cine personalities frequented him quite often. When questioned, police said, he claimed that he handed over these gifts as replicas, not as originals.Later Sudhakaran and DIG S Surendran said they were not aware of his alleged activities. “I approached him in connection with a skin treatment. He was recommended by one of my old friends in Kochi. I was not aware of his past or his degree,” he said in Kannur (north Kerala). He said many VIPs used to visit him and his name was singled out and deliberately dragged to defame him. He squarely blamed the CM’s office for this. A Bete Noire of the CM, he is known for running a feud with him. DIG S Surendran also said he was unaware of Mavunkal’s unlawful activities. But some of the purported videos show he was celebrating a birthday party along with his family members in his house. “We have been complaining about him for quite some time. But he used his influence with the police to hush them up. Many VIPs were frequent visitors there. He claimed he’s a cosmetologist from Germany. Many people were cheated but fearing backlash and bad publicity they are scared to complain,” said one of the complainants KT Shameer who said he was duped of ₹3 crore claiming a share in the fictitious museum.A senior police officer, who did not want to be identified, said Mavunkal was a master conman and owned a fleet of luxury cars. “There are around 30 cars in his yard. We have information that he even brought used and abandoned high-end cars to show off. Maharashtra to Nagaland, number plates vary. It seems most of the VIPs were not aware of his shady past,” he said, adding that Mavunkal also used private security guards and was surrounded by many secretaries. He said fraud worth ₹20 crore has surfaced so far and more complaints are likely. Mavunkal is also believed to head a number of self-made organisations and NGOs. There are unconfirmed reports that some central agencies also sought details about him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-antique-collector-conned-many-101632767032160.html

With all the accused under arrest, the police’s priority will now be to file its chargesheet in the case, Chaure added. Of the total accused, two minors were detained last week and sent to a juvenile home in Bhiwandi. In her complaint on September 22, the survivor alleged that it all started in January when a man she was in a relationship with, threatened to leak their private videos and forced her to have physical relations with some of his friends and acquaintances. All the accused then raped the girl, a resident of Dombivli (East), at various locations such as Dombivli, Murbad and Badlapur in Thane district and Rabale in Navi Mumbai on multiple occasions till September, officials familiar with the matter said. The matter, however, came to light earlier this month when the survivor approached a relative over the prolonged sexual abuse. Based on the survivor’s statements, the FIR was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code as well as the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. A special investigation team was also formed to probe the case. While the FIR was initially filed against 27 people, more were arrested later when several other names cropped up during the probe. The survivor, who was admitted to a government hospital in Kalwa for medical examinations, was discharged on Saturday and provided police protection.Inquiries are still underway to collect corroborative evidence that can be presented in court, along with the victim’s statement and results of her medical examination, the officials cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thaneall-33-accused-of-gang-raping-dombivli-minor-arrested-saypolice-101632766252124.html

Further, he also said that the Goa state unit has become a “cruel parody” of what the Congress party stood for.Faleiro made the remarks following his resignation from the party and as a MLA earlier on Monday. Goa assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar accepted the resignation. Also, several loyalists of Faleiro have also quit the party.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi, Faleiro pointed to the party’s performance in the 2017 assembly elections in which it won 17 seats. He said that alongside the 17 MLAs, an independent MLA also won who was supported by the party and the party had also rallied the support of four others and had a “clear majority” with 21 MLAs.Also read | Former Goa CM Faleiro resigns as Cong MLA, says Mamata can fight PM Modi“However, I was prevented from going to the governor by the AICC desk in charge and asked to wait till we had 24 MLAs, a decision that eventually cost us the Government and allowed the BJP to steal the mandate through manipulation and inducement,” he said. “I felt dejected, shocked and utterly betrayed. We had let down the people of Goa who had entrusted us with their mandate,” he added.He also said that the Goa Congress was not the same party for which the leaders “sacrificed and fought” and said that it is functioning contrary to “every ideal and principle” of its founding fathers. “However, the Goa unit of the party has become a cruel parody of what the Congress stands for. Led by a coterie of leaders who prioritize personal gains over the responsibility we owe to our people, we have utterly failed to even be an effective Opposition,” he wrote.Mentioning that the party has been reduced to five MLAs from 18, he said that no one was held accountable for the loss of MLAs but “true Congress workers” were being sidelined. “ I see absolutely no hope or even the will to prevent the collapse of the party and change for the better,” he said.However, he said that his decision to quit his post and step-down from the party was “the need of the hour” and to dedicate his efforts to the betterment of the people of Goa. His resignation came as the state is scheduled to go to polls in 2022 for its 40-seat legislative assembly.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-hope-or-even-the-will-to-prevent-the-collapse-of-the-party-luizinho-faleiro-writes-to-congress-chief-sonia-gandhi-101632762215972.html

27-09-2021||India||Nitish Kumar govt drops decade-old demand for special status to Bihar||The Nitish Kumar government on Monday said that it will cease demanding for the special category status for Bihar and will seek special assistance instead. Brijendra Yadav, a senior minister of the Nitish Kumar cabinet, said that the government is ‘tired’ of demanding the special status.“There is a limit to it. Now we will seek special assistance in every field,” Yadav said.Bihar’s demand for special category status is a long-pending one and the ruling party Janata Dal (United) made it the primary election agenda throughout several elections.The special category status is accorded to states which have hilly and difficult terrain, low population density, presence of a sizable tribal population, strategic location along international borders, economic and infrastructural backwardness and non-viable nature of state finances. This criteria was introduced by the government in 1969 acknowledging that several regions of the country were disadvantaged than the others.The states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim and Tripura were accorded special category status. Jammu and Kashmir, however, does not enjoy a special status and a special category status anymore since Article 35A was scrapped.Bihar lawmaker from the Janata Dal (United), Rajiv Ranjan Singh, earlier during the monsoon session, asked in the Lok Sabha if the Centre is considering giving special status to Bihar, but the government in its reply said that the 14th Finance Commission gives states more fiscal space for implementation of projects.The Centre in 2015 said that the implementation of the 14th Finance Commission and forming of the Niti Aayog removed the concept of Special Category Status. It says that according to the 14th Finance Commission recommendations, the share of states in the divisible pool of central taxes has increased from 32% to 42%.Bihar lawmakers earlier this year cited a NITI Aayog's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index Report 2020-21 which showed that Bihar's composite score was lowest among all states to reignite the demand of giving special category status to the state. The report also showed that 33.74% of the population was living below the poverty line and 52.5% of the population were suffering from multidimensional poverty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-govt-drops-decade-old-demand-for-special-status-to-bihar-101632750328010.html
27-09-2021||India||Solution to farmers' protest only through dialogue, says Rakesh Tikait||Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait on Monday said the solution to the ongoing farmers' protest against the Centre's three agri laws can be reached only through dialogue and not in the courts.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson was speaking during an online discussion hosted by the Bharatiya Chhatra Sansad (Indian Students Parliament), Pune, a non-political platform.Several trains were cancelled, highways and key roads blocked and many thousands stranded for hours on Monday as a nationwide 10-hour shutdown against the Centre's three agri laws disrupted lives across parts of India, particularly in the north.Tikait said the 10-month-long protest, under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), is to prevent 'roti' from becoming a market commodity, and privatisation of the agriculture sector."I don't know what is going to be the end of this protest but the movement has begun and the country's youth, who often remained away from discussion on farming-related issues, is also joining it," he said.In response to a query on the way forward, the BKU leader said, "The solution to the ongoing protests against the three agri laws of the Centre can be achieved only through dialogue and not in the courts of law."He said the farmers' stir is not only against the three laws and for legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops but also against privatisation of agriculture.Referring to a leading multinational fast food chain, Tikait claimed, "When these stores close their work at the end of the day, they have plenty of unsold food which goes to the dustbins. There could be hungry staff or poor people outside their shops, but the unsold food goes to the dustbin only."Hitting out at the BJP-led Centre, he alleged that the government has now "illegally" captured "several institutions" which the country has also understood now.Speaking at the session earlier in the day, BJP MLA and Deputy Speaker in the Assam Assembly Dr. Numal Momin said the new laws are aimed at checking middlemen in the farming sector and benefitting both farmers and consumers.He said the growth of farmers was important for the country's growth and some people opposed to the new laws now might realise their benefits eventually."PM Modi brought these laws to end the middlemen from the farming system. Also, the benefits, which earlier went to middlemen, would be passed on to consumers,” Momin said."It would take some time for some people to realise the benefits of these laws. Opposition to these laws is understandable. It's a democracy and some people who have some objections on some points are opposing the laws," he added.Hundreds of farmers have been camping at Delhi's three border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- since November 2020 under the banner of SKM, demanding that the three contentious farm laws be repealed and a legal guarantee provided to them on MSP of crops.Tikait has been leading the charge with his supporters at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border.The Centre, which has held 11 rounds of formal dialogues with the farmers, has maintained that the new laws are pro-farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/solution-to-farmers-protest-only-through-dialogue-says-rakesh-tikait-101632744875810.html

The allegations against Amazon are very serious and they cannot be ignored," he said.Asked about the comments of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Khera said, "What the RSS says about Amazon is irrelevant because there is a duet going on between the RSS and the BJP."We have seen that duet and they stand exposed in the farmers' agitation. We have seen the dubious role played by the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh as it has not come in support of the farmers even for one day in the last 10 months."The Congress leader said "nobody takes what the RSS says seriously anymore, because they do not speak the language in national interest, they talk in the interest of the BJP."Amazon was dubbed as "East India Company 2.0" by "Panchjanya", which has also alleged that the firm has paid crores of rupees in bribes for favourable government policies.In its latest edition, which will hit the stands on October 3, the RSS-linked weekly has carried a cover story that is highly critical of Amazon."Whatever the East India Company did in the 18th century to capture India, the same is visible in the activities of Amazon," the article titled "East India Company 2.0" reads.Claiming that Amazon wants to establish its monopoly in the Indian market, it says, "For doing so, it has started taking initiatives for seizing the economic, political and personal freedom of the Indian citizens."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-remark-on-amazon-irrelevant-but-charges-against-firm-can-t-be-ignored-cong-101632745475470.html

MOP is a restricted commodity for export under the foreign trade policy.The customs department’s investigation report, reviewed by HT, states that Agrasain Gehlot’s company – M/s Anupam Krishi – allegedly played a key role in the irregularities. It is suspected that the MOP was exported to companies in Malaysia and Singapore.The customs probe report states that Agrasain Gehlot “knowingly opted to become a part of the syndicate in the entire chain of the conspiracy by facilitating the said consortium (of private companies) by supplying subsidized MOP, which was meant for sale to farmers only and forged documents for which he admittedly gained a certain amount as his commission”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-examines-ashok-gehlot-s-brother-agrasain-gehlot-in-money-laundering-probe-101632746086933.html
27-09-2021||India||Police on lookout for ‘Mr Natwarlal’ who duped many posing as govt official||Police in Assam are on the lookout for a fraudster who has reportedly duped many persons in past years posing as a senior government official. In his early 30s, Mridupaban Neog is believed to have been active for some time but police in Nagaon district came to know about his activities last week after a car dealer filed an FIR alleging he cheated him of ₹31 lakhs. “Our investigation against this person has been going in the right track and you will get positive results soon,” Assam director general of police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta told journalists on Sunday. Based on the FIR lodged under several IPC (Indian Penal Code) sections for cheating, criminal breach of trust, impersonating public servant and criminal intimidation, a joint team of Nagaon and Guwahati police raided Neog’s house in Guwahati on Saturday. Though they recovered many incriminating documents and material, the conman managed to give a slip to the police team. Besides two luxury vehicles, police found a .32 pistol, 20 live rounds, many letter pads in the name of the accused with the Government of India insignia, several identity cards with different designations, many bottles of expensive liquor, gold jewellery worth several lakhs, logo of a media house etc. “This man is like the Hindi movie character Mr Natwarlal, a fraud with different identities. He finds rich and gullible people and tricks them into parting with large sums of money using different means,” said Anand Kumar Mishra, Nagaon superintendent of police. “Once people start asking him to return their money, he threatens them by showing his so-called connections with top shots. In the present case, he took ₹31 lakhs from the complainant saying he’s a senior ministry of home affairs official and needed to sell his Fortuner SUV as he needed the money urgently,” he added. When Neog failed to deliver the vehicle after two months, the complainant approached the police. A little bit of digging up by the police revealed that Neog had duped several others. “He would pose with celebrities, bureaucrats, politicians and ministers and post those photos on social media, claiming closeness to these persons. Lot of people believed his claims and became victims,” said Mishra. “Sometimes he would say he’s a Central government official, at other times he would say he’s a civil servant from Assam. He would also claim to be senior journalist, if required,” he added. Neog is reported to have studied till Class 10. A Twitter account in his name shows him shaking hands with governor of Assam Jagdish Mukhi. HT couldn’t verify the authenticity of the account or the photo. Police have arrested a private security guard employed by Neog and are questioning him. “Lots of people in Assam’s corridors of power seemed to be aware of Neog’s activities. But it is only now that some of those cheated by him have started coming forward,” said Mishra. On Saturday, the all women police station at Panbazar in Guwahati lodged another complaint against Neog following a complaint by a woman about receiving threatening calls from a phone number apparently belonging to Neog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-on-lookout-for-mr-natwarlal-who-duped-many-posing-as-govt-official-101632744586188.html

27-09-2021||India||Amid conciliatory talks senior leader VM Sudheeran resigns from AICC||Two days after he quit the party’s political affairs committee (PAC), sulking Congress leader VM Sudheeran on Monday announced his resignation from the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the second highest decision making body of the party after the Congress Working Committee (CWC). His announcement came in the wake of his scheduled meeting with AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar who rushed to Kerala to sort out problems arising out of the recent elevation of a new set of state and district leaders. While Sudheeran, former PCC chief and five-time MP, did not disclose reasons for quitting, leaders close to him said he was not happy with the functioning of new Pradesh Congress Chief (PCC) chief K Sudhakaran and opposition leader VD Satheesan. Responding to allegations that decisions were being taken unanimously ignoring senior leaders, the PCC chief said Sudheeran was consulted before announcing the District Congress Committee list. Hectic efforts were on to placate the senior leader and Anwar was expected to call on him in the evening. Former CM Oommen Chandy and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala also termed his resignation unfortunate and asked party leaders to talk to him. Known for his clean image, Sudheeran quit the PCC chief’s post after the party’s rout in 2016 assembly elections. It was then alleged that he forced then CM Chandy to take some unpopular decisions like issuing the new liquor policy. Recently, fireworks started in the faction-ridden state unit of the party with the appointment of new president K Sudhakaran, a tough leader from Communist heartland Kannur and opposition leader VD Satheesan, sidelining two powerful blocs led by former CM Oommen Chandy and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala, who dominated the state unit for more than one and a half decade. Problems aggravated after the DCC presidents’ list was released last month. The party currently has 150-odd secretaries and many other office-bearers, and the PCC chief has made it clear that all new party bodies will be lean and mean. Many see the leadership transition as a major generational shift but leaders of factions claim it will be difficult for the party to surge ahead after sidelining two senior leaders and their followers. After public display of anger at the changes, three senior leaders have quit the party, AV Gopinath, KP Anil Kumar and PS Prashanth-- the last two have joined the ruling CPI(M).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-conciliatory-talks-senior-leader-vm-sudheeran-resigns-from-aicc-101632741946010.html

27-09-2021||India||Campaign at Bhawanipore disrupted by TMC demonstration around BJP’s Dilip Ghosh||The final campaigning for the September 30 bypoll at Kolkata’s Bhawanipore assembly seat was disrupted on Monday afternoon when Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers staged demonstration, obstructing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national vice-president Dilip Ghosh and shouted ‘go back’ slogans. In response, the BJP decided to move the Election Commission urging it stop the election in Bhawanipore. The incident took place at Jadu Babu Bazar where Ghosh was campaigning on foot. A BJP worker, Bharat Narayan Singh, suffered minor injuries when his associates got into a scuffle with TMC workers. Security personnel accompanying Ghosh had to escort him to safety. Two of them were caught on camera when they drew their pistols at the TMC workers, apparently to scare them. Ghosh also got agitated and shouted back at the crowd. BJP Lok Sabha member and state vice-president Arjun Singh, who was campaigning at Sambhunath Pandit Street, faced similar demonstrations when he approached the location where Ghosh was surrounded. Singh had to leave the spot. “Today’s incident has proved that the situation is not conducive for holding free and fair polls. We will submit a memorandum to the EC urging it withhold the poll till the law and order situation gets normal. However, we will contest if the EC decides to go ahead with the election,” Dilip Ghosh said. TMC workers also staged a demonstration near a podium, set up by the BJP for a roadside meeting on Ashutosh Mukherjee Road. Leader of the Opposition in the assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, addressed people from the podium later in the afternoon. “These disruptions are being created to scare voters,” Adhikari said in his speech. As many as 80 BJP leaders hit the streets to muster support for party candidate Priyanka Tibrewal on the last day of campaigning. TMC leaders and ministers also started campaigning early for chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who needs to win the bypoll to continue as CM of West Bengal. “Central armed police forces will not sit silent if incidents like this happen on the day of polling,” said Tibrewal. BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar, who also took part in the campaign, condemned the demonstration. “The TMC must change its culture and start showing respect to democratic practices. Ghosh is a senior leader. One should at least respect his age. Do BJP workers demonstrate around Mamata Banerjee or her nephew Abhishek Banerjee when they visit Delhi?” asked Majumdar. Transport minister Firhad Hakim, who led the TMC campaign, said, “Common people demonstrated against Ghosh. They should not have paid him so much attention. BJP leaders are irrelevant in state politics.” Bhawanipore has 206,389 voters. According to TMC and BJP leaders, more than 20 % Bhawanipore residents are Muslims, while Sikhs and non-Bengali speaking Hindus comprise around 34 % of the local population. The constituency comprises eight civic body wards. The BJP announced on Sunday that 10 leaders will visit each of these eight civic body wards. Their campaign started at 8 am. The Election Commission has sought a report on the trouble in Bhawanipore. The returning officer has also been asked to examine video footage showing Dilip Ghosh’s security personnel pointing pistols at the crowd, an official said on condition of anonymity. The Kolkata Police deployed additional forces in Bhawanipore in the afternoon. BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said, “It appears that the TMC had made elaborate plans to create trouble. Our leadership is going to hold a meeting to review the situation. Can polls be held peacefully in a situation like this?.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/campaign-at-bhawanipore-disrupted-by-tmc-demonstration-around-bjp-s-dilip-ghosh-101632740506020.html

Bagel Ram, the 54-year-old protester, was a member of the Kirti Kisan Union, and was present at the protest site in Singhu on Bharat Bandh.Gurnam Bhagad, the leader of Kirti Kisan Union, said Bagel Ram was a member of the farmers' outfit. “He was not a farmer but a labourer from Jalandhar and arrived at the Singhu border with one of our groups on September 18. He has been feeling unwell since yesterday and suffered a heart attack this morning.”Farmers dies by suicide in PunjabIn another incident, a farmer in Ludhiana died by suicide on Sunday after he hanged himself to death hours before the Bharat Bandh commenced. It was unclear whether the ‘suicide’ was an act of protest against the three farm laws which were passed in the Parliament on September 27, last year, during the monsoon session.The 65-year-old farmer was found hanging from a pipe in the wee hours of Monday by other farmers next to the toll barrier near Ghulal village in Samrala. He along with his wife were protesting against the farm laws at Delhi’s borders for the past 10 months.The Bharat Bandh called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella organisation of more than 40 farmers’ rights groups, received mixed response across the country. Traffic snarls were reported from parts of the National Capital Region (NCR). Though several states, like Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, did not evoke any response to the nationwide strike call, it was Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala which saw strong to moderate response to the nationwide strike call.The farmers called the nationwide strike to protest against the three farm bills which they claim will lower farm incomes, remove the procurement under the minimum support price (MSP) system and make the agricultural sector profitable for private sector companies.(With inputs from Kainat Sarfaraz and Tarsem Deogan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-protester-dies-of-heart-attack-at-singhu-border-101632738646568.html
27-09-2021||India||Sneha Dubey: The new, young inspiration for Gen Z||Her piercing rebuttal to comments of Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), has won the hearts of Indians the world over. And India’s first secretary to UN, Sneha Dubey has overnight emerged as the new icon of inspiration for the youth! She is garnering unprecedented praise for her fiery response, ever since the video clipping of her speech has gone viral on social media. What’s caught the attention of many is Dubey’s choice of words and the deft delivery by this Indian Foreign Service’s officer. “In a country where women are often thought to be suppressed and not have political views, Sneha has proved that women too can give a strong counter argument. She is the voice of the youth, who often feel alienated from politics, and shows how a young female can fight against inequalities in society, and leave a strong impression on the world stage,” says Gitoshri Sen, a BA Psychology (Hons) student at Delhi University (DU). Dubey’s coherent speech has also kindled pride in the UPSC aspirants, who say they too want to make an impact like this young civil servant from 2012 batch. “What better epitome can the world get at such an important platform where women empowerment is all up to shut the false claims of Pakistan,” asks Jasika Pawar, a UPSC aspirant. Adding to this view, Pragya Gupta, another Delhi-based UPSC aspirant, says, “Pakistan tries to use the world stage to tarnish India’s image through platforms like the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and UNGA. But, all this is without much success till there are IFS officers like Sneha! It’s inspiring to see the fake faces being served a strong and befitting reply by a feisty, young Indian diplomat.” Sejal Chopra, another DU student feels “really proud at how young minds like Dubey are thinking and voicing their concerns for our country”. Chopra opines, “What Sneha has said is correct in every sense, and it’s known that Pakistan does favour terrorism, which has been hampering not just India’s growth but also disrupting the peace of humanity across the globe. It’s impossible for Pakistan’s government to not know what kind of militant or terrorist activities are thriving on their soil! It’s very important to point this out at such a platform where the world sees and accepts Pakistan at face value. I’m in awe of how this girl articulated all these thoughts so well, and yet mentioned all the crucial issues in a respectable yet firm tone!” Even students of Dubey’s alma mater, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), are hailing her speech. “She has done a great job at the UN platform,” says Danish, a research scholar at JNU’s School of International Studies. “Our Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, is also an alumna of this school... Deliberations on international relations are part of the course and training here, and aid in becoming a diplomat. Being a student of the same college, I feel truly proud, and also hope to serve our country in future!” All about Sneha Dubey!* An Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer of 2012 batch, she cleared the UPSC exam in one attempt. * She was born in Goa, and did her schooling there. Later, she pursued higher education at Pune’s Fergusson College and MPhil from Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. * She wanted to join the IFS since she was 12.* Her father works in a multinational company, and mother is a school teacher.

Protesters led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and the Communist Party of India (CPI) blocked National Highways and other key roads across the state and also squatted on railway tracks. However, no major incident has been reported during the shutdown from any part of the state so far. Chaos prevailed at Danapur, Patna and Rajendra Nagar railway terminus, where commuters waited for train services to resume in sweltering heat . Passengers stuck on trains, stranded in the blockade, were seen getting off with luggage in their hands, hoping to make some alternate arrangement to finish their remaining journeys.Most of the private schools in Patna, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur and Gaya were closed while business establishments such as restaurants and eateries functioned as usual. In Patna, students of Patna University blocked Ashok Rajpath, burnt tyres and raised slogans in support of the shutdown. At Patna junction round about, some political workers attacked and damaged windowpanes of local buses and their crew. Traffic was thin as auto rickshaws and private buses, the main mode of public transport in the state capital, kept away from the roads. A vegetable seller Ashok Mahto in Patna’s Anta Ghat area, said the bandh was not forced on them and they had voluntarily shut down business for the day in support of the cause. RJD supporters led by member of legislative assembly (MLA) Mukesh Roushan blocked Gandhi Setu which connects North Bihar with Patna, disrupting vehicular traffic and resulting in huge traffic jam. CPI, CPI(M) and CPI(ML) supporters, led by MLA Sudama Prasad blocked Ara-Patna-Sasaram highway, held public meeting and raised anti-government slogans. Demonstrations were also reported from Jehanabad, Darbhanga, Begusarai, Nawada, where protestors forcibly stopped train movements. There were similar protests in Aurangabad, Nawada, Sheikhpura, Gopalganj, Saran, Siwan, Sitamarhi, Samastipur, Bhagalpur and Lakhisarai, where protestors blocked roads in some areas this morning. A senior state government official, however, said the situation was peaceful. The Bihar police had put in place elaborate security measures during the Bharat Bandh, which will end at 6 pm. East Central Railway’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said several trains were halted at Begusarai, Sheikhpura, Nawada, Jehanabad and Darbhanga due to the agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-road-train-traffic-thrown-out-of-gear-in-bihar-101632737685999.html

In his letter to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Gandhi has demanded to increase the rate of sugarcane to ₹400 per quintal.“Sugarcane rate in the upcoming crushing season in Uttar Pradesh is ₹350, thanks to Yogi ji for declaring 350/quintal. I request you to please reconsider this according to the rising cost and inflation and declare the rate at ₹400 or give a bonus of 50/quintal above the declared rate separately,” the BJP MP tweeted and attached his letter to the chief minister.His remarks come a day after Adityanath announced a ₹25 per quintal hike in the purchase prices of sugarcane in the state taking it to ₹350 per quintal.In his letter, Varun Gandhi said that the cost of sugarcane has increased significantly in the last four years but in the last four seasons, the price has increased by only ₹10 per quintal. At the same time, the BJP MP said that the economic condition of sugarcane farmers remains pathetic. The BJP MP said that the economic condition of sugarcane farmers remains pathetic, they are not getting proper sugarcane and are in debt.In a letter sent to the chief minister on Monday, Varun Gandhi said, “Expenditure is increasing but the price is not. Sugarcane is a major crop in Uttar Pradesh, about 50 lakh farmer families are engaged in its cultivation. Lakhs of labourers also get employment from this. Sugarcane farmers of my area Pilibhit have requested to inform you that in the last four years, the cost of sugarcane, fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, electricity, water, diesel labour, transportation etc. has increased a lot.”Reiterating his demand, Gandhi said lakhs of farmers are looking at Adityanath with the hope that he will further increase the cane prices.“With the continuous rise in input cost for farmers, the cane prices should be fixed at minimum ₹400 per quintal. It is a matter of livelihood for lakhs of farmers and labourers,” Gandhi said.This is the second time the Pilibhit MP has written to the chief minister. He sought an increase in sugarcane prices earlier this month as well.Gandhi earlier sought various relief measures for farmers in Uttar Pradesh including subsidy on diesel, bonus above MSP of wheat and paddy and doubling the amount under the PM KISAN scheme.He also advocated for re-engaging with protesting farmers to reach a common ground during the Muzaffarnagar Mahapanchayat which was held on September 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varun-gandhi-writes-to-cm-yogi-again-urges-to-increase-sugarcane-prices-101632737506437.html

Some may wonder what does health care program have to do with tourism?,” PM Modi asked while addressing the launch event of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission. “But health has a very strong relationship with tourism. Because when our health infrastructure is integrated and strengthened, it also affects the tourism sector in a positive way,” he pointed out.He asked whether a tourist will want to visit a place that doesn’t have good health infrastructure. “And after corona, it has become all the more important. Tourists will feel safe in places that have vaccinated the most number of people. And you must have noticed that in places like Himachal, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Goa and Andaman and Nicobar—the tourist destination states—there has been a stress on the pace of vaccination so that tourists have a sense of trust,” he added.Also read | Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission: All you need to knowWorld Tourism Day is observed to stress the potential of tourism and raise awareness of its importance in affecting the international community’s social, cultural, political and economic values. This year the theme of World Tourism Day is 'Tourism for Inclusive Growth’ and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has urged businesses, tourists, UN agencies, member states and non-members to "celebrate tourism’s unique ability to ensure that nobody is left behind as the world begins to open up again and look to the future".Also read | Ayushman Bharat and the path to universal health coverage in IndiaThe Prime Minister also expressed gratitude to all doctors, nurses, the medical staff of the nation, for their efforts in the vaccination drive or treatment of Covid-19 patients. He said it is very important that the medical services in villages should be improved in order to improve healthcare services across the country. "Today the network related to primary health care is being strengthened in the village and near the house. So far 80,000 such centres have been made operational. Unprecedented reforms are also taking place in medical education to transform India's health sector. Today more doctors and paramedical manpower are being prepared in the country than before in 7-8 years," he said.PM Modi noted that the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission will now connect the digital health solutions of hospitals across the country and play a big role in eliminating problems in the medical treatment of the poor and middle class. PM Modi said that the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission has the potential to bring a revolutionary change to the country’s health facilities. Under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, a digital health ID will be provided to people that will contain their health records.

This is not an ordinary phase. This is an extraordinary phase,” he added.The healthcare sector welcomed the move, calling it a “progressive step”. “The PMDHM would be a revolutionary concept in the healthcare delivery of our country and would be akin to the introduction of Aadhaar card introduced in our country many years ago as a unique identification card for our citizens.,” said Dr Sudarshan Ballal, Chairman, Manipal Hospitals.Know all about Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission:1.

27-09-2021||India||Bharat Bandh cripples normal life in Kerala||The dawn to dusk Bharat Bandh called by a front of farmers and trade bodies in Kerala crippled normal life on Monday with the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) and opposition Congress party supporting disruptions against the Union government‘s three farm laws, enacted a year ago.All offices, business establishments and educational institutions remained closed throughout the state. Though private vehicles were allowed, they were blocked forcibly at some places. No important examination was disrupted since the state education department had rescheduled examinations to be held on Monday.Rail and air services were functioning normally but arriving passengers were left stranded outside railway stations and airports in absence of public transport. Police and voluntary organisations have been making some alternate arrangements to transport them. Similarly, three major Information Technology (IT) parks of the state were also functioning. No untoward incident has been reported so far. Later, a sit-in will be organised before Raj Bhawan in the state capital.The ruling Left Democratic Front and Congress-led United Democratic Front leaders have exhorted workers to make the shutdown a success. “It is sad that farmers have been agitating for almost a year. The Centre is ignoring their repeated pleas. The country never witnessed such mute and irresponsible government,” said LDF convenor A Vijayaraghavan. Though many merchants’ associations and tour bodies asked the LDF to make it a symbolic protest in view of the pandemic situation, the front did not agree.Several farmers’ organisations that have put up a united front under the banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) have called for the countrywide shutdown to strengthen their movement against the three farm laws--the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-cripples-normal-life-in-kerala-101632727186747.html

But there was only one Indian-American who was part of that meeting - Sumona Guha - who was appointed as special assistant to the President and senior director for South Asia by Biden after he took over as US President.She was also a part of US Vice President Kamala Harris' high-profile entourage during her meeting with PM Modi. Guha was the co-chair of the South Asia foreign policy working group on the Biden-Harris campaign.According to US Department of State, before joining the top post, Guha worked in the Secretary's policy planning division. Previously, she worked as a senior advisor in the Office of the Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.Guha also served as a special advisor for National Security Affairs in the Office of the Vice President, as a foreign affairs fellow in the US Senate, and as special assistant to the Under Secretary of State for political affairs.According to her LinkedIn profile, Guha holds degrees from Georgetown and Johns Hopkins University. She started her career as an economist in 1996 in the office of national drug control policy and the last update shows her current position as senior vice president at Albright Stonebridge Group, according to the LinkedIn profile.Biden, who was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on January 20 this year, created history by appointing at least 55 Indian-Americans to key positions in his administration, ranging from his speech writer to almost every wing of the government.Nearly half of them are women and a sizable number of them are working in the White House. So far, the Obama-Biden administration (2009-2017) has the distinction of appointing the largest number of Indian-Americans in any administration.During the meeting between PM Modi and President Biden, Guha was among the top US officials like secretary of state Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, Deputy Assistant to the President and Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell and Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Donald Lu.President Biden had said earlier this year that Indian-American are taking over the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-sumona-guha-the-only-indian-american-from-biden-s-team-when-he-met-pm-modi-101632725396951.html

27-09-2021||India||Indra Nooyi memoir: The secrets to balancing work and family life||How did a middle-class girl from Chennai who went to business school “with men, was taught by men and studied the work of men to enter industries dominated by men” become the global chief executive of PepsiCo in 2006 and only the 11th woman to lead a Fortune 500 company? Indra Nooyi tells the story of that journey in her memoir, My Life in Full (published by Hachette India) in 313 pages that are packed with her experiences of settling in America, negotiating the boardroom, balancing work and family life and what the pandemic has meant for workplaces.Sixty-five-year-old Nooyi, who retired from PepsiCo in 2019 after serving at the top for more than a decade, traces her journey at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Motorola, ABB before finally landing at PepsiCo while navigating the pressures of getting good childcare, handling a child being subject to racist behaviour in school, the importance of power dressing while also living up to her mother’s expectation of a woman’s duties. Nooyi hit the headlines across the world in 2017 when she revealed that the day she got her promotion as president of PepsiCo, her mother told her to go out and get milk. When Nooyi protested, she said her mother told her to “leave that crown in the garage.”That comment, which set off endless international columns and articles about work-life balance, gets context in the book when Nooyi reveals how she sets up a roster system with her family in India to take turns to look after the first of her two daughters. When she couldn’t find reliable childcare in the US, her mother and mother-in-law and other relatives took turns to look after her older child, Preetha, and do some housework and Nooyi and her husband would take over in the evening. “We didn’t pay the visiting relatives or my mother for their help,’’ Nooyi writes, adding that they saw it as “intergenerational responsibility and a joy’’. By the time Nooyi had her second daughter, Tara, they were able to find childcare but throughout the book, there’s emphasis on the it-takes-a-village-to-raise-children theory. From family, to the efficient secretary who steps in for school events, to neighbours who drop in and oversee childcare.In the book, Nooyi focuses on the importance that organisational support plays in working women’s lives. For instance, she lists the offer of three months of paid leave by BCG to take care of her father in India when he was diagnosed with cancer. “I believe I would have curtailed my career, by quitting BCG to be with my dad and to help my family, had I not received this paid leave... we would have been in real financial trouble and unsettled,” she writes. Nooyi brought her father to the US for his treatment but he was unable to fight it and Nooyi went back to work after two months.Then again, an important role was played by her immediate boss Gerhard Salge at ABB who didn’t stop giving her important assignments just because she was pregnant. In fact, the day after delivering her child, he came over to brief her about an important project. Nooyi spent her limited maternity leave with regular meetings at home but says that it was her choice to do so. At the same time, Nooyi writes about battling separation anxiety with her newborn and sleepless nights, constantly questioning her choices.The most interesting parts of the book, however, are the bits of her describing her PepsiCo years and navigating a leadership role with hardly any other woman in the boardroom. While her legacy has been to make a push for healthy products and Performance with Purpose (PwP) or how to reduce water wastage and plastic usage by Pepsi products, the bits in her book that stay with you is her revelation of the change she noticed when she worked with a stylist as CEO, with one colleague even sending her a note about how dressing well made her more authoritative. Nooyi also acknowledges that it may be ‘elitism’ to talk about the use of company plane but it allowed her to finally be able to be there for her daughters, to have the freedom to hop across the country for work meetings, but still be back home for dinner. As the book was finished during the pandemic, Nooyi, who now is an Amazon Board member and also International Cricket Council’s first independent female board member, makes a case for flexible working hours. “I believe job flexibility and remote work for everyone who needs it should be entirely routine. This will give families the chance to take care of home life obligations during the workday without feeling loaded with emotional consequences,’’ she writes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indra-nooyi-memoir-the-secrets-to-balancing-work-and-family-life-101632717104680.html
27-09-2021||India||Third diesel price hike makes it costlier by 70 paise on Monday||Diesel has become costlier by 70 paise a litre on Monday after state-run fuel retailers raised its rates by another 25 paise a litre, the third price hike of the fuel in the last four days as international crude oil prices head towards $80 a barrel on rising demand and supply concerns.Pump prices of petrol, however, remain frozen at ₹101.19 per litre since September 5. Diesel prices, which had softened to ₹88.62 per litre three weeks ago after climbing to record ₹89.87 a litre in mid-July, have been priced at ₹89.32 on Monday in Delhi.Retail prices of petrol and diesel are under pressure due to rising international oil rates and automobile fuel rates may see a further northward movement, two people working in different oil companies said, requesting anonymity.Benchmark Brent crude continued an upward movement in intraday trade on Monday with a gain of 1.83% at $79.52 a barrel. It has soared by over 10% from $72.22 per barrel three weeks ago. Last week, HT reported that fuel retailers would start raising fuel rates soon.After international oil prices dropped below $70 a barrel in mid-August, fuel retailers had started to cut fuel rates. Diesel prices were first reduced by 20 paise per litre on August 18 after it climbed to an all-time high of ₹89.87 a litre in mid-July and remained at that level for the next 34 days. Petrol prices were also reduced by 20 paise a litre for the first time on August 22, after it maintained a record of ₹101.84 per litre in Delhi for 36 days.Subsequently, several small price cuts made petrol and diesel cheaper by 65 paise a litre and ₹1.25 per litre, respectively, until their pump rates were frozen on September 5.According to the people mentioned above, international crude oil prices rose on subdued US oil production in view of the Ida hurricane which tore through the Gulf of Mexico, and robust demand on optimism about global economic growth.“Companies were holding prices, and expecting some tax relief from the government in terms of GST [Goods and Services Tax] relief, but the proposal to include petroleum products in GST was declined in the GST Council meeting on September 17, forcing companies to think about raising fuel rates” one person mentioned above, said. International oil rates, which are often volatile, directly influence pump prices of petrol and diesel in India. Heavy loads of Central and state taxes are also responsible for astronomically high rates of the auto fuels.Through 2020, as global crude prices plunged (below $20 a barrel in April last year), the central government raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit as their revenues were hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, Central and state levies, combined, are over 50% of the retail prices of petrol and diesel.

Although Cyclone Gulab will not directly hit the state, Kolkata and some districts in south Bengal will experience rainfall from Monday, the weather office has predicted.According to TMC and BJP leaders, more than 20% people in Bhawanipore are Muslims while Sikhs and non-Bengali speaking Hindus comprise around 34% of the local population. The constituency comprises eight civic body wards with a total 206,389 voters.The BJP announced on Sunday night that 10 party leaders will visit each of these eight civic body wards on Monday. The first phase of their campaign will start at 8am and continue till 11 am. After lunch recess, the second phase will continue from 2pm to 5pm. The 80 leaders will visit 80 locations combined during the day.“The voters will be made to realise that it is their responsibility to ensure that the honour of West Bengal is restored,” said a statement issued by BJP state vice-president Pratap Banerjee.BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar and his predecessor Dilip Ghosh, who is now a national vice-president, will address voters in the morning.

At least three people were killed in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh as Cyclone Gulab made landfall in the coastal region of the two states on Sunday evening. Officials said one person was swept away in Odisha’s Ganjam district and two fishermen from the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh were killed and another went missing."The Cyclonic Storm 'Gulab' over north Andhra Pradesh and adjoining south Odisha, weakened into a Deep Depression at 0230 hrs IST of 27th Sep over north Andhra Pradesh.

Last Tuesday, Canada extended the restriction on all direct commercial and private passenger flights from India until September 26. "As of September 27, 2021, direct flights from India to Canada will resume," the Canadian government said on Sunday.The flight ban was lifted after test results of passengers who flew to Canada from New Delhi on September 22 aboard three Air Canada flights came out to be negative. Prior to the ban in April this year, the two airlines were operating daily direct flights from India to Canada under an air bubble arrangement between the two governments.With the ban now lifted, passengers from India can now travel to Canada with a few precautionary measures, which include having a negative Covid-19 test report from an approved laboratory.Here are the latest guidelines:1. The negative Covid-19 test report should be taken not more than 18 hours before departure.2. Prior to boarding, air operators will check the travellers’ test results ensuring they are eligible to come to Canada.3. Fully vaccinated passengers will have to upload the relevant information into the ArriveCAN mobile app or website.4. Those who are unable to meet these requirements will be denied boarding by the officials.5.

27-09-2021||India||CJI calls for women’s equal representation in judiciary||A representation of 50 percent women in the judiciary is not a matter of charity but of right, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said on Sunday, adding that he is “forcing the executive for applying necessary correctives.”Lamenting centuries of suppression of women at workplaces, chief justice Ramana called for an “urgent correction” in the state of affairs, and said he strongly advocates reservation of a “significant percentage of seats” in law schools and universities for women.“Enough of suppression of thousands of years. It is high time we have 50% representation of women in judiciary. It is your right. It is not a matter of charity,” the chief justice said at an event organised by women advocates of the Supreme Court.Higher judiciary in India, which includes the Supreme Court and the high courts, currently has no policy of reservations for women.Such reservation in subordinate courts depends on the policy of the state government and the concerned high court.Justice Ramana’s statement came weeks after the collegium headed by him paved the way for a woman judge to head the apex court in 2027.Out of the sanctioned strength of 34, the Supreme Court currently has four women judges — justices Indira Banerjee, Hima Kohli, BV Nagarathna and Bela M Trivedi — which is the highest ever in the top court’s history.Other than justice Banerjee, three judges were appointed on August 31, taking the total number of women judges appointed in the top court to 11.Justice Nagarathna is in line to become the first woman chief justice in September 2027. She will have a tenure of a little over a month.Women constitute only about 30% of the lower judiciary, justice Ramana pointed out. “In high courts, women judges constitute 11.5%. Here in the Supreme Court, we currently have 4 women justices out of the sitting 33.That makes it just 12%. Of the 1.7 million advocates, only 15% are women. Only 2% of the elected representatives in the state bar councils are women. (There is) no woman member in the Bar Council of India,” the chief justice said.Women face various obstacles to enter the profession and gender stereotypes force them to bear the brunt of family burdens, he said.“Clients’ preference for male advocates, uncomfortable environment within courtrooms, lack of infrastructure, crowded courtrooms, lack of washrooms for women, etc., all these deter women from entering the profession... An important focus area is to increase gender diversity in legal education, he said. “I strongly advocate reservation of a significant percentage of seats in law schools and universities for women, as a first step.”Justice Ramana emphasised that inclusion of women judges and lawyers will substantially improve the quality of justice delivery and that he will wholeheartedly support initiatives that will further the cause of eliminating gender disparity in the profession.He congratulated the women judges present at the event (justices Banerjee, Kohli, Nagarathna and Trivedi), saying that their actions in upholding the Constitution will inspire women not only in the legal profession but in all walks of life.“Everyone here, women lawyers and my sister judges, are role models for young girls who are hoping to enter the profession,” justice Ramana said in his address.Speaking at the event, Justice Nagarathna said: “Women visibility as judicial officers can pave the way for greater representation of women in other decision-making positions such as legislative and executive branches of the government.”Out of 677 sitting judges in the Supreme Court and the high courts, only 81 are women, law ministry data show, which translates into only 12 percent representation.Among the 25 high courts, only the Madras high court has women judges in the double digits. Out of the working strength of 58 judges, the Madras high court has 13 women, which is more than 22% representation.At least five high courts — Manipur, Meghalaya, Bihar, Tripura and Uttarakhand — do not have a single woman judge, while seven other high courts have just one woman judge each.The sanctioned strength of judges across 25 high courts in India is 1,098. Of these, 465 posts (more than 42% of the total strength) were vacant as of September.In his speech on Sunday, justice Ramana expressed hope that the Supreme Court opens up fully for offline hearings after the Dussehra break that ends on October 17.The concerns of the bar on certain stipulations in the guidelines for physical hearings are being addressed, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cji-calls-for-women-s-equal-representation-in-judiciary-101632696419660.html

27-09-2021||India||Kerala to develop tourism circuit connecting sites of Malabar riots||With the Sangh Parivar and Bharatiya Janata Party busy branding the Malabar riots of 1921 as a “genocide”, the ruling CPI(M) in Kerala is planning to develop a tourism circuit connecting important sites related to the Malabar uprising. State Tourism Minister Muhammed Riyas said in Alappuzha that the tourism department will develop a circuit connecting all important sites related to the rebellion in Malappuram. He said it will attract a lot of tourists and history students. He also said it was wrong to call the Wagon Tragedy a ‘tragedy’, since it was a “massacre” carried out by the British deliberately. After the riot was brutally suppressed in 1921 by the British, another bitter incident unfolded, the ‘Wagon Tragedy’. Prisoners of the riots were filled in a closed railway goods wagon and taken to Coimbatore for trial and 64 prisoners suffocated to death on the way. In Tirur railway station (Malappuram) there is a memorial for ‘Wagon Tragedy’.’ “Tragedy means a disaster. But it was a deliberate massacre by herding hapless people in a closed windowless wagon that led to many being choked to death. The British called it a tragedy and still we are using this term,” he said adding a travel circuit will be developed to mark the centenary of the Malabar uprising. He rejected the contention of the BJP and Hindu outfits saying it was nothing new and reiterated that it was a peasant uprising. The Malabar rebellion, also called as Moppila uprising, is a controversial issue in history. A section of historians and Left parties say it was a peasant uprising against British colonialism in south India but many right wing groups and a section of historians contend that it was a communal riot and Hindus were targeted. The issue is still hotly debated in the southern state_ whether it was a rebellion against colonial forces and landlords or a mindless action by fanatics. Last month there was a controversy after the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) removed Malabar rebellion leader Variyamkunnath Kunjahmed Haji from the ‘Dictionary of Martyrs of India Freedom Struggle.’ Haji was captured and executed by the British in 1921. The issue flared up further after assembly speaker M B Rajesh compared Haji with Bhagat Singh, a young martyr from Punjab who was executed by the British and later turned a hero of the freedom struggle. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath while addressing a programme organised by the RSS mouthpiece “Panchajanya” on Saturday said the “Malabar riots was planned genocide of Hindus by jihad elements.” He said it is important to understand history through the right lens. “Some people say Hindu landlords in Kerala were exploiting Muslim labourers and they gifted a peasant uprising stamp to it. But fact is that thousands of Hindus were killed after they refused to convert. For the left and pseudo-secularists it is still a peasant uprising. But it was genocide,” he said adding attempts to make it a part of the freedom movement should be opposed vehemently. Addressing a seminar in Kozhikode last month, RSS leader Ram Madhav also alleged that the riot was one of the first manifestations of Taliban mindset in India and Left parties were trying to whitewash it by celebrating it as a labour uprising. But CM Pinarayi Vijayan last month reiterated that the state government will observe it as part of the freedom struggle. “People who betrayed the freedom struggle (Sangh Parivar) have no right to raise accusing fingers at others,” he said. The Hindu Aikya Vedi, a right-wing group, said it will oppose the government’s move to develop a tourism circuit to glorify the riot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-develop-tourism-circuit-connecting-sites-of-malabar-riots-101632688661399.html

27-09-2021||India||Pole dancing emerges as the latest fitness trend to sweep Chennai||Pole dancing is the new fitness trend in Chennai, with locals ranging from fitness enthusiasts, lawyers, mothers and children to members of the LGBTQIA+ community taking to the pole across the city. In a state where classical dance form Bharatanatyam originated and is known for its temples, a section of Chennai’s fitness community is beginning to take to pole dancing as a form of exercise. Pole dancing workshops started in the city in August. The beginnings replicate the surfing scene in the city a decade ago, after international surfers discovered it along with coastal Chennai and its outskirts, which now became a sport and a fitness activity. While pole dancing came to Delhi and Mumbai a few years ago, Chennai is beginning to warm up to it.Anusha Swamy, a choreographer for Tamil movies, is at the forefront of the pole dance movement in the city. Swamy learnt pole dancing in 2019 in a four-day crash course in Melbourne. After the Covid pandemic hit the world, she has self-taught pole dancing and is learning from instructors online. During the lockdown, Swamy posted her pole dancing videos with a background score of unconventional mellifluous and lyrical Indian and international music on Instagram. Some found this therapeutic. It opened up the notion that pole dancing can be more than an exotic dance performed inside clubs. “Initially, I tried it as a fun activity. When it is taboo in the society as rebellious girls, we want ask what about it is so shameful,” says Anusha. “Then I understood it’s such a meditative activity. When you’re on the pole, your mind and body are incomplete in connection with each other. You also understand your limitations. It’s like working on yourself. Of course, the beauty and athletic qualities come with it.” Swamy’s videos did, however, draw nasty and shaming comments. Explaining the rising popularity of pole dancing, Nikita Vijay, founder of Tattva studio, which hosts occasional workshops, said, “We did wonder if people in Chennai would open up and attempt pole dancing which is why we had a workshop first. There is a taboo associated with pole dancing, but it requires a high-level core and upper body strength, so we wanted to give it a try, and it was the first time a pole workshop happened in South India.” The first pole dancing workshop in August saw more than 20people participate, which was followed by 10 more workshops across the city. The Tattva studio also launched a three-month pole camp to start in October, seats for which got sold out in three days. “Once you do it, you know it’s not something to be ashamed about and it’s not just a show. It’s about fitness, and you can be fully dressed to do it,” Vijay said. Teaming up with Swami, three mechanical engineering grad students, who make fitness equipment locally in Chennai named Sthenos recently began manufacturing poles in the city. Sthenos formed in August 2020 amidst the pandemic and used local labourers who were out of jobs due to the lockdown. They have now begun selling ‘fitness poles’ along with other equipment such as multi bars and pull up bars. These ‘fitness poles’ are silicone coated, so it does not require skin contact for grip, unlike the majority of the poles available in the market. “Whether it’s swimming or pole dancing, when women wear fewer clothes, the commentary shifts to their body from the art form. With these poles, they don’t have to miss out on being constrained by attire,” Sthenos co-founder Mathews Fernandes said. The poles weigh about 20 kgs and come in various heights from 8.5 feet to 13.5 feet to adjust to the ceiling. Given the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, these poles can also be used at home and are portable. “Even I had a negative perception of pole dancing, but when I tried it once, I realised how tough it is, and I’ve come full circle to respecting it and manufacturing it for the entire country,” he concluded.Preethi Nedumaran, a 32-year-old Bharatanatyam dancer and a fitness enthusiast, attempted pole dancing as a weekend activity with her friends. “It’s a great way to mix dance routines and fitness,” she said. In another example, 24-year-old J Kanish, a software engineer, is a lone man among dozens of women trying the pole in a workshop in Chennai. “Pole dancing is portrayed by women but I don’t see a sex assigned to it,” he said. “For me, the agenda of doing pole is that it gives you an entire body workout. It looks easy, but it’s tough to do,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pole-dancing-emerges-as-the-latest-fitness-trend-to-sweep-chennai-101632681823566.html
27-09-2021||India||Malabar uprising sites to be made a tourist circuit||The Kerala government on Sunday said the state tourism department is going to develop a circuit connecting all important historical sites related to the Malabar rebellion in 1921, marking the centenary of the uprising, even as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and right-wing leaders voiced their opposition to celebrating the event as a ‘freedom struggle’ and termed the riots ‘genocide’ against the Hindus. State tourism minister Muhammed Riyas said that the circuit will be developed in Malappuram, attracting a lot of tourists and history students. Riyas also said that the term ‘tragedy’ for the 1921 Wagon Tragedy is incorrect as it was a deliberate massacre carried out by the British regime. Around 64 prisoners were taken into custody following the Malabar rebellion, an uprising movement against the British Empire that resulted in riots and thousands of casualties, and were on their way to Coimbatore for judicial trial on November 10, 1921, when they died inside the railway goods wagon due to suffocation. A memorial for the Wagon Tragedy exists inside the Tirur railway station (Malappuram) in Kerala. “Tragedy means a disaster. But it was a deliberate massacre by herding hapless people in a closed windowless wagon and many were choked to death. British called it a tragedy and still we are using this term,” he said. The Malabar rebellion, also called the Moplah uprising, is a controversial issue in history. While a section of historians and left parties say it was a peasant uprising against British colonialism in South India, many right-wing groups and a section of historians contend that it was a communal riot where Hindus were targeted. The issue is still hotly debated in the southern state – whether it was a rebellion against colonial forces and landlords or a mindless action by fanatics. Last month, a controversy sparked after the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) removed Malabar rebellion leader Variyamkunnath Kunjahmed Haji from the ‘Dictionary of Martyrs of India Freedom Struggle.’ Haji was captured and executed by the British in 1921. The issue flared up further after Kerala assembly speaker M B Rajesh compared Haji with Bhagat Singh, a young martyr from Punjab and a freedom fighter executed by the British in 1931. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, while addressing a programme organised by RSS mouthpiece “Panchajanya” on Saturday, said the “Malabar riots were planned genocide of Hindus by jihad elements.” Yogi said it is important to understand history through the right lens. “Some people say Hindu landlords in Kerala were exploiting Muslim labourers and they gifted a peasant uprising stamp to it.

Tourism minister Riyas refused to divulge further into the BJP and RSS leaders’ comments, saying that he rejected their contention.The Hindu Aikya Vedi, a right-wing group, said it will oppose the government’s move to develop a tourism circuit to glorify the riot. “It is another example of appeasement politics. We will oppose it tooth and nail”, said Vedi president R V Babu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malabar-uprising-sites-to-be-made-a-tourist-circuit-101632681821008.html
27-09-2021||India||Kerala teacher pitches for education on Constitution||A Kottayam teacher’s movement to set up clubs teaching articles from the Constitution of India in schools to create awareness among the youth about their rights and duties as citizens is gaining popularity across Kerala. Last year, Binu PG had even written a letter to Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan in this regard, who in turn, lauded his initiative and recommended the letter to President Ram Nath Kovind. A decision on the letter is still pending. In his letter to the governor, Binu also mentioned that contribution of B N Rau, a civil servant and jurist, who played a key role in drafting the Constitution, was not properly recognized and wanted a befitting memorial for him. Binu, who has travelled across the country to promote the idea of educating the youth, said the constitutional values should be taught to children at a young age and citizenship education should be included in the curriculum. “If you ask our students about the freedom movement and our Constitution, they will only tell you about some dates or tall leaders. I have been teaching students about constitutional values for more than one and a half-decade and I am sure if they imbibe the right spirit they will be better citizens,” said the 40-year-old, who was the Kerala project officer of the National Service Scheme in 2011-12. “I am not saying that all articles and rights should be taught in schools. What we need is the literacy of the Constitution. Youngsters should be made aware of their rights, duties and obligations. We have to give them good lessons on how to be a responsible citizen and how to respect the system and law of the land,” he said, adding that citizenship education is a subject in countries like Singapore and Japan. Regarding his movement, Binu is planning to tour the state to mobilise support and later take it to the national level. “We have around 450 million youth in the country. We don’t have an effective mechanism to groom and channelize their energy for the country. I am sure good lessons will make them good citizens and we don’t need high doses of nationalism at a later stage,” he said, adding that he has prepared a blueprint for the Constitution clubs. “Binu is a committed social activist who dreams of a better country. As a motivational speaker and a teacher, he has been inspiring youth for many years,” said Dr V Reghu, former assistant director of the Centre for Adult Education Board of Kerala University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-teacher-pitches-for-education-on-constitution-101632681760603.html
27-09-2021||India||Ahead of Bihar bypolls, LJP factions tussle over party symbol||The Chirag Paswan-led faction of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) has written to the Election Commission (EC) stating that Union minister Pashupati Paras’ claims of being elected as the party president are “false” and should be “rejected” within a week or before the notification of the Bihar assembly by-polls for the Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan constituencies.Both the Paswan and Paras factions will be fielding candidates in the yet to be announced bypolls, and both have claimed the right to use the party’s name and symbol. EC must see which group has a majority in the organisational and legislative wings to decide which faction’s claim can be accepted. So far, said an EC official, the Paras faction has not filed any petition to claim LJP’s symbol and name.On June 16, Paras wrote to the EC that he has been elected as the leader of the parliamentary party and a new president will be elected at a national executive meeting. A day later, Suraj Bhan Singh signing as the returning officer/ acting president informed the poll panel that Paras has been elected as the national president of the party.Paswan faction’s letter to EC dated September 23 states that the so-called election that Paras claims made him the party leader does not fulfil the requirement of Rule 15 of the Election Symbol (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968.“The party’s constitution was amended in 2014 at the national executive and was approved by the open house (a collective of all district presidents) in 2017 in Gaya. It was the constitution that increased the term of the president from three years to five and stated that the president can only be changed if s/he voluntarily steps down or dies. Since Chirag was elected in 2019, a decision to which Paras was a signatory, he is the sole authority to sign the forms of candidates fighting on the party ticket,” said Abdul Khaliq, the party’s national general secretary.Khaliq also mentioned that he informed EC in June that Paras’ claims of being the party president violate the party’s constitution.On June 15, Paras, along with four other Lok Sabha MPs, staged a coup against Paswan and declared he did not enjoy the support of the party leaders. They wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that the party’s parliamentary board at a meeting on June 13 decided that Paras will be the parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha. Friction between Paswan and Paras, who is also his uncle, deepened after the passing away of Ram Vilas Paswan, the LJP founder, and exacerbated when Paswan junior decided that LJP will contest the Bihar assembly election alone and attacked Janata Dal (United) leader and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.In a letter dated June 21, Singh informed the poll panel that as per the party’s constitution, one person cannot hold multiple positions in the organisation and it was imperative to hold elections to the office of the president following the demise of Ram Vilas Paswan.He went to say that as election officer he received only the nomination of Pashupati Paras for the post of president and during the election process, all members of the national council present in the meeting unanimously supported his candidature.Khaliq, however, dismissed these claims as contradictory to the party constitution and said that the Paras faction needs to move court if they want to challenge Paswan’s presidency.“The EC had forwarded Paras’ letter stating his elevation as party president for us to submit our report. However, it is not the mandate of the poll panel to decide the party’s leadership issue. Their remit is limited to deciding the symbol and the party’s name. If they (Paras faction) want to claim leadership they should file a petition in the civil court,” Khaliq said.In August, the Paswan faction took exception to the EC not referring to Chirag Paswan as the LJP president in a letter addressed to him. “It was conveyed in November 2019 and in January 2021 to the EC that Chirag has been appointed as the president for a period of five years. We said the EC does not have the power to adjudicate in matters raised by members of the party who have been expelled.Khaliq said at the national executive meeting held on June 15, 2021, in Patna it was unanimously decided to expel Paras, and four other Lok Sabha MPs Prince Raj, Veena Devi, Chandan Singh and MA Quaiser for anti-party activities.“Therefore, any national executive meeting called by Paras is illegal,” he said.Mahtab Alam, vice-president of a Bihar unit of LJP with the Paras faction said they will stake a claim to the party symbol and name. “There is still time for the bypoll. We will move the EC for giving us the name and the symbol and submit the documents as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-bihar-bypolls-ljp-factions-tussle-over-party-symbol-101632679910502.html
27-09-2021||India||Poll-bound Punjab, UP rejig cabinets||Fifteen Congress MLAs were sworn in as ministers in Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s cabinet on Sunday, with dissent over the selection of leaders fanning new controversy in the state headed for polls in under five months.A similar exercise was carried out in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, where chief minister Yogi Adityanath inducted seven leaders into his council of ministers, trying to balance caste and regional aspirations. Jitin Prasada, who recently crossed over to the Bharatiya Janata Party from the Congress, was administered oath as cabinet minister, while six others were sworn in as ministers of state.Channi, who took over as the chief minister after Congress veteran Amarinder Singh’s unceremonious exit after a prolonged power tussle with state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, included six new faces in his first cabinet expansion.The new faces are Randeep Singh Nabha, Raj Kumar Verka, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Pargat Singh, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Gurkirat Singh Kotli.Rana Gurjit Singh, who was forced to resign from the previous Amarinder Singh cabinet over allegations of corruption in 2018, was also sworn in on Sunday.Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit administered the oath of office and secrecy to the legislators a day after Channi finalised the names after three rounds of discussions with the Congress leadership.While Amarinder skipped the ceremony, Punjab affairs incharge Harish Rawat and Sidhu were present during the oath-taking.The exercise, carried out after approvals from former leader Rahul Gandhi and Sidhu, has brought about a generational shift in the state leadership, taking into consideration caste and regional equations, experts said.Verka hails from the Valmiki community and Gilzian represents the other backward classes (OBCs). The five other MLAs are Jat Sikhs.After Channi, a Dalit leader, was elected as the Congress Legislature Party leader, the party picked Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, a Jat Sikh, and OP Soni, a Hindu, as his deputies.State unit incharge Harish Rawat said the exercise has been done to bring in young faces and strike a social and regional balance. “We have tried to ensure a social balance. This is a balanced cabinet,” he said after the oath-taking ceremony.In the 18-member cabinet, nine ministers are from the state’s Malwa region, six — including the two deputy CMs — from Majha and three from Doaba.Eight ministers from the previous cabinet — Brahm Mohindra, Manpreet Singh Badal, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Aruna Chaudhary, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Razia Sultana, Vijay Inder Singla and Bharat Bhushan Ashu — were retained.The party, however, dropped five ministers — Balbir Singh Sidhu, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Rana Gurmeet Sodhi, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Sundar Shyam Arora — from the previous cabinet, leading to loud protests ahead of the swearing-in ceremony.Balbir Singh and Gurpreet Singh held a joint news conference and questioned the party leadership’s decision to drop them.Earlier in the day, last-minute changes were made to the list of candidates approved a day earlier, after four-time MLA Randeep Singh Nabha lodged a strong protest against his name being dropped from the cabinet list, people familiar with the matter said.The Amloh MLA was added to the list, replacing Punjab Congress working president Kuljit Singh Nagra, a two-time MLA from Fatehgarh Sahib, the people cited above said.The day saw more protests as at least six legislators from Doaba region wrote to Sidhu, objecting to the induction of former irrigation and power minister Rana Gurjit Singh, alleging that he was “corrupt and tainted”.The leaders demanded that the cabinet berth should instead be filled up “by giving representation to a clean Dalit leader”, news agency PTI reported citing the letter. A copy of the letter was also sent to the chief minister.Rana Gurjit Singh, after facing flak from the Opposition over allegations of impropriety in the auction of sand mining contracts, had resigned from the previous Amarinder Singh cabinet in 2018. Rana Gurjit, Mohindra and Singla are considered close to Amarinder Singh.Rawat, in what appeared to be an attempt at controlling discontent in the faction-ridden party, later said: “We have decided that those who could not be accommodated in the Cabinet, they will be adjusted in the party and government set-up because there is a lot of work, they will be given responsibilities.”Deputy chief ministers, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni, were sworn in last Monday.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pollbound-punjab-up-rejig-cabinets-101632679780725.html
27-09-2021||India||IMD predicts heavy rain in parts of India||There will likely be showers over central and western parts of India in the next 4-5 days, the India Meteorological Department predicted on Sunday, even as Cyclone Gulab hit the country’s east coast between Kalingapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Gopalpur in Odisha.“ We can expect widespread rain over central India in the next few days. There is a trough passing from Bay of Bengal to the Pacific, where cyclonic circulations and tropical storms are forming one after the other,” said Sunitha Devi, in-charge, cyclones, IMD. “The remnants of these storms are causing development of depressions and low pressure areas over Bay of Bengal this month.”Atmospheric low pressure and depressions lead to heavy rainfall and cyclones in the Indian subcontinent. Cyclone Gulab is likely to have a wind speed of 75 to 85 km per hour, with wind gusts of 95 kmph during landfall, before weakening and moving towards central India as a low-pressure system, the Met department said.Light to moderate rainfall at most places with extremely heavy rain at isolated places is likely over Vidarbha, south Chhattisgarh and Telangana; heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places over Konkan and Goa, central Maharashtra, Odisha, Marathwada in the next 2-3 days, IMD said. “As the cyclone weakens, the remnant will move towards central India bringing rain to central India and west India including Maharashtra and Gujarat at least for next 2-3 days,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.On Tuesday, moderate rainfall at most places with extremely heavy rain of over 20 cm is likely at isolated places over Gujarat, central Maharashtra, Konkan and Goa. Heavy to very heavy rain is also likely at isolated places over Saurashtra, Kutch and Marathwada.There might be a cyclonic circulation on September 28 over east-central Bay of Bengal with a similar pattern of movement as Cyclone Gulab. However, there is no probability of another cyclone forming, IMD scientists said.The southwest monsoon is unlikely to withdraw in the next week, according to Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology at private forecaster Skymet Weather. “Patchy rain will continue over northwest India including Delhi NCR (national capital region). Monsoon may finish with normal rainfall around 99% of LPA,” Palawat said. LPA is short for long-period average of rainfall between 1961 and 2010.Monsoon rainfall was deficient by 2% as on Sunday, with 12% deficiency over east and northeast India; 4% deficiency over northwest India; 0% excess over central India and 9% excess over peninsular India.The overall deficiency at the end of August was nine percent. The IMD in its forecast on September 1 said that owing to above normal rains in September, the overall southwest monsoon rains this year may be in the “lower end of normal category”.The weather department considers 96% to 104% of LPA to be normal. But considering that widespread rainfall is likely to continue till the end of the month, total rainfall may increase further. There was 9.6% excess rain at the end of June; 6.8% deficiency in July; 24% deficiency in August and 28.8% excess in September, making it the most active month.The extended range model guidance of the IMD is indicating widespread rain over the country till October 7 and patchy rain till October 14. The monsoon typically withdraws from northwest India from September 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-gulab-imd-predicts-heavy-rain-in-central-western-parts-of-india-in-next-4-5-days-101632679550319.html
27-09-2021||India||Need data protection bodies at state level for robust law: JPC member||There is a need for state-level data protection authorities (DPAs), along with a national watchdog, to ensure that the data protection law becomes more robust and implementable, according to parliamentarian Amar Patnaik of the Biju Janata Dal, who is a member of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) looking into the draft legislation.“I’m strongly of the view that the DPA in its current form means that there is one DPA for all of India, and every state government or institution is accountable to it,” he said in an interview with Hindustan Times. “We need state-level DPAs so as to not raise issues of federal override. This way the administration of data protection regime will become more robust and implementable. Else, it will be overwhelming for an institution to deal with all of it.”The personal data protection committee is considering a slew of changes, including introducing psychological manipulation as a violation and stressing on the need for algorithmic fairness, HT reported over the past week.The key amendments are under consideration of the House panel, which aims to table its report in the winter session of Parliament. The JPC was set up in 2019 to look into the provisions of the bill and has since sought several extensions, the latest one after chairperson Meenakshi Lekhi had to step down as she was elevated to the post of a union minister.Patnaik stressed that while the proceedings of the committee were confidential, concerns about various aspects of the bill have been discussed. “There have been concerns regarding the heavy compliance cost,” he said. “The second one is that it will be a consent based framework. How does one ensure informed consent is there? Then of course is the concerns that the government has overriding measures, which empowers it to bypass the bill, like in the interest of national security.”The proposed law will not only protect a citizen’s privacy but will also unlock the value of data. “Once encryption enforcement happens, personal data can become non-personal data. The exemptions that the bill provides for speaks to how narrow it is and what are the chances that it can be misused,” Patnaik said. “It should be as discretionary as possible.”He said that the concerns about non-personal data (NPD) being addressed in the personal data protection (PDP) bill have been discussed. “There is the question whether non-personal data should be regulated at all, how should NPD be addressed in PDP, and whether NPD should not be regulated at all,” Patnaik said.Over 60 sessions later, a new report is set to be drawn up by the committee. “An immense amount of attention has been given to the bill,” he said. “DPA will be a behemoth. It will have a say over how data are used.”“In terms of structural independence and functional capacity of DPA, I believe it should be a constitutional authority,” Patnaik said. “Unless its a constitutional body, one can’t ensure its independence.”“I’m reasonably optimistic that the final form of the report may see a bit of delay, but it will be adopted in the winter session.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-state-level-data-protection-authorities-joint-parliamentary-committee-mp-amar-patnaik-101632679181340.html
27-09-2021||India||Cyclone Gulab: 3 dead in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh||Three people were killed in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh as Cyclone Gulab made landfall in the coastal region of the two states on Sunday evening, officials said.One person was swept away in Odisha’s Ganjam district and two fishermen from Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh lost their lives while one another went missing as the cyclonic storm made landfall on Sunday evening.Special relief commissioner of Odisha Pradeep Jena said, “After making landfall at 8.30 pm, the cyclone was moving towards Koraput and Malkangiri districts where it is expected to cause potential damage due to wind and rain. We are expecting widespread rains in Malkangiri, Koraput, Ganjam, Gajapati and Rayagada districts till tomorrow afternoon. There was no danger to any other coastal districts”.In Ganjam district, a man was swept away in Gosaninuagaon block while three members of a family in Kharput block of Malkangiri district escaped narrowly from coming under a tree that fell on their house, the officer said.In Srikakulam of Andhra Pradesh, two fishermen in a boat died after five of the six fishermen fell in the sea off Mandasa coast due to strong waves. While three reached ashore safely and two others died, and one fisherman is still missing, officials said.One of the six called his village over phone and informed that their boat lost balance and five of his fellow fishermen were lost in the sea. Subsequently, his mobile phone too went silent, indicating that he too might have gone missing.The Andhra Pradesh fisheries Minister contacted the Navy authorities to carry out a rescue operation.The three north coastal districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam had been receiving moderate to heavy rain under the influence of Gulab.Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority Commissioner K Kanna Babu reviewed the situation with the district Collectors and other officials in Visakhapatnam and directed them to be on high alert.He said NDRF and SDRF teams have been positioned in the three north coastal districts for rescue and relief operations.In Srikakulam district, 182 persons from Vajrapukothuru mandal have been moved to relief camps, according to the Collector L Srikesh Balaji Rao.Before the cyclone made landfall, around 39,000 people in Odisha’s Ganjam and Gajapati district had been evacuated by the districts. Officials said people did not show interest for evacuation process as there have been comparatively less wind speed and rains. In Gajapati district, a road was sealed following landslides in a mountain.The East Coast Railway has cancelled 34 pairs of trains due to Cyclone Gulab. The ECoR has also rescheduled 13 trains and diverted at least 17 trains so far, according to its bulletins. “In view of the forecast of heavy rain with cyclonic wind, all necessary precautions have been taken by ECoR,” it said.Meanwhile, the South Central Railway informed in a release that eight trains on the Vijayawada-Howrah route were diverted via Kharagpur, Jharsuguda, Bilaspur and Balharshah. Two other trains that were supposed to begin journey on Sunday, have been rescheduled for Monday.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-gulab-3-dead-in-odisha-and-andhra-pradesh-101632679062312.html
27-09-2021||India||Govt expert group may recommend inclusion of ZyCoV-D in India vaccination drive||ZyCoV-D, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Zydus Cadila in partnership with the Department of Biotechnology, is likely to be included in the national immunisation programme as a government expert group is expected to recommend its inclusion next week, said an official aware of the matter. The Zydus Cadila vaccine would expand India’s vaccination programme to those aged 12 years and above.“The deliberations are nearing conclusion and by next week or so the government should receive their recommendations on the matter,” the official said, requesting anonymity. “It seems that the expert group is in favour of including children in the list of eligible beneficiaries for Covid-19 vaccination.”The Centre could introduce the three-dose vaccine in a phased manner, with children with specified comorbidities receiving priority because they have the additional risk of severe infection.“Eventually, we will have to vaccinate all children and not just those at risk because children can bring the infection home and expose those members who are at high risk, especially the elderly and sick in the family,” said Dr JS Bhasin, director and head, department of paediatrics, BLK Hospital, New Delhi.The issue of pricing the product is also being considered said the official cited earlier. Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, had mentioned pricing is an issue in a press briefing last week.“The price is also a clear issue. Talks are going on and a decision will soon be taken. With full preparation, it will become a part of the country’s national vaccination programme,” Dr Paul had said. “We are looking forward to receiving recommendations of the NTAGI on the beneficiary or target group to which the vaccine has to be given.”On August 20, VG Somani, Drugs Controller General of India, approved the Zydus Cadila vaccine for emergency use. ZyCoV-D, the world’s first plasmid DNA vaccine for Covid-19, is administered in three doses on Day zero, Day 28, and Day 56.The government expects around 10 million vaccine doses from the company.

In particular, he asked the researchers to pay greater attention to agricultural research and come out with innovations, techniques and solutions to address the problems faced by farmers.Among some of the challenges that need the focus of the scientific community, Naidu cited climate change, drug resistance, pollution, epidemic and pandemic outbreaks.Union minister of state for science and technology, Jitendra Singh, also asked CSIR and all the science departments to explore science and technology innovations needed in the next 10 years to make India globally competitive.“We should not restrict our ambition to be best in India but be best in the world as India is blessed with the demographic dividend of youth and they can take up any challenge with the right training and motivation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/names-of-11-scientists-declared-for-india-s-highest-science-award-101632678640267.html
27-09-2021||India||Ensure nobody is left out of vaccine’s ‘circle of safety’: PM Modi||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged people to keep following the Covid-19 protocol and ensure that no one is left out of vaccination’s “circle of safety” ahead of the festive season. “Team India is making new records everyday in this fight. With regards to vaccination, the country has made many such records which are being talked about the world over... We have to get the vaccine administered when our turn comes, but we also have to take care that no one is left out of this circle of safety,” the Prime Minister said in his monthly Mann Ki Baat address. “Those around you who have not got vaccinated also have to be taken to the vaccine centre. Even after getting vaccinated, the necessary protocol has to be followed.”India has administered 858.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, according the government’s Co-Win dashboard. A record 25 million people received jabs on September 17, Modi’s birthday, according to a government statement. Paying tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, Deen Dayal Uppadhay and Lal Bahadur Shastri, Modi said, “I don’t ever let go any chance to speak in connection with cleanliness and... in this Amrit Mahotsav of freedom, we should take the resolve of economic cleanliness too.” The Prime Minister said that over 3.5 billion digital transactions were done in August through the United Payment Interface (UPI).He said money of the poor is getting credited directly into their bank accounts, and because of this, obstacles like corruption have reduced significantly. “It is true that technology can help a lot in economic cleanliness. It is matter of delight for us that even in villages, the common person is getting connected in the direction of digital transactions through fin-tech UPI... During last August, around 355 crore (3.55 billion) UPI transactions took place in one month, that is over 350 crore (3.5 billion) transactions. Today, on an average, digital payments of more than ₹2 lakh crore are happening through UPI. Through this the economy of the country is acquiring cleanliness and transparency.” On the occasion of the World Rivers Day, Modi called for collective efforts to keep India’s rivers free of pollution. He said that all the proceeds from the e-auction of the birthday gifts he received will be donated to the Namami Gange Mission, a part of the National Mission for Clean Ganga programme. “The Namami Gange Mission too is making advances today... a mass movement has a major role to play in that,” he said. “This electronic auction pertains to gifts presented to me by people from time to time. The money that accrues through this e-auction is dedicated solely to the Namami Gange Campaign. The affectionate, warm spirit, with which you present me gifts …that very sentiment gets bolstered through this campaign.”Modi also highlighted “interesting initiatives” by the ministry of Ayush to increase awareness about “medicinal and herbal plants among children like Aloe Vera, Tulsi, Amla, Giloy, Neem, Ashwagandha and Brahmi ”. He urged “scientists, researchers and people associated with the start-up world to pay attention to such products, which not only increase the wellness and immunity of the people, but also help in increasing the income of our farmers and youth”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-nobody-is-left-out-of-vaccine-s-circle-of-safety-pm-modi-101632678159505.html
27-09-2021||India||Don’t shift goalposts on LAC row, Indian envoy tells Chinese||India’s ambassador to China, Vikram Misri, has urged China to separate the ongoing border tension in eastern Ladakh from the larger boundary dispute, saying the primary concern now is to restore peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and not resolving the decades-long boundary disagreement.Speaking at a virtual India-China track-II dialogue last week, Misri said day-to-day affairs along the disputed border should be addressed through existing established agreements and protocols, which are not to be confused with the long-term mechanisms in place for the final resolution.Misri was referring to the ongoing 16-month long military tension along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, which has plunged Sino-India bilateral ties to the worst chill in decades.“A serious violation of peace and tranquillity in the border areas naturally requires us to apply our minds on the basis of established agreements, protocols and mechanisms to resolve it,” Misri told the gathering by video link.“As we do so, any attempt to confuse border affairs with the Boundary Question is a disservice to the work of those involved in finding solutions,” he said, indicating that China was doing so by “shifting goalposts”.“This is why the Indian side has been consistently saying that the current issue is about restoring peace and tranquillity to the border areas and is not about the resolution of the larger Boundary Question, on which our stance has not changed, despite what happened last year,” Misri added.Separating the broader boundary dispute from managing day-to-day border affairs, Misri listed the “Special Representatives mechanism, the Agreement on Political Parameters and Guiding Principles of 2005 and the three-phase framework” as the agreements designed to resolve the dispute.“On the other hand, for managing border affairs on a daily basis, we evolved a mechanism, consisting of instruments such as the WMCC and a succession of agreements, protocols and CBMs, in order to govern behaviour on the ground and ensure peace and tranquillity,” Misri said, adding that the final resolution of the disputed border is a “…complex and sensitive issue requiring time to work through”.The Indian ambassador was addressing an event co-hosted by the School of International Studies of Sichuan University (SCU), China Centre for South Asian Studies and the New Delhi-based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses last Friday; his speech was released on Sunday.Misri addressed the gathering, which included Chinese envoy to India, Sun Weidong, on a day when India blamed China’s “provocative behaviour” and unilateral attempts to alter status quo on the LAC for disrupting bilateral ties, rejecting Beijing’s contention, on the same day, that the Indian side was responsible for the deadly Galwan Valley clash last year.Misri reminded the Chinese side that safeguarding territorial integrity and national security held equal value for both sides.“Affixing blame exclusively on the other side is not a helpful approach. And to press one’s own concerns and disregard the other side’s concerns and sensitivities without any explanation or recourse goes beyond disrespect. It actually creates even more obstacles to finding solutions,” he said.In his speech, Misri listed two other “obstacles” in the current difficult ties with China: one-sided view of concerns and sensitivities, and viewing bilateral relations through the prism of relations with other countries.The Indian ambassador brought up the problems that students and separated families in India were facing because of stringent visa restrictions implemented by China in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic.“I would also like to mention that these issues need not be limited to the realm of high politics. Far less complex issues, which have a purely humanitarian context and are not connected to bilateral diplomatic stances, such as facilitating the movement of students, businesspersons and stranded family members from India to China for over a year and a half now, await a more balanced and sensitive approach,” Misri said.Thousands of Indian citizens who work, study or whose spouses work in China are stranded in India because of Beijing’s hard visa rules.The Chinese government has so far not given any indication when it will open its borders to Indian citizens.On external factors impacting Sino-Indian ties, he said: “India-China relations therefore must be judged and managed on their own merits. They are substantial enough and sufficiently complex that they require their own approach and appropriate handling, without imaginary third factors complicating them further and distracting us from working on our priorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-shift-goalposts-on-lac-row-indian-envoy-tells-chinese-101632678099566.html
27-09-2021||India||Terrorists involved in BJP leader’s killing gunned down in J&K||Two Lashkar-e-Taiba militants, suspected of killing a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party and two of his family members in July last year, were shot dead by security forces in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district on Sunday.Police said a cordon and search operation was started on Saturday evening after security forces received information about the presence of the militants in the Watnira area of Bandipora. The state police, army and Central Reserve Police Force conducted a joint operation after they found out where the militants were hiding. “Due restraint was exercised to avoid collateral damage. A surrender appeal was made to the terrorists. However, they brought down heavy fire on the security forces, forcing them to retaliate,” said Lt Col Emron Musavi, public relations officer, Defence, Srinagar.The two militants were killed. “Their bodies were retrieved from the site of the encounter,” a police spokesman said.The slain have been identified as Azad Ahmad Shah and Abid Rashid Dar alias Haqani, who were affiliated with the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba outfit.“The killed terrorist Abid Rahid Dar was a Pakistan-trained terrorist who had crossed over the Wagah Border in April 2018 and had infiltrated back in the year 2019,” the spokesman said.Police said both the militants were involved in planning and executing terror attacks on civilians and security establishments. “Moreover, terrorist Abid Rashid Dar was instrumental in recruiting gullible youth into the terror ranks of proscribed terror outfit LeT in North Kashmir,” the spokesman said.The police spokesman said that both the slain militants, along with other two foreign militants named Usman and Sajad alias Haider, were involved in the killing of BJP leader Waseem Bari, his brother and father in July 2020. “The involved foreign terrorists Usman and Sajad were already eliminated in an encounter at Kreeri on August 17, 2020, while the other two local terrorists got killed in today’s encounter,” the spokesman said.The official said that all the four militants involved in case FIR No 74/2019 of Bandipora police station pertaining to the killing of Bari and his family are now dead. “Incriminating materials, arms and ammunition, including two AK-47 rifles, one pistol and other incriminating material, were recovered from the site of encounter,” the spokesman said. “All the recovered materials have been taken into case records for further investigation and to probe their complicity in other terror crimes.”A case under relevant sections of law has been registered and an investigation has been initiated. “People are requested to cooperate with police till the area is completely sanitised and cleared of all the explosive materials, if any,” the police spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorists-involved-in-bjp-leader-s-killing-gunned-down-in-jk-101632678039487.html

I am the tiger. The power lies with the person who runs the government. It means that all power lies with the people. We are a ‘by the people’s government and not by the court government,” the CM said. He also mentioned how the state’s previous chief secretary was disposed of his duties because he feared “contempt of court”. Reacting to the comments, Trinamool Congress general secretary Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday uploaded a video clip of Deb’s speech on Twitter, claiming that Deb mocked judiciary and democracy as well. “@BjpBiplab is a DISGRACE to the entire nation! He shamelessly mocks Democracy, MOCKS the Hon’ble JUDICIARY and seemingly gets away with it! Will the SUPREME COURT take cognizance of his comments that reflect such grave disrespect?” Banerjee tweeted on Sunday. Reacting to Banerjee’s tweet, OSD to Deb, Sanjay Mishra took to Twitter and said, “You must listen to full speech before spreading your fake propaganda, which you have learned from your political guru CPM and how much respect you have for government institutions we all know that.” CPM leader Pabitra Kar said, “Whatever chief minister said is an attack on Constitution and judiciary. Being a chief minister, he cannot say such things. We condemn it and we will take initiative to draw the attention of the judiciary towards the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-cm-biplab-tells-officers-not-to-fear-contempt-of-court-action-as-he-is-the-tiger-101632677800610.html
27-09-2021||India||Intensify anti-Maoist operations, says Shah to CMs in left-wing extremism meet||Home minister Amit Shah on Sunday chaired a meeting with the chief ministers and representatives of 10 states affected by left-wing extremism to discuss a road map for development and to bring an end to the Maoist insurgency. He asked all the chief ministers and their representatives to give priority to this in the next one year so that a permanent solution can be found to the problem, adding that it requires building pressure on the Maoists, increasing the speed of development activities and better coordination between central and state agencies. The Maoist insurgency, which has claimed more than 16,000 civilian lives in the past 40 years, has now reached near its end, the home minister said. This needs to be accelerated and made decisive, he said. Issues ranging from intensifying operations against Maoists, choking their funding through concerted action by agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and state police forces, targeting the front organisations, and carrying out widespread development activities, among others, were discussed during the meeting, which went on for several hours at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. Those who attended the meeting included chief ministers of Odisha (Naveen Patnaik), Bihar (Nitish Kumar), Telangana (K Chandrashekar Rao), Jharkhand (Hemant Soren), Maharashtra (Uddhav Thackeray) and Madhya Pradesh (Shivraj Singh Chouhan). Union ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw, Gen (retired) V K Singh, Giriraj Singh, Arjun Munda and Nityanand Rai, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, and Intelligence Bureau chief Arvinda Kumar also attended the meeting. Director generals of NIA and central paramilitary forces, and union road, rural, and tribal affairs secretaries were in attendance as well. The chief misters of of Chhattisgarh ( Bhupesh Baghel), West Bengal (Mamata Banerjee), Kerala (Pinarayi Vijayan) and Andhra Pradesh (Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy) did not attend the meeting but were represented by their chief secretaries and senior police officials. The meeting comes in wake of the home ministry reducing the number of districts affected by left-wing extremism. The number of such districts has declined sharply to 70 in 10 states for the first time in over three decades, with Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand showing the biggest improvement, HT reported last month. Only 25 districts in eight states are now categorised as most affected, while Uttar Pradesh is now free of Maoism, according to the Union home ministry’s revised list that was updated in July. The incidents of Maoist violence has declined by 70% to 665 in 2020 from a high of 2,258 in 2009. Deaths due to such incidents of has also fallen by 82% 183 in 2020 from a high of 1,005 in 2010. Shah said during the meeting that “in decades of fighting, we have reached a point where the death toll is less than 200 for the first time and this is a huge achievement for all of us.” “We all know that unless we get rid of the problem of left-wing extremism completely, the full development of the country and the states affected by it is not possible. Without eliminating it, neither we will be able to spread democracy to the bottom nor will we be able to develop the underdeveloped areas,” Shah said. “So, instead of being satisfied with what we have achieved so far, we need to increase the speed to get what is left.” He urged the states to hold a review meeting with police chiefs and central agencies at least every three months to deal to “take this fight forward”. “In last two years, a huge and successful effort has been made to increase security camps in areas where security was not stringent, especially in Chhattisgarh, as well as in Maharashtra and Odisha. If regular review is done at the level of chief ministers, chief secretaries and director generals of police, then the problems of coordination at the lower level will automatically get resolved,” Shah said. On the source of income of Maoists, Shah said it is “very important to neutralize” it “by making a system together”. He said Centre has taken several developmental initiatives, which include approving the construction of 17,600km of roads, out of which 9,343km have already been built. As many as 2,343 new telecom towers have been installed and 2,542 more will come up within next 18 months. The authorities have opened 1,789 new post offices, 1,236 bank branches, 1,077 ATMs and 14,230 banking correspondents. Another 3,114 post offices will be opened in next one year. All these will help the affected districts to join the mainstream. For imparting education in these areas, Shah said special focus is given to opening of Eklavya Model Residential Schools. A total 234 of these schools have been sanctioned for Maoist-affected districts, of which 119 are already functional, Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intensify-anti-maoist-operations-says-shah-to-cms-in-left-wing-extremism-meet-101632677740614.html
27-09-2021||India||Rijiju: No turf war between the judiciary, executive and legislature||A lively relationship between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive is vital in a democracy, Union law minister Kiren Rijiju said here on Sunday even as he dismissed the perception of any turf war among these three organs.Speaking at the Gandhinagar-based National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU) after inaugurating the new School of Law, Forensic Justice and Policy Studies, Rijiju said “it is for the government to implement whatever judges say and think and this should not be done out of fear for the contempt of court alone”. “The judiciary, the executive and the legislature are separate organs, but we all work for the country. People on the outside think we are engaged in a turf war, fighting for a domain, but that is not the case. We all are working for the interest of the nation,” Rijiju said.“In the Supreme Court, high courts and even in the lower judiciary, we get to listen to commentaries of judges during (court) hearings, and even anguish and satisfaction aired by them through the media. It is for us to implement whatever judges say or think,” the minister said.Rijiju said it was for the executive to “judiciously implement” a good judgment of the court of law. “In a democracy, it is very important for us to have a lively relation between us (the judiciary, executive and legislature)...It is vital for us to have a lively relationship,” he said.Supreme Court judge Justice MR Shah, Gujarat High Court’s Acting Chief Justice R M Chhaya and several judges and retired judges of the high court and the Supreme Court were present on the occasion along with Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, state Law Minister Rajendra Trivedi and MoS for Home Harsh Sanghavi.Rijiju further said the “impression” that laws are not being implemented for a long time has been removed to a great extent under the Narendra Modi government. “We feel good to hear good things from judges. But judges will praise us only when we do good work,” the Union law and justice minister said and assured judges the government will work “with full transparency and accountability.” He said the “ease of getting justice” should also be talked about like the ease of doing business and the ease of living. “Justice delivery system should not suffer merely for want of a simple input which can be handled by the application of science,” he said.Rijiju said the NFSU’s School of Law, Forensic Justice and Policy Studies will play a critical role in a situation like this to help catch up with technologies for the fast delivery of justice.Rijiju also suggested the NFSU enter into an understanding with the National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) so that the latter does not meet the “fate of suspension of its accreditation” by the World Anti-Doping Agency. “...Otherwise it becomes a huge controversy when young boys and girls are unnecessarily tested (positive) and their lives are spoiled”.“There are no proper guidelines, and sometimes the testing process itself is questionable. So, we have to be very, very careful when it comes to science, and as I said, we have no shortage of manpower in India. We are a leading nation, we just have to manage it professionally,” he said.Supreme Court judge Justice MR Shah said, “the legal education carries the weight on its shoulders to creating responsible citizens in the country (who) are major catalysts for delivering democratic ethos through social justice and the political and economic welfare”. “The poor and weaker sections should be able to seek justice keeping the morals and discipline intact. Legal education has a significant role to play,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rijijuno-turf-war-between-the-judiciary-executive-and-legislature-101632677622386.html
27-09-2021||India||Nitish reiterates census demand, says will call all-party meet in Bihar||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday reiterated his demand for caste-based census and announced that he would soon discuss the issue with all political parties in the state in light of the Centre’s affidavit to the Supreme Court reasoning that conducting a caste enumeration exercise for backward classes was not feasible. “There should be a caste-based census as it is in the interest of the country and will help in identifying groups that are socially, economically backward. A caste census would help in extending government schemes to poor and backward classes more efficiently,” Kumar said, after attending a high level meeting on tackling left wing extremism chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi. “I will be discussing our demand for a caste-based census with all parties in Bihar to adopt our future course of action in light of the new perspective of the Centre’s stand before the Supreme Court,” Kumar said. The statement clearly underlines how the JD (U) strongman, whose party is a constituent of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by BJP, is not in the mood to dilute his stand on the demand for enumeration of castes and likely to side with opposition parties on holding such an exercise. Kumar’s reiteration of the demand for caste census comes just two days after leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had asked the chief minister to clear his stand on the issue in light of the Centre giving an affidavit in the Supreme Court. Referring to the Maoist insurgency, the chief minister said in Bihar, the situation of left wing extremism had improved to a great extent than previous times because of the state’s initiative to take big strides on the development front. In the mid-80s and 1990, the state had witnessed bloody clashes and violence due to the spread of left wing extremist groups. “Since we came to power in 2005, we have worked for development and taken a slew of measures to tackle left extremism. The Centre too has taken a number of measures. This has helped in tackling the problem because development is reaching people,” he said. But the chief minister did emphasize that there was no reason for being complacent on left wing extremist activities. “We cannot be complacent on the issue,” he said. There are 13 districts affected by left wing extremism in the state. Referring to the caste census, the chief minister, whose party JD (U) is a constituent in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), maintained the exercise to collect caste data had its importance for all sections of the society. He said the socio-economic caste census (SECC) conducted in 2011 was not an exclusive caste census as it had different parameters and was not done in a proper manner. “I urge the Centre to hold the caste census. I along with an all-party delegation had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand a caste census. The Bihar assembly has also passed a resolution for a caste-based census unanimously twice,” Kumar said. Incidentally, Kumar whose JD (U) has a considerable support base among backward classes including extremely backward classes (EBCs) has shared a common platform with the opposition RJD to demand a caste census. On Saturday, leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav too had made a firm pitch for a caste-based census by writing to 33 non-BJP leaders of the country to muster support for the conduct of enumeration of castes. Yadav in his letter had stressed that the Centre had not given one single rational reason against the desirability of the caste census.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-reiterates-demand-for-caste-census-plans-to-call-all-party-meet-soon-101632664599233.html

27-09-2021||Today's||India will need more than green hydrogen||In recent weeks, zero-carbon (“green”) hydrogen has moved from the margins of India’s energy infrastructure planning to centre stage. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech included the announcement of a National Green Hydrogen Mission aimed at kickstarting development and deployment of the emerging technology, while the International Climate Summit in New Delhi took up as its theme “Powering India’s Hydrogen Ecosystem.” PM Modi’s recent meetings in Washington also focused on green hydrogen as a key tool in India’s arsenal to combat the climate crisis. Investing in green hydrogen is prudent — its energy density and ease of storage could allow it to cut emissions in sectors where existing approaches to clean electricity will likely prove inadequate, such as long distance transportation or steel manufacturing. Yet, trumpeting the potential of hydrogen might also distract from more pressing priorities for clean energy.Hydrogen will only ever be cost-effective in slashing emissions in a handful of sectors; instead, a combination of electrification and renewable energy will account for the lion’s share of India’s carbon reductions. More to the point, green hydrogen’s commercial viability relies on renewable energy used to manufacture it being available at a low price. Without an abundant supply of wind and solar power, green hydrogen will never get off the ground.Unfortunately, while India has added wind and solar capacity at a rapid pace in recent years, that growth shows signs of slowing. The government is almost certain to fall short of its goal of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2022, and its goal of 450 gigawatts by 2030 is projected to meet the same fate. One of the principal reasons for this impending slowdown is India’s broken electricity distribution companies (discoms).Transitioning to a renewables-intensive energy paradigm is a formidable challenge, requiring utilities to (among other things) cope with greater variability of electricity supply than they are used to from traditional fossil fuel generation. Adaptation requires not only new investments in battery storage and transmission capacity, but also more fundamental changes in how discoms operate, such as a shift to coordinating energy dispatch over larger geographic areas.These changes should be feasible and even cost-effective. At the moment, however, India’s power sector isn’t up to the task. A long history of manipulation by politicians for the sake of short-term electoral objectives has left discoms bankrupt and institutionally weak. Chronic financial shortfalls prevent them from making forward-looking investments in the infrastructure necessary to support higher levels of renewable energy. Their limited independence from political interests, meanwhile, makes it difficult to enact more structural changes to grid management — including the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s recent proposal for a market-based system of energy dispatch, which would give a vital fillip to India’s renewable energy build-out, if implemented.Starved of funds, risk-averse, and largely insulated from voter demands for change, most discoms will continue to take the path of least resistance, dragging their heels on the path to a high-renewables future. Fixing these maladies is no easy task. Past efforts at reform — such as the 2015 Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme — have done little to address the power sector’s core political problems, instead focusing on technical, bureaucratic reforms such as establishing new regulatory agencies or restructuring utilities’ debts.As a result, they have had limited impact. Discoms remain operationally inept, financially insolvent, and vulnerable to political interference. The government’s ₹300,000-crore discom reform scheme proposed earlier this year, while an improvement in some respects, ultimately follows the same broken strategy.Serious action on clean energy must instead begin by recognising that additional policy demands and financial bailouts from the Centre won’t move the needle unless coupled with a concerted attempt at mobilising voters and deploying political capital to break state-level cycles of dysfunction. In other words, power sector reform must be seen as a political problem rather than a technical one. Fortunately, in this respect, Modi enjoys a unique window of opportunity.His popularity with voters can lend credibility to reforms that have long been viewed as politically unpalatable. And his dominance within the Bharatiya Janata Party allows him to pressure governments led by his party to back up reform packages with the political resolve to implement them. In this way, Modi could coordinate a “coalition of the willing” in which BJP-ruled states join hands with solar- and wind-intensive states such as Tamil Nadu, which have the most to gain from a renewable energy-friendly distribution policy, and commit to a reform package with teeth.A critical mass of states acting in concert could create a virtuous circle in which investors would vote with their feet and voters would see the benefits of a more robust energy sector, encouraging them to exert pressure on their own representatives to enact similar policies. These regional efforts could then gradually expand and deepen, setting the stage for truly national reform.Such an incremental, state-based strategy may lack the “big bang” appeal of a national initiative like the Green Hydrogen Mission. However, it is this more comprehensive approach that holds the promise of meeting India’s clean energy ambitions.By contrast, if the government continues to defer reform on the fundamental problems crippling the power sector, the growth of India’s renewable energy will falter, and the promise of a decarbonised economy will remain a pipe dream.Jonathan Kay is a non-resident research assistant at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-will-need-more-than-green-hydrogen-101632749516085.html

27-09-2021||Editorials||The future of global tech||Following their first in-person summit in Washington, Quad countries — Australia, India, Japan and the United States (US) — announced a set of principles that will guide how they design, develop, govern and use technology. These broadly rest on three pillars — technologies should support democratic values; build trust, integrity and resilience; and foster competition and collaboration that drive advances in science and technology. The direction that Quad countries take will have a significant bearing on the future of technology. A key driver of Quad is balancing China’s influence on global security and economy, and the future of technology sits at the heart of both. In this context, the principles outlined reflect a significant commitment to a counter-China approach. Take, for example, the stress on values: Technology should be designed, governed and used to promote “shared values of autonomy, agency and dignity of individuals”. This contradicts some of the principles China has embraced. It has a sprawling deployment of digital tools that help keep a strong check on the activities of its people. In 2019, the US blacklisted several Chinese companies for furthering China’s “campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance” in the Xinjiang region. In fact, the principles explicitly condemn the misuse of technology for “malicious activities such as authoritarian surveillance and oppression, for terrorist purposes or to disseminate disinformation”. This is a message to autocracies, but it is also a message to democracies to live by their own ideals. A second core area of focus relates to how the Quad countries envision the future of their tech industries. Technology ecosystems must be built with “trust, integrity and resilience”. Again, the China backdrop is conspicuous. In recent years, all Quad partners have blacklisted Chinese hardware giants such as Huawei over concerns that they could open security backdoors for China. Quad also aims to reorient the semiconductor supply-chain dominated by Beijing. All four Quad partners are well positioned to make a meaningful pivot if they address this overreliance. Crucially, India will stand to gain as it attempts to become an alternative to the powerhouse of the tech industry that China has become. But for that to happen, India’s commitment to the principles will be under close scrutiny. In the short- term, this could have a bearing on how India approaches regulation of big tech which, for a while now, appears to be on a collision course with the Global North’s light touch policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-future-of-global-tech-101632741826524.html
27-09-2021||Editorials||The battle within the Opposition space||On Monday, senior Congress leader and former chief minister of Goa, Luizinho Faleiro, resigned as a legislator of the assembly and quit his party. Mr Faleiro is all set to join the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and expressed his admiration for West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s street fighting abilities and her win in the recent state assembly elections. Mr Faleiro joins a list of leaders who have joined the TMC from the Congress in recent weeks, the most prominent being Sushmita Dev. The TMC has also picked a Congress-leaning activist, Saket Gokhale. It also welcomed former finance minister Yashwant Sinha (formerly of the Bharatiya Janata Party) right before the West Bengal polls, and former BJP MP and minister Babu Supriyo recently. It is making a serious bid to expand in Tripura, with an eye on the 2023 elections in the state; in Parliament, the TMC has been the most belligerent among the Opposition forces in a bid to lead the charge against the government; and Mamata Banerjee has made no secret of her national ambitions, including in her current campaign for an assembly seat.
