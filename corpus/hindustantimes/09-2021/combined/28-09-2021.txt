The SDMC commissioner also advised the municipal councillors to obtain life certificates -- to attest that the pension beneficiary is alive and well -- before adding new pensioners under the scheme.Explaining the issue, a senior municipal official said the municipal body has a provision of issuing pension assistance of ₹1,000 per month to 400 pensioners in each of the 104 municipal wards. “After adding the pensions allocated from the discretionary quotas of senior functionaries such as the mayor, a total of 45,000 pensions can be disbursed by the corporation,” the official said, asking not to be named. Due to shortage of funds, the civic body was unable to disburse these pensions since the past two years, the official said. “The last pensions were issued in September 2019. Commissioner has ordered that life certificates must be obtained from all beneficiaries before releasing any new pension amount. These certificates will be vetted and attested by the respective municipal councillor,” the official further said.Officials said life certificates will help weed out dead beneficiaries, especially those who died since 2020 from the Covid-19 pandemic. Standing committee chairman, Col (retd) BK Oberoi said there are 16 types of pensions in Delhi and most of the categories have been transferred to the Delhi government. “Categories such as senior citizen pensions and disable persons pensions have been taken over by the Delhi government. We are currently allowed to issue pensions only to five categories of people -- widows, transgenders, divorcees, people are ill /bedridden and children whose parents have died,” he said. Oberoi said he was not aware about the number of cases in which discrepancies were found. “This is an administrative matter. During the committee meeting, the commissioner informed us that in some cases, pension were found issued to persons who are not alive. These must be cases not more than two years old and a probe is being carried out,” he said.Bharti said no pension will be released without the production of a life certificate for a beneficiary concerned and said a similar attestation is made once a year by retired government officials as well. He did not provide specific number of cases in which the Lokayukta is carrying out the inquiry. In the past, several pension related irregularities have been found in the north corporation as well as the erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). In 2010, the MCD had deleted the names of 3,583 beneficiaries from its pension scheme after finding out that they were availing of benefits from both the civic body and the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-south-corporation-makes-life-certificates-mandatory-for-pensions-101632853741341.html
28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Amid opposition, Mohali MC House approves cattle dairy shed in Industrial Area||Heated arguments ensued during the question hour of the House meeting of the municipal corporation (MC) on Tuesday when Congress councillors started replying to questions asked by the Azad group even though they were asked to the mayor.The Azad group councillors again took up the issue of construction of the cattle shed on 3.5 acres of land in Industrial Area, Phase 8, alleging that Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had leased the land to MC and it couldn’t be subleased further.The agenda, which was tabled in the House, was to shift milch animals out of city limits by developing a cattle dairy shed, to be carved out of 13.6 acres of MC land in Industrial Area, Phase 8B. The agenda was approved amid the ruckus.The Azad group alleged that Congress councillors came prepared to counter their allegations on the issue of allotting land to dairy owners for shifting of cattle to a designated place on the lines of Milk Colony in Chandigarh.Congress councillors were carrying full-size photographs of stray cattle seen on roads, which they flaunted as soon as the Opposition started questioning the agenda point.Opposed to charging rent from dairy farmers: OppositionOpposition councillors Gurmeet Kaur flanked by Aruna Sharma, Ramanpreet Kaur from Kumbran and Harjinder Kaur from Sohana raised objections over the agenda point to rent out sheds to dairy owners to set up cattle rearing units. Ramanpreet Kaur said, “We are not opposing the agenda for shifting of the cattle out of the city but the charging of rent from dairy owners.”“Small-time dairy owners will not be able to pay the rent to the tune of ₹10,000 to ₹15,000 per month as they might not earn that much after selling the milk,” she added.While clarifying the issue, city mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu said, “We gave time to the Opposition, but they raised an unnecessary issue.”“It has been observed that local dairy owners let their cattle stray out on roads for grazing after milking them which causes much inconvenience to the commuters,” he added.Deputy mayor Kuljeet Singh Bedi said, “We have earmarked 3.5 acres of land for setting up a shed where local dairy owners will be given space to tie their cattle and milk them. The space will be given as per the number of cattle owned by the dairy owners. The cattle will not be allowed to let out in the open.”Apart from this another agenda item regarding developing a children’s park under Amrut Mission and developing a park in Industrial Area, Phase 9, were also passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-opposition-mohali-mc-house-approves-cattle-dairy-shed-in-industrial-area-101632853740197.html

They will be provided with ₹50,000 as compensation.Earlier, the Centre, in an affidavit filed before with the Supreme Court, said the compensation will be paid by the state governments from their respective disaster response funds and will be channelised through the District Disaster Management Authority or the district administrations.The families will have to submit their claims through a form issued by the state authorities along with specified documents, including those certifying the cause of death.As per the official records, 8187 people in the state have so far succumbed to Covid-19. However, NGOs working in the health sector believe otherwise as Odisha registered around 20,000-odd excess deaths in 2020 as compared to 2019 which they allege may possibly have been caused due to Covid-19. The NGO leaders say there may have been more deaths this year as the second wave of Covid-19 was more fatal as compared to last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-to-issue-sop-on-covid-19-death-compensation-101632852841654.html
28-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai hospitals witness 50% rise in emergency footfall of patients with heart attacks||Hospitals across the city are witnessing an almost 50% rise in emergency footfall of patients with heart attacks compared to the peak pandemic period in the second wave. This is attributed to sedentary lifestyle during the pandemic and disruption of treatment for patients with cardiac ailments in the lockdown.Data from the state health department shows there has been a 27% drop in cases of hypertension and diabetes—which are considered as contributing factors to heart attack amid the pandemic compared to 2019-20. Doctors also believe Covid-19, which increases the chances of heart-related diseases, can also be a contributing factor. They lay emphasis on conducting more studies to conclude on the correlation.Heart attack is the biggest killer in Mumbai. On an average, every day around 90 people die because of it, as per the data of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). When the pandemic started in March 2020, both private and civic-run hospitals witnessed a drastic drop in cases of heart attack. But as the daily Covid-19 cases dip, there has been a sudden surge in cases of heart attack in the past 2-3 months.Dr Akshay Deodhar, in-charge of accident and emergency department at Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital, that he has witnessed almost 50% rise in heart attack cases in the past few months. Wockhardt Hospital, Mira Road has recorded 8,451 cases of heart attacks since the start of the pandemic.Pandemic fearWhen the pandemic started, people refused to visit hospitals to avoid contracting Covid-19. Thus a large number of patients with diabetes and hypertension remained undetected or lagged behind in medication.Data provided by the state health department shows that in 2019-20, a total of 173,678 patients were diagnosed with diabetes in Maharashtra, which dropped to 127,320 in 2020-21 amid the pandemic. Similarly, detection of patients with hypertension dropped from 230,476 to 166,968 in the time period in the state.Dr Anup Taksande, consultant interventional cardiologist, Wockhardt Hospital, Mira Road, said, “Since Covid-19 cases started swelling up in the country, not many people were diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases as they failed to opt for cardiac screenings and seek timely intervention due to the fear of getting infected with the virus. Due to the lack of proper diagnosis, delayed treatment and complicated recovery, and ignorance, many suffered in silence. Still, many cases are going unreported. People have avoided treatment even after getting a heart attack.”Dr Mohit Garg, consultant and head of accident and emergency at Global Hospital, Parel, stated that with the starting of the pandemic, all emergency visits and admissions across hospitals for heart related ailments had declined drastically by 40-50% compared with pre-pandemic data.“Researchers concluded that people were more than twice as likely to die from a heart attack when compared with pre-pandemic times, probably because they were less likely to be hospitalized,” he said.Covid-19 a cause?Studies across the globe have stated that Covid-19 recovered patients are vulnerable to developing heart attacks within two-three weeks of recovery. A study—Incidence and clinical profile of acute coronary syndromes (heart attacks) in recovered cases of Covid infection – by doctors from Sri Jayadevai Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bangalore in June found that 26 patients who recovered from Covid-19 had suffered a heart attack within seven to eight weeks of post recovery.“There is a widespread swelling (inflammation) as the body’s immune system fights the infection. The inflammation not only affects the lungs, but also the heart, brain, kidneys and other systems of the body. We also know that the Delta variant can have more effects. Many patients have been experiencing cardiac symptoms during the pandemic,” said Dr Ruchit Shah, interventional cardiologist, Masina Hospital.A study published in the Lancet which was conducted among 86,742 people found that the risk of heart attacks and strokes is three times higher in the first two weeks of Covid-19 infection.Dr Garg also shared the same opinion. “In various studies over the past few months, it has been found that Covid-19 evolved as a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes. It is fatally affecting a large number of young people with no pre-existing heart ailments or any traditional risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension or high cholesterol,” he said.Doctors are getting several patients with complaints of chest pain who upon diagnosis are identified as Covid-19 positive. “As per our safety protocol, every patient strictly undergoes a Rapid Antigen test (RAT), followed by an RT-PCR test. We diagnosed active Covid-19 infection in less than 4% to 5% of patients, who rushed to the casualty ward,” said Deodhar.Many young people between the age of 20 and 35 years are getting diagnosed with heart attacks.Dr Taksande said he is witnessing a large number of patients in emergency between the age of 20 to 35 years suffering a massive heart attack and succumbing to it.Doctors have recommended social distancing, avoiding crowded places, double masks covering nose and mouth, sanitization and complete vaccination as must for all. Dr Shah further recommended avoiding heavy strenuous activity for six to eight weeks after Covid-19 infection.Case studyTushar Rane and Sanchita Gamre, a ward boy and technician from Nanavati Max Hospital, gave a new lease of life to a 55-year-old heart attack patient by providing him Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in an autorickshaw while ferrying him to the hospital.CPR is a lifesaving technique that involves chest compressions in an effort to manually help in breathing of a person who is in cardiac arrest.On September 20, when the two staff visited a nationalised insurance company for personal work, they witnessed the man collapse. “I had barely climbed the stairs when I heard my colleague Sanchita calling out my name loudly,” said Rane. “He was breathless and had no pulse. I immediately started CPR,” said Gamre who works as a senior technician in the 2D Echo unit.The patient’s angiography revealed a 100% blockage in the patient’s left anterior descending artery (LAD)—the largest and most important of the three main coronary arteries. Cardiologists from the hospital immediately performed an angioplasty to relieve the block and restored the heart’s blood flow. The patient was discharged within 48 hours of observation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-hospitals-witness-50-rise-in-emergency-footfall-of-patients-with-heart-attacks-101632852542639.html

She chose to settle in Surat as she had lived there before, during her father’s posting as a serviceman before his retirement. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj said the woman went missing from Delhi since August 17. Her husband, who lodged a complaint, told police that she went to get medicines from a market near their house, leaving behind her two daughters aged six and four. “On September 3, the anti-human trafficking unit of Delhi Police received a request to find the woman, soon after which a team was constituted to trace her,” said Bhardwaj. “The team collected relevant details. People connected to her had no clue about her whereabouts. Her call detail records were also procured but there was no activity on her phone number.” “Several numbers were tracked and one of them led to her location in Gujarat’s Surat. The person in whose name the number was registered, identified as Manish Jha, was contacted. He refused to have known the woman. The team pursued this contact further and made local enquiries from his family members. Finally, his two daughters identified the woman and said she was their tuition teacher. Manish revealed the woman was living at an apartment in Sapna Nagar in Surat,” said Bhardwaj.According to police, the woman said that due to some family dispute, she decided to leave her two daughters with her husband and live elsewhere. She first went to Rewari from where she boarded a bus for Jaipur and thereafter, took a Volvo bus for Mumbai in search of a job. However, when the bus reached the industrial area of Surat, she sensed good job opportunities there. Moreover, since her father was a former serviceman, she had lived there with him during one of his postings, said police. Police said the woman started giving tuitions to students of primary classes and also worked at a small beauty parlour to make ends meet. She has been handed over to local police for further proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/30yrold-woman-goes-missing-from-delhi-found-in-surat-101632851219834.html

Speaking at a press conference in Gurugram on Tuesday, Chautala said that the candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) coalition would not be elected to the assembly as a majority of farmers are opposed to the government. Chautala was the MLA of Ellenabad constituency in Sirsa district; he resigned on January 27 in a protest against the farm laws. He was the only INLD member in the state assembly.“This byelection will signify whether people support the three farm laws or if they are against these black laws. I had asked my voters whether I should follow the footsteps of Chaudhary Devi Lal and resign as an MLA; they supported the decision at that time,” Chautala said.The INLD leader also said that decision about the party candidate for the polls would be taken on October 3. “I can assure you that candidate from ruling BJP-JJP will face strong opposition and protests from the voters as most of them are farmers, who oppose the farm laws,” Chautala said.The INLD leader said that if the Congress MLAs had also resigned on the farm laws issue, then the government would have fallen.Raman Malik, BJP spokesperson, said that resignation by INLD was nothing but a political gimmick to win public sympathy. “The three farm laws are still there and these have not been repealed. So, why is Chautala or his party keen on fighting the election? The reason for resignation is still there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ellenabad-polls-will-be-referendum-on-farm-laws-says-abhay-chautala-of-inld-101632851106091.html

HSVP officials said that with the removal of encroachments on this land, the construction of a 60-metre road can be completed without further issues. The drive was undertaken in the presence of the Gurugram police, officials said. Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP, said that these structures posed a hindrance in the construction of the sector road and notices had been issued to the owners about a fortnight ago. “The removal of these encroachments was needed to complete the road. A number of residential areas would benefit once this road is constructed,” he said.Officials said that the boundary wall of a health centre and a warehouse, which were encroaching on its land, were also demolished as they were falling in the alignment of the road. The enforcement team used earthmoving machines to demolish this structure and there was no resistance from the locals as they had been given notice in advance. The HSVP has been directed to conduct demolition drives on its land and remove encroachments, particularly in developing sectors of the city, where roads have remained stuck for a long period. In this regard, the authority demarcated two large sections of roads in sectors 81 and 83. Officials said that illegal constructions on these roads would also be removed soon. Last week, the authority had cleared encroachments from a two-acre plot in Sector 5, where five permanent houses, a service station and several hutments were constructed illegally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-clears-encroachments-for-main-road-between-sectors-37d-9b-101632851104879.html

Officials said the transmission period of diseases caused by mosquitoes, such as dengue and malaria, is between July and November.“This season provides a conducive atmosphere, with the average temperature hovering around 25°C and the humidity above 60%, for the mosquitoes to breed, which in turn facilitates the transmission of dengue and malaria. The cases reported so far this year are not confined to one particular area and is spread across the district,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, GB Nagar.According to doctors, symptoms of malaria include fever with chills and discomfort, general discomfort, abdominal pain, cough and in severe cases, may lead to nausea, vomiting and headache.“The preventive measures to keep one safe from malaria are to keep the body covered and use mosquito repellents and not let stagnant water accumulate near residential areas. The incubation period of malaria is 1-2 weeks, after one is bitten by the female Anopheles mosquito, that causes the disease,” said Dr N K Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association (Noida). Meanwhile, two new dengue cases were reported in GB Nagar between September 24 and 26. “There have been 39 dengue cases in the district so far. In last two years, there has been substantial decrease in number of dengue cases. In 2018, 145 dengue cases were reported followed by 82 in 2019 and 35 last year,” said Sharma. Medical experts said chances of increase in vector-borne diseases in the coming months are high.“As seasons are changing, mosquitoes will breed more and cases of malaria and dengue may rise. People should consult a doctor as soon as they get symptoms and get tested and treated,” said Dr N K Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-reports-45-new-cases-of-malaria-in-sept-tally-reaches-68-101632850559937.html
28-09-2021||Chandigarh||At 59, Chandigarh’s dengue case count in September highest in 4 years||The Chandigarh health department has registered 59 confirmed cases of dengue in September, highest in four years.The cases of dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, started spiralling in the city after spells of rain.Last year, only 19 cases were reported during the corresponding period. The health department had confirmed 30 cases in September 2019 and 56 a year before.However, September of 2017 had witnessed 662 cases while the year’s total caseload stood at 1,951.So far in 2021, 78 cases of dengue have been reported in Chandigarh, with the health department claiming zero fatality due to the disease.Health experts fear that the combination of dengue and Covid infections can intensify the severity of both the diseases as there is no specific antiviral drug for both and the treatment mostly depends on clinical conditions and symptoms.“Since Covid and dengue have common symptoms, people must get tested for both the diseases as early detection can help them recover better. Covid is not over yet and people must follow appropriate behaviour,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, health services, Chandigarh, adding that no case of co-infection has so far been seen in UT.The health department has also logged six confirmed cases of malaria this year against last year’s seven. No chikungunya case has been reported in Chandigarh in the last three years.“With the onset of dengue season, the department has ramped up field activities to prevent and control the spread of the disease. Medical teams have been formed to check the breeding of dengue larvae while door-to-door inspection is also on. This month, more than 300 challans have been issued to erring residents and 285 show-cause notices have been served on government offices, colleges and schools, where larvae were found,” said Dr Nagpal.While the health department is strengthening the infrastructure for a possible third wave of Covid, authorities are also gearing up to control the dengue outbreak, the doctor said, adding that fogging is conducted regularly throughout the year, especially before and during the monsoon season.“Cases can further shoot up from next month. We have enough platelets in the blood bank at Government Multi Specialty Hospital in Sector 16 and dengue testing has also been scaled up at government centres. Also, awareness camps are being set up at schools and public places to educate people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-59-chandigarh-s-dengue-case-count-in-september-highest-in-3-years-101632850199810.html

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||BJP top brass goes into huddle to shortlist candidates for bypolls in Himachal||Soon after the Election Commission (EC) announced the schedule for bypolls to the three assemblies and one parliamentary segment in Himachal, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s top brass went into a huddle in the state capital to give the final shape to its poll strategy. Those who attended the meeting included the party’s national vice-president Saudan Singh, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, state in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna, state president Suresh Kashyap and co-in-charge Sanjay Tandon and party’s general secretary organisation Pawan Rana. The party also deliberated on the prospective candidates for the seats. The party leaders also discussed in detail the prospects of two cabinet ministers -- Jalshakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur and education minister Govind Singh Thakur -- from Mandi Lok Sabha seat even as the party’s vice-president Ajay Rana and Kargil war hero Brigadier Kushal Thakur too are vying for a ticket here. The party will draw a panel of candidates for the elections and forward it to the high command by October 2. The party has already approved Ram Rattan Pal Singh from Arki and former horticulture minister Narendra Bragta’s elder son Chetan Bragta. Congress is most likely to pit former chief parliamentary secretary and grandson of former chief minister Ram Thakur against him. Thakur is a two-time legislator from Jubbal and Kotkhai assembly segment. While Ram Rattan Pal Singh had contested against six-time chief minister Virbhadra Singh who died on July 8 this year. Speaking on the occasion, BJP general secretary Trilok Jamwal said, “BJP is fully prepared for these elections.” He said the BJP will fight elections on the issue of development. “Under the strong leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, national BJP president Jagat Prakash Nadda, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and state president Suresh Kashyap, BJP will win the byelections of Mandi Lok Sabha, Jubbal Kotkhai, Fatehpur and Arki,” he said. BJP state president Suresh Kashyap said the party will announce the candidates for the four seats soon. “The candidates will be announced by the Parliamentary Board will after the election committee meeting,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-top-brass-goes-into-huddle-to-shortlist-candidates-for-bypolls-in-himachal-101632849839906.html

28-09-2021||Mumbai||Thane man mistakenly jabbed for rabies instead of Covid-19; doctor, nurse suspended||A resident of Kalwa in Maharashtra’s Thane city was mistakenly administered an anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) instead of a Covid-19 jab, officials said. The man had gone to get the Covid-19 vaccine at a healthcare centre in centre Kalwa east. Rajkumar Yadav, 45, said that he recently underwent surgery on his lower back and therefore he went to the centre to inquire if he can get the Covid-19 vaccine. He claimed he was jabbed on both the arms. “I have weakness and pain in my arm now. I recently underwent surgery for my back and went to the centre to inquire about the dose. The doctor said I can take the vaccine and gave me the case papers. As I was unable to stand due to the operation, one person from the hospital told me to go and take a seat in one of the rooms.” The nurse, he claimed, jabbed him in both the arms which made him suspicious so he asked her what dose was he injected with. “She did not ask me to show any papers or asked what dose I was there for. I was shocked to hear that they gave me the anti-rabies vaccine. I went to the local corporator and narrated my ordeal.” Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has acknowledged the goof up and suspended the doctor and nurse at the centre. The corporation informed that the said person who was administered the anti-rabies vaccine is stable. Sandeep Malvi, additional municipal commissioner, TMC, said, “The concerned patient, Rajkumar Yadav, had gone to inquire about Covishield vaccine at Atkoneshwar Nagar primary health care centre in Kalwa east. The medical officer in charge of the centre, Dr Rakhi Tawade, gave him case papers for Covishield vaccine and asked him to wait in the queue.” The primary healthcare centre caters to all other healthcare ailments of Atkoneshwar and nearby slums. Apart from Covid, it also administers other vaccines. Malvi added, “Yadav mistakenly went and sat in a queue meant for ARV. When his turn came to get the shot, the concerned nurse, Kirti Rayat, did not check his case papers or inform him about the vaccine dose administered. She assumed he was there for an ARV shot and gave him the jab. The nurse and the medical officer should have informed the patient about the vaccine being administered and should have checked the case papers before giving any vaccine.” Malvi informed that such negligence in any of its healthcare centres will not be tolerated. “We have suspended both of them. Yadav’s condition is stable and we have been monitoring his health.” A person familiar with the matter at TMC said, “After taking the vaccine, Yadav went and inquired with the nurse about the vaccine. The nurse told him it was an anti-rabies vaccine following which he panicked and said he was supposed to get the Covishield vaccine. He demanded an explanation following which an inquiry was held.” Thane Mayor Naresh Mhaske added that the centre is in a slum where most beneficiaries are uneducated and it was the duty of the medical staff to guide them. Mhaske said, “I came to know about the incident and immediately gave directives to inquire and take action against the staff responsible. We agree that the person sat in the wrong queue, however, the staff should have informed every person about the vaccine that was being administered.” TMC is not new to such goof-ups, in August, several vaccine doses went missing from one of its vaccine centres in Kausa, Mumbra and were found at a hair transplant clinic. In May, few celebrities were jabbed out of turn while incidents of a woman being jabbed thrice on the same day and a senior citizen being given a certificate without being jabbed also surfaced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-man-mistakenly-jabbed-for-rabies-instead-of-covid-19-doctor-nurse-suspended-101632849304128.html

28-09-2021||Noida||UP govt to soon take a decision on leasehold properties in Noida||The Uttar Pradesh government will soon take a decision on residents’ demands of converting leasehold properties into freehold following a directive from the Allahabad high court. In response to a Noida resident’s petition filed in July this year, the Allahabad high court directed the UP government on September 9 to decide the matter within one month’s time.This is the first time that the court has directed the state government to decide the issue in a month--residents have been demanding freehold status of their properties for several years.Under the freehold system, an allottee has outright ownership of property, thereby making its transfer and sale easier. Under the leasehold system, the government has control over the sale or transfer of a property. Moreover, as per the leasehold system, the owner has the right to call the property his or hers for only 90 years — and not forever.During the hearing on September 9, the state counsel submitted before the court that the matter raised by the petitioner is under “active consideration with the state government and being a policy decision, some reasonable time may be given to finalise the decision which is required to be approved by the cabinet”.“As prayed by the learned standing counsel a month’s time is given to the respondents for taking final decision on the matter. Let writ petition is listed again in October 2021, enabling the respondents (UP gov) to take a final decision of the subject matter. It is however made clear that further delay in the matter would not be accepted thus, the respondents would take a final decision in this matter before the next date of hearing,” said the order passed by acting chief justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and justice Anil Kumar Ojha.The Uttar Pradesh government has sought details again from the Noida authority to make a decision before the next court hearing scheduled in October.“We have provided the state government with all facts and figures about leasehold properties and how the freehold status will impact the development and maintenance of civic infrastructure,” said a Noida authority official, requesting anonymity. Chairman of the Noida authority Sanjiv Mittal and CEO Ritu Maheshwari were not available for comments despite repeated attempts.In November 2018, during its board meeting, the Noida authority approved a proposal to convert all leasehold properties into freehold.Petitioner PS Jain, president of the confederation of Delhi-NCR residents’ welfare association (CONRWA), an umbrella body of RWAs, filed this plea in July this year to question why the state had not taken a decision three years after the Noida authority board approved this proposal.“We submitted before the court that when leasehold property has been converted to freehold in all cities of the country, then why not in Noida? A committee formed by the authority also recommended that freehold status should be awarded to leasehold properties. The Noida authority itself recommended it. Then why the delay in decision making?” said Jain, who is hopeful that leasehold property will be deemed freehold in Noida next month.The authority, in 2017, conducted a survey on the impact of changing the status of certain properties to freehold from leasehold. Ernst & Young, an agency surveyed and studied revenue pattern and profit from this move, and submitted a report in October 2018 on the pros and cons of conversion from leasehold to freehold. Later the same year, an internal committee of the authority also deliberated on the survey report and recommended that freehold status should be awarded to leasehold properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-govt-to-soon-take-a-decision-on-leasehold-properties-in-noida-101632849299882.html

28-09-2021||Lucknow||Ram Mandir: Trust sets Dec 2023 deadline for enthroning Ram Lalla||The Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust has set a deadline to enthrone Ram Lalla (infant Lord Ram) in the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya by December 2023 to allow devotees to worship the deity and start placement work of stones for this work by January next year.After completing foundation work of the temple, the Trust has started the second phase of construction. In this phase, the plinth of the temple will be constructed. According to the Trust, above the foundation, a one-and- a-half-metre thick raft is being placed. Above this raft, the plinth will be constructed in which Mirzapur stone granite will be used. Following it, placement work of stones for sanctum sanctorum of the Ram Mandir will start. “Placement work of stones will start from January next (2022),” said a member of the Trust. “The Trust has set a target of enthroning Ram Lalla in sanctum sanctorum of Ram Mandir by December 2023,” he added. Chiselling of around 60 percent of the stones to be used in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple has been completed. The remaining stones are being chiselled. Around 12 artisans from Rajasthan have reached Ayodhya for this work. The Trust will soon increase the number of artisans to expedite the process of chiselling of stones. According to a study carried out by the Trust, the number of devotees is expected to increase fivefold after Ram Mandir comes up in Ayodhya. To face this situation, the Trust is developing infrastructure in the temple town. A new road up to Ram Mandir has been proposed starting from Birla Dharamshala and passing from behind Sugreev Quila. Larsen and Toubro is carrying out construction work of the Ram Mandir. The Tata Consulting Engineers is working as project management consultant and is assisting Larsen and Toubro in the construction work. Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over “Bhoomi Pujan” of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on August 5 last year. Apart from Ram Mandir, a total of 124 projects worth ₹20,107 crore are also under way for the development of Ayodhya and 79 of them will be completed by December 15 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ram-mandir-trust-sets-dec-2023-deadline-for-enthroning-ram-lalla-101632849179890.html

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Garbage collectors block road for an hour during protest||Even as the civic body is making tall claims about streamlining door-to-door collection of waste in the city, around 50 waste collectors protested against municipal corporation (MC) officials and Congress leader Gurpreet Gopi on Tuesday after being stopped from dumping garbage at the Dugri static compactor site.They blocked Dugri canal bridge with their carts for around an hour and threatened to dump the waste in between the chowk, if the issue wasn’t resolved.As per information, the garbage collectors collect waste from houses in Dugri, Dhandra Road and adjoining areas. Earlier, they used to dump the waste at a secondary dump site in Dugri, which was removed after residents raised objections against it. The collectors were then asked to dump the garbage at the static compactor site.After the quantity of garbage at the compactor site increased and started to spill on the roadsides, Gopi, who is the son of deceased area councillor (ward number 49) Rajinder Kaur, stopped them from dumping the garbage there and directed them to dump it at secondary dump site in Model Town near scooter market.

28-09-2021||Mumbai||Let’s make action plan to combat climate crisis: Aaditya Thackeray to 27 environment ministers||Maharashtra cabinet minister for environment and climate change, Aaditya Thackeray, has written letters to his counterparts in 26 states and one union territory — Delhi —seeking “coordination on a common action plan for climate change mitigation and adaption”. A copy of Thackeray’s letter, dated September 14, was obtained by Hindustan Times this week.Although Thackeray’s letter does not delve into the specifics of how states are proposed to coordinate on the matter, the minister wrote that “it would be in the best interest of us all, nationally to convene digital meets and share our work and ideate on a common agenda that we can assist each other on”.According to officials in the minister’s office, the move is the first step in Maharashtra’s plans to host a convention of India’s environment ministers after the upcoming 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow in November, where Thackeray will present a draft version of the Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP), which is being drafted pursuant to the BMC’s agreement with the C40 Cities climate leadership group in December 2020.Speaking to HT about the same, Thackeray commented, “Regional leadership is key to climate action. As sub-national governments, we ought to come together and exchange our learnings to ensure that we are aligned nationally for an ambitious pathway for reducing our emissions.”Under the aegis of the C40 group, Aaditya Thackeray will also be participating on Wednesday in a 45-minute closed-door meeting with his counterparts from Delhi (Gopal Rai), Karnataka (Anand Singh) and Tamil Nadu (Siva.V. Meyyanathan) where each minister will be presenting an overview of the climate action taken in their respective states. A spokesperson for Thackeray described the online gathering as an “exploratory meeting” that will be followed up with similar conferences with environment departments of other states.This development comes amid a major push from Maharashtra to align itself with movements and organisations working toward climate crisis action. Last week, the minister had announced that 43 Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) cities and urban clusters from Maharashtra will join the global Race to Zero campaign. Cities joining this campaign have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions in the 2040s or sooner.Earlier this month, the state Cabinet had also given a nod to setting up the country’s first state council on climate, which is expected to be formed in coming months, and will hold weekly meetings to set and review the implementation of climate change targets. In addition to this, the Maharashtra government’s proposed electric vehicle policy 2021 and its move to bring 9,800 hectares of mangroves under protection of the Indian Forest Act (1972) have been publicly hailed by Thackeray as evidence of the state’s climate-forward agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lets-make-action-plan-to-combat-climate-crisis-aaditya-thackeray-to-27-environment-ministers-101632848759749.html

28-09-2021||Mumbai||Thane resident mistakenly given anti-rabies vaccine||In yet another bizarre incident related to Covid-19 vaccination in Thane city, a Kalwa resident, who went to get the vaccine at a healthcare centre, was mistakenly administered an anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) instead. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) suspended the doctor and nurse of that centre. The corporation informed that the said person who was administered anti-rabies vaccine is stable. Sandeep Malvi, additional municipal commissioner, TMC, said, “The concerned patient Rajkumar Yadav, had gone to enquire about Covishield vaccine at the Atkoneshwar Nagar primary health care centre in Kalwa East. The medical officer in-charge of the centre, Dr Rakhi Tawade, gave him case papers for Covishield vaccine and asked him to wait in the queue.” The primary healthcare centre caters to all other healthcare ailments of the Atkoneshwar and nearby slums. Apart from Covid, it also administers other vaccines. Malvi added, “Yadav mistakenly went and sat in a queue meant for ARV. When his turn came to get the shot, the concerned nurse Kirti Rayat, did not check his case papers or inform him about the vaccine dose administered. She assumed he was there for ARV and gave jabbed him with the same. It was the responsibility of the nurse and the medical officer to inform the patient about the vaccine being administered and to check the case papers before giving any vaccine.” Malvi informed that such negligence in any of its healthcare centre will not be tolerated. “We have suspended both Rayat who did not check the case papers and Tawade under whom monitoring and supervision of the said incident took place, for endangering the life of a patient. Yadav’s condition is stable and we have being monitoring his health.” A source from TMC said, “After taking the vaccine, Yadav went and inquire with the nurse which vaccine was he administered after getting jabbed. The nurse told him it was anti-rabies vaccine, following which he panicked and said he was supposed to get Covishield vaccine. He demanded an explanation, following which an inquiry was held.” Thane mayor Naresh Mhaske added that the centre is in a slum where most beneficiaries are uneducated and it was duty of the medical staff to guide them. Mhaske said, “I came to know about the incident and immediately gave directives to inquire and take action against the staff responsible. We agree that the person sat in wrong queue, however, the staff should inform each and every person what vaccine is being administered before the jab.” TMC is not new to such goof ups, as in the month of August several vaccine doses went missing from one of its vaccine centres in Kausa, Mumbra and were found at a hair transplant clinic. In May few celebrities were jabbed out of turn while incidents of a woman being jabbed thrice on the same day and a senior citizen being given a certificate without being jabbed had taken place. Rajkumar Yadav, 45, said that he had recently undergone a surgery on his lower back and so had gone to inquire if he can get the Covid vaccine. He claimed he was jabbed on both the arms. He said, “I have weakness and pain in my arm now. I recently underwent a surgery for my back and went to the centre to enquire about the dose. The doctor said I can take the vaccine and gave me the case papers. As I was unable to stand due to the operation, one person from the hospital told me to go and take a seat in one of the rooms.” The nurse, he claimed, jabbed him in both the arms, which made him suspicious so he asked her what dose was he injected. “She did not ask me to show any papers or asked what dose I was there for. I was shocked to hear that they gave me anti-rabies vaccine when I was not bitten by a dog. I went to local corporator and narrated my ordeal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-resident-mistakenly-given-anti-rabies-vaccine-101632848400923.html

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Students of Islamic University of Science and Technology decry offline exams||The decision of Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST) to conduct final-semester B.Tech exams offline has not gone down well with some students.The students have demanded that their examinations be conducted online, the way they were taught online. Many students have alleged that the university has woken up to rush through the exams after the students wrote to lieutenant governor about delay in finishing their B.Tech degrees. “Our degrees are already late as we have been insisting on our exams for the past more than a month. There are placement drives already going on. Now they have come up with a decision to conduct an offline exam within a couple of weeks. We wanted an online exam but they are pressuring us for offline exams. We have studied keeping in mind online exams,” said a student of B.Tech Computer Science.“Let them take our exams keeping in mind what the teachers have taught us online,” she said.Another student said the university has informed them that their ‘minors’ will be from Wednesday to Friday online and then after two days they will conduct ‘majors’ offline without any gap.“For four days our four papers will be examined. They are giving us four days’ time. How can we get ready? Four subjects with 20 units and then project presentation and project report. How come it is possible that we will be able to do justice and our final year is totally dependent on project work? ,” he said.“We want that either the exams should be conducted online or if they want offline exams then we should be given enough time for the preparations,” he said.Another student said, “Our majors should also be online as marking papers offline takes time. There should be some relaxation at least.” The university’s vice-chancellor Prof Shakil Ahmad Romshoo said they have decided to conduct all exams offline to maintain the sanctity of the exams.“This is unfortunate that some students try to make a mockery of this system. Most of the students are ready for the exams. If people have studied online, their exams will be taken keeping that in mind and it is not necessary that it has to be online. They will be examined on the topics they have been taught,” he said.He said the university is attempting to declare the results before October 30 to allow students to complete their masters admissions in NIT. “There are students who want to go for masters and have also qualified GATE; they want to apply for admissions at NIT whose last date is October 30. That is why we decided to declare the result a few days before the date,” he said.“Still if some students have some issues they can talk to dean and we can see how much concession we can give to students,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/students-of-islamic-university-of-science-and-technology-decry-offline-exams-101632847981319.html

The IMA sought the intervention of Bihar’s director-general of police (DGP) in arresting the culprits on a priority basis and said that more such incidents had taken place in the state of late. In a joint letter to the DGP on Tuesday, shared with the media, the national IMA president-elect Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh, IMA-Bihar president Dr Ajay Kumar and its secretary Dr Sunil Kumar condemned the police for not visiting the place of occurrence to either inquire or to arrest the accused even 15 hours after the incident. Copies of the letter were marked to the Bihar chief minister, the health minister, the chief secretary, additional chief secretaries of the health and the home departments as well as the officer-in-charge of the Kadamkuan police station. The IMA regretted that the police were delaying in taking action against the accused despite the Bihar Clinical Establishment and Personal Safety Act, 2011, and the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Act, 2020, for the protection of medical professionals and their clinical establishments. The IMA had enclosed a copy of the FIR filed by Dr Amit Kumar of the Kalyani orthopaedics and gynaecological centre and termed such acts as reprehensible, which dented the confidence of the medical professionals and tarnished the image of the state’s healthcare system. In his FIR, Dr Kumar alleged that relatives of a local patient, who came to his clinic in labour pain on September 27, had refused to make advance part-payment for the delivery while also refusing to sign the risk bond before any procedure. When the doctor requested the patient’s husband to sign the risk bond, his relatives, some of whom were allegedly in an inebriated condition roughed him up and also damaged his clinic..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-doc-assaulted-ima-writes-to-dgp-seeks-arrest-of-culprits-101632847979806.html

Citing the directive from the National Green Tribunal, DPCC said it is planning a comprehensive program for the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution."There will be a 'Complete Ban' on bursting and sale of all kinds of firecrackers up to 01.01.2022 in the territory of NCT of Delhi," the order reads.Delhi government had already announced a ban on the sale, use and storage of firecrackers in the national capital this Diwali. In a series of tweets, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the ban was announced in view of deteriorating air quality over the past three years.“Last year, the complete ban was imposed late, after looking at the rising pollution levels in the city. Because of this traders had already bought stock and they had to face losses. This time, traders are requested not to stock up on crackers,” he had tweeted.Delhi’s air quality takes a major dip during the winter season when the particulate matter concentration, PM2.5 and PM10, goes much beyond the prescribed standards. Pollutants from stubble burning in adjoining states, vehicular pollution, particulate matter from construction work majorly contribute to the decline in air quality which is further exacerbated by firecrackers during Diwali and New Year celebrations.DPCC said that large scale celebrations by the bursting of firecrackers will result in violation of social distancing norms, which could lead to another Covid-19 surge. It further noted that the firecrackers would result in a high level of air pollution leading to serious health issues in Delhi, “which under the prevalent pandemic crisis situation is not favourable for the cause of larger community health.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-orders-complete-ban-on-sale-bursting-of-firecrackers-till-january-1-101632846807519.html

Of this figure, 830 candidates were elected unopposed to the post of panch, while 26 candidates were elected uncontested to the post of ward member in gram panchayats. On the other hand, the posts of Mukhiya and Sarpanch witnessed competition.Besides, in the election’s second phase that is to begin September 29, as many as 3,402 candidates will be declared to have won uncontested out of the total 21,131 posts.Officials are attributing the reason for candidates being elected unopposed for the post of panch in gram kutcheries to “less number of perks”. “The fact that a large number of candidates are getting elected unopposed for the post of panch is because there are not many takers for the post in gram kutcheries, as the incumbents enjoy fewer powers and perks. It is the sarpanch who wields power and prestige, just like mukhiyas,” said an SEC official handling the panchayat polls.According to Rupesh Kumar, a social activist working to strengthen the panchayati raj system, the panch has considerable power to give his or her opinion on settling small disputes, but hardly any financial powers as like their counterparts, be it ward members or mukhiya in gram panchayats. “The lack of any financial power is a major factor as to why the post attracts less aspiring representatives of panchayat bodies,” Kumar said.However, panchayati raj minister Samrat Choudhary said the gram kutcheries have been delegated considerable legal powers to discharge their role in arbitration of small civil disputes and petty disputes at the village level in the last few years. “But, there is a general perception among those vying to contest panchayat polls that panch members have fewer powers and it’s not an important post. This is entirely wrong. We are trying to change this mindset,” he said.Referring to powers to gram kutcheries, the minister said the quasi-judicial bodies have the powers to interfere in disputes on small civil matters related to land and can even enforce the prohibition on an assemblage of four or more persons at a disputed site for 30 days.Choudhary said the state government is looking into the aspect of strengthening the kutcheries more and mulling over giving the panch members more powers so that the post holds importance in the local self-governance. “We are working on the proposal of strengthening gram kutcheries and also delegating more powers to panch members as we gave to the ward members in gram panchayat. The devolution of powers to ward members is one reason why there has been a rapid rise in nominations for the post in the ongoing panchayat polls,” the minister said.In the second phase of polls that will cover 48 blocks in 34 districts, there are a total of 71,467 candidates contesting for 21,131 posts. Altogether, 40,903 candidates are in the fray for the post of ward member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/panchayat-polls-not-many-takers-for-panch-post-as-over-800-elected-unopposed-in-1st-phase-101632846899960.html

28-09-2021||Lucknow||BHU scientists develop high yielding wheat variety||A high yielding wheat variety -- Malviya 838-- developed by the scientists of Institute of Agricultural Science-BHU-- was dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, Banaras Hindu University said in a press statement.On the occasion, the Prime Minister also dedicated 34 other crop varieties that were climate-resilient and had high nutrition content to the nation from New Delhi. He also spoke to some farmers via video conferencing. The communique by the BHU said professor Vinod Kumar Mishra, professor Hemant Kumar Jaiswal and Dr Sandeep Sharma from the department of genetics and plant breeding, professor Ramesh Kumar Singh from department of agronomy, professor Ramesh Chand and professor Shyam Sharan Vaish from department of plant pathology worked for six years to achieve this result.“This is a biofortified wheat variety and gives relatively higher output. It is rich in zinc and iron,” professor Vinod Kumar Mishra said. The biofortified varieties are 1.5 to 3.0 times more nutritious than the traditional varieties.The communique further said: “Wheat production in neighbouring Bangladesh has been adversely affected by a fungal disease Wheat Blast. Being a neighboring country, there is a possibility of this disease coming to our country as it spreads through air. However, there is no effect of this disease on Malaviya 838. It is completely resistant variety. Therefore, if this variety is grown in the states of India adjacent to Bangladesh, then we can stop this disease from coming to India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bhu-scientists-develop-high-yielding-wheat-variety-101632846419725.html
28-09-2021||Mumbai||MBA aspirants file PIL in Bombay HC against Maharashtra CET cell, demand re-exam||Days after Master in Business Administration (MBA) aspirants raised queries about discrepancies in the currently ongoing common entrance test exams, a group of students has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) against the state CET cell. In their petition, the students have highlighted how despite clearly mentioning a set paper pattern for the entrance test, the exams did not follow the said pattern, which students have called unfair. Students, through this PIL, have requested that the CET results be stayed for the timebeing unless their queries are heard. They have further demanded a re-examination. CET is an entrance test for admissions to professional undergraduate degree programs, including engineering, management, architecture, hotel management, pharmacy, agriculture and allied courses, among others. After an initial delay due to the pandemic, the exam is being conducted in multiple sessions starting September 20 and will go on till October 10. Nearly 1.3 lakh students appeared for the MH-MBA/MMS CET in the state this year. “Students tried on several occasions to bring this issue to the notice of the CET officials, but all in vain. We have also approached state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant to look into the matter. We now hope the judiciary will give us justice,” said Vaibhav Edke, petitioner, and president, Maharashtra Students Welfare Association (MSWA). As per the official CET website, MBA aspirants’ entrance exam has a total of 200 questions divided between four topics—Logical Reasoning (LR), Abstract Reasoning (AR), Quantitative Aptitude (Quant) and Verbal Ability (VA). “The paper pattern mentioned in the official examination brochure states that LR will have 75 questions, AR will have 25 questions and the remaining two topics will have 50 questions each. What did happen, however, is that some students got 90 questions in LR instead of 75 and others got 30 questions in the same topic. Similarly, some students got 70 questions in Quantitative Aptitude while others got 50. This means the exam was not held on a common platform,” said one of the students who appeared for the entrance exam this year. “Some of us who had jobs have already quit because we had all our hopes on the entrance exam going well and scoring well too. But with the discrepancies in the manner in which the exam was conducted, we are worried about scoring well,” said a student from Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mba-aspirants-file-pil-in-bombay-hc-against-maharashtra-cet-cell-demand-reexam-101632846299748.html

Channi had said ‘either I (Channi) will remain or corruption will be there’. Chadha, however, claimed that the inclusion of tainted minister in the state cabinet meant that the Congress cannot change its character, and that corruption and Channi will go hand in hand. “The Congress and corruption are two sides of the same coin,” Chadha alleged, during a press conference at the Jalandhar Press Club on Tuesday. He added that by the presence of Rana Gurjit Singh, who had serious allegations of illegal sand mining etc against him, into his ministry, Channi has proved that appearances are deceptive.“Another Punjab minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu is accused of causing loss of thousands of crores of rupees to Punjab with his links to the mandi mafia; Gurkirat Singh Kotli is accusing of sexually assaulting a French national, but yet all these ministers are in Channi’s cabinet. It is clear that the Congress wants to loot Punjab,” Chadha alleged.He demanded that chief minister Channi should award a compensation of ₹75,000 per acre to every cotton farmer, who had lost his crop due to the pink bollworm disease, with farm labourers provided relief of ₹25,000 each. “Channi need learn from the Kejriwal government in Delhi,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/congress-corruption-two-sides-of-the-same-coin-aap-s-chadha-101632845939778.html

The father of nation Mahatma Gandhi appealed people to leave foreign clothes and people obeyed it. Lal Bahadur Shastri appealed people to leave anna (food) and people obeyed it.

Following a discussion during the state cabinet meeting on Tuesday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray convened a meeting with senior officials on Wednesday evening. Officials said that all agencies will be asked to fill potholes by October 15.The state has been receiving flak for the poor condition of the highways including in Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur, Nashik among other cities. Last week, the Bombay high court had pulled up the government over potholes on the Mumbai-Nashik highway. The court also directed the Centre and state governments to address the issue of potholes on highways.State public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan said, “There has been a lot of rainfall, especially over the past few days, therefore the condition of roads has suffered. The chief minister will chair a meeting tomorrow [Wednesday] on the situation of all highways in the state — both national and state.” Senior state government officials said that the condition of the roads has been severely damaged due to heavy rainfall over the past few weeks in parts of the state. The official added that directions have been issued to devise a master plan to take immediate action in the case of damage to the highways. A cabinet minister, who spoke requesting anonymity said that most ministers expressed the need for fixing responsibility on the engineers on the condition of the roads and must immediately fill up the potholes on major highways. “Several highways have developed potholes on patches stretching kilometres. This leads to traffic snarls on the highway. Each year, such situation arise and therefore responsibility must be fixed on agencies and engineers,” the minister said.Another cabinet minister said that the issue of multiple agencies handling the maintenance of highways is also an issue. “There are many bodies like National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), PWD, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation that construct and maintain highways across the state. Possibly poor quality of material coupled with heavy rains has caused potholes. The potholes have to be fixed by mid-October,” he said requesting anonymity. Ministers also said that the state is also being wrongly blamed for the bad condition of highways that are not under the state government for maintenance, such as the Mumbai-Goa highway, which is handled by NHAI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/potholes-on-highways-maharashtra-cabinet-discusses-issue-cm-may-direct-officials-to-fill-potholes-by-oct-15-101632845640461.html

Till 5:30 pm, Kolkata and its adjoining areas such as Dum Dum and Salt Lake received very light rain. Kolkata received 1.8mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours.“Even though a low-pressure system is common during the monsoon, the district administrations, particularly in the coastal areas and a few other districts, swung into action as large areas are still inundated because of last week’s heavy rain. It was the heaviest rain in September in one day in Kolkata for 14 years. More rains could aggravate matters,” said a senior official of the state’s disaster management department. West Bengal didn’t have to bear the direct brunt of cyclone Gulab which hit Andhra Pradesh on September 26. The IMD however had predicted that a cyclone circulation would develop over the sea around September 27 which could trigger a low-pressure system. The low-pressure system would bring heavy to very heavy rain in south Bengal. “There could be water logging in low lying areas, damage to standing crops and mud houses and lightning. People have been advised to stay indoors and avoid waterlogged areas and dilapidated houses,” the IMD official said. The Bhawanipore by-election, from where Mamata Banerjee is contesting to retain her chief ministership, is scheduled on September 30. There is, however, no warning of heavy rain on that day in Kolkata. Over the past one week, some districts received more than three times excess rain over the climatic normal. More than a dozen were killed due to electrocution in water-logged areas in various districts. At least 120,000 people had to be evacuated from two districts. The Kolkata Police have set up a unified command centre at its headquarters. Officials from the fire brigade, public works department, power supply corporation, city’s civic body and police would remain stationed at the centre. At least 22 teams have been formed. Officials said that special care is being taken for Bhabanipur in south Kolkata to avoid any waterlogging. “Heavy rains are expected. But even then I would request you to go to the booth with an umbrella and wearing a mask to cast your vote. Don’t waste a single vote,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/imd-issues-red-alert-for-heavy-rains-in-south-bengal-35-000-evacuated-101632843481305.html

The transport fraternity is under acute stress and the rising diesel prices have only been adding to it,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Congress (AIMTC).In Mumbai’s neighbouring Thane, one litre of petrol was priced at ₹107.60 while a litre of diesel was priced at ₹97.34.Petrol crossed ₹100 per litre mark in the city on May 29 and has since then been on a rise in Mumbai. Fuel prices in the city have been on an increase since May 3.Earlier on September 1, fuel prices had dropped in the city. One litre of petrol was priced at ₹107.39 and a litre of diesel was available in the city at ₹96.33.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fuel-prices-hike-in-mumbai-diesel-at-97-21-a-litre-petrol-at-10747-101632842099298.html
28-09-2021||Mumbai||Yes Bank case: Bombay high court rejects bail pleas of Rana Kapoor’s wife, daughters||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday rejected bail applications of Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor’s wife Bindu, daughters Radha and Roshini and the then business head of the private bank, Rajiv Anand.“In the instant case, it is apparent that all the applicants are alleged to have indulged in the commission of offences, which have resulted in the serious dent to the financial health of the state as well as defrauding the public at large,” said single judge bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while rejecting the four bail applications.“Such offences are occurring in plenty and have resulted in the stultifying overall growth of the nation and also have caused tremendous impairment to the economy of the nation. These crimes are more heinous in nature as they intend to destroy the economic fabric and financial edifice of the state,” the high court said.Bindu Kapoor and her daughters were remanded to judicial custody when they appeared before the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on September 18. The special court had rejected their bail pleas and sent them to jail. Similarly, Anand was taken into custody and sent to jail on September 20.All of them had then moved the high court for bail, contending that though the CBI did not find it necessary to arrest any of them for completing its investigation, the special court rejected their bail pleas when they formally appeared before the court, after filing of the charge-sheet. It was argued on their behalf that grant of bail in such matters is a mere formality and the special CBI court had erred in rejecting their bail applications and taking them in custody.HC, however, rejected the argument. Justice Dangre said there was nothing in the Code of Criminal Procedure to indicate that the grant of bail post-charge-sheet is a formality. On the contrary, the bench said, the court is bound to take into consideration the entire material brought on record on the filing of the charge sheet.Justice Dangre said it is only upon the presentation of the charge sheet, when full material is compiled together, the gravity of the offence and the possibility of conviction could be judged on the basis of the material coming before the court in a crystallised form, which perhaps prompted the Special court to reject the bail, applications.“Dispensation of arrest at the stage of investigation need not continue throughout and in particular, when the offence made out against the Applicants has clearly emerged in the charge-sheet as a grave economic offence and the witnesses who will participate in the trial apparently surfacing, the Applicants do not deserve their release on bail,” said HC. The economic offences wing of the CBI has on March 7, 2020, registered an FIR against M/s. Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL), M/s. DOIT Urban Venture (India) Private Limited (“DOIT”) and some other entities, their directors and promoters and has named Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor as the prime accused.The central agency alleged that Yes Bank had invested ₹3,700 crore in short term non-convertible debenture of DHFL between April and June 2018. Kapoor allegedly received ₹600 crore as kickbacks from DHFL in terms of loan advanced to two firms, DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited and Morgan Credits Private Limited. Rana Kapoor’s three daughters hold 100℅ stakes in DOIT, whereas Morgan Credits is controlled by his wife.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/yes-bank-case-bombay-high-court-rejects-bail-pleas-of-rana-kapoor-s-wife-daughters-101632841979247.html

28-09-2021||Mumbai||Eligible adult population to be fully vaccinated by Feb 2022, first dose to all in Mumbai by Diwali: BMC||Going by the current pace, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) expects the entire eligible adult population of 9.2 million in Mumbai is likely to get fully vaccinated by February 2022. The BMC anticipates that by Diwali, in the first week of November, the entire eligible population in the city would have got at least their first dose. Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force has meanwhile suggested that citizens might have to continue wearing masks till the end of 2022. Currently, 85% of the eligible population has got their first dose of the vaccine. According to BMC officials, the entire population will be vaccinated by February 2022, provided the vaccine supply remains the same as that in September. Also, the BMC anticipates that of the total vaccinated, 20% is the floating population of those who work in Mumbai but reside outside. Similarly, the BMC anticipates that hundreds of citizens who are residents of Mumbai have also got their vaccination outside Mumbai. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We hope that all eligible adult citizens will get their first dose of vaccine by October-end, and both doses by say February. We have to consider the 84-day gap after the first dose. These calculations are valid if we have proper supply, which currently does not look like a problem. However, the vaccination drive will continue even after February 2022, as the scope might widen with vaccination for children below 18 years of age.” According to BMC data, the supply of vaccine has been the best till now in September 2021, ever since the vaccination drive kicked off in January 2021. From getting vaccine doses supply between 0.5-1 million doses on a monthly basis, the BMC anticipates that the vaccine supply will go up till 1.5 million by the end of September. Mumbai crossed 10 million vaccinations in the first week of September. As of September 22, 2021, 85% of the total target population have got at least first dose and 40% of the citizens are fully vaccinated. In terms of age-wise vaccination ratio, the highest target of fully vaccinated has been achieved is in the age group of 45-59, in which 59% target is achieved, followed by 55% in senior citizens above 60 years of age. Further, a 23% target is achieved in the 18-45 age group. The data reveals that 52% of the total healthcare workers and 57% frontline workers have been fully vaccinated. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of state taskforce, said, “We have vaccinated a substantial number of the population, and we still have to vaccinate the remaining beneficiaries. We do not have to let down our guard and have to continuously keep wearing masks. Also, I feel by the time we will fully vaccinate all our citizens for both doses, there will be time for a booster dose. Hence, I feel citizens will have to continue wearing masks till the end of 2022 at least for now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eligible-adult-population-to-be-fully-vaccinated-by-feb-2022-first-dose-to-all-in-mumbai-by-diwali-bmc-101632837839137.html
28-09-2021||Other||‘IAS officers involved in PDS scam should be removed’: Raman Singh||Former Chhattisgarh chief minster and national vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Raman Singh alleged that Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress government is trying to save two Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers in multi-crore Public Distribution System (PDS) scam by weakening. Singh demanded their removal from current positions till the case is in court.Singh’s comments came during a press conference. He was referring to a news report published on Tuesday which claimed that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) informed the Supreme Court through an affidavit that Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, some members of the special investigating team investigating the PDS scam and a top law officer are allegedly trying to weaken the case against the two IAS officers involved in the PDS scam.The two officers are former managing director of Nangrik Apurti Nigam (NAN) Anil Kumar Tujeja and former chairman Alok Shukla. “It is very clear that the Congress government made several mistakes in the entire case. Congress government ordered a fresh SIT probe in the case where a chargesheet was already filed. They were also reports of pressuring investigation officer to bring in light new evidence. The officers (two IAS) for whom Congress wrote a letter to the Prime Minister demanding strict action on them so much so as asking that these officers should be put in jail… But now when they are in power, they are weakening their cases and did nothing against them,” said Raman Singh citing the media report.“We demand that both the officers in question should be removed from their position and the government should stop interfering in the cases that are in Chhattisgarh high court,” said Singh.On the other hand, Congress claimed that the Central government is misusing central agencies for political purposes and the allegations against the state agencies are politically motivated.“This is a clear misuse of central agencies by the Union government... They are using the ED for political purposes in a Congress-run state. Secondly, as far as Raman Singh is concerned, he is the one who weakened the investigation of the NAN scam... Raman Singh should first answer who was ‘CM madam’ in the dairy found during the PDS scam. The central government had approved the prosecution of these two officers in 2016, what were the reasons for him to wait for two years till 2018 when they were charge-sheeted?” said Shailesh Nitin Trivedi, Congress’s state communication head. Nan scam came into light in 2014 when the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) conducted raids in various parts of the state and seized cash and documents. The ACB also recovered coded diary entries of pay-offs to officials and politicians. Then in opposition, the Congress party claimed that the scam is about ₹36,000 crore and further alleged the involvement of BJP leaders. In 2015, a PIL was filed by Sudeep Shrivastava in Chhattisgarh high court demanding an SIT investigation in the case. Shrivastava in his PIL alleged the investigating agency saved few officers who were involved in the scam. The PIL which was filed by Shrivastava stated that 111 samples of 254 samples of rice and out of 185 samples of salt 64 samples were found to be sub-standard and unfit for human consumption but were cleared by officers.“The mega PDS scam has deep roots in Chhattisgarh. The so-called welfare scheme to provide cheap rice has been envisaged in a manner to have enough cushions for corruption. In September 2013, the total number of below poverty line (BPL) ration cards was 70.67 lakh against 56.11 of total families as per the 2011 census. Moreover, the iodized salt supplied under PDS was found unfit for human consumption risking the lives of innocent people. During the rule of Raman Singh, the ACB ensured that investigation doesn’t reach the CM and ministers despite clear evidence of money trail, now in Bhupesh-regime, the ACB tries to save these charge-sheeted IAS officers,” said Shrivastava, a lawyer and activist who filed a PIL in this case, adding that it is an irony that Chhattisgarh high court, in last 6 years, could not decide PILs seeking an independent court-monitored probe into this huge scam.Shrivastava further said that the empathy of the Congress regime to these two officers is beyond understanding considering the fact that one of them, Shukla, got retired in July 2020 but the cabinet appointed him on a contractual basis for three more years on the same day despite the corruption charge-sheet against him. Shukla, refused to comment over the current development and the transcript submitted by the ED.Meanwhile, a senior ACB officer commenting over the transcript said that the said transcript was based on a seizure of the IT department raid in 2020. “Since then, everything in ACB and EOW has changed. Now, new men are leading the state agencies,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ias-officers-involved-in-pds-scam-should-be-removed-raman-singh-101632837658443.html
28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Paying homage to my first and last companion in life’s journey||If our birth is deemed as the fountainhead of a mountain, death an ocean, then our life would be akin to a river constantly flowing down the ‘age’ at a constant ‘time’ and speed. Most of the water in my case has already flowed under the bridge, irreversibly like time. However, imagination allows me to scan the whole gamut of childhood, adulthood and retired life at my leisure to recall scores of people who bumped into me in the rites of passage for a particular time only to get replaced by new ones at regular intervals. Call it a sheer twist of good fortune, or my destiny, the first person in my life has ironically been the ‘last’ one who has continued staying with me selflessly under all conditions thus far; spanning decades as the rest of the faces around kept changing over time. The quantum of effort she’d put in through the ages to ensure her son’s life remained in poise during all his ups and downs is writ large upon her sagging anatomy, conspicuously marked with her deeply wrinkled face, baggy eyes and veined hands. That priceless companion is none other than my octogenarian mother. One memory is too vivid worth declaring the moment of yesterday; when having got my first job at a meagre salary in a textile factory in Ludhiana, I’d lifted her in my arms spinning round and round in unchecked alacrity. Sitting next to me looking ever so sprightly, she bubbled with unbridled cheerfulness observing my celebratory wedding as I put offerings into the sacred fire unmindful of the real, insidious and volatile designs of the ‘time’. Years later, when I was setting fire to my wife’s pyre, she was still standing by my side though in a starkly contrasting mood. Not only had my joyous mother wiped my tears when I was a newly ‘born’ baby, but she did the same when I was a newly ‘dead’ adult. Her strengthening presence served as a reminder to a gospel truth that if a wife is the better half, who else could be one’s best half apart from mother. Privy to my innermost thoughts, she took it upon herself to buffer my delicate predicament as having had my own mother alive at my side I was futilely making endeavours to placate the pangs of my children longing for their departed mother. My struggle in vain to come to terms with the sudden loss of my spouse at times turned into frustration and anger that she went on absorbing like sponge to water. If my wholesome identity in my mother’s presence had not perpetually interpreted ‘double’, the double whammy of losing my wife and then my younger brother within a short span would have crushed me to unspeakable, unbearable, and irreparable proportions. Holding a pen to channel my pent-up emotions, I often tend to visualise many wayward and wild things, but immediately rein in my mind daring to imagine how my life might have read without her. Many people will come and go, but mother tends to stay with us right from the time we open our eyes until we close them forever before her, or when she breathes her last. My silent wish goes one way; may my case fall in the former category for, I’ve honestly run out of the willpower to afford losing her to the deadly claws of time after losing my dear ones for, she’s indeed been the ‘dearest’ to me in no uncertain terms. ak.bhardwaj3103@gmail.com The writer is a Mukerian-based retired headmaster||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paying-homage-to-my-first-and-last-companion-in-life-s-journey-101632837179149.html

28-09-2021||Lucknow||Yogi distributes 1.23 lakh smartphones among anganwadi workers||LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath showered praise on anganwadi workers for their contribution to Covid control efforts in UP and distributed 1.23 lakh smartphones to 1.23 lakh anganwadi workers during a programme to promote nutrition among women and children in the state capital on Tuesday. Under Nutrition Campaign, he also gave away 1.87 lakh newborn growth monitoring devices (infantometers) to the anganwadi workers for health testing of children. Now, these workers will be digitally enabled to perform their task.“During the peak of the pandemic, anganwadi workers went from house to house. They provided medicine kits to every patient, checked who is having flu-like symptoms, who is suffering from cough, cold and fever. They prepared a list of such patients and gave it to the district headquarters by evening. This way, Uttar Pradesh created a new model by controlling Covid through field workers. This also sends a message to others that by doing collective work, we can easily deal with any major challenge, said Yogi Adityanath while addressing anganwadi workers.The CM said institutions/departments/individuals could do any propaganda about themselves, but their real work was tested in times of calamity or adverse situations. “UP has passed all tests with flying colours, because of such a strong workforce. Covid was all over the world, but the eyes of the country’s media were on Uttar Pradesh, because they had some expectations from the state,” he added.Yogi Adityanath also indicated a wage hike for anganwadi workers but stopped short of any announcement in this regard.“Technology not only makes our work easier, but is also transparent and brings added responsibility. It makes us skilled in the field besides earning respect. He said today the perception of people about UP has changed. Every department has done something new and good. Remember what the situation was four and a half years back. Now, the state of affairs has changed and the respect and honour of anganwadi workers has increased during our government,” said Yogi.On September 7, governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath had inaugurated 529 new anganwadi centres, constructed at a cost of Rs. 4,142 lakh, in 24 districts of the state, and appointment letters were distributed among 91 newly-selected child development project officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-distributes-1-23-lakh-smartphones-among-anganwadi-workers-101632833218786.html

28-09-2021||Patna||‘Coming with a mission’: Kanhaiya Kumar entry raises hopes in Bihar Congress||PATNA: Former president of Jawaharlal University Students’ Union (JNUSU) Kanhaiya Kumar’s induction in the Congress could improve the party’s ability to revive its roots in Bihar and beyond but its ally Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) may not be comfortable at the entry of the high-profile leader, Congress leaders and political analysts said.Kanhaiya Kumar, who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Begusarai as the Communist Party of India (CPI) candidate, along with Gujarat’s youth Dalit icon and MLA Jignesh Mevani joined the Congress in the presence of party leader Rahul Gandhi. To be sure, Mevani said he hadn't formally joined the party due to a technical hitch - he will lose his membership to the Gujarat assembly if he does - but will contest the state elections on a Congress ticket.The two inductions are broadly seen as part of a continuing effort by Congress to expand its diminished support base. It was in this context that the Congress last week opted for S Charanjit Singh Channi as Punjab Punjab chief minister. “Elevation of S Charanjit Singh Channi as the chief minister of Punjab would give a fresh fillip to the party in the state owing to the caste factor,” said former Patna University professor and political observer Nawal Kishore Chaudhary.Congress MLA from Kadwa and JNU alumnus Shakeel Ahmad Khan said the Congress was certain to harness Kanhaiya Kumar’s mass appeal. “This will make other senior leaders to rejuvenate their ties with the people, or face the risk of being marginalised. Kanhiaya is coming with a mission,” said Khan after his conversation with the former JNUSU leader.Some Congress leaders how Kanhaiya Kumar, whose arrest as a JNUSU president in a sedition case in 2016 put him at the centre of a nationwide debate on free speech, would start in his new role with some distinct advantages. Apart from his background, said a former Bihar Congress vice president, “he will enjoy the freedom to work as he would have access to party seniors such as Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi”. He hoped tht the Congress leader’s bid to connect to the masses would make others to fall in line.Some RJD leaders insisted that they weren’t worried about the Congress’ new find. But there were others who acknowledged that if the Congress and Kanhaiya Kumar come anywhere close to expanding the party base in Bihar, it would enhance the Congress’ bargaining power in the coalition and give some competition to the opposition camp’s most prominent face, Tejashwi Yadav.Senior RJD leader Alok Mehta, however, brushed aside such concerns. “He was part of the alliance in 2020 elections and will remain so,” Mehta said, confident that his switch from the CPI to the Congress not alter the ground realities. It will not be a challenge for the RJD’s leadership of the opposition’s grand alliance, he added.Chaudhary contended that how things play out in the field would depend on Kanhaiya Kumar’s role and authority in the party, and if Kanhaiya is really given the chance to rebuild the party’s base in Bihar and make the best of his clean image, dynamic leadership and charismatic appeal among the youth across caste barriers.“The Congress’s pro-poor and secular image, which suffered badly over the years due to liberalisation and its previous pursuit towards soft-hindutva, could be restored if Kanhaiya delivers,” said Chaudhary, adding that the RJD might not face any immediate challenge from Kanhaiya Kumar’s increased engagement with the Congress.Anand Madhab, chairman of the research department of BPCC, said that Kanhaiya Kumar is a brand and a very analytical person. “He talks with facts and a very good soldier. The entire Congress is happy,” said Madhab, convinced that the party was likely to deploy the young leader in and outside Bihar.Chief spokesman of the BPCC Rajesh Rathore said that Congress would be strengthened by his entry. “He is young and together with Tejashwi, he will strengthen the Grand Alliance,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/coming-with-a-mission-kanhaiya-kumar-entry-raises-hopes-in-bihar-congress-101632832258758.html

28-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra ATS again takes custody of 2 terror suspects arrested a week back||The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has again taken custody of the two terror suspects arrested a week back. A special court on Tuesday remanded Zakir Hussain Shaikh and Rizwan Momin to ATS custody till October 4.The ATS arrested Shaikh on September 18 while Momin was arrested from his Mumbra home on September 19. Both have been booked under sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967.Initially, both were remanded in police custody. Subsequently, they were produced in court after their initial remand ended on September 20, and on ATS’ request, they were sent to judicial custody for 14 days. On September 24, ATS filed an application in session court to get their police custody again. During the course of the hearing on the plea on Monday, the ATS informed the court that they have got sufficient evidence to interrogate and confront the accused. “We have scrutinised call data records of Shaikh and Momin and other documents seized during the raid at their residences in Jogeshwari and Mumbra respectively. We have learnt that few more people were in touch with them and the agency has been looking for them,” said an ATS officer.The ATS has also been looking for one Fazlu Rehman Ubedu Rehman Khan alias Mujju, a resident of Kurla (West), as he was also in touch with Shaikh and Momin and allegedly associated with the Dawood Ibrahim gang or the D company.Khan, police officers said, was arrested by the anti-extortion cell of the Mumbai crime branch in November last year for allegedly conspiring to kill a south Mumbai-based businessman at the behest of Fahim Machmach. Fahim, a close associate of Dawood’s younger brother Anees, is believed to have died in Pakistan last month. The officer said after Fahim’s death, all his associates in Mumbai were in direct touch with Anees Ibrahim and Khan was one of them. “Khan has switched off his phone and has fled from Mumbai. The ATS and the crime branch have been looking for him,” said a senior Mumbai police officer.Shaikh and Momin were arrested after the terror module was busted and Jaan Mohammad Shaikh alias Sameer Kaliya, along with five other suspects were arrested by Delhi Police’s special cell from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan on September 14. Shaikh got scared then fled his Jogeshwari house to Mumbra and stayed two days with Rizwan Momin, 40, in his residence in Kausa, Mumbra. Both were arrested for suspected criminal conspiracy and committing terror acts. Momin was aware of the terror plan, destroyed Shaikh’s phone and threw it in the drain. The ATS has recovered it, added the officer.ATS, in a statement, said that Zakir Shaikh was allegedly acting as per instructions of his foreign handler, Anthony aka Anwar aka Anas, but the agency has not revealed what the conspiracy was all about.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ats-again-takes-custody-of-2-terror-suspects-arrested-a-week-back-101632831540427.html

But there was one senior party leader – his predecessor Sunil Jakhar – who had a strong inkling that this was coming. Jakhar had, in a chat with this reporter on Monday, predicted this, stating that seeing the way things are developing and knowing his temperament, Sidhu will leave before the elections roll out. Also read: Five possible reasons why Navjot Singh Sidhu may have quitJakhar, known for his strong political instincts, made the prediction when asked about former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s statement that he (former CM) will field a strong candidate to oppose Sidhu in the assembly elections in 2022. The cricketer-turned-politician, handpicked by former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra despite Capt Amarinder’s strong opposition to his elevation, sent his shock resignation from his post to the Congress president within 24 hours. Sidhu, who took over as the president of the faction-ridden state unit on July 23, posted his resignation on Twitter even as Sonia and Rahul, who were holidaying in Shimla, boarded a flight from Chandigarh to Delhi. Jakhar, a Hindu face, had made way for Sidhu’s elevation and was a frontrunner for the chief minister’s post with Rahul’s backing after Capt Amarinder resigned following months of internal strife in the state unit. His name was more or less final at one stage, but a section of the party leaders, including Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Ambika Soni and some MLAs, pressed for a Sikh CM. The assembly elections in Punjab are less than five months away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sunil-jakhar-the-oracle-who-predicted-sidhu-s-early-exit-101632830938640.html

Sinha made the announcement after laying the foundation stone for four national highway projects worth ₹3,612 crore in Jammu and Kashmir, including the Srinagar Ring Road project. Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari was also present at the function on Monday evening. “By December 2022, Kashmir will be connected to Kanyakumari by train. Besides, the national highway projects will catalyse the overall socio-economic development of the Union Territory,” Sinha said. Strengthening road infrastructure The projects include strengthening and upgrading 43km of existing carriageway on the Baramulla-Gulmarg section of National Highway-701A; the construction of a new double lane bypass from Donipawa via Ashajipora connecting NH-244 and NH-44; the construction and upgrade of a 28km stretch from Vailoo to Donipawa on the Khellani-Khanabal section of NH-244, besides the construction of the much-awaited Ring Road around Srinagar city. The lieutenant governor said that from national highways to rural roads, the infrastructure in the UT had become stronger than ever. “Till 2014, there were only seven national highways in erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir, including Ladakh. In 2021, the number of national highways has increased to 11 in J&K alone. In 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced road infra projects worth ₹40,900 crore for J&K, out of which work on projects of about ₹38,000 crore is underway,” he said. 11 tunnel projects approved for J&K He said that Jammu and Kashmir today has the distinction of being the third UT in the country in terms of road construction. Sinha said that with liberal funding and special interest of the Prime Minister and the Union minister for road transport and highways in the development of Jammu and Kashmir, 11 tunnel projects have been approved for J&K in one year alone. “Four tunnels will be built on the Chenani-Kishtwar highway at a cost of ₹10,000 crore. To modernise the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, tunnels at a cost of ₹4,000 crore, besides five flyovers worth ₹3,000 crore will be built in J&K, reducing the travel time and traffic congestion substantially,” he said. Road connectivity key driver of growth Gadkari termed road connectivity as a key driver of socio-economic growth and development of any region. “The new projects will further strengthen the road connectivity in J&K, opening up new livelihood avenues for the local population, enhancing tourism and business activities besides improving the quality of life of the people,” he said. Gadkari said it’s his endeavour is to decrease the time travel between major cities. “Be it Delhi-Jammu or Jammu-Srinagar, the time to travel will get reduced to half by providing expressways and better road connectivity. Mega highways and tunnel projects will reduce the travel time from Delhi to Kashmir by eight hours in the coming years,” he said. The Union minister said that the long-pending Srinagar Ring Road project will be ready by 2023-end. Work on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway will be completed in three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kashmir-will-be-connected-with-kanyakumari-by-train-by-december-2022-lg-sinha-101632830521483.html

Passing a ball of string, each participant in turn talks about how the element they represent is connected to another. The web that results shows how nature has complex interconnections which we often don’t realise.The presence of natural ecosystems in a city makes the urban landscape more liveable. Hillslopes that are vegetated and undisturbed help percolate rainwater, have lesser erosion, and regulate the micro-climate. They act as sinks for pollutants and bringing these substances back into natural cycles.Earlier, biodiversity studies in Pune have shown the connection of these natural areas to the cityscape. Bats and birds that help control insect populations in the city need the natural habitats on the hills, streams, and riverbanks to nest, roost and breed undisturbed. Beehives in these natural areas, and butterflies that begin life on host plants there, also help in the pollination of plants in city gardens. Dr Swati Gole, director of Pune’s Ecological Society says “Hill ranges, rivers with their riparian vegetation, roadside trees, hedge-rows support not only biodiversity movement but also the flows of energy and water through the city ecosystems. Landscape ecology is a relatively new science, but such landscape facets must be considered while making the city’s development plans.” “Natural geomorphic, soil, hydrologic and biological processes such as the growth of various kinds of vegetation, population dynamics of birds, small animals, insects are closely linked to the landscape mosaic. Human activities almost always interact with natural processes to produce new landscape mosaic patterns. Natural vegetated grassy, shrubby, woodland, riparian ‘patches’ of appropriate size and numbers are necessary so that they are connected and have adequate and sustained functioning of biological processes without human inputs”. When we simplify the ecosystem by removing native plant species, converting forests or grasslands into parks and gardens, excavating soil, and making roads, we unravel the web of life. Since the city is already extensively covered with buildings and roads, the last remaining natural areas become more precious. It’s important to understand that these natural areas provide us benefits other than recreation.Needed - plan for biodiversity conservation These recent protests underline the need for a well-thought-out biodiversity action plan for Pune. Eminent biodiversity expert Dr Erach Bharucha says, “Ideally, policymakers and the public in Pune should deliberate on how we can conserve biodiversity, considering our own needs and values, and studies, good practices, and policy guidance available.”Other cities in India are already doing so. Kudos to Pimpri-Chinchwad for developing its Biodiversity report recently. Kochi in Kerala has gone a step further and prepared a local biodiversity strategy and action plan. These cities have used the City Biodiversity Index framework to prepare the biodiversity status report. Under this framework, cities are expected to promote natural biodiversity and allocate budgets for conservation, learning and management. Protecting remnant natural areas in cities can mean, for example, preventing the destruction of the habitat due to quarrying, buildings, and hard paved roads, preventing littering, reducing bright lights and sounds at night-time that disturb wildlife, removing, and controlling alien invasive species (like Lantana). We can try to infuse biodiversity into built-up spaces through roadside plantations, public parks, and home gardens. Let’s bring nature closer to people, rather than converting the last remaining natural areas into built spaces for increased crowds.Pune had set up a Biodiversity Management Committee. Indeed, public deliberations would not only help us make a biodiversity action plan but also raise our collective understanding and commitment to conservation. Such understanding is essential for cities to address the climate and ecological crises we now face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-why-pune-s-biodiversity-strategy-is-no-walk-in-the-park-101632828179925.html
28-09-2021||Patna||‘Congress’ assertiveness and focus on Bihar reflects through Kanhaiya’: Experts||Kanhaiya Kumar’s entry into the Congress is mostly being viewed as an attempt to resurrect the party in a state where it has struggled for over three decades and mostly rode piggyback on the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). But there is more to it.The way Bihar politics is evolving, youth may end up in the drivers’ seats to script a new trend in tune with the state’s predominantly young population. With almost 58% of the Bihar population below 25 years of age, the highest in the country, it could be a potent force cutting across caste and creed if properly channelised.Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, 31, and Chirag Paswan, 38, are already in the political ring and now with the entry of Kanhaiya Kumar, 34, the battle may be truly on. Only time will tell if all the three could come on one platform, but even if they don’t, all three have shown their penchant for connecting with the state’s youth with their powerful oratory skills and talking in their language.As per the 2011 census, Bihar’s population was 10.40 crore with a density of 1106, which is projected to go up significantly in the coming census. With nearly 57.4% of the population below 25 years of age, the youth will certainly be in a position to tilt the election in any favour. The youth population includes 57.9% of women.This makes Kanhaiya’s entry into the Congress fold a significant development. Along with Tejashwi and Chirag, the youth may have plenty of voices to identify with to strengthen the anti-BJP opposition.“It is a timely move both on part of the Congress as well as Kanhaiya. If the CPI is also toeing the line of the Congress, Kanhaiya thought it wise to directly enter the party. CPI should also not have any reason to complain. On part of the Congress, it is a sign of the assertiveness of its new leadership at the Centre which it demonstrated even in Punjab and now taking it further. It is a fact that Bihar Congress remained with leadership vacuum for far too long and the party decided to project Kanhaiya, who could ask for a due share in the anti-NDA front and compete even within the non-BJP opposition, which, too, has tough competition to occupy the front space in Bihar,” said social analyst Professor Nawal Kishore Choudhary.He said that the Congress, having none to fill the void in Bihar from amongst the state leaders, while the RJD and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) enjoyed dynastic leadership change, has gone with Kanhaiya in the hope of capturing the imagination of the enormous youth power in the state with a generational shift. “This demonstrates new strategy on part of the Congress leadership with an eye on future, which is very important and may augur well, for both Janata Dal-United (JDU) and the BJP seem to lack young and dynamic leadership for future at the state level not only in Bihar, but in other states also. Kanhaiya also gets a larger platform to deliver,” he added.Former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies, DM Diwakar, too, viewed it as a pro-active step of the Congress to cash in on the opportunity in the form of Kanhaiya to take on the BJP and at the same time have a voice in the non-BJP opposition. “For Kanhaiya, his rise is attributed to the CPI and so his switchover may put him in the same bracket of leaders who look for political opportunism, but for the Congress, it is an indication of its willingness to change and bring competent leaders to its fold. Both BJP and the JD-U don’t seem to have young leadership at present and so it is to the credit of the Congress to realise its limitations in Bihar and bring Kanhaiya to its fold. It shows that the Congress is getting decisively active ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha elections,” he added.BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said that projecting hired or dynastic leaders would not serve many purposes for the Congress. “BJP has already gone in for a generational shift at the organisational level and the process started ahead of 2019 elections and has yielded good leadership at the mandal and district level. It will gradually find its place at the higher level. Even in ticket distribution, the youth got preference. In the mandals, the average age of chiefs is less than 40 years,” he added.JD-U spokesman Neeraj Kumar said the youth of Bihar would never go by rhetoric, rather by what they have experienced during the Nitish Kumar regime in the form of youth-centric schemes and incentives. “The line Nitish Kumar has drawn will be tough for anyone to match, as he believes in delivery. Be it a large number of engineering and medical colleges, polytechnic, incentives for girls, allowances for competitive exams and many others, they are all meant for youth only and the people know it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/congress-assertiveness-and-focus-on-bihar-reflects-through-kanhaiya-experts-101632826877168.html

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Five possible reasons why Navjot Singh Sidhu may have quit||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu’s surprise resignation on Tuesday, less than five weeks after he took over the reins of the faction-torn state unit, was the culmination of a series of behind-the-scenes events that left him peeved since the resignation of bête noire, Captain Amarinder Singh, as the chief minister. HT looks at possible reasons why cricketer-turned-politician may have called it quits:-- Though the Congress leadership endorsed Sidhu’s choice of Charanjit Singh Channi as Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister, it nixed his opposition to the appointment of Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, a prominent Jat Sikh face, as deputy chief minister.-- Sidhu, also a Jat Sikh, is believed to have viewed Randhawa’s elevation as a threat to his chief ministerial ambitions after the 2022 assembly polls.-- He is believed to have been miffed at being overruled on Randhawa who had made a common cause with him in the rebellion against Amarinder Singh.-- Sidhu is seen to have been riled over a limited say in the formation of the 15-minister cabinet last Sunday. The cabinet had a stamp of Rahul Gandhi who did not go by Sidhu’s bidding for ministerial berths for his loyalists Kuljit Singh Nagra and Surjit Singh Dhiman.Also read: Navjot Singh Sidhu resigns as Punjab Congress chief-- What is believed to have added insult to Sidhu’s injury was the return of Rana Gurjit Singh, a sugar baron from Kapurthala, to the cabinet four years after he quit the Amarinder Singh-led ministry over allegations of involvement in a sand auction scam. Sidhu opposed Rana’s comeback, but the high command overlooked his objections and that of eight party lawmakers from the Doaba region.-- Sidhu is believed to have also been miffed over Channi’s assertion, with the high command’s backing, in the allocation of ministerial portfolios. On Sunday, Channi gave the powerful home department to Randhawa.-- What is seen to have been the last straw was Channi ignoring Sidhu’s recommendations for the appointment of Siddhartha Chattopadhyay as director general of police and DS Patwalia as advocate general.-- Channi, in a move seen to be an attempt to shake off the perception about Sidhu calling the shots in his government, went ahead with his own choices, appointing Iqbal Preet Singh Sihota and APS Deol for top police and law office posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/five-reasons-why-navjot-singh-sidhu-called-it-quits-101632826798098.html

Several sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) relating to unlawful assembly, rioting with arms and weapons, voluntarily causing hurt and criminal intimidation have been invoked in the FIR filed at Bhawanipore police station, he said.Ghosh was Monday pushed and heckled by alleged TMC supporters in the Bhabanipur assembly constituency, where West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is in the fray, provoking his security officer to whip out a pistol, as political temperature shot up on the last day of electioneering. National TV channels showed Ghosh being pushed and heckled on a road as a posse of security guards tried to shield him. A suspected TMC supporter was seen grabbing a security man by his collar who swiftly pulled out a pistol to scare away the crowd.The incident occurred when Ghosh had gone inside a vaccination camp in the Jadubabur Bazaar area in the constituency, where the by-poll will be held on September 30. Ghosh, who was whisked away by his security guards, had alleged TMC supporters "attacked" him without provocation and injured a BJP activist. He had also demanded deferment of the by-poll which Mamata Banerjee must win to stay on as the chief minister.Under the constitutional arrangement, Banerjee can continue as the chief minister only till November 5 without getting elected to the state assembly. She was defeated in Nandigram in the state assembly elections held in March-April this year. A BJP delegation is scheduled to meet Election Commission officials in New Delhi later on Tuesday to register a complaint about the incident involving Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-police-to-probe-alleged-assault-on-bjp-s-dilip-ghosh-fir-lodged-101632816371878.html

The Congress is considering fielding former Congress member of Parlaiament Pratibha Singh, who is the wife of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, from the Mandi seat even as the BJP has kept its cards close to its chest. The Arki assembly byelection was necessitated after the death of sitting MLA and six-time chief minister Virbhadra Singh on July 8.

Bragta’s son Chetan is tipped to be the BJP’s choice for Jubbal-Kotkhai as the party tries to cash in on sympathy votes though there are a few other party leaders vying for the ticket. For the Congress, Rohit Thakur, a former chief parliamentary secretary, is the obvious choice. In the politically significant Kangra district, Pathania’s son Bhawani Singh Pathania has staked claim to the Congress ticket from Fatehpur. Bhawani Singh quit a career in the banking and insurance sectors to take the political plunge. He has already launched his poll campaign.

The curriculum is being rolled out in every class – from nursery to class 12 – across all public schools in the national capital on September 28 to mark the occasion of the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh. Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi, is expected to launch the deshbhakti curriculum at an event in Chhatrasal Stadium.Also Read | Deshbhakti curriculum in Delhi schools from today: All you need to knowThe deshbhakti curriculum mandates one period every day for patriotism studies for students in the nursery to class 8, and two classes per week – not on consequent days – for senior students of classes 9 to 12. According to a circular released last week by the directorate of education (DoE), “Every deshbhakti period shall start with a five-minute ‘Deshbhakti Dhyaan’, where the teacher and students shall practice mindfulness, reflect on their gratitude for the country, freedom fighters, and any five persons that they consider deshbhakts, and pledge their respect for the country.”Delhi chief minister Kejriwal earlier said that the deshbhakti curriculum will not be based on rote learning and there will be no tests. “It will be activity-based and students will be told stories about independence and the nation's pride,” he said. “Children will be made to realise their responsibilities and duties towards the country.”Kejriwal added, “They (the students) will be prepared to fulfil their responsibilities and contribute towards the nation's progress. They will also be prepared in a way that if the need arises, they can lay down their lives for the nation and be willing to give their all to the country.”Also Read | Deshbhakti curriculum will be taught through activities, no formal examThe framework of the ‘Deshbhakti’ curriculum submitted by a government-appointed panel was approved by the governing council of the state council of educational research and training (SCERT) on August 6.

During his Independence Day address at the Delhi Secretariat, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the curriculum will be activity-based and it will be a tribute to freedom fighter Bhagat Singh.Kejriwal said that the deshbhakti curriculum will help realise the dreams of freedom fighters and the celebration of Independence Day will cease to be symbolic in schools but will now have substantive meaning. “This is not something that will require rote learning. Children will be told about the stories of the nation, there will be discussions about their responsibilities and duties to nation and how they can contribute,” he added.Kejriwal announced the vision for the deshbhakti curriculum on the 73rd Independence Day in 2019. The framework of the deshbhakti curriculum submitted by a government-appointed panel was approved by the Governing Council of the State Council of Educational Research And Training (SCERT) on August 6 this year. The deshbhakti curriculum will be implemented in schools in every class from nursery to Class 12 when the schools reopen physically. Right now, only students of classes 9 to 12 are allowed to return to schools for physical classes.Here’s all about the deshbhakti curriculum:1. The curriculum will not be based on rote learning and there will be no tests.2. The curriculum will be activity-based and students will be told stories about Independence and the nation's pride. Children will be made to realise their responsibilities and duties towards the nation.3. Students will be prepared to fulfil their responsibilities and contribute to the nation's progress.4. The deshbhakti curriculum framework aims to develop a deep sense of respect towards constitutional values and seeks to bridge the gap between values and action, according to a statement from the government, reports news agency PTI.5. “There is very little scope to relate values such as equality and fraternity to their daily lives. The deshbhakti curriculum seeks to build a deeper understanding of these values and make them part of children's behaviour. Therefore, the stress is also on connecting to children's lives outside of school,” an official statement issued during the launch of the curriculum said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deshbhakti-curriculum-in-delhi-schools-from-today-all-you-need-to-know-101632787339785.html

The UT administration has told the commission that the proposal of the payment of compensation is under active consideration by the general administration department for placing it before the administrative council for consideration and approval. “Interestingly, while on the one hand the UT administration has been trying to portray that it was willing to pay compensation to the victims, on the other hand it has even filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the order of the J&K High Court which has not only rejected the plea of the administration against the payment of compensation but also passed strictures against the conduct of the bureaucracy,” he said. “However, the UT administration is trying to delay the matter by pleading approval by the administrative council headed by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and also subject to the outcome of the SLP pending before the SC,” he added.

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Contamination of water: High court serves notice on HP chief secy||The Himachal Pradesh high court on Monday issued notices to state chief secretary, member secretary, state environment protection and pollution control board and Solan DC in a matter pertaining to the contamination of water of wells and borewells of the surrounding areas due to chemical waste of Shivalik Solid Waste Management Plant set up Majra village in Nalagarh.A division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua passed these orders on a petition taken up suo motu as a PIL on a letter written to the chief justice by one Joginder Singh of Majra village that falls under the Solan district. The petitioner has said that Shivalik Solid Waste Management Plant was set up 15 years ago after obtaining NOC from the panchayat by misleading it that an environment project was going to the set up there. “But later, when the waste management plant was built, villagers came to know that hazardous chemical and solid toxic waste of different factories of Himachal Pradesh was to be brought to this plant and responsibility for treating this solid waste has been entrusted to the unit. For the last 15 years, the solid waste is being dumped on the ground by the aforesaid plant by covering it with soil, without proper treatment,” he added. With passage of time, the water of natural sources, wells and bore-wells of Majra and the surrounding villages has become poisonous due to seepage of chemically contaminated water from this plant into the ground and resultantly foul smell is coming from the water, he said. He has alleged that villagers made many complaints to the pollution control board as well as various other higher authorities but till date, no action has been taken against the solid waste company. He has alleged that due to this poisonous water, their cattle have died and even the villagers have contracted many serious diseases.He has prayed that necessary directions for taking stringent action against the Shivalik Solid Waste Management may be issued so that they could be saved from the hazardous effects of contaminated water and people may not face any health-related issues. The court has posted the matter after two weeks and also directed the respondents to file their replies by the next date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/contamination-of-water-high-court-serves-notice-on-hp-chief-secy-101632786052424.html

The Capital registered 273 cases of the vector-borne disease till September 25.In comparison, the city recorded 212 cases of the infection in the same period last year. To be sure, doctors say fewer dengue patients reported to hospitals last year due to a fear of Covid-19. In 2019, Delhi logged 282 dengue cases in the same period.Municipal officials warned that the breeding is on the rise. “This is the peak time for breeding. Additionally, the city also received record rainfall at unexpected time, which will lead to more breeding. It does, however, seem less than 2010, when there was a lot of rain and Delhi saw one of the worst dengue outbreaks,” said a senior official from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation.An official from the East corporation said, “Nowadays, we see cases being reported well into November. Earlier, the number of cases used to go down mid-October, as temperatures started dropping, but now we see that the mosquitoes start breeding indoors, especially in rooms where people switch on heaters during the winters.”Even though the treatment for dengue is symptomatic, people must seek a doctor’s opinion said Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) during a public lecture. “Some people who get dengue may develop severe disease. If they receive timely care and support they will be okay.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-adds-62-dengue-cases-in-a-week-mcds-say-breeding-on-rise-101632782060995.html

He submitted his resignation to the principal secretary, health and family welfare. “It (resignation) is out of respect for Sidhu who recognised my honesty and offered me top posts in the health department. What is the point of continuing in the post when the minister is not there? I am thankful to him for supporting me,” said Dr Manjit, an ophthalmologist.

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet passes resolution seeking repeal of Centre’s 3 farm laws||A day after the induction of 15 ministers, the Punjab cabinet led by Charanjit Singh Channi on Monday passed a resolution seeking repeal of the central government’s three contentious farm laws. The specially convened meeting coincided with the Bharat bandh call by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions leading the protests at the Delhi border and elsewhere. Terming the agriculture laws as anti-farmer and against food security, Channi said they were a threat to the peasantry and their future generations. “Therefore, the earlier resolutions passed by the state assembly seeking repeal of black laws should be conceded by the Centre without delay,” he said. Referring to a Supreme Court order staying the legislations, the CM suggested that there was the need for dialogue with all stakeholders as the laws had a direct bearing on farmers’ future. He asked his ministers to win the confidence of the families of 155 deceased farmers by visiting their homes and delivering them appointment letters for government jobs besides instructing chief secretary Anirudh Tiwari to verify the households left out of the process. Channi also directed Tiwari to explore ways to rationalise compensation to be awarded to the farmers whose land was acquired for government projects, including the Centre’s Bharat Mala road project. Farmers are complaining of inadequate compensation. Ministers asked to work overtimeThe CM asked all ministers to work overtime as time left to fulfill promises made before the 2017 polls was too short, it is learnt. “The CM also asked all ministers to work from 9am to 10pm and sit in office at least two days a week, it is learnt. The ministers would also be given additional responsibility of a district each to oversee government functioning and for redressal of people’s grievances,” said a minister. In Monday’s meeting, the second after he took over from Capt Amarinder Singh a week ago, Channi assured to announce “people-centric decisions” in the next cabinet meeting on October 1. Also, the new council of ministers as a “goodwill gesture” appreciated Amarinder for “pro-people initiatives and development works” during his tenure. Deputy chief ministers OP Soni and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa were also present in the discussions that went on for 3 hours. Curtail security: CM CM Channi asked the ministers to keep their security “bare minimum” saying that he had already curtailed his own. “This would save the general public from unnecessary inconvenience,” he said. To provide access to the elected representatives like sarpanches and municipal councillors it was decided to issue an entry card from the office of deputy commissioners and SDMs concerned so that they are allowed entry in government offices and the secretariats in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cabinet-passes-resolution-seeking-repeal-of-centre-s-3-farm-laws-101632777115885.html
28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Akali Dal stays mum on Bharat bandh call after attack on workers at Tikri border||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) did not respond to Monday’s Bharat bandh (countrywide shutdown) call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) in protest against the central government’s three contentious farm laws, days after an attack on its workers at the Tikri border in Delhi. This was in contrast to the farmers’ March 26 bandh call when Akali workers staged protests at many places in Punjab under the party banner. The SAD leadership neither issued any official statement nor did it say anything on social media about Monday’s shutdown. Party spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said, “We are not taking part in the protests directly as the farmers unions have announced not to share stage with political parties. As far as the attack on Akali workers is concerned, we have already asked the farmer leaders to take action against those behind it. But no action has been taken yet.” Also, the SAD-controlled Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which has been extending help to the protesting farmers at the Delhi borders and elsewhere, kept open its offices that remained close on March 26 to join the stir. The move is being seen as an aftermath of the Tikri border incident, even as senior SGPC officials declined to comment on the issue.In a video of the September 17 incident, hair of an elderly Akali worker were seen being pulled by protesters. SGPC president Jagir Kaur shared a graphic on his Facebook page supporting the bandh call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-stays-mum-on-bharat-bandh-call-after-attack-on-workers-at-tikri-border-101632776692491.html
28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Complete shutdown in Punjab’s Majha on Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s Bharat bandh call against farm laws||A complete shutdown was observed on Monday in the Majha region of Punjab as nearly all sections gave a good response to the Bharat bandh call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) in protest against the central government’s three controversial farm laws.Commercial establishments, including shops, and public transport remained shut at most places in Amritsar and adjoining districts. In Amritsar, protesters staged dharnas, asking the shopkeepers and vendors to support the strike. They also moved around in vehicles calling for people to observe the protest.However, the commuters had a tough time reaching their destinations.The farmers owing allegiance to various organisations, including the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) and the Jamhuri Kisan Sabha, staged dharnas at more than 30 points on the national highways and other key roads till around 3pm. The protesters also laid siege to railway tracks in the district. Sandeep, 27, a vegetable vendor from Tarn Taran, said he had to shell out ₹1,000 to an auto-rickshaw driver to bring his mother to a local Hospital for eye surgery. “My mother was slated to be operated on at 11am. We left Tarn Taran at 6am so that we could reach in time. Since no bus plied on their routes, we had to hire an auto-rickshaw,” he said.Zain-ul- Abedeen, who runs a dhaba at Katra Ahluwalia, said, “I have to pay salaries of 5 workers. I can’t tell them that there was a strike for a day or two.”The Golden Temple, however, witnessed a heavy rush of devotees despite the bandh. People were seen standing in long queues in front of the sanctum sanctorum.Only a handful of shops in some narrow streets didn’t observe the ‘bandh’ and went about their business as usual. In Tarn Taran district also, all services barring health facilities, remained closed till 4pm. The farmers under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee blocked around a dozen roads, including the Amritsar-Bathinda highway near Rasoolpur village. The farmers also blocked the Tarn Taran-Khemkaran and the Tarn Taran-Beas railway tracks. Some shopkeepers in Tarn Taran city also expressed their solidarity with the farmers. A similar situation was witnessed in Gurdaspur and Batala towns.Traders, protesters come face to face in PathankotThe shutdown also brought life to a standstill in Pathankot district, considered a stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The farmers along with others staged a protest on the outskirts of the town, and the traders also kept their outlets shut.But the situation turned tense in the Post Office Chowk market in the city when the agitating farmers came there on tractors to ensure all the shops were shut. Some shopkeepers gathered to oppose them and started raising slogans and refused to shut their shops. Police brought the situation under control and the protesters returned after some time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/complete-shutdown-in-punjab-s-majha-on-samyukt-kisan-morcha-s-bharat-bandh-call-against-farm-laws-101632776392980.html

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana police exam: Weird questions leave candidates stumped||Haryana staff selection commission (HSSC) explored the general knowledge of candidates at a very different level in an examination conducted for selection of sub-inspectors (SI) on Sunday. Through this examination, the commission will fill 463 posts of sub-inspector. There were at least half-a-dozen questions that stumped the candidates. To a question on ‘specialty’ of Haryana home minister Anil Vij, there were four options to choose from: Vij is highly educated, he has been a home minister before, he is unmarried or he has served as a police officer. If that was not perplexing enough, answer this: Name a Haryana BJP MP whose father died recently; or who is BJP’s Haryana president, or name BJP’s candidate in the Baroda bypoll. The fun didn’t end there. The next question was on the meaning of HSSC chairman Bhopal Singh Khadri’s surname and the options for the answer were: Is it the name of a caste, community/gotra, Khadar area or none of the above! “There were at least five to six questions related to Haryana BJP members. None related to the police field or general knowledge,” said Sachin Kumar, a candidate from Rohtak. “We will register a complaint. If the HSSC does not act on our complaint, we will move court,” he added. HSSC chairman Bhopal Singh Khadri said, “The agency had been given the task to set the question paper, we can’t do anything about the questions being asked.

People commuting by road and train were at the receiving end as protesters blocked highways and squatted on railway tracks at many places in the two states. No untoward incident was reported from anywhere. Shops and other commercial establishments were closed in most towns in the two states as traders, as social organisations, employee bodies extended their support to the farmers. Protesters laid siege to nearly 500 locations across Punjab, blocking inter-state highways and key rail routes. Schools, colleges and universities and government offices reported thin attendance. Long traffic jams were reported from different districts, while ambulances were allowed to ply. “It is a near total bandh in Punjab. We are thankful to all those who supported us,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, the president of the Bharti Kisan Union (Rajewal), a constituent of the SKM. Over 50 trains affectedFourteen trains were cancelled in the Ferozepur rail division, while eight were rescheduled and two short terminated. Under the neighbouring Ambala division, 19 trains were cancelled and 15 rescheduled. Officials said the Delhi-Amritsar Shan-e-Punjab, New Delhi-Moga Express, Old Delhi-Pathankot Express, Vande Bharat Express from New Delhi to Katra, and Amritsar Shatabdi are some of the trains that have been affected.“More than 20 locations in Delhi, Ambala, and Ferozepur divisions had been blocked. About 50 trains were affected due to this. All train movement is normal now since 4:30 pm,” a spokesperson for the Northern Railway said.In Haryana, farmers blocked the Delhi-Ambala-Chandigarh highway, Chandigarh-Kaithal-Jind-Hisar highway, Panipat-Rohtak highway, Kurukshetra-Kaithal highway, Kurukshetra-Yamunangar highway, Karnal-Jind highway and Karnal-Yamunanagar highway. The protesters sat on rail tracks in Jhajjar, Bahadurgarh, Fatehgarh in Dadri and at Ramayana toll plaza in Hisar. Commuters used village link roads to reach their destinations. Traders in most parts of the state kept their business establishments closed in solidarity. Security was beefed up at Singhu and Tikri borders where farmers have been camping for almost a year. Entry and exit gates of metro stations from Tikri to Bahadurgarh were closed, inconveniencing commuters headed for Delhi. SKM leader Inderjit Singh said, “Shopkeepers and small factory owners also shut their establishments in support of farmers till 4pm. Medical staff and ambulances were allowed passage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bandh-in-bharat-brings-punjab-haryana-to-halt-101632773750528.html

The northern railways cancelled 19 trains in Ambala railway division. The 10-hour Bandh passed off peacefully in Haryana, evoking good response in the heartland districts of Rohtak, Hisar, Bhiwani and Jind. Farmers blocked the Delhi-Ambala-Chandigarh highway, Chandigarh-Kaithal-Jind-Hisar highway, Panipat-Rohtak highway, Kurukshetra-Kaithal highway, Kurukshetra-Yamunangar highway, Karnal-Jind highway and Karnal-Yamunanagar highway. The protesters sat on rail tracks in Jhajjar, Bahadurgarh, Fatehgarh in Dadri and at Ramayana toll plaza in Hisar. Bus stands of Hisar, Rohtak, Jind and Sonepat wore a deserted look, and many buses were seen parked at the bus terminus itself. Commuters used village link roads to reach their destinations. Protesters, however, allowed the movement of vehicles on emergency duty such as ambulances. Traders in most parts of the state kept their business establishments closed in solidarity. Security was beefed up at Singhu and Tikri borders where farmers have been camping for almost a year. Entry and exit gates of metro stations from Tikri to Bahadurgarh were closed, inconveniencing commuters headed for Delhi. SKM leader Inderjit Singh said, “Shopkeepers and small factory owners also shut their establishments in support of farmers till 4pm. We occupied highways and rail tracks to raise our voice though medical staff and ambulances were allowed passage.” Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains said that most market associations have assured the farmers of their support. “A team of farmers kept visiting markets and requested them to shut shop during the bandh duration,” Bains said. Asked about people stuck in traffic jams, he said: “Farmers had announced the blockade in advance and commuters should have avoided travelling on Monday. But farmers will make arrangements of food and water for them.” A Haryana police spokesperson said the Bandh call given by farmers’ organisations passed off peacefully and no violent incident was reported in the state.The spokesperson said the impact of the Bandh was largely seen in the form of road and rail blockades and hampered the intercity road and rail traffic movement. However, it did not have much impact on the activities within towns and cities.The bandh call did not have any impact in the districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Narnaul, Rewari and Nuh in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10hour-bandh-passes-off-peacefully-in-haryana-rail-tracks-roads-blocked-101632773689492.html

Condemning the appointment, he claimed that Punjabis were sad at the development, as everyone wants a logical conclusion into the incident in which two men were killed. “The Congress had come to power by promising that the guilty will be punished.

Due to such weaknesses, the Congress is called the mother of corruption,” Cheema allegedHe claimed that the presence of Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Rana Gurjit Singh, Raja Warring and Gurkirat Kotli in the cabinet had put Channi, Sidhu and the Gandhi family in the dock. “If an FIR is not registered against former minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and other corrupt ministers within a week by the Channi government, the AAP will start an agitation,” Cheem claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-cm-channi-s-claims-on-corruption-ring-hollow-aap-101632772308938.html

Himachal SKM members blocked the traffic at Victory Tunnel in Shimla and raised slogans against the central and state governments. The president of Himachal Pradesh Kisan Sabha, Kuldeep Tanwar, said that farmers have been agitating for the past over nine months but the central government is still ignoring their demands.“The farmers’ unions have been protesting against this adamant attitude of the central government and seek withdrawal of the three farm laws, which are not in favour of farmers but would benefit the friends of the Prime Minister,” he said.Speaking in the context of Himachal, Tanwar said the apple farmers were in deep crises as they were not getting reasonable price for their produce.The state government has failed to provide a relief to the farmers of HP. He said the HP government should implement the Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) and fix minimum support price (MSP) for apple crop on the analogy of Jammu and Kashmir.He said the state farmers also demand the government to procure apple, barley, maize and wheat crops through National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India. He said the farmers’ movement will continue till the government repeals the three “anti-farmer” laws. Tanwar said a joint forum of all farmers’ unions, eight trade unions and students’ organisations participated in the bandh.Various farm unions led by CPIM legislator Rakesh Singha also blocked the NH at Theog.The protest, however, remained peaceful.Meanwhile, there was a heavy traffic jam on the Himalayan Expressway after the farm unions blocked the highway at Chandimandir in Panchkula, Haryana. Long queues of vehicles were seen on the Himachal side too.The farmers also staged protests in other parts of the state, including Dharamshala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bharat-bandh-leads-to-traffic-disruptions-in-hp-101632772009158.html
28-09-2021||Kolkata||CBI arrests 4 in Bengal coal smuggling case; quizzes TMC MLA in chit fund probe||KOLKATA: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday made its first set of arrests in the Bengal coal smuggling case by taking into custody four suspects in West Burdwan and Bankura districts, officials aware of the development said.The men were identified as Joydeb Mondal, Narayan Nanda, Nirad Mondal and Gurupada Majhi. CBI suspects that they ran the operation for Anup Majhi alias Lala, the racket’s alleged head named in the FIR. Majhi was earlier granted an arrest shield by the Supreme Court. He has appealed for an extension of the order. The arrested men will be produced before the Asansol court in West Burdwan on Tuesday.The coal smuggling case is a raging political issue in Bengal. On September 6, Trinamool Congress (TMC) national general secretary and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Delhi for almost nine hours. ED is conducting a parallel probe into money laundering charges linked to allegations of organised coal smuggling.Meanwhile, CBI on Monday questioned Madan Mitra, the TMC legislator from Kamarhati in North 24 Parganas district in the I-Core chit fund case in which industry minister Partha Chatterjee and legislator Mans Bhunia were questioned recently.“Our party has never said that we will not face CBI. I answered the questioned the officers asked,” Mitra said.Agency officials said Mitra’s son, Swarup, may be summoned on Tuesday. “I don’t know if my son has received any e-mail from the CBI,” Mitra said.CBI registered the coal smuggling case in November last year. It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs a number of mines.Abhishek Banerjee was summoned again by ED to its Delhi office on September 21 but he and his wife Rujira, who was earlier questioned by CBI in Kolkata, have moved the Delhi high court seeking permission to face the officers in the West Bengal capital Kolkata.The developments come days before the September 30 voting in the assembly bypoll at Kolkata’s Bhawanipore, chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s old seat, which she has to win to continue as chief minister. She was defeated by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram in the March-April polls. During the campaign, which ended on Monday, the BJP described her as corrupt.On September 6, Abhishek Banerjee threw a challenge at the BJP, saying using probe agencies against TMC leaders will not help the saffron camp gain any political ground in Bengal.“TMC will never bow before you (BJP). Do whatever you can. If ED has any evidence against me, make it public. If anybody can prove that I have accepted even ten paise from anyone, I will voluntarily walk to the gallows and hang myself,” Abhishek Banerjee said in Delhi.On August 17, ED filed its first charge-sheet in the coal smuggling case and named former TMC youth wing general secretary Vinay Mishra’s brother Vikas and former officer-in-charge of Bankura police station, Ashok Mishra, as prime accused. Both were arrested in Delhi.A businessman, Vinay Mishra renounced his Indian citizenship in December last year and became a citizen of Vanuatu, a small island country in the South Pacific. ED’s charge-sheet, filed at a special court in Delhi, did not mention Abhishek Banerjee. The agency told the court that it will file supplementary charge-sheets as the probe progresses. ED has also summoned Bengal law minister Moloy Ghatak for questioning in this case. Ghatak informed the agency on Monday that as a senior citizen it is not possible for him to travel to Delhi during the Covid pandemic.Before summoning Abhishek Banerjee, ED wanted to question his wife Rujira Banerjee in the first week of September. She did not go to Delhi citing the risk a mother of two infants might face while travelling during the pandemic. She told the agency in an email that it would be convenient for her if ED officers came to her Kolkata residence.Rujira Banerjee was questioned by CBI in February. A CBI team visited Abhishek Banerjee’s residence. In March, CBI officials also questioned Rujira’s sister Maneka Gambhir and the latter’s husband Ankush Arora and father-in-law Pawan Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-arrests-4-in-bengal-coal-smuggling-case-quizzes-tmc-mla-in-chit-fund-probe-101632771710446.html

Channi also asked officers to give respect to ministers and MLAs, as per rule of law. In the previous government under Capt Amarinder Singh, Channi had raised the issue of bureaucratic dominance in government functioning, and the sidelining of the elected representatives. Over time, this had turned into a major issue against the former CM. “I am soft and gentle, but please don’t mistake my gentleness into an assumption that I will let inaction go unnoticed. I will act against those who won’t act for the common people,” Channi told the meeting.He directed officers to submit their proposals for a 100-day roadmap for their departments to the chief secretary within a week, also asking them to focus on the core sectors of providing affordable health care and education in rural areas. “The work of the common man must be done on priority and employee-friendly approach is to be followed so that they should not resort to agitation,” he said, adding that if anyone dropped his name to coerce them into any wrongdoing, the matter must be brought to his notice.Channi also asked administrative secretaries to ensure timely completion of ongoing projects, besides implementing welfare measures so the last man standing in line, benefits from government schemes. Punjab chief secretary Anirudh Tewari assured the CM of providing good service to citizens, and that the officers would achieve desired goals, according to his directions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-cm-meets-dept-heads-asks-for-100-day-roadmap-within-a-week-101632771648840.html
28-09-2021||Lucknow||Designers pin hopes on upcoming festive season||Navratri is just a few days away and fashion designers in the state capital are keeping their fingers crossed that it ushers a new beginning for them. Pinning their hopes on the festival and wedding season ahead, the glamour industry is readying itself for the buying season.Small functions as per permissible limits – now 100 people – have badly impacted designers. “Earlier, people bought dresses for haldi, mehndi, wedding, reception and more functions. Now, post-marriage receptions are rarely happening, and the other functions are confined to home, so just brides, groom and close family buys for wedding days. People used to come to us for high-end trail lehngas and all. Now, their budgets have gone down by 40-50%. Strangely, compared to Lucknow and Kanpur, customers in small cities are giving better business. We hope things improve for us and the people attached with the trade,” says designer Pallavi Madeshia Yadav. Budgets are surely down but people buy for themselves, says celebrity designer and Lucknowite Manish Tripathi. “Like we witnessed revenge travelling before the second wave, I see people going in for revenge buying. And this time, they are going to pamper themselves. We are running into the second year since the pandemic happened and people have not spent on themselves. Also, fat weddings and functions are not happening, so they are now buying for self-happiness, but budgets surely are lesser and we had to carve a new range accordingly,” he says.Lucknowite Gunriddh Sial, currently based in Singapore, says, “Millennials prefer more casual yet classy silhouettes and at House of Gulaal I have used shades that are very different, for example, the pistachio green or the icy blue. They are common festive colours but we’ve done it in a way that fashion conscious people are loving them. As people are environmentally conscious, we used 91% reused fabrics with fresh silhouettes. My festive collection has been inspired by some iconic dresses worn by Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Sarah Jessica Parker and many more.”Fashion designer Romaa Agarwal feels work from home culture has given rise to relaxed styles which can be worn both for online meetings and staying comfortable indoors. “The pandemic has changed our lives and our pattern of consumption, work and leisure. Rare outings and connection to the outside world has also brought about a shift in how we dress. Long lasting, classic, timeless styles are being bought more. Comfort, functionality and durability are taking over affordability and price. Staying indoors has given a huge boost to lounge wear and active wear. Practicality has become the core of design thinking for today’s consumer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/designers-pin-hopes-on-upcoming-festive-season-101632771589798.html

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Govt has not finalised new mining policy: Punjab to HC||The Punjab government has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that no new mining policy has been finalised. The state government on Monday said before a bench of justice Ajay Tewari and justice Alka Sarin that all the mining contracts are in position as per existing mining policy and no new policy has been finalised. The submissions were made in a plea filed by Mahadev Enclave Private Limited, a mining firm that had approached the high court last week seeking quashing of the September 20 decision of state cabinet allowing “free mining” “The high court has posted the matter for October 1 in view of the stand taken by the state government and asked for an affidavit on the same,” one of the counsel in the matter, Raman Preet Singh Bara, said. In the first cabinet meeting chaired by Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, he asked for a survey of the prices of sand and how to provide the sand at cheaper rates. At the meeting, it was also decided to allow landowners to do mining in their respective areas. The plea termed the decision a “political gimmick”, further submitting that state’s action in taking the decision of allowing “free mining” is totally illegal and arbitrary and the same is against the law laid down in various judgments. The assembly polls in Punjab are just about two to three months away and the ruling party, in order to gain political mileage, is resorting to policy of free sand to the public, which is legally and practically unfeasible, the firm told the court, adding that the move would lead to an environmental disaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-has-not-finalised-new-mining-policy-punjab-to-hc-101632771110005.html

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: HC takes note of plea seeking revival of Apartment Rules||The high court has sought response from the Chandigarh administration and central government on a plea challenging the 2007 notification withdrawing Apartment Rules, 2001, claiming that the move was illegal and without jurisdiction.The high court (HC) bench of justice Rajan Gupta and justice Karamjit Singh has sought response from various respondents by November 2.A 2016 plea is already under consideration of another division bench presided over by justice TS Dhindsa, in which petitioners are demanding that Chandigarh be restricted from allowing floor-wise sale of properties. In this matter, it has come to light that between 2016 and 2019, as many as 891 sale deeds were registered by the estate office, wherein a part of the property was sold outside the family. In 2001, the administration had notified Chandigarh Apartment Rules, 2001, whereby single residential units could be subdivided into apartments. It was repealed in October 2007. The administration has maintained that no permission is being granted to convert residential houses into apartments.The fresh plea demands that the sale of a storey as an independent unit be allowed, as it is not prohibited under the Capital of Punjab Development and Regulation Act 1952 and rules made thereunder. It also says that a committee be constituted to examine the issue of allowing construction of apartments to address the demand of residents and modern-day challenges of the city. It says each floor is an independent unit capable of being occupied by a family, and does not in anyway affect the basic character of Chandigarh and there is no violation of building rules. The regulatory powers of a state are also not affected in any manner if registration of floors as independent units is allowed, the plea underlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhhc-takes-note-of-plea-seeking-revival-of-apartment-rules-101632771048872.html
28-09-2021||Chandigarh||US Marines let Sikh officer wear turban but with riders, he plans to sue Corps||A 26-year-old Sikh-American officer in the US Marines who has been allowed to wear a turban --- the first person in the 246-year history of the elite force allowed doing so, but with a few limitations ---- plans to sue the Corps if he is not granted full religious accommodation, according to a media report. “Almost every morning for five years, First Lt Sukhbir Toor has pulled on the uniform of the United States Marine Corps. On Thursday, he also got to put on the turban of a faithful Sikh,” a report in The New York Times said.“I finally don’t have to pick which life I want to commit to, my faith or my country. I can be who I am and honour both sides,” Toor said in an interview.When Toor was promoted as Captain this spring, he decided to appeal. Toor’s case is the latest in a long-running conflict between two fundamental values in the United States military: “the tradition of discipline and uniformity, and the constitutional liberties the armed forces were created to defend,” the NYT said.However, Toor, who grew up in Washington and Ohio and is the son of Indian immigrants, has been allowed to wear the turban while on duty with limitations. He “can wear a turban in daily dress at normal duty stations, but not while deployed to a conflict zone, or when in dress uniform in a ceremonial unit, where the public could see it.” The NYT report said Toor has “appealed the restrictive decision to the Marine Corps commandant, and he says that if he does not get a full accommodation, he will sue the Corps.“The Marine Corps needs to show it really means what it has been saying about strength in diversity — that it doesn’t matter what you look like, it just matters that you can do your job,” he said. The Corps has maintained that “uniformity was as essential to a fighting force as well-oiled rifles”.“In order to build squads that will move forward in a combat environment where people are dying, a strong team bond is required,” Col Kelly Frushour, a spokeswoman for Marine Headquarters, said in written responses to The Times on Toor’s case. “The Corps cannot experiment with the components of mission accomplishment,” Lt Gen David A Ottignon, the deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs, said in the response. “Failure on the battlefield is not an acceptable risk.” Toor said the limits meant that “I would have to either sacrifice my career or my ability to practice my religion.” Toor appealed to the commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Corps agreed partially, allowing him to wear the turban with certain limitations, according to the report.The NYT report said that nearly 100 Sikhs currently serve in the Army and Air Force wearing full beards and turbans.Manvinder Singh, director of United Sikhs, a US-based advocacy group, said : “Sikhs have served in the armed forces worldwide. It is their fundamental right to practice their faith and also defend the nations they represent. The valour that Sikhs have shown in history comes from their faith . The American freedom guarantees through the Bill of Rights for the people to practice their faith while performing their duty. They shouldn’t have to choose between the two”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/us-marines-let-sikh-officer-wear-turban-but-with-riders-he-plans-to-sue-corps-101632770988775.html

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Bharat Bandh: Punjab industry faces ₹500-cr loss||The Bharat Bandh call that received an unprecedented response in Punjab on Monday, caused a loss of around ₹500 crore to the industry in the state. While large and medium-scale units remained shut, some small-scale units operated with shutters down. In most parts of the state’s industrial hub Ludhiana, labour was unable to reach the factories. Businesses and all transactions were hampered as banks and commercial establishments remained completely shut till 4pm. A large section of industry extended its support to the farmers but there were many who were left fuming and have decided to not to extend support to such protests in future. “The estimated losses faced by the industry due to the bandh are close to ₹500 crore. We have decided that we will not be part of the bandh next time. The police and the entire government machinery support the bandh and it’s the common people who suffer. It was a Monday and after two days of bank holiday, all financial transactions get affected. The industry had already suffered enough since the last year due to Covid-induced lockdown and the farmers protest. There is a limit to how much we can bear as the industry has been taken for granted to support the farmers while no one thinks about us,” said Badish Jindal, president of the Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association (FOPSIA). Pankaj Sharma, general secretary, Chamber of Commercial and Industrial Undertaking (CICU), said almost all factories remained shut as a precaution, fearing backlash from farmers and other protesters. “There should be an open space or a ground to hold such protests outside the city. Protesters can sit there, hold press conferences and enter the grievances in the record book. The govt representative should go there and receive their memorandum. Why disrupt the daily life which affects the economy?” he asked. Sharma also said that a lot many people blocking the roads have nothing to do with farm Laws. Some of them are factory workers who are allured on the pretext of free food, he said, adding that shutdowns in all forms should be condemned by all. It is high time politicians stop taking common man for a ride, he said. Amit Thapar, president of Ganga Acrowools and vice-president, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Punjab, said: “For me, it’s not about farm laws. I cannot support any cause which in form of protest denies me my right to livelihood. Disruption is not a solution and neither you can force people to close down anyone who wishes to be part of the protest can voluntary close down his shop / factory and keep it closed for as long as he wants. But he has no right to ask me to close mine.” Trucks remain off road With transporters in the largest Transport Nagar in the state extending support to the Bharat Bandh, thousands of trucks remained off road.The industrial activities also got disturbed in the industrial hub of the state with no loading and unloading of goods taking place during the protest hours from 6am to 4pm. According to transporters the Ludhiana Goods Transport Association, there are over 1,100 transporters in Transport Nagar with around 15,000 loading vehicles.Only the transport services related to medicines, vegetables, eatables among other essential services continued.Secretary, Punjab Bank Employees’ Federation Naresh Gaur said as per an estimate, banking transactions worth crores were hit due to the protest as the industrial activities were affected. President of Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association Jaswinder Thukral said that the industry in Janta Nagar, Gill Road and adjoining areas also remained shut in support of the farmer agitation. “Though the industry will suffer losses, it is far less than what we will have to suffer if the farm laws are implemented. The economy of the state depends on the farming sector and if that sector is destroyed, we will not be able to survive,” he said.

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Senior advocate APS Deol is Punjab advocate general||The Punjab government on Monday appointed criminal lawyer Amar Preet Singh Deol as the advocate general (AG) of the state replacing Atul Nanda who had resigned after Captain Amarinder Singh quit as the chief minister. Deol, 61, came into limelight recently when he secured release of former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini arrested by the vigilance bureau in a 2020 criminal case. Deol had appeared for Saini and other accused in the 2015 sacrilege cases in the high court. In the past, Deol has also appeared for former CM Amarinder Singh in some criminal cases registered during SAD-BJP regime. In 2007, he was appointed as special public prosecutor in a disproportionate assets case against former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal by then Congress government. Deol, who became a senior advocate in 2007, was in the reckoning for the AG’s post in 2017 as well when Amarinder took over as the CM.The government took more than a week to clear Deol’s name. Names of senior advocates Deepinder Singh Patwalia and Anmol Rattan Sidhu, too, were considered.The government’s move has invited sharp criticism from a section of legal fraternity, who are of the view that technically, Deol won’t be able to appear in the high court neither in cases against Saini nor in 2015 sacrilege violence cases as he had appeared on the other side in the past. Speaking to a news portal after his appointment, Deol said his name was cleared by Congress high command. He also said he would prefer senior advocates from high court over those coming from Delhi to defend interests of the state. To a question on him appearing for Saini, he said files have been sent back and his job is to watch the interests of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/senior-advocate-aps-deol-is-punjab-advocate-general-101632770449064.html

But had failed. The pollutants are affecting the ecosystem, including aquatic life and public health. Discharge of untreated sewage into the drain is in violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and constitutional obligation under Article 243W and also citizen’s right to clean environment, it was argued. It was also argued that since the wastewater of the drain was used for cultivation of crops and washing of vegetables consumed by residents, it was affecting the food chain and public health, the lawyer submitted. Taking note of the issue raised in June, the NGT had directed the chief secretary, Punjab, and the adviser, Chandigarh administration, to take remedial measures to comply with the mandate of law. A joint committee was also asked to inspect the drain and furnish a status report. The committee had submitted a report on September 20 after site inspection. Taking note of that report, the NGT posted the matter for October 30 and directed the committee to ascertain the status of the quantity of sewage being discharged by UT and Punjab, along with suggesting ways to improve water quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pollution-of-ghaggar-ngt-directs-ut-punjab-to-ascertain-amount-of-sewage-discharged-101632770028987.html

According to hospital authorities, 3,942 patients were physically examined at OPDs on Monday (including walk-in and those prior appointments) besides 1,346 were provided consultation on phones.Patients were seen waiting in long queues at the registration windows of the hospital’s New OPD department. Though the hospital authorities provided face masks and hand sanitisers to the patients and their attendants, social distancing was hardly maintained at these windows. Meanwhile, patients were randomly screened and tested for Covid-19, the hospital authorities said. ‘Expected more patients’“We were expecting more patients for physical consultation on the first day, but due to the Bharat Bandh call given by farmers, not many patients from neighbouring states could travel to PGIMER. However, we are expecting an increase in the number of patients in the coming few days,” said Dr Navin Pandey, associate professor, department of hospital administration, PGIMER. The institute has also cut down the tele-consultation timings by half an hour, to scale up physical consultation. “Now, tele-consultation is being provided between 8am and 9am. the hospital can easily manage this footfall and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour, but it is difficult to match the pre-Covid times as virus infection can spread. After inspecting the footfall for a few days, the institute will decide more guidelines for attending OPDs,” said Dr Navin.Before the contagion, over 10,000 patients visited PGIMER’s OPDs daily. Since the suspension of walk-in consultation and online appointments in March last year, the institute had been providing OPD services through tele-consultation. From June 21 this year, physical consultations resumed, but only after prior appointment through tele-consultation.On September 6, the institute also restarted online appointment facility, but with a cap of 30 patients per department to ensure adherence to Covid protocols.

The team was questioning some others in connection with the fraud.IG, range, KP Singh, said that the Cyber Police Station received inputs about a website www.upsssb.org that was similar to the website of UPSESSB www.upsessb.org. Investigations revealed that some persons were running the site to dupe people. SHO Cyber Crime Police Station Rajeev Kumar Tiwari and his team used advanced techniques and manual inputs to trace the culprits and arrested two members of the gang on Monday, who were identified as Sachin Kumar aka Lalit of Etah district and Sahil Srivastava of Sultanpur district.The accused revealed that they had earlier created a website in the name of Child Research Development Organisation and duped people of ₹50 lakh on the pretext of providing jobs. As no complaint was made to the police, it encouraged the accused to make another fake website in the name of UPSESSB.Sachin, who is the kingpin of the gang, did not communicate with people directly and used conference calling. He used to receive payments from people in the account of his girlfriend while using the VPN option in his mobile for connecting to the internet to avoid being traced by the police. Moreover, he used the email address and name of another person for creating the website. Two laptops, seven mobile phones, one tablet, WiFi calling phone, two pen drives, WiFi Airtel Extreme Modem, nine ATM cards, two passbooks, two cheque books, one passport, a document relating to the fake website and application forms of 567 students who applied for different jobs through the website, along with other documents were recovered from the accused.

28-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The poolside Stein||It’s a sunny evening, here in the members-only India International Centre (IIC). The Lounge by the poolside is teeming with softly-chatting tea-drinking ladies in handloom saris. The only loud sounds are of the twittering birds, and of the pool water spraying up from the fountain jet, and sprinkling back into the pool. Meanwhile, the Lounge and the Dining Hall on the floor above are being reflected into the pool’s sparkling wavelets. As you stare longer at the reflection, the building seems to unravel itself gradually, each of its segments timorously trembling in the glassy liquid.Composed of light and shade, gardens and galleries, jaalis and pools, the IIC is among the most iconic buildings of contemporary Delhi. It was designed by Joseph Stein, the American architect who made the Capital his home and gave it a series of distinctive buildings that are admired for resting so gently on the earth. A typical Stein consists of a two-to four-storey edifice effortlessly fusing with the air, water, trees, and gardens, while flowers and vines spill about the walls. Delhi’s other Stein landmarks include the offices of the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Triveni Kala Sangam, the American International School, the Australian High Commission, and the India Habitat Centre. The landscaping of Lodhi Garden, as we know it today, was done under his guidance.With Stein’s 20th death anniversary falling next week (October 6), it is time to pay homage to his legacy by surveying all his creations.One convenient alternative is to simply loiter by this pool in the IIC, and observe the aforementioned reflection, and surroundings, from various vantage points. Here all the elements that make up Stein’s aesthetics come together to stage a satisfying show. Bougainvillea is crawling up the walls, mynas are nibbling on the grass, lotus leaves are floating in the water, daylight is leaking into shaded porticos, and humans are babbling on with tranquillity.Indeed, one might easily imagine Stein among these poolside sophisticates. An IIC regular, he was often sighted enjoying his favourite meal of naan with seekh kebabs. One is envious of those earlier generation of Delhiites who frequented the IIC when its legendary architect was alive and was seen ensconced amid his buildings. Today, he appears more like a myth.Stein was cremated following his death, aged 89. His ashes lie in the US, in the custody of his younger son, who cared for him in his final years. Even so, New Delhi’s great architect does have a tomb in his karma bhoomi, the land containing his life’s principal works. It is this watery grave, here in his IIC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-poolside-stein-101632769262108.html

All markets in Mohali, Zirakpur, Dera Bassi, Lalru and Kharar wore a deserted look during the day. Even petrol pumps remained closed, though chemist shops and banks were open.Overall, the bandh announced by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha from 6am to 4pm to protest against the contentious farm laws passed off peacefully in Mohali, though commuters had a tough time due to various blockades.Farmers belonging to Kisan Aid Mohali, Kisan Sangharsh Committee and Global Kisans had blocked all intersections on the Airport Road from Balongi to Chhat village besides Mohali-Chandigarh border. However, those going to the airport to board a flight were allowed to pass through after showing their tickets, said deputy commissioner (DC) Isha Kalia.“Police remained on their toes to ensure law and order. We were also in touch with the airport authorities,” said Kalia. Airport chief executive officer Ajay Bhardwaj confirmed that the operations were normal during the day, and most passengers reported much earlier.Traffic jams were witnessed in the periphery, as farmers blocked McDonald’s Chowk and Azizpur toll plaza in Zirakpur besides protesting at Lalru entry point, Kharar bus stand and Landran. Raising anti-establishment slogans, they did not allow any one to pass through, though people with medical emergencies were not stopped. All subdivisional magistrates with administrative staff were present at strategic locations to help police in maintaining law and order situation. Fire tenders and ambulances were also stationed in coordination with SDMs. No report of any untoward incident was received from any of the protest sites,” said the DC.Mixed response in Chandigarh, PanchkulaThe situation in Chandigarh remained calm. All major markets remained open and there was no report of traffic jams inside the city. The police had already issued an advisory for the Mullanpur and Hallomajra barriers, where some traffic snarls were witnessed. The road in front of the Hallomajra light point had been sealed off and protesters were seen sitting there. However, all roads were cleared by 5pm. Due to the bandh, some travellers were seen stranded at the Inter State Bus Terminal, Sector 43, and the railway station. Student outfits of Panjab University also organised a protest, wherein Gate No. 2 of the campus was closed for some time. On the request of students, traders in Sector 14 also closed their shops for some time.In Panchkula, as farmers had blocked toll plazas at Chandimandir and Barwala, police had put in place traffic diversions. Traffic moving towards Shimla via the Chandmandir toll plaza was diverted towards the Morni T-point and from there towards Thaapli. Similarly, traffic was managed at the Barwala toll plaza, said police, adding that overall, there was less vehicular movement as people were aware of the bandh.Even at toll plazas, protesters did not stop emergency vehicles or those going for examinations or to hospitals and airport. As far as shops were concerned, they usually remain closed on Mondays in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bandh-life-at-standstill-in-mohali-business-as-usual-in-chandigarh-101632769309929.html

28-09-2021||Noida||Bharat Bandh impacts major roads in Ghaziabad, highways; markets remained open||The Bharat Bandh call by protesting farmers impacted traffic on roads and highways connecting Ghaziabad on Monday, while shops and business establishments stayed open. The traffic police said that their entire staff -- about 250 members, including officers -- were busy managing traffic diversions and snarls during the day.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a farmers’ collective, announced Bharat Bandh on Monday; their protesters occupied the UP-Gate area of the Delhi Meerut Expressway (Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway) from 6am to around 4.15pm.“Our protesters also staged sit-ins on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME), besides the Delhi-Meerut Road. Our call was largely successful. We, however, did not stop any emergency services. We regret the inconvenience to commuters but would like to say that our agitation--which has been going on for the past 10 months--is for them,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader and UP-Gate site spokesperson from Samyukta Kisan Morcha.As protesters closed DME down at UP-Gate, commuters were forced to use other border roads near EDM Mall, Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar, and Seemapuri to travel to Ghaziabad, Meerut, and other cities from Delhi.On the Delhi-Meerut Road, connecting Ghaziabad to Meerut, protesting farmers blocked the Duhai area below the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, causing long traffic snarls.Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) confirmed that traffic was thrown out of gear on several roads.“Farmers staged sit-ins at many spots of the DME. Vehicular movement was also affected on Eastern Peripheral Expressway and the Dasna to Hapur section of the DME,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI.The Ghaziabad traffic police said that the sit-in by protesting farmers ended around 4.15pm.“Our entire staff, including traffic inspectors, traffic sub-inspectors and other personnel, remained deployed throughout the day to control traffic snarls on Delhi-Meerut Road, Gaur City intersection, Wave City intersection, Duhai, and other parts of the Delhi-Meerut Road,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic).He added that due to the blockade of the DME, vehicles coming from Delhi were routed through other border roads around Ghaziabad.Since November last year, farmers, under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, have been protesting against three new farm laws--The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act--at the Capital’s borders. They have been demanding the rollback of the laws and the creation of a new law on minimum support price (MSP).Farmers called the Bharat Bandh on the first anniversary of the enactment of the three farm laws.“If need be, we will continue our ongoing protest for the next 10 years. People will say that the Bharat Bandh was a flop, but it is not the case. It has been successful. As part of the protest, we only held up roads and it was not like sealing the roads. If the union agriculture minister calls us for talks, we will go,” said Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union.Farmer union leaders and the Central government have held as many as 11 rounds of talks, but each time the talks have ended in a stalemate.The last time the two parties held talks was on January 22.Meanwhile, traders in major markets of Ghaziabad said that they did not shut their shutters or support the Bharat Bandh, because they had already suffered financial losses when they had to shut down operations due to pandemic-related restrictions last year.“Our traders have already been facing losses since last year due to the pandemic. So we kept our shops open and did not support the Bharat Bandh call. There were traffic disruptions, which delayed the arrival of our employees at shops, but shops were not closed,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti, a traders’ union in Indirapuram, Ghaziabad.At the city’s biggest market in Turab Nagar, shops were open as usual, but traders’ association members said that footfall was low.“The general footfall is about 20,000-25,000. But it was reduced to almost 50% on Monday. Customers probably avoided coming to the market due to the bandh call. But all our shops remained open,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairperson of Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/bharat-bandh-impacts-major-roads-in-ghaziabad-highways-markets-remained-open-101632767868613.html

However, a few companies have already started calling their employees to office as per state government guidelines.The city has a strong base of IT hubs spread across Hinjewadi, Kharadi, Kalyani nagar and Viman nagar. On August 11, the state government issued a directive stating that companies can allow fully vaccinated employees to work from office but with only 25% employees per shift.Raj Gujar, cofounder, Bulb and Key Software Company, Bhandarkar road, Erandwane, said, “Coming out of the second wave of the pandemic, we have well-established processes allowing our product development team to work from home. However, our content, sales and operations teams have resumed working from the office and will continue to do so as these verticals work more efficiently in the same physical space. All those attending the office have completed their vaccination.”While many companies have started prepping to resume work from office, several employees want to continue with the “work from home (WFH)” model.Harpreet Saluja, president, Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), a non-profit organisation working extensively for the protection of benefits, welfare and rights of tech industry employees, said, “Employees are not willing to go back to office. In the WFH model, none of the work got stuck and none of the clients had any problem with people working from home. With the festive season ahead, we cannot rule out the anticipated third wave so 95% of IT employees in our survey do not want to resume work from office. The product and quality of work has improved in the WFH model. If we look from the employees’ perspective, they are still considering safety first.”Then again, many companies that are planning to resume work from office from January 2022 are considering calling employees to office in a phased manner.Neha R, an employee of an IT firm based out of Aundh, said, “All employees won’t have to be in office for a complete week. They will be allotted days on which they will have to come to the office. All companies are coming out with different strategies to keep their employees safe.”Werner Van Huyssteen, general manager – India, TomTom, which has its main office in Yerawada, said, “We will continue with our hybrid working approach, but also firmly believe in the benefits that an office environment brings. We look forward to welcoming our TomTom’ers back into world-class facilities sometime in Q4 namely, between October 31 and December 31, adhering to government protocols.”“We strictly enforce all safety-related protocols to ensure that our employees and their loved ones are safe. We also want to create an environment to manage this optimally,” he said.Many other industrial firms have started calling their employees to office with the flexibility to work from home whenever needed.Pankajj Ghode, chief executive officer, Agri10X, Kalyaninagar, said, “We are following all the basic Covid-19 regulations while allowing staff into the office. If our team finds anything problematic, the employee is straightaway sent home. We have given flexibility to our employees so they can opt to work from home if they have even the slightest of symptoms.”State government directions for private offices:25% of staff allowed in one shiftCompletion of two doses of vaccination compulsoryAs per survey by NITES, 95% of employees want to continue with work from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/not-all-pune-it-companies-have-resumed-work-from-office-yet-101632767748732.html
28-09-2021||Noida||Malls, markets open in Noida despite Bharat Bandh call||Malls and markets remained open in Noida and Greater Noida on Monday despite farmers’ call for Bharat Bandh on the first anniversary of the enactment of three contentious farm laws.The farmers’ protest mostly impacted the Greater Noida area, authorities said.Traffic officials said that a group of farmers reached Zero Point with several tractors to protest, which halted vehicular movement for some time on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. The officials also said that vehicular movement was slow at the DND Flyway and Chilla border during peak traffic hours in the morning as Delhi Police had set up barricades to check vehicles from 8am to 11am.Ashutosh Singh, Noida traffic inspector, said, “Personnel of Noida Police reached the spot and facilitated vehicular movement. They also ensured smooth traffic in Greater Noida and there was no major traffic jam reported,” he said.However, authorities said, there was no impact of the Bharat Bandh on the markets. Shamim Anwar, spokesperson, GIP Mall, said that the mall was open on Monday. “Shoppers visited the mall like on normal days. We also held a vaccination camp on the premises, which functioned normally,” he said.The DLF Mall of India spokesperson chose not to comment on the issue and just said the mall was open on Monday.SK Jain, president, Sector 18 market association, said that there are around 500 shops in the market and most of them were open. “The retailers did not participate in this Bandh. This is not our issue and hence all the shops were open. Also, the farmers or anyone else did not come to the market to enforce the closure,” he said.Jain said that the markets had already remained closed for several months when pandemic-related restrictions were in force since March last year, leading to severe financial losses. He said closing shops again, even for a day, would lead to difficulties for traders.Similarly, there was no impact of Bandh at the Atta Market in Sector 27. CB Jha, president of Atta Market association, said that the market functioned normally on Monday. “There are 700 shops in the market and most were open. There was good footfall as well,” he said.Sunil Pradhan, the media in-charge of Bhartiya Kisan Union-Tikait (a farmers’ group headed by Rakesh Tikait, a farmer leader), said that farmers gathered at Pari Chowk at 10am. “We protested there from 10am to 1.30pm against the farm laws. We also parked our tractors on the road, which halted Noida-Greater Noida traffic for some time,” he said.Pawan Khatana, BKU-Tikait spokesperson, said farmers also protested against the Greater Noida authority because the authority acquired farmers’ land nearly 10 years ago but have not yet met their demands. “The farmers have not got increased compensation or developed land. There are several companies and factories in Noida and Greater Noida. People from other states and districts get jobs here but our children are not given jobs,” he said.Since November last year, farmers, under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, have been protesting against three new farm laws--The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act--at the Capital’s borders. They have been demanding the rollback of the laws and the creation of a new law on minimum support price (MSP).“If need be, we will continue our ongoing protest for the next 10 years. People will say that the Bharat Bandh was a flop, but it is not the case. It has been successful. As part of the protest, we only held up roads and it was not like sealing the roads. If the union agriculture minister calls us for talks, we will go,” said Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union.Farmer union leaders and the Central government have held as many as 11 rounds of talks, but each time the talks have ended in a stalemate.The last time the two parties held talks was on January 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/malls-markets-open-in-noida-despite-bharat-bandh-call-101632767628574.html
28-09-2021||Noida||Abadi land dispute: Protesting farmers break barricades near Noida authority office||Farmers from across Noida removed barricades, broke a gate of the outer periphery, and reached the city authority’s main administrative building in Sector 6 on Monday to protest against the authority and the Uttar Pradesh government over the abadi land dispute.They urged the authority not to touch their extended abadi in villages, while demanding for an additional land compensation, settlement of the land dispute, among other benefits. They have been protesting over the issue since September 1. Police had earmarked a space near the Harola community centre there to maintain a proper vehicular movement in the area during the ongoing protest which usually takes place nearly 800 meters away from the authority office.On Monday afternoon, nearly 1,500 farmers on tractors marched towards the main administrative building, while shouting slogans against the authority and the state government. Police tried to stop them, but the farmers outnumbered them, removed the barricades, and broke the lock of one of the gates on the outer periphery, which leads to the Noida authority’s main administrative building.“Our protest has been going on for 27 days (till Monday), but the Noida authority is not considering our demands seriously, or solving the abadi land dispute. Farmers who gave their land for the development of this well-planned city are facing a lot of difficulties. It seems that the authority is trying to ruin their lives further. But we will not let this happen. Our agitation will continue until all the issues are addressed,” said Anil Yadav, senior farmer leader, who is also leading the protest.Many women farmers, children, and elderly people also joined the protest on Monday. With expanded families, there is no land left for the children in the villages, they said.“There are no drains, sewer lines, clean drinking water, roads, or other basic amenities in our villages. The authority officials are misleading the state government, and are not addressing our grievances,” said Sukhbir Arya, a farmer leader from Bhartiya Kisan Parishad.The authority, however, said it is ready to accept the demands of the farmers within legal limitations. “We have discussed the farmers’ issues many times, and are ready to talk to the farmers. But we cannot accept some of their demands due to legal issues... We can sit and discuss this,” said a Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, the Gautam Budh Nagar additional deputy commissioner of police, Ranvijay Singh, convinced the farmers to return to the Harola protest site. “We have appealed to the farmers to continue their agitation peacefully at the designated site. The farmers agreed to this and returned to the Harola protest site. We hope that the farmers and the authority will resolve the issues amicably, at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/abadi-land-dispute-protesting-farmers-break-barricades-near-noida-authority-office-101632767510768.html

28-09-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Now, bank third party to handle escrow account for realty project||The Greater Noida authority has directly engaged the bank concerned in handling an escrow account opened for a realty project in the city, officials said on Monday.Now, an escrow account will be managed by three parties -- the authority, the developer, and the bank concerned. The move came in a bid to contain fund diversion by the developers, as alleged by many homebuyers during a board meeting held by the Greater Noida authority on September 24, they added. “Earlier, an escrow account was only controlled by the authority and the developer. But now, the bank concerned will become an operator, who will keep a track of the funds collected from a particular realty project. The move is aimed at monitoring funds collected from homebuyers so that it is spent on construction and other essential works. We want to ensure that the pending projects are completed at the earliest,” said Santosh Kumar, officer on special duty, Noida authority.At present, 200 projects are ongoing in Greater Noida, where thousands of housing units have been proposed, said the officials.Earlier, following the Uttar Pradesh government’s order, the Greater Noida authority had given an additional time to the developers to complete and deliver flats to the homebuyers amidst the Covid-19 crisis, pushing the deadline from June to December 31 this year. “If the developers fail to do so, the authority will impose penalties against them,” Kumar added.Homebuyers, however, said that the Greater Noida authority delayed the move by a few years.“If the Uttar Pradesh government or the Greater Noida authority had introduced the escrow account scheme six to seven years ago, the developers would not have been able to misuse the funds of the homebuyers. The escrow account method could have saved thousands of homebuyers as it contains the developers from diverting the funds collected in a realty project. Let’s see how this move helps all,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension flat owners’ welfare association.The confederation of real estate developers’ association of India (CREDAI), a realtor group, has also welcomed the move. “The Greater Noida authority’s decision to engage three parties in escrow was a much-needed step, as it will help in restoring the faith of the homebuyers into the system and the realty sector,” said Prashant Kumar Tiwari, president of CREDAI’s western Uttar Pradesh chapter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-now-bank-third-party-to-handle-escrow-account-for-realty-project-101632767449034.html
28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Bharat Bandh brings life to a standstill in Ludhiana||A year after the Centre passed the three contentious farm laws, protesting farmer unions’ call for a Bharat Bandh received an overwhelming response from residents, transporters, and roadways employees as roads, markets and malls remained deserted on Monday. Amid heavy police deployment, farmers carried out marches in the city and forced those who had opened their businesses to shut them down. Meanwhile, farmers used tractor-trolleys, tippers and other vehicles to block roads, which caused traffic chaos, at around 25 points in and around the city and in rural areas of the district. Protesting farmers blocked all major chowks, intersections and entry points to the city from 6am to 4pm.The areas that were blocked include Ferozepur Road, Bharat Nagar Chowk, Jagraon Bridge, Samrala Chowk, and Jalandhar Bypass, Jodhewal Basti Chowk, Dugri Canal Bridge, Southern Bypass, Sherpur Chowk near Dhandai Bridge, Kohara Chowk, Hambran, Dehlon Main Chowk, Hari Singh Nalwa Chowk in Raikot, Barnala Chowk in Raikot, Ludhiana- Moga GT road near Jagraon, and the toll plaza near Hissowal village.All main markets – Chaura Bazaar, Ghumar Mandi, main Sarabha Nagar market, Model Town, Gol Market, Feroze Gandhi market, Jawahar Nagar camp, BRS Nagar, and Dugri – remained shut as did malls such as Silver Arc, Pavilion, and MBD.While a section of shopkeepers closed their shops to extend support to the farmers’ cause, others shut them down fearing reprisal. Many shopkeepers who have been financially suffering due to the pandemic were also seen sitting outside their shops with half their shutters open in Jawahar Nagar Camp, Chaura Bazar, and Field Ganj. Medical stores and vegetable vendors went about their business as usual. Chaura Bazar shopkeepers association president Parampal Singh Witty said, “Shopkeepers are already struggling due to the pandemic and business is slowly getting back on track. Thus, farmers should not force shopkeepers to shut their businesses. We support farmers and many shopkeepers closed their shops in their support, but those who did not should not be harassed as they are trying to look after their families.” Ghumar Mandi Shopkeepers’ Association president Pawan Batra said the market had remained closed till 4pm in support of the farmers, but had been opened after that. A BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) leader Gurpreet Singh said the call for a ‘bandh’ had received an overwhelming response across the city and urban-area residents had joined the protesting farmers near MBD Mall. “It was never our intention to harass the public. We are glad that tthe shopkeepers extended support to our cause. Residents with emergencies were also allowed to move past the barriers. Our fight is against the Union government and it will continue till the three farm laws are not repealed,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bharat-bandh-brings-life-to-a-standstill-in-ludhiana-101632767333157.html

28-09-2021||Kolkata||‘Drama to get attention’: TMC MP on Dilip Ghosh 'heckled' and ‘abused’ during Bhabanipur campaign||The controversy regarding BJP national vice president Dilip Ghosh’s claim that he was "heckled" by Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers while campaigning for the upcoming Bhabanipur by-poll received fresh fuel after TMC MP Saugata Roy said that Ghosh’s allegations are a “drama to get attention.”Roy told news agency ANI that no harm was done to him as the former saw pictures of Ghosh smiling and “changing Jai Shree Ram.” “All this was a drama to get attention. We want to see a peaceful campaign during whatever time is left,” Roy was quoted as saying.Further elaborating his viewpoint, the TMC MP said that Ghosh went to an area in Kolkata --Jadu Babu Bazar -- where there is resentment against him, thereby paving way for a spontaneous protest against Ghosh’s arrival. “Dilip Ghosh escaped and his security personnel pointed guns at the crowd,” Roy added.Hours earlier, Ghosh alleged that during BJP’s campaign for its Bhabanipur by-poll candidate Priyanka Tibrewal against TMC supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, the workers of the state ruling dispensation hurled abuses at him and one of BJP’s workers was beaten up as well. The BJP national vice president added that the local police didn’t help. The saffron party has since moved to the Election Commission (EC) in order to stop the Bhabanipur by-polls – which Banerjee has to win to continue holding the chief ministerial chair.Also Read | Campaign at Bhawanipore disrupted by TMC demonstration around BJP’s Dilip GhoshDuring the commotion, security personnel of Ghosh had to take him out to safety while two of them were caught pointing their pistols at TMC workers – allegedly to scare them. The former Bengal BJP president also got triggered and shouted back at the crowd.“Today’s incident has proved that the situation is not conducive for holding free and fair polls…However, we will contest if the EC decides to go ahead with the election,” Ghosh said.As many as 80 BJP leaders took part in the campaign rally for Tibrewal in the last push for the Bhabanipur by-poll, while TMC leaders and ministers also campaigned for the same post in support of Banerjee.Following the incident involving Ghosh, many prominent BJP leaders from Bengal, including state’s Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari, Tibrewal and BJP Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta raised their voices.The EC has asked the returning officer to examine the CCTV footage showing Ghosh’s security personnel drawing their guns at the crowd, according to an official who wished to remain anonymous. The EC has also asked for a report on the incident regarding Bhabanipur on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/drama-to-get-attention-tmc-mp-on-dilip-ghosh-heckled-and-abused-101632766351778.html

28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Bharat Bandh: Traffic gridlock keeps Ludhiana cops on toes||Traffic snarls and gridlocks were the order of the day as hundreds of commuters remained stuck throughout the day on Monday. Even after the Bharat Bandh was lifted around 4pm, it took at least two hours for traffic to get back on track. Though most residents stayed home, many were seen stuck on roads due to blockades and had to take multiple detours. Videos of residents struggling to move past the blockades were also widely circulated on social media.The cops were forced to think on their feet as farmers also blocked roads ,which were not on the list of proposed spots. Inner roads also witnessed heavy traffic and chaos was witnessed near Samrala Chowk, Kochar Market Road, near Octroi post, Jalandhar Bypass Chowk, Jagraon Bridge, Dholewal and Sherpur.Traffic was diverted to Ladhowal Bypass from Ladhowal Chowk. As the Bharat Nagar Chowk was blocked, cops shifted traffic to the Ring Road and Jawahar Nagar Chowk. Similarly, traffic on Ferozepur Road was shifted to the Southern Bypass and to the inner roads at Sarabha Nagar and Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar.Sachin Gulati, a resident of Khanna, who was travelling to DMC Hospital, said he was aware of the Bharat Bandh, but had to visit the hospital due to an emergency. “As the protest was scheduled to start at 9am, I left early so that I could reach the hospital on time. Butwhen I reached Ludhiana, I found that the Jagraon Bridge was blocked. So, I took the Bus Stand route from Dholewal Chowk, but as Bharat Nagar Chowk was also blocked, the traffic was diverted via Kochar Market Road,” he said.A Dugri area resident, Dilpreet Singh, who was stuck at the Dugri Canal Bridge, said. “The general public is suffering as farmers have parked tractor-trolleys on the roads. Even the police is not taking action against the protesters as the state government has extended support to the farmers for gaining political mileage.” “Protests should be staged in a way that the public is not harassed, otherwise the farmers will lose the support of residents,” said Parminder Singh, a resident of Salem Tabri area.Joint commissioner of police (JCP, city and traffic) Deepak Pareek said that all necessary arrangements were made and they had chalked out a special diversion plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bharat-bandh-traffic-gridlock-keeps-ludhiana-cops-on-toes-101632766733733.html

In a status report, Director General (Prisons) told justice Mukta Gupta that the inmates would be kept under CCTV surveillance, and that their every move was being monitored closely.The status report was filed in response to a petition by the five inmates of Tihar Jail who sought directions to ensure their safety as well as to restrain the authorities from “threatening/coercing/injuring them with a view to prevent them from seeking justice for themselves and the deceased inmate”.The petitioners, represented by advocate Mehmood Pracha, claimed to be eyewitnesses to the allegedly “brutal murder” of Gujjar. Gujjar, 29, was found dead in his jail cell on August 4.Earlier this month, the court, which has transferred the investigation from Delhi police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), sought a status report from the prison authority on the steps being taken to ensure the safety and security of the witnesses.Two of the petitioners, it was claimed, were the co-inmates of the deceased, and also victims of the same assault while the other three witnessed the alleged assault on Gujjar by prison officials. Justice Gupta, noting the stand, said no further court orders are called for on the petition.The status report said, “Two CCTV cameras are installed inside their (two inmates) cell and 24x7 footage of the cell is being closely monitored by the officials whenever inmates are locked out from their cell, they are escorted by two Tamil Nadu special police personnel. Two CCTV cameras are installed inside the barrack and one camera is installed out the gallery (for the third inmate).”HT reported on September 4 that according to a prison report, between 9.30am on August 3 and 4.50pm on August 4, the time when top Uttar Pradesh gangster Ankit Gujjar got into a scuffle with jail officers and was found unconscious in another part of the prison, CCTV cameras inside ward 1 and 5A of Tihar jail 3 were switched off for “maintenance work”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ankit-gujjar-murder-witnesses-safe-prisons-chief-tells-delhi-high-court-101632766428450.html

28-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Suspected gangster shot dead in Najafgarh||In yet another suspected case of gang war, a 20-year-old alleged criminal was shot dead by two unidentified assailants, who intercepted his car and opened fire at him in southwest Delhi’s Khaira Road near Najafgarh on Monday evening.Eyewitnesses told the police that 8 to 10 rounds were fired by the two attackers, killing the man, identified as Tinku Kharab, on the spot. Kharab was in the driver’s seat, and was alone in his i-20 car. Eight empty cartridges were recovered from the crime scene, police said.The firing and murder incident has taken place three days after notorious gangster, Jitender Maan alias Gogi, was shot dead in a courtroom at Rohini court by two assailants who were dressed like laywers, before they were gunned down by the policemen escorting Gogi. Police are suspecting that Gogi’s murder was a fallout of his decade-long rivalry with gangster Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuriya, who is presently lodged in Mandoli jail.Involved in three criminal cases, including a case of extortion, Kharab is suspected to be a member of a syndicate led by jailed gangster Manjeet Mahal. The gang, which also has Nafe, better known as Mantri, as its key member, has been running a rivalry with Nandu gang that is led by fugitive gangster, Kapil Sangwan, also known as Nandu, since 2015.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said the police control room received a call reporting firing near a school on the Khaira Road. A police team reached there and found a man dead in an i-10 car with multiple bullet injuries.“On local enquiry, it was found that a white Swift Dzire car was chasing the i-20 car bearing Haryana’s registration number. The Dzire car blocked the way, two persons came out of it and opened fire at the victim,” said DCP Meena.Police said the assailants fled in their Dzire car that was probably being driven by a third person. A country-made pistol that one of them used in the firing fell at the crime scene. A case of murder has been registered and several teams formed to identify and nab the killers, the police said.The police are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed on the routes leading to the crime spot. They are also probing the role of Nandu gang behind Kharab’s murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-suspected-gangster-shot-dead-in-najafgarh-101632766128358.html
28-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi high courts to hear a plea seeking better security at city courts||The Delhi high court on Monday agreed to hear a plea seeking enhancement of security in district courts across the city after gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi and two others were shot dead inside a courtroom at the Rohini court complex on Friday.The matter was mentioned urgently before a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh by advocate Richa Singh, counsel for the petitioner.Advocate Singh told the court that she has moved an application for early hearing in the petition pending since 2019, seeking better security at the city courts.The public interest litigation, filed by six law students, mentioned the Rohini court shootout, adding that a counter affidavit was filed by the high court registry and alleged loopholes were pointed out by them.“Your application will come for hearing on Wednesday,” the chief justice said.On Saturday, HT reported that Delhi high court registry on September 4, 2020, highlighted the need for augmenting security at court complexes across the city.The Delhi high court was informed that “in view of the growing requirement the same is required to be strengthened further and there is further need to augment the security arrangement in Rohini court complex”.The high court was also informed that even though the security apparatus e.g. X-ray machines, metal detectors, baggage scanner etc. installed at Rohini court complex are functional, “as on date (Sep 4, 2020) there was a grossly insufficient number of CCTV cameras installed in Rohini court complex”.In her early hearing application, Singh had said, “The writ petition...will take quite considerable time to come up in its own normal turn for hearing before this court. Therefore, the interest of justice demands that the Writ Petition (Civil)... is listed and finally heard at an early time convenient to this court,” the application reads.The PIL highlighted several “crimes” that took place inside the court premises and stated that there has to be an atmosphere of dignity which could be achieved only when security lapses are attended to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-courts-to-hear-a-plea-seeking-better-security-at-city-courts-101632766072012.html
28-09-2021||Delhi||Over 2k children begin classes at schools of specialised excellence in Delhi||Over 2,000 children, who secured admission into the 20 new Schools of Specialised Excellence (SoSEs) and are among the first batch of students studying under the Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) with an International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum, began school on Monday.At an induction ceremony for these students, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia interacted with parents, students, industry experts, and teachers, and said that SoSEs will focus on the development of “out-of-the-box thinking” to prepare students to face the challenges of the future.“Marks shouldn’t be the only criteria for a student’s success. In this uncertain world, a student’s ability to think creatively is what will set him/her apart from others. Covid has shown us that the future is going to be very uncertain. Hence, our students should be prepared to solve challenges which haven’t even arisen yet. They should be ready for the kind of jobs which haven’t been created yet,” said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.SoSEs offer specialised education to students of classes 9 to 12 in four domains — science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); humanities; performing and visual arts; and “high-end 21st-century skills”. The schools are affiliated with the newly formed DBSE which has tied up with IB. The international education board, which has over 190 schools in India, has four dedicated programmes for students aged 3-19 that can be adopted by any school upon gaining authorisation from the board. While the IB board will provide the curriculum framework for the SoSEs, the content will be provided by the education department. School heads said they are waiting clarity on the nature of assessment, academic cycle, and books used for various disciplines. The 20 SoSEs received 26,687 applications in their first admission cycle, out of which 14,245 took the special aptitude test and 2,794 students were selected for the first batch. Sahil Kumar (16), a Class 11 student at SoSE Kalkaji, said that he was looking forward to an educational approach that would prioritise the practical application of skills over rote learning. “We will be familiarised with the IB curriculum as well as lessons that will help us in cracking competitive exams such as NEET and JEE. We have been told that we will be trained by knowledge partners. People usually end up going to Kota for such coaching, but we will be provided with these skills and lessons by the school itself at no extra cost,” said Kumar, who aims to crack the IIT entrance test.Mohammad Adil (16), another Class 11 student, was told by teachers that the school “will encourage critical thinking”. “An analytical approach will help us at every level and unlike other schools, the focus will not be on securing good marks in Board exams alone. I think we will be better prepared as far as competitive exams are concerned,” he said. M Shariq, principal of SoSE Kalkaji, that offers the STEM discipline, said that the school will hold orientations for students in the next few days to familiarise them with the curriculum and teaching methodology. “Our mission is to ensure that students are able to secure ranks in the top 1,000 of various competitive exams. They will get the best of both IB and DBSE at our school. Additional support through knowledge partners will also be provided to students,” said Shariq. Vandana Jha, an Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum (EMC) teacher at the school, said that training sessions for teachers were being conducted to familiarise them with the new approach to teaching and assessment. She said that teachers had been holding sessions with parents as well to answer their questions regarding the course. “This is a new beginning, and the first few days will be used to engage with students and understand their expectations and concerns. While two modules on languages and environment will be based on the IB curriculum, Physics, Chemistry and Maths will be taught in a manner that suits competitive entrances such as IIT and NEET,” said Jha. Preeti Tanwar, who will teach Chemistry to Class 11 and 12 students at SoSE Hari Nagar, said, “The teacher training which began in August focused on how to inculcate information and communication technology tools and engage students in enquiry-based learning... Since there are no rigid learning structures, it allows teachers to engage in such methods more freely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-2k-children-begin-classes-at-schools-of-specialised-excellence-in-delhi-101632765471098.html
28-09-2021||Delhi||Bharat Bandh: Thin crowd at farmer protest sites in Delhi||Even as hundreds of protesters blocked several highways and railway tracks across the country to mark the one-day Bharat Bandh call given by farmers protesting against the three central farm laws, the crowds at the three protest sites of Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri, on Delhi borders, remained relatively thin on Monday.Protesters across the three agitation spots said several among them had camped on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway, as part of the Bharat Bandh blockade, while many others have returned to villages to work in the fields. On Monday, the crowd at the protest site in Singhu, which saw thousands of people between November and February, was sparse.The bandh call, given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a collective of farmer unions, to mark the first anniversary of the enactment of the three farm laws, severely hit vehicular traffic movement in the NCR, especially at the Delhi border points with Gurugram and Ghaziabad.Meanwhile, at the protest sites, farmers said the crowd was relatively more when compared to the past few weeks, but the carriageways that earlier used to be packed with protesters from different parts of the country remained empty on Monday.While a few tractors are still in use at the site to cater to daily needs, many farmers have parked their tractors there, refusing to budge them until the agitation is over.Sukhdev Singh, 30, a farmer from Asarpur in Patiala district of Punjab, said, “What is the point of taking tractors back home if there is no livelihood to sustain? My village panchayat said they will reimburse me if anything happens to my tractor. We will only take it back once the laws are repealed and the agitation ends. The tractor is a symbol of our resistance. ”Inder Singh, a farmer from Nawanshahr in Punjab’s Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district, said, “Agricultural work mainly happens during summers. When we started the protest last winter, it was easier for us to devote time to the agitation. Now that people have to work on their fields, many have gone back home.”Most protesters in Singhu, however, reiterated that their numbers have not dwindled. Ranjot Singh, 20, a farmer from the Ludhiana district of Punjab, said people from outside the farming community showed a lot of interest in the protest when it started in November.“These people visited the protest sites during the winter because it was convenient for them. Now, such crowds have reduced. Only farmers remain and they too have to work on the fields back home ahead of the harvest, which is likely to happen in another 10 days,” he said.Referring to the Republic Day incident and the lathicharge on farmers in Haryana’s Karnal district earlier this month, 62-year-old farmer Inder Singh said, “Every incident of violence on protesters only increases the support for the agitation. We have around 1,800 people in our village and each of them contributed money so that those protesting here do not fall ill.”Singh was talking about the air-conditioned trolley where he was seated along with others from his village. The trolley has a television set, three power points, and light fixtures, and is covered on all sides with tin and fibre sheets. “It cost us around ₹1.5 lakh to arrange this set-up. Now anyone coming from our village can rest here instead of falling sick by sleeping out in the sun,” he said.Since the beginning of summer, the protest site has transformed itself to accommodate multiple such AC trolleys, bamboo shacks with coolers, decorative plants and shrubs, porta cabins, and trolleys with thatched roofs. Most trolleys and tents have been converted into these semi pucca structures to offer protection from the heat and rain.Farmer groups said over 600 protesters have lost their lives in the agitation since November. On Monday, a 54-year-old protester from Kirti Kisan Union died and was taken back to his village in Khela village of Jalandhar district, Punjab.Metro shuts stationThe Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Monday closed its Pandit Shree Ram Sharma station for commuters as a security measure in view of the Bharat Bandh. The station reopened after almost nine hours.The station, which is located on the Delhi-Haryana border, is part of DMRC’s Green line (Kirti Nagar/Inder lok to Brigadier Hoshiar Singh in Bahadurgarh). It is located near the Tikri border, one of the sites for ongoing farmers’ protest.At 8am the DMRC tweeted, “Entry/exit for Pandit Shree Ram Sharma has been closed.” While the station was closed, Metro operations on the Green line were running smoothly. A DMRC official said that the station has been closed as per the suggestion of the security agency. The station was reopened at 4.45 pm, DMRC officials said.Dhaarna Yadav, district transport officer cum secretary, regional transport authority, Jhajjar , said the Pandit Ram Sharma Metro station was closed due to ongoing farmers’ protest, “They have blocked the entry and exit gates of the Metro station along with other railway tracks. The station is near the Tikri border where a large number of farmers have gathered,” she said.Long snarls in trafficA massive jam was seen at Gurugram-Delhi border as vehicles entering the national capital are being checked by Delhi Police and paramilitary personnel. Heavy barricading by the Delhi Police at the Sirhaul toll plaza on Monday morning triggered congestion, with tailbacks stretching for around 2km, up to Shankar Chowk, in Gurugram. It took commuters around 30-45 minutes to cross the stretch during the peak hour, traffic police said.The situation was no different in Ghaziabad. Vehicles queued up for kilometres as protesters occupied the UP-Gate area of the Delhi Meerut Expressway (Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway) from 6am to around 4.15pm. On the Delhi-Meerut Road, connecting Ghaziabad to Meerut, protesting farmers blocked the Duhai area below the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, causing long snarls.Traffic officials said that a group of farmers reached Zero Point with tractors, and that halted vehicular movement for some time on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. The officials also said traffic was slow on the DND Flyway and Chilla border during morning rush hour as Delhi Police set up barricades to check vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bharat-bandh-thin-crowd-at-farmer-protest-sites-in-delhi-many-have-gone-home-for-harvest-say-protesters-101632765228311.html
28-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal launches one-stop app for tourists||The Delhi government on Monday launched a mobile phone app, “Dekho Meri Dilli”, that will act as a one-stop centre for tourism related information and tickets to all major tourist spots in Delhi, including popular market places and eateries. The app, built by the Delhi government’s tourism department, was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday on the occasion of World Tourism Day. The “Dekho Meri Dilli” app offers six unique ways to discover Delhi and helps one plan a city tour ranging from half a day to six days. It also provides access to Google Maps to the required destination, and lists public and paid toilet facilities nearest to the user. After launching the application, Kejriwal said the app has been created with the intention of making tourists stay longer in the city and spend more on various businesses. “This app will be extremely useful to all those who come to Delhi from across the world. Delhi is a historical city, but it is also very modern and technologically driven. If anyone wants to understand the history of this country, they cannot do that without visiting Delhi. Delhi boasts of amazing food, engaging entertainment and the most revered monuments. But until the launch of this app, we lacked information about all of these. Every information about tourism in Delhi will be available on this app in an organised, user-friendly, and effective manner,” Kejriwal said. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the city’s tourism minister, said at present, people or tourists visiting Delhi stay in the capital for an average of 1.5 days. He said the Delhi government aims to increase the average stay of tourists to about 2.5 days. Sisodia said, “The average time that a tourist spends in Delhi is 1.5 days. It seems like a small period of time but those who work in the tourism sector would know how much effort goes into everything. We hope to increase this (average stay) to 2.5 days. Secondly, those who come to see Delhi, the government will provide them with all possible options to travel. Thirdly, for the locals in Delhi, who want to spend weekends in and around the city, we wish to give them options and make their experience of travelling and enjoying in Delhi better.” Senior officials of the tourism department said the app has a unique feature that allows one to browse the list of monuments, eateries, entertainment and recreational sites within a 5km radius of the user’s location. “The app also has information about the nearest public conveniences around the user. This is a first-of-its-kind app in India; only a few cities in developed countries have such apps. We hope that sectors such as food and beverages, and entertainment and hospitality will immensely grow because of this app. With an increase in the scale of tourism in Delhi, we’ll also see a rise in the economy and job offerings,” the chief minister said. The app also has the Google Lens feature integrated into it which allows one to look at Delhi through the Lens. It also has a “Delhi Darshan” video integrated in it, the government later said in a press statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-launches-one-stop-app-for-tourists-101632764868371.html

28-09-2021||Delhi||Nod for dynamic parking norms around Metro stations, multilevel lots in Delhi||The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) has given the final go-ahead for the new “dynamic parking norms” which aims to tackle the issue of traffic congestion by reducing parking space and encourage people to use public transport.Under the policy, which was notified on September 21, buildings near Metro stations and multilevel parking lots will now have 10-30% less parking space than what is allowed under the current policy. A senior official from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said the new rules will be applicable on all sites where the construction has not yet begun.“Even in cases where plans have been approved and construction has not started, the properties can be developed as per revised norms,” the official said.The MoHUA notification states that if a property is located within a walkable distance from a Metro station, the parking requirement within that property will be reduced by 15-30%, depending upon the distance. A maximum of 30% deduction will be available if the property is located within a 500m radius. It drops to 15% if the distance from the Metro station is between 500m and 800m.
28-09-2021||Delhi||Narela, eight others included in list of villages for DDA land pooling policy||The Delhi government has notified nine more villages, including Narela, as development areas for the implementing the land pooling policy, which was notified by DDA in 2018 with the aim to provide planned development and close to 1.7 million dwelling units in the urban extensions to meet the housing requirement in the national Capital. With the latest inclusion, the total number of villages chosen for land pooling will go up to 105.The nine new villages are: Bankner, Holambi Kalan, Bhorgarh, Khera Kalan, Kureni, Mamoorpur, Narela, Mubarakpur Dabas and Barwala. These villages, which fall in the Delhi Development Authority’s planning zone P-I, are in addition to the 95 villages that were urbanised and declared development areas in 2017 for the implementation of the pooling policy.“There is one more village (Naya Bans or Iradat Nagar in northwest Delhi) which is yet to be notified. All these villages are located in the urban extension areas of the city,” said a senior DDA official aware of the development.A senior Delhi government official said though the villages have been declared as development areas, there are some portions of land parcels which have been excluded from the notifications. “Areas where a government project has been approved, forest land, gram sabha land transferred to the government’s revenue department, green belt land, etc are excluded from the notification,” he said. A key objective of the land pooling policy was to do away with the complexities in land acquisition by making the land owners a direct beneficiary of the planned development. So far, the land owners have submitted 6,930.4 hectares to DDA for pooling. However, the agency is yet to operationalise it.This has led to calls for implementing land pooling expediently. Bhupinder Bazad, president of Master Plan committee of Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, an association of land owners in Delhi villages, said DDA should expedite the land survey and planning. “It has been pending for a long time. We want DDA to expedite the survey and planning process so that people in these villages will be able to participate in the land pooling policy,” said Bazad.The land-owning agency is planning to develop three model sectors to operationalise land pooling in Bawana’s sectors 17, 20 and 21, Pooth Khurd and Sultanpur Dabas villages.“The entire area is divided into 109 sectors and on an average each sector is about 250Ha to 350 Ha and is anticipated to accommodate a population of about 80,000 to 100,000,” said a DDA official.Development of NarelaThe notification for Narela village, one of the three sub-cities planned by DDA, will help in planned development of the area, DDA officials said.DDA officials said while land was acquired for the sub-city, some areas couldn’t be acquired after the new Land Acquisition Act (Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013) came into force. “Now, we can plan for the area’s development in a better manner, as we are already working out the details to develop the sub-city as a commercial and institutional hub,” said the official. The land-owning agency has invested heavily in the area with over 25,000 housing units ready or in various stages of construction. The DDA has been struggling to sell its residential units in the area for the past six years.Last year, the land-owning agency hired a consultant to prepare a development plan for the Narela sub-city for effective utilisation of vacant land parcels available with DDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/narela-eight-others-included-in-list-of-villages-for-dda-land-pooling-policy-101632763908641.html
28-09-2021||Delhi||East Delhi residents adopt 1,800 saplings under ‘adopt a tree’ programme||Residents of east Delhi have so far adopted 1,800 saplings under the ‘adopt a tree’ programme launched by the civic body.Under the programme launched by East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), each sapling -- the civic body has identified 15 varieties, including mango, jamun, neem, rudraksha, champa, amla, ashoka, moringa and bottlebrush -- is protected by a meshed tree guard which also mentions the name of the person who has adopted it.EDMC mayor Shyam Sundar Aggarwal said that the corporation has set a target of planting 4,800 saplings under this initiative. “All 64 wards will be covered under this drive and will mainly focus on roadside plantations. We have been continuously encouraging residents to come forward and participate in this drive to make east Delhi area clean and green. The residents can adopt a tree through their area councillors and contribute to environment protection,” he said. RK Singh, the director (horticulture) of EDMC, said that the programme has got financial assistance from the ministry of urban development. “The urban development ministry has allotted us ₹1 crore for this initiative. After identifying the spots of plantation, our staff dig holes for proper plantation by the machines and fill it with proper soil and fertilizers. The name plates of the adopting residents, along with their municipal representatives, are also being displayed on the tree guards,” he said. Singh said that most saplings have been planted in the Karawal Nagar-Bhajanpura road stretch. “We are organising an exhibition on ‘adopt a tree’ programme in several parks of Shahdara, in which other achievements of the EDMC horticulture department will also be highlighted. Additionally, our department is also making benches and other recreative items for parks in Vivek Vihar nursery, using wood from trees that fell during monsoon this year,” he said. Many residents expressed support for the drive. Sunil Kumar of Karawal Nagar, who planted a sampling in August this year, said that watering and nurturing the trees have become a daily routine. “We are enthusiastic about its growth. Recently, one of my friends bought some organic fertiliser from the market, to ensure rapid growth of the plant adopted by him,” he said. Yamuna Vihar resident Dinesh Bisht (68) said that his wife is treating the plant they adopted as a newborn. “We are retired now and our children are well settled. The plant is giving us a sense of parenthood again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/east-delhi-residents-adopt-1-800-saplings-under-adopt-a-tree-programme-101632763368289.html
28-09-2021||Mumbai||Congress’s Rajni Patil elected unopposed to Rajya Sabha after BJP candidate withdrew nomination||After Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) withdrew its candidate for Rajya Sabha (RS) seat, Congress’s Rajani Patil was declared elected unopposed on Monday. In the absence of the required strength in the legislative Assembly, Maharashtra BJP decided to withdraw its candidate Sanjay Upadhyay from the fray.BJP had fielded its Mumbai general secretary and north Indian leader Sanjay Upadhyay as its candidate last week. Upadhyay on Monday withdrew his nomination form at Vidhan Bhavan in Mumbai.BJP decided to withdraw the nomination as it has no numbers in legislative Assembly to elect the RS candidate. Besides its tally of 106 MLAs, the party enjoys the support of around ten more members from smaller parties and independents, which is too less to elect the candidate by polling 145 votes.“After Congress leaders Balasaheb Thorat and Nana Patole requested leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis by personally meeting him to withdraw the candidate, the party decided to pave the way for an unopposed election of Congress candidate. The decision was taken by core committee of state unit of the party. We respected Congress’s request to elect their candidate from the seat fallen vacant because of the demise of the sitting MP,” a statement issued by BJP reads.BJP had picked a north Indian candidate to send out a message in the community ahead of the Assembly polls to Uttar Pradesh and civic body polls in Mumbai early next year. North Indians accounts for more than 20% population of Mumbai.The election was necessitated because of the demise of sitting Congres MP Rajiv Satav, who was 46, died due to the post-Covid complications in Pune in May.“Since there were only two nominations under consideration, we announced Congress candidate elected unopposed after the withdrawal of the other candidate. The swearing in of the newly elected member, will be decided by the Rajya Sabha,” said Rajendra Bhagwat, principal secretary, Maharashtra legislature.Rajni Patil, 62, who is currently the party’s in-charge of Jammu and Kashmir, served as Rajya Sabha MP for five years until April 2018 on the seat fallen vacant after the demise of former Union minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. She was elected to Lok Sabha in 1996 from Beed as a BJP candidate. She is considered to be very close to party president Sonia Gandhi and has been preferred over other aspirants including Mukul Wasnik, Milind Deora among others. The party has believably picked Marathwada leader for the seat represented by Satav, who too was from the region.Upadhyay said, “As per the directives by the party, I have withdrawn my nomination. I am thankful to the party leaders Devendraji Fadnavis, Chandrakantji Patil for the opportunity given to me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congresss-rajni-patil-elected-unopposed-to-rajya-sabha-after-bjp-candidate-withdrew-nomination-101632759287676.html
28-09-2021||Lucknow||Heart disease affects Indians earlier than western counterparts, say doctors||LUCKNOW Prevention and treatment services for cardiovascular diseases have been severely disrupted amid healthcare providers more focused on combating spread of vector-borne and Covid infections, said health experts.“With the growing burden of heart failure in India, there is need to recognise it as a public health priority. However, another barrier to care that needs to be overcome is poor adherence to treatment,” said Dr Nakul Sinha, director, interventional cardiology, Medanta Hospital. Cardiovascular diseases affect Indians at least a decade earlier than their western counterparts, in their most productive years. This worrying trend is attributed to several factors, including stressful lifestyles, poor dietary habits, alcohol or drug misuse and lack of adequate physical activity. Identifying early symptoms of heart failure is essential, said experts. “In our population, up to one-fourth of patients default from treatment, especially once they feel that symptoms have regressed. This non-adherence can snowball into further complications, increasing risk of hospital admissions. Awareness can facilitate early and effective disease management,” said Sinha. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in ankles, legs or the stomach, and difficulty in sleeping. Less typical signs include nocturnal cough, wheezing, loss of appetite and palpitations, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/heart-disease-affects-indians-ahead-of-western-counterparts-say-doctors-101632751128967.html
28-09-2021||World||Here's how fuel shortage crisis is impacting the citizens of the UK||Gas station pumps ran dry in British cities on Monday and vendors rationed sales as a shortage of truckers strained supply chains to breaking point.A post-Brexit shortage of lorry drivers as the Covid-19 pandemic eases has sown chaos through British supply chains in everything from food to fuel, raising the spectre of disruptions and price rises in the run-up to Christmas.Drivers queued for hours to fill their cars at petrol stations that were still selling fuel, albeit often rationed. There were also calls for National Health Service (NHS) staff and other emergency workers to be given priority.Pumps across British cities were either closed or had signs saying fuel was unavailable on Monday, Reuters reporters said, with some limiting the amount of fuel each customer could buy.The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent fuel retailers accounting for 65% of all the 8,380 UK forecourts, said members had reported that 50% to 90% of pumps were dry in some areas.Fuel suppliers said they expected the situation to get back to normal soon."There is plenty of fuel at UK refineries and terminals, and as an industry we are working closely with the government to help ensure fuel is available to be delivered to stations across the country," said a joint statement from the fuel industry, which included the BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil's Esso."As many cars are now holding more fuel than usual, we expect that demand will return to its normal levels in the coming days, easing pressures on fuel station forecourts. We would encourage everyone to buy fuel as they usually would."The industry's message echoed the plea from the government for people not to panic buy. Environment Secretary George Eustice said there was no shortage of fuel and that there were no plans to get the army to drive trucks, though the Ministry of Defence would help with trucker testing.Hauliers, gas stations and retailers said there were no quick fixes, however, as the shortfall of truck drivers - estimated to be around 100,000 - was so acute, and because transporting fuel demands additional training and licensing.Cabbies stay home"We need some calm," Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA, told Reuters. "Please don't panic buy: if people drain the network then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."London taxi driver Paul Kirby said he had visited nine filling stations before finding one that had fuel."I'm okay for the next day or so but then it's going to be completely out of my hands. If I can't get anything, then the cab is going to be parked up," he told Reuters."Probably 50% of my colleagues that I regularly keep in touch with are sitting at home today because they couldn't get fuel at the weekend."For months, supermarkets, processors and farmers have warned that a shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers was straining supply chains.The government on Sunday announced a plan to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers.But Andrzej Dobrowolski, a 44-year-old Pole who owns a construction and transportation firm in Britain, said many drivers would scoff at such a proposal."Boris Johnson is inviting the drivers back and they are laughing," Dobrowolski said. "They are saying: why should they quit their companies in Poland or Bulgaria or Romania or anywhere in the EU for four months?"What the British don't understand is that it's not just the money that's important," he said. "Their offer is at least three years out of date."Amid warnings of a dire winter ahead, some politicians in the European Union linked the supply chain stress to the 2016 Brexit referendum and Britain's subsequent decision to seek a distant relationship with the bloc."The free movement of labour is part of the European Union, and we tried very hard to convince the British not to leave the Union," said Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrat candidate to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor."They decided differently. I hope they will manage the problems coming from that," Scholz said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heres-how-fuel-shortage-crisis-is-impacting-the-citizens-of-the-uk-101632851866345.html
28-09-2021||World||Why are 30,000 posts for minorities lying vacant?: Pak SC slams Imran Khan||The Pakistan Supreme court questioned the Imran Khan government regarding vacancies in posts allotted for minorities. Pakistan chief justice Gulzar Ahmed on Tuesday while hearing a case on the attack on Rahim Yar Khan's Bhong temple enquired about the job quota for the minorities, news agency ANI reported citing news agency Samaa TV.“Nearly 30,000 jobs allocated for minorities are vacant. Why?,” chief justice Ahmed questioned the government. Shoaib Suddle, the chairman of the Minority Commission, told the court that Pakistan has a 5% job quota for minorities. He said that the government did not specify which minority group should be hired.“It doesn't specify whether Hindus, Sikhs, or Christians should be hired,” Suddle told the court. The chief justice then summoned a report from the government on jobs for minorities. He also told the federal government and chief secretaries to cooperate with the commission.The court also said that the Bhong temple has been renovated. The Ganesh temple in Pakistan’s Rahim Yar Khan district was vandalised by several hundred miscreants who were carrying sticks, stones and bricks.Pakistan chief justice Gulzar Ahmed criticised the police and said that their inaction brought shame to the nation while listening to the case earlier this month. The miscreants claimed that they were protesting against the release of an eight-year-old child belonging to the Hindu community who was arrested for allegedly urinating in a local seminary.At least 85 suspects are on trial and were booked by the Pakistan police under anti-terrorism charges and other sections of the Pakistan Penal Code for vandalising the temple.The recent years saw a surge of attacks on minorities and minority places of worship in Pakistan. In December 2020, over a hundred miscreants led by local Muslim clerics had destroyed and set on fire a temple in the Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-are-30-000-posts-for-minorities-lying-vacant-pak-sc-slams-imran-khan-101632850413653.html

He died at 5-15 p.m. (15-15 GMT—20.45 IST).The announcement was made by Cairo Radio.After Cairo Radio had carried a reading from the Koran for 30 minutes, Vice-President Anwar Sadat announced the news of the death.President Nasser, who was 52, had been treated in the Soviet Union for diabetes and a circulatory ailment.He was the most powerful and controversial Arab leader in modern history.There had been no indication of any serious illness which Nasser might have suffered from. He went to Moscow in July this year for treatment of diabetes.” But doctors there said he returned to Cairo in good health.Mr. Sadat said in the death announcement that he could not “find the right words to express the deep sorrow which befell the United Arab Republic and the Arab nations.”Cairo television and radio abruptly halted its regular programmes at 12 a.m. and began broadcasting verses from Koran before the announcement was made.The British telephone service reported from London that all telephone communications with Cairo had been interrupted.

28-09-2021||World||Chinese govt faces public outcry over move to restrict abortions||The Chinese government’s move to reduce the rate of abortions needed for "non-medical reasons" has resulted in public backlash, with many seeing this as an intrusive measure meant to raise the country’s sagging birthrate as part of its three-child policy, according to a media report.China’s central Cabinet, called the State Council, on Monday said it will “reduce the rate of abortions needed for non-medical reasons”, as part of its efforts to improve women’s health, according to a series of new guidelines addressing issues related to women and children in the world's most populous nation.Though lowering the high abortion rate, -- largely driven by a preference for boys over girls -- has been the government policy for decades, the Council's statement drew public attention immediately and was seen by many as restricting women’s rights amid an official drive to boost population growth to address the country’s ageing population.The policy was criticised by the public as a new form of government interference in people’s private family life, after the notorious forced abortions during the implementation of the decades-old one-child policy, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday.“It’s so funny that when they didn’t want so many people, they said fewer kids make you happy for the entire life, and when they wanted it, they said women should consider their health and avoid abortions. In the past, there were women who carried a second child being forced to get abortions, and now are they forcing people to get pregnant?” a user of Weibo (akin to Chinese Twitter) commented.Last month, China’s national legislature, the National People’s Congress (NPC) formally endorsed the three-child policy mooted by the ruling Communist Party, in a major policy shift to prevent a steep decline in birth rates in the country, which has a population of over 1.4 billion.The revised Population and Family Planning Law, which allows Chinese couples to have three children, was passed by the NPC in an apparent attempt to address the reluctance of the Chinese couples to have more children due to mounting costs.The amended law has also passed more social and economic supportive measures to address the concerns.In May this year, the Communist Party approved a relaxation of its strict two-child policy to allow all couples to have up to three children.China permitted all couples to have two children in 2016, scrapping the decades-old one-child policy which policymakers blame for the demographic crisis in the country.Chinese officials claim the one-child policy implemented for over three decades has prevented over 400 million births.Li Ying, a Beijing-based women’s rights lawyer, said amid the authorities’ diametric shift in family planning, it’s natural for women to worry that the authorities may now be imposing restrictions on access to abortions.“The public backlash shows female citizens today have a better awareness of their rights. They want to make their own choices in terms of having babies, not be restricted by a law or regulation,” Li told the South China Morning Post, adding that “they have the freedom to raise children, and the freedom not to as well.”The decision to permit the third child came after a new census this year showed that China's population grew at the slowest pace to 1.412 billion amid official projections that the decline may begin as early as next year.The new census figures revealed that the demographic crisis China faced was expected to deepen as the population above 60 years grew to 264 million, up by 18.7 per cent last year.As the calls for the government to do away with the family planning restrictions grew louder due to concerns that the declining population in the country could result in serious labour shortage, negatively impacting the world's second-largest economy, the ruling Communist Party of China, (CPC) has decided to permit a third child while declining to completely scrap the family planning policy."Data shows the ageing of the Chinese population has further deepened, and we will continue to face the pressure to achieve a long-term balanced population development," Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), said in May this year.The two-child policy failed to enthuse couples to have a second child as fewer opted for the second child, citing heavy expenditure in raising the children.The poor response made Liang Jianzhang, professor at Peking University's School of Economics, suggest to the government to offer parents 1 million yuan (USD 156,000) for each newborn child to shore up the country's declining birth rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-govt-faces-public-outcry-over-move-to-restrict-abortions-101632844873118.html

The shots were given 21 days apart.The FDA has previously said that once the formal submission is completed, the agency will complete its review "likely in a matter of weeks rather than months."The Pfizer vaccine received full, formal approval in the US in August and is therefore technically available to younger children if prescribed by a doctor, but US authorities have cautioned against doing this until the safety data was in.Pfizer and BioNTech are also trialling their vaccine on infants aged six months to two years, and on children aged two to five.Initial data for these groups may come as soon as the "fourth quarter" of the year.In total, 4,500 children aged six months to 11 years were enrolled in the United States, Finland, Poland, and Spain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-submits-data-to-authorise-covid-vaccine-in-children-aged-511-101632837443283.html
28-09-2021||World||Pakistan is home to these 12 foreign terror outfits. 5 of them are India-centric||Pakistan is home to at least 12 US-designated ‘foreign terrorist organisations’ of which five of them are India-centric, according to a new bipartisan Congressional report. These terror groups have broadly, but not exclusively, classified as globally-oriented, Afghanistan oriented, India- and Kashmir-oriented, domestically oriented, and Sectarian (anti-Shia). The report, 'Terrorist and Other Militant Groups in Pakistan, suggests Pakistan is a base of operations or target for numerous armed and non-state militant groups, some of which have existed since the 1980s.Financial Action Task Force (FATF) returned Pakistan to the “grey list” in 2018 after the country was found to have “strategic deficiencies” in countering money laundering and terror financing. Pakistan completed 26 out of 27 assigned “action plan items” but the terror financing watchdog left the status unchanged.Pakistan has been accused of proving assistance to the Taliban that retook the power in Afghanistan last month. Afghan Taliban were named by the US as Special Designated Global Terrorists in 2002. During the two decades of US occupation in Afghanistan, the leadership of the Afghan Taliban was believed to operate mainly from the Balochistan provincial capital of Quetta, as well as in Karachi and Peshawar.Pakistan is home to these 12 terrorist groups:Al Qaeda (AQ) - After US-led forces expelled the terrorist group from Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks, the group has operated primarily from Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Karachi. Since 2011, Al Qaeda has been led by Ayman al-Zawahiri and reportedly maintains supportive ties with many other terrorist groups.Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) - According to the Congressional report, AQIS operates with an estimated several hundred members and has been implicated in terrorist attacks in Pakistan.Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP or IS-K) - The regional affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS, ISIL, or Da’esh) is estimated to have around 1,500-2,200 fighters. Most of the recruits are former members of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). ISIS-K was responsible for the recent suicide bombing outside Kabul airport that claimed dozens of lives.The Haqqani Network - Founded in the late 1980s, the group was designated as a foreign terrorist organisation in 2012. Group founder Jalaluddin Haqqani’s son Sirajuddin has now become Afghanistan’s acting interior minister. With several hundred core members and an estimated 3,000-5,000 armed militants, the Haqqani Network is said to have links with Pakistan’s main intelligence service, a charge Pakistan denies.Lashkar-e-Taiba(LeT) - Formed in the late 1980s in Pakistan, the terrorist group has been responsible for various high-profile attacks including the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai. Lashkar-e-Taiba was designated as an FTO in 2001. It is based in both Pakistan’s Punjab province and in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Jaish-e-Mohammed - The terror organisation was founded by Masood Azhar in 2000 and was designated as an FTO in 2001. Along with LeT, JeM was responsible for the attack on the Indian Parliament. Based in both Pakistan’s Punjab and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, JeM’s several hundred armed supporters operate in India, Afghanistan, and Pakistan while seeking annexation of Kashmir into Pakistan. JeM also has openly declared war on the United States.Hizb-ul Mujahideen - Founded in 1989, the militant wing of Pakistan’s largest Islamist political party was designated as an FTO in 2017. It is one of the largest and oldest terrorist groups operating in Kashmir. Although Kashmir-based, Hizb-ul Mujahideen reportedly has key funding sources in Pakistan.Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) - Pakistan has banned the terror organisation which was formed in 2007. Composed largely of ethnic Pashtun militants, TTP leadership reportedly fled into the border areas of eastern Afghanistan in response to Pakistani military operations in 2014. With suspected links to Al Qaeda, the TTP members seek to defeat Pakistan’s government and establish Sharia law in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) - The ethnic-based separatist group of up to 1,000 armed militants operating mainly in ethnic Baloch areas of Pakistan. It has been responsible for a spate of violence in Balochistan for years.Harakat-ul Jihad Islami - Formed in 1980, the group fought against the Soviet army in Afghanistan in the 1980s and later redirected its efforts toward India. At present, HUJI operates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India, and seeks annexation of Kashmir into Pakistan.Harakat ul-Mujahadeen - Another FTO which was designated and operates mainly from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and from some Pakistani cities. It was responsible for the 1999 hijacking of an Indian airliner, which led to the release of JeM’s future founder from an Indian prison.Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan - This anti-Shia group was established in Pakistan's Punjab in the mid-1980s. It mainly operates in the erstwhile FATA, Punjab, Balochistan, and Karachi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-is-home-to-these-12-foreign-terror-outfits-5-of-them-are-indiacentric-101632832315784.html
28-09-2021||World||China scrambles to tackle ‘unexpected, unprecedented’ electricity shortage||China is scrambling to counter a widening power shortage in the northeast of the country as electricity outages have led to rationing of power at homes, shut down factories and malls, and hit manufacturing. The outages, which began in factories, are worrying authorities ahead of winter when demand peaks as provinces switch on central heating.Shortage of coal supply coupled with rising prices and tougher emission standards are said to be the primary reasons behind the power crunch.Chinese state media reported that rationing of power in households in northeast China has sparked public anger and debates on social media about the country’s power supply and whether authorities are ready to face the sharp increase in demand during the long and harsh winter.The worst-hit provinces are Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning in northeast China, which have experienced “unexpected and unprecedented” power cuts, state media reported.Temperatures in the north and northeast of China have already begun to register sharp drops, reports said.The power crisis in the three provinces in northeast China made it to Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform, drawing around 500 million viewers and over 230,000 comments, the tabloid Global Times reported on Tuesday.Power rationing during peak hours was ordered in many parts of northeast China since late last week, including in cities such as Shenyang and Changchun after the region’s entire power grid was in danger of collapse.“The power-supply shock in the world’s second biggest economy and biggest manufacturer will ripple through and impact global markets,” Reuters quoted analysts from the global financial services group, Nomura, as saying in a September 24 note, warning that global supplies of textiles, toys and machine parts could be affected.State Grid Corporation of China, a major operator of electricity networks, has pledged to ensure that basic electricity demand for daily consumption is met and power cuts are avoided, the Global Times report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-scrambles-to-tackle-unexpected-unprecedented-electricity-shortage-101632828178491.html

Police said there was reason to "believe something has exploded that is not of natural causes."An explosion in an apartment building in Gothenburg, Sweden, injured up to 20 people early on Tuesday morning, according to Swedish media outlets.The explosion occurred in the early hours, and rescue services are still working to put out fires that spread to several apartments, the Swedish news agency TT and public service radio SR reported.What we know so farTT reported the explosion occurred just before 5 a.m. local time (0300 GMT) in the Annedal district in the center of Sweden's second-largest city.Authorities said they had opened an investigation and that though the cause of the blast was not immediately clear, there was reason to "believe something has exploded that is not of natural causes," police spokesperson Thomas Fuxborg told a news conference.A spokesperson for the Sahlgrenska University Hospital said three women and one man were seriously wounded among those hospitalized.Emergency services said they were still working to evacuate people and extinguish fires."Several apartments and stairwells are affected. It is at present unclear what has caused the explosion," said a spokesperson for the emergency services in the wider Gothenburg area, before adding that several hundred people had been evacuated from the vicinity of the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sweden-apartment-building-explosion-leaves-several-injured-101632826192945.html
28-09-2021||World||Taliban-appointed Chancellor bars women from teaching or attending university||Taliban-appointed chancellor of Kabul University has barred women from attending classes or work at the varsity. The rule, said Mohammad Ashraf Ghairat, will be in place "until an Islamic environment is created"."As long as real Islamic environment is not provided for all, women will not be allowed to come to universities or work. Islam first," Ghairat said in a tweet on Monday, reported CNN.Around 70 members of the university's teaching staff have resigned after the Taliban sacked PhD holder Vice-Chancellor Muhammad Osman Baburi and replaced him with Muhammad Ashraf Ghairat, a BA degree holder.The appointment of Ghairat as VC in the biggest university based in Kabul even led to protests on social media. Critics have highlighted a tweet by Ghairat last year in which he justified the killing of journalists.The university was named after former Afghanistan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was killed in a suicide attack in 2009, but the Taliban changed it to Kabul Education University. Local media reported that Afghanistan's ministry of higher education said in a directive that universities are intellectual assets and should not be named after political or ethnic leaders.Since taking over the reins in Afghanistan, Taliban have issued a number of diktats, most of them about confining the movements of women. Earlier this month, news agency Sputnik reported that the Taliban barred female employees from entering the ministry of women affairs in Kabul, allowing only males into the building.The decisions taken by the insurgent group are making true the fears of the international community which said that Afghan women are most likely to face an uncertain future under the Taliban regime.During the previous rule of the Taliban in the 1990s, women were largely confined to their homes. This time, they announced a new government sans any women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibanappointed-chancellor-bars-women-from-teaching-or-attending-university-101632826269969.html
28-09-2021||World||AUKUS can undermine world peace: Labour Party passes motion||The UK’s Opposition Labour Party members have passed an emergency motion declaring the new AUKUS military pact between Australia, UK and the US as a “dangerous move” threatening world peace.The party’s annual conference is underway in the seaside town of Brighton, where members had pushed through the emergency motion on Monday despite the party leadership backing the agreement earlier this month.However, the wider membership passed the motion, 70 per cent to 30 per cent, attacking the Conservative Party Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“Conference believes that in contradiction to Tory PM Johnson’s statement that ‘this will promote stability in the Indo-Pacific region’, in fact, this is a dangerous move which will undermine world peace,” the motion reads.Under the AUKUS alliance, the three nations have agreed to enhance the development of joint capabilities and technology sharing, including a collaboration on future nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy.Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer had backed the alliance when it was announced, saying: “Britain must look after our most important relationships.”The passing of the motion is seen as a reflection of a divide within the Opposition party, with former leader Jeremy Corbyn backed leftist faction pushing through their agenda.It came as Andy McDonald, who was shadow secretary for employment rights in Starmer’s frontline team, stepped down from the post claiming that the party was “more divided than ever”.The conference vote was condemned by one of its affiliate workers' unions, the GMB union, which warned that opposition to the new military agreement would undermine industries and jobs.“This deal could be a real opportunity for UK manufacturing. To dismiss it out of hand is nonsense,” said GMB regional secretary Hazel Nolan.“If it ever wants to be in power, Labour needs to get back to its roots and speak up for jobs and the concerns of working people,” she said.The Labour Party conference, which opened over the weekend, has been seen as the first major test for Starmer’s leadership.He won his first big win when his planned internal party election reforms were passed by the party membership and has insisted that his focus remains on setting the agenda for winning the next general election.His senior shadow minister, foreign secretary Lisa Nandy, made references to her Indian roots and her father who migrated from India to the UK in the 1950s and worked on creating the country’s Race Relations Act.“Almost a century ago the seams of my family were threaded together when the Indian independence campaign, supported by my grandparents, had devastating consequences for Lancashire textile workers,” she recalled.“When the cotton stopped coming, the mills stopped running and the workers went hungry. But members of my family, who worked in those mills, were among those who welcomed Gandhi to Lancashire. Because they knew, as I know, as the first mixed race woman to ever hold this office, that solidarity has power and our struggle is one and the same,” she said.Labour's annual conference will be followed by the Conservative Party conference in Manchester between October 3 and 5. The political parties have resumed their annual tradition of in-person gatherings after a cancellation due to the coronavirus lockdown last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aukus-can-undermine-world-peace-labour-party-passes-motion-101632819005141.html

28-09-2021||World||Almost! How Iceland missed out on having Europe's first female-majority parliament||Iceland seemed to have made history for a brief moment on Sunday when an initial election count appeared to have made the country the first in Europe to win a female-majority parliament. The early projections based on the final results showed that women had won 33 of the 63 seats in the Althing parliament, a remarkable 52 per cent. A later recount, however, soon cleared up the situation and credited the women with 30 seats, or 47.6 per cent. It was announced that Iceland was going to have a male-majority parliament after all.Iceland has long been a pioneer in gender equality and women's rights, so the initial election results were hailed as a landmark moment for progressive politics. According to data compiled by the World Bank, no other European country has had more than 50 per cent of women lawmakers in parliament, but Sweden has now come the closest at 47 per cent.To what extent did the numbers change after the recount?According to public broadcaster RUV, it was understood that a handful of votes had been miscounted in the initial projection of the Saturday ballot for Althing, Iceland's parliament. This affected the distribution of the so-called “compensatory” seats, according to the broadcaster which communicates elections results in an official role. As far as representation in the parliament was concerned, the recount showed that there will be 33 men and 30 women.However, the recount did not affect the overall election results and the distribution of seats. Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir's coalition bloc, which includes the conservative Independence Party and the centre-right Progressive Party along with her Left-Green Movement, won the majority with a total of 37 of the 63 seats in the parliament, boosting its representation from the 33 it held before the vote.But the Left-Green Movement itself won only eight seats, three fewer than in 2017, raising questions about Jakobsdottir's future as prime minister. The largest party remained the Independence Party, whose leader Bjarni Benediktsson – the current finance minister and a former prime minister – has long been eyeing Jakobsdottir's job.Pioneer in gender equalityIceland, unlike some other countries, does not have an actual legal quota on female representation in the parliament, although some parties do require a minimum number of candidates to be women.However, the latest election results are still being called a milestone in gender equality and women's rights, considering the effort put forth by activists in recent years to increase female representation in parliamentary politics. Speaking to the AFP news agency, Icelandic president Gudni Johannesson said, “This is yet another example of how far we have advanced on the road to full gender equality.”Only five other countries around the globe currently have parliaments where women hold at least half the seats, although none of them is in Europe. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, these are – Rwanda (61 per cent), Cuba (53 per cent), Nicaragua (51 per cent), Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates (50 per cent).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-how-iceland-missed-out-on-having-europe-s-first-female-majority-parliament-101632812263957.html

It quoted experts who suggested another way - by attempting a daring and life-threatening journey to escape by land.The experts said that those trying to escape by land could encounter as many as 20 Taliban checkpoint, Fox News report further said. The experts also called for putting pressure on the Taliban or negotiate with the new rulers for a faster escape of the people from there, according to Fox News.John Sifton, the Asia Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch, told the news outlet that it will be a "perilous journey", but the people have "no choice".Fox News report estimated that over 100,000 Afghan partners remain in Afghanistan. There are also about 1,000 green card holders in the war-torn country, the report further claimed.US Representative for Michigan's third congressional district told Fox News that many are hiding in safe houses or are constantly changing locations.Meanwhile, New York Post quoted 28-year-old Mir as saying that Taliban fighters carry out night raids now and take people out. "It has been my third time changing locations in the last couple of months," he told the Post. "I am safe because they haven't located me so far," he added.The United States forces completed the process of leaving Afghanistan on August 31, marking the end of a chaotic and messy exit from America's longest war.Over 120,000 people were evacuated by the United States and its partner nations in the final frantic weeks of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.Afghanistan plunged into crisis last month after Kabul fell to the Taliban and the democratically elected government of former president Ashraf Ghani collapsed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-can-wait-for-airlift-or-experts-on-escaping-taliban-rule-101632814330164.html

The statistics came to the fore by data released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Monday.The number of murders registered in the year 2020 was 21,500, according to the FBI's uniform crime report. This is 4,901 more than the 2019 data, said the FBI. Out of these, 77 per cent of the murders were committed with a firearm, up from 74 per cent in 2019, the report further showed.However, the total number of such killings still remained below that of the 1980s when homicides stayed above 23,000 a year as drug wars played out in many places in the US, the FBI data further showed.The FBI said that 16,000 federal, state, county, city, university, college and tribal agencies have submitted data to the crime report.Though there is no single explanation in the report for the rise in such heinous crimes, experts point to the destabilising impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and a rise in gun sales.“This jump in murders is just the latest proof that we are experiencing a gun violence epidemic within the Covid-19 pandemic,” John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement. “This death spiral will continue until we stem the flow of illegal guns and invest in proven intervention programs.”According to World Bank figures, there were 6.5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in the United States in 2018, compared with 35 in Mexico, 27 in Brazil, eight in Russia and one per 100,000 in France and Germany.The FBI report further showed that violent crimes in 2020 went up by 5.6 per cent over the previous year while property crimes continued a nearly two-decade decline, falling 7.8 per cent. Robbery and rape dropped 9.3 per cent and 12 per cent respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/murders-rose-30-in-united-states-in-2020-shows-fbi-report-101632812182863.html

The report showed that after the United States military withdrew from war-torn Afghanistan and the Taliban seized Kabul, deadly terrorist attacks in Pakistan increased to their highest level in more than four years, signalling growing instability in the region that experts say could come back to bite Islamabad.Also Read | Factional fighting hits Taliban govt, differences are over PakistanAs per its latest review, seen by the Bloomberg news agency – Pakistan saw at least 35 terror attacks that killed 52 civilians in August alone, the highest since February 2017. Most of these attacks have been attributed to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot terror outfit of the Taliban, which is believed to have been ‘encouraged’ by the developments next door. The South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP) is the largest website on terrorism and low-intensity warfare in South Asia; it creates the database and analytic context for research and analysis of all extremist movements in the region.The TTP, alternatively referred to as the ‘Pakistani Taliban’ has a stated aim to overthrow the government in Islamabad by waging a violent military campaign against the state. It maintains ties with several other terror outfits, including but not limited to al-Qaeda. According to experts, this fringe militant group was “emboldened further by what happened in Afghanistan”.“The terrorist group had already been growing stronger much before the situation in Afghanistan with splinter groups merging over the past year or so,” Umar Karim, a visiting fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, told the Bloomberg agency over the phone.Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said that although Pakistan is not talking about it openly, Islamabad is concerned about the re-emergence of the Pakistani Taliban threat, which had earlier been suppressed by a combination of domestic military operations and US drone strikes.Also Read | Pakistan involved in harbouring Taliban, must 'line up’: BlinkenThe development comes amid a precarious situation for Pakistan, which was criticised heavily across global quarters for encouraging the Taliban offensive against the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani government in Afghanistan, in the hopes of gaining favour among the ranks of the new rulers in Kabul and keep its neighbours uncomfortable in the process. But so far, the newfound Taliban regime has only led to more discomfort for Islamabad. The militants, after sweeping to power, freed several terrorists wanted by the Pakistan government from jails in Afghanistan.Terrorists firing from Afghanistan killed two Pakistani soldiers and left many injured in a clash last month. Seven other soldiers died earlier in September when the Pakistani army attacked terrorists in South Waziristan, according to a statement sent by the army’s media wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-taliban-takeover-of-afghanistan-terror-attacks-in-pakistan-highest-in-4-years-101632806928271.html

28-09-2021||World||In Pakistan, 1.5 million people apply for a peon’s position||Despite Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's claim that the rate of unemployment in the country stands at 6.5 per cent, data shows otherwise. According to the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), the unemployment rate is much higher at 16 per cent. Highlighting the rising rate of unemployment in the county, PIDE said that at least 24 per cent of educated people are jobless at the moment in the country, reported Dawn.The desperate situation is more reflective in the fact that at least 1.5 million people recently applied for a peon's position in a high court advertised recently, reported the Pakistan-based newspaper. Among those who applied for the job were MPhil degree holders.The institute, in its briefing to the Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development, highlighted that 40 per cent of educated—both undergraduate and graduate—were unemployed in the country. The public policy think tank also pointed out that many educated people got themselves enrolled in MPhil studies even as they struggled to bag a better job, suggesting this may be skewing the unemployment rate as the aforesaid people weren't being included in the figures.It also pointed out that no research was being conducted by the government, adding that all such studies were done from abroad. It said several research institutes were operating in the country, but the research purposes were not being fulfilled.Meanwhile, a survey published by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) showed that joblessness in Pakistan has jumped from 5.8 per cent in 2017-18 to 6.9 per cent in 2018-19. The first year of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in power saw an increase in unemployment in the case of both men and women, with the male unemployment rate rising from 5.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent and female unemployment rate jumping from 8.3 per cent to 10 per cent, reported Dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-pakistan-1-5-million-people-apply-for-a-peon-s-position-101632807258905.html

The country's biggest airshow, in the southern coastal city of Zhuhai, comes as Beijing pushes to meet a 2035 deadline to retool its military for modern warfare.China still lags the United States in terms of tech and investment in its war machine, but experts say it is narrowing the gap. A US intelligence report this year flagged China's growing influence as one of America's biggest threats.On Tuesday, a prototype of a new surveillance drone able to carry out attacks – the CH-6 – was among domestic tech unveiled in Zhuhai.With a wingspan of 20.5 metres (67 feet) and 15.8 metres long, the drone can carry missiles and is designed for surveillance and strike operations, according to open-source intelligence agency Janes.Other debutants include the WZ-7 high-altitude drone for border reconnaissance and maritime patrol, as well as the J-16D fighter jet which can jam electronic equipment.Both have already entered service with the air force, state media reported."They will play a major role in both the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea," military commentator Song Zhongping told AFP.China claims virtually all of the South China Sea – disputed with several other nations – while Beijing says the self-ruled island of Taiwan is an inviolable part of its territory.China is also "clearly positioning itself to be an alternative supplier" of advanced drones, with relative affordability, said Janes analyst Kelvin Wong.The United States and European countries have been hesitant to supply such equipment outside a select group of partners, he added.Already, Chinese drones have seen combat action in the Middle East, with sales to other regions as well.Similarly, the J-16D shows "overall improvement" in the combat capabilities of the People's Liberation Army, said James Char, a Chinese military expert at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. “This is indeed a significant development since it gives the Chinese military an advantage in terms of conducting aerial electronic warfare over targets that possess significant air defence capabilities,” he said.Under former US president Donald Trump, Washington authorised around $18 billion worth of arms sales to Taiwan, including advanced missile platforms -- sales that have angered Beijing.The J-16D has wingtip pods to disrupt enemy electronic equipment and has drawn comparisons with the US Navy's EA-18G Growler.The airshow, which is usually held every two years, was postponed from last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and is being held before a largely domestic audience due to quarantine and travel restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-drones-to-jets-china-shows-off-its-new-arsenal-in-biggest-airshow-yet-101632805054390.html
28-09-2021||World||US successfully flight tests Raytheon hypersonic weapon||The United States has tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon capable of speeds faster than five times the speed of sound, marking the first successful test of the class of weapon since 2013, the Pentagon said on Monday.The test took place as the United States and its global rivals quicken their pace to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.In July, Russia said it had successfully tested a Tsirkon(Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile, a weapon President Vladimir Putin has touted as part of a new generation of missile systems without equal in the world.The free flight test of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) occurred last week, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, said in a statement."This brings us one step closer to transitioning HAWC to a program of record that offers next generation capability to the U.S. military," said Andrew Knoedler, HAWC program manager in DARPA's Tactical Technology Office. There is no target date for that transition, but Knoedler told Reuters, "we are readying our next vehicles and working toward additional flight tests later in the year."Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kilometers (3,853 miles) per hour."The missile, built by Raytheon Technologies, was released from an aircraft seconds before its Northrop Grumman scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) engine kicked on," DARPA said."The DoD (Department of Defense) has identified hypersonic weapons and counter-hypersonic capabilities as the highest technical priorities for our nation's security," said Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon's Missiles & Defense business unit."The United States, and our allies, must have the ability to deter the use of these weapons and the capabilities to defeat them," he said."Investments in hypersonic strike have begun to pay dividends, answering the progress already made by the likes of Russia and China," Tom Karako, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Reuters.In 2019 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-airshow-raytheon-hypersonic/northrop-engine-teams-with-raytheon-hypersonic-program-idUSKCN1TJ0UJ, Raytheon teamed up with Northrop Grumman to develop and produce engines for hypersonic weapons. Northrop's scramjet engine technology uses the vehicle's high speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion to enable sustained flight at hypersonic speeds."The HAWC vehicle operates best in oxygen-rich atmosphere, where speed and maneuverability make it difficult to detect in a timely way. It could strike targets much more quickly than subsonic missiles and has significant kinetic energy even without high explosives," DARPA said in a statement.Dan Olson, vice president of Northrop Grumman's Weapon Systems Division, said "decades of learning advanced manufacturing techniques and industry partnerships helped us define what is now possible."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-successfully-flight-tests-raytheon-hypersonic-weapon-101632801211811.html
28-09-2021||World||These countries, including North Korea, reported ‘zero’ Covid-19 cases. How true are their claims?||At a time when the coronavirus pandemic has the entire world in a chokehold, there are certain countries where reports say not a single case of infection has been reported in nearly two years. According to a review of data collected by the Johns Hopkins University in Maryland and the World Health Organization (WHO), there are five countries – three of them isolated islands in the Pacific, Turkmenistan, and North Korea – where not even a single Covid-19 case has been reported so far. Further fuelling this idea, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also claimed that the frontiers of his country are safe from the coronavirus pandemic. However, given that it is notoriously difficult to get proper facts out of the East Asian country without bypassing its state control, several experts have doubted this claim, pointing out that Pyongyang simply chose not to disclose reports regarding its actual Covid-19 tally.Also Read | Covid-19 slashed life expectancy by most since World War II: Oxford studyHere's examining the reports which claim the coronavirus pandemic has not touched a single human soul in certain countries:TurkmenistanTurkmenistan insists that none of its residents have contracted the coronavirus disease so far, in the nearly two years since the Covid-19 pandemic began. The country's president Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who has ruled since 2006, told the United Nations in an address earlier this week that any reports of Covid-19 in his country are “fake” and that the response to this pandemic should not be “politicised”.However, independent activists cited by the CNN news network said that the Turkmenistan government, “secretive” and “authoritarian”, is suppressing data to hide the fact that hospitals and medical health professionals in the central Asian country are actually being overwhelmed with the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Ruslan Myatiev, an exile from Turkmenistan and editor of the Netherlands-based independent news organisation Turkmen News, said that the “repressive” president of the former Soviet nation was downplaying the Covid-19 threat in order to protect his image.Myatiev has personally assembled the names of more than 60 people – including doctors, artists, and teachers – whose families have corroborated the reports of their deaths from the deadly virus.North KoreaNorth Korea told the World Health Organization in June that it tested more than 30,000 people for Covid-19 till that month but found not a single case of the virus. The isolated and secretive state has banned tourists and severely restricted cross-border traffic and trade to stop the virus.Also Read | Kim Jong Un orders stricter Covid-19 steps after North Korea shuns vaccinesBut many experts doubt the North Korean dictatorship's claim that it has not found a single case of the virus. They say the country's poor health infrastructure and porous border with China — its major ally and economic lifeline — mean that some people would have caught the infection.Recent footage of North Korean soldiers goose-stepping in hazmat suits through capital Pyongyang on its founding anniversary sent an ominous indicator. North Korea's population is estimated at about 25 million, and although no one knows the exact extent of the infection rate, experts say that the spread of Covid-19 in the country will prove “disastrous”, with its healthcare system not equipped with the proper means to cope with the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/these-countries-including-north-korea-reported-zero-covid-19-cases-how-true-are-their-claims-101632792470396.html

"Child executed in Takhar province by Taliban fighters after his father is suspected of being in the Resistance. #WarCrimes #Afghanistan," Panjshir Observer said in a tweet.The brutal killing of the child is the latest incident of the Taliban's crackdown on Afghans who raised voices against the outfit. The Taliban, who took over the war-torn country on August 15, promised there would be no revenge attacks but in Panjshir—the last province to fall to the Taliban—there have been reports of civilians getting shot as they attempt to escape. ABC, the US broadcast television network, reported last week that members of the resistance force and former government are being targeted in revenge killings across the country. "Five times they attacked my family," a young man from Panjshir told the ABC.Also read | Ghani says Facebook page hacked after post calls for Taliban recognitionAnother Panjshir local resident told the ABC that the Taliban were stopping people to ask them about their associations with the resistance movement or Afghanistan's previous government. "They take our mobiles and check them. If they find a suspicious photo, they kill that person," he said.The Taliban on Monday ordered barbers in the southern Helmand province not to shave or trim beards, claiming their edict is in line with Sharia. The order was issued by the provincial Taliban government's vice and virtue department to barbers in Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital.

It was notorious for enforcing the stricter interpretation of Sharia law and punishing the violators in a manner contradictory to international laws on human rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-kill-child-after-father-suspected-of-being-resistance-force-member-101632795129485.html
28-09-2021||World||China’s electricity crunch is latest supply chain threat to world||China’s energy crisis is shaping up as the latest shock to global supply chains as factories in the world’s biggest exporter are forced to conserve energy by curbing production.The disruption comes as producers and shippers race to meet demand for everything from clothing to toys for the year-end holiday shopping season, grappling with supply lines that have been upended by soaring raw material costs, long delays at ports and shortages of shipping containers. Chinese manufacturers warn that strict measures to cut electricity use will slash output in economic powerhouses like Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces -- which together account for almost a third of the nation’s gross domestic product -- and possibly drive up prices. Local governments are ordering the power cuts as they try to avoid missing targets for reducing energy and emissions intensity, while some are facing an actual lack of electricity. Clark Feng, whose Vita Leisure Co. buys tents and furniture from Chinese manufacturers to sell overseas, said electricity curbs in the eastern province of Zhejiang, where the company is based, have dealt another blow to businesses. Fabric makers in the province that are suffering production halts have started to hike prices and postpone taking new overseas orders, he said.“We were already struggling to ship goods overseas, and now with the production capacity restriction, it’s definitely going to be a huge mess,” said Feng. “We already had to deal with so many uncertain factors, and now there’s one more. It will be harder to deliver orders, especially for the holiday season.”Yiwu Huading Nylon Co. Ltd., a maker of synthetic fabric nylon in Zhejiang, suspended half of its production capacity since Sept. 25 in response to the local government’s order to cut electricity consumption, according to a stock exchange filing Monday. The company expects output to resume from Oct. 1 and said it will look to minimize the impact of the closure.Port DisruptionsThe power problems come after recent port disruptions in China rippled across global supply chains. Part of Ningbo port, one of the world’s busiest, was idled for weeks last month following a Covid outbreak, while Yantian port in Shenzhen was shut in May.The energy crunch will weigh on China’s economy at a time when it’s already slowing because of factors such as stringent virus control measures and tighter restrictions to rein in the property market. Nomura Holdings Ltd., China International Capital Corp. and Morgan Stanley have either downgraded GDP growth forecasts or have warned of lower growth because of the power disruptions.“Global markets will feel the pinch of a shortage of supply from textiles, toys to machine parts,” said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc in Hong Kong. “The hottest topic about China will very soon shift from “Evergrande” to “Power Crunch.”To be sure, the full impact on production remains to be seen. iPhone assembly operations in China are beginning to reduce their energy consumption, Pegatron Corp., a key partner for Apple Inc. and one of the assemblers of its iPhone, said on Monday. The company said it’s taking energy-saving measures to comply with local government policies. Yet the firms responsible for producing the Apple handset have avoided drastic cutbacks in production so far and appear to be getting preferential access to energy in order to keep operations going, according to people familiar with the situation.Authorities are watching for disruption, with the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, saying in an Sunday editorial that the shortages would force companies to raise the prices of goods for Chinese consumers. The government of northeast Liaoning province urged local regulators to prevent power curbs from impacting production and residential use, state broadcaster CCTV reported.With the power crisis moving from the factory floor to people’s homes, electricity utility State Grid Corporation of China said Monday it will try its best to avoid power cuts to meet basic residential demand.Analysts say the power shortages will inevitably impact both heavy industries such as aluminum and steel right through to downstream sectors. In the industrial hub of Guangdong, the provincial energy administration issued a notice Sunday that said large-scale cuts to factories have already been implemented.“No one knows when the supply chain bottleneck will be overcome,” said Hao Hong, head of research and chief strategist at Bocom International. “But it is looking ominous for this winter.”Chen Yubing, manager at Suzhou Berya Textile Technology Co. Ltd., an exporter of polyester and nylon fabric based in Zhejiang, said his company has suffered “huge losses” due to the suspension. The company’s production lines were only allowed to operate three days a week starting from early September and the latest order on Monday means it will be allowed to operate every other day. Half of the company’s sales come from overseas clients.“We have problems delivering some orders already,” Chen said. “All we can do now is wait and negotiate with customers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-electricity-crunch-is-latest-supply-chain-threat-to-world-101632789474866.html
28-09-2021||World||North Korea demands Biden admin to end military exercise with South Korea||North Korea on Monday accused the United States of hostility and demanded the Biden administration permanently end joint military exercises with South Korea even as it continued its recent streak of weapons tests apparently aimed at pressuring Washington and Seoul over slow nuclear diplomacy.North Korean Ambassador Kim Song’s comments on the last day of the U.N. General Assembly came shortly after South Korea’s military said the North fired an unidentified projectile into its eastern waters.The North’s latest test, which followed two previous rounds of missile tests this month, indicated the country is returning to its tried-and-true technique of mixing weapons demonstrations and peace offers to wrest concessions amid long-stalled negotiations over its nuclear weapons program.Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff didn’t immediately say what the North launched in its latest test, which took place early Tuesday on the Korean Peninsula, or how far the weapon flew.Speaking through a translator, Kim justified North Korea’s development of a “war deterrent” as a necessity to defend against U.S. threats, and also accused of South Korea of betraying inter-Korean peace agreements by prioritizing its Western ally over “national harmony.”He demanded that the United States “permanently” stop its military exercises with South Korea, which the North has traditionally described as invasion rehearsals, and end the deployment of U.S. strategic weapons to the Korean Peninsula.“The possible outbreak of a new war on the Korean Peninsula is contained not because of the U.S.’s mercy on the DPRK, it is because our state is growing s reliable deterrent that can control the hostile forces in an attempted military invasion,” Kim said, referring to North Korea by the abbreviation of its formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.He called for the United States to contribute to the peace and stability of the peninsula and the world by withdrawing an "anachronistic, hostile policy towards the DPRK in a bold and complete manner.”North Korea mainly uses the term "hostile policy” to refer to U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program and the joint U.S.-South Korea military drills.“If (the United States) is really desirous of peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula, they should take the first step towards giving up its hostile policy against the DPRK by stopping permanently the joint military exercises and the deployment of all kinds of strategic weapons which are leveled at the DPRK in and around the Korean Peninsula," Kim said.The United States keeps about 28,000 troops in South Korea to help deter potential aggression from North Korea. The allies say their drills are defensive in nature, but they have canceled or downsized them in recent years to create space for diplomacy or in pandemic response.North Korea's nuclear program has seemed to recede in attention at this year's General Assembly in the face of new and broader challenges like COVID-19 and rising U.S.-China tensions, and the meeting ended without meaningful new proposals to break the diplomatic stalemate.But North Korea usually hates being ignored. After months of relative quiet, the country this month tested new cruise missiles it eventually plans to arm with nuclear warheads and launched ballistic missiles from a train. It then offered to improve relations with South Korea if certain conditions are met.Analysts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is using the South’s desire for inter-Korean engagement to pressure Seoul to extract concessions from the Biden administration on his behalf as he renews an attempt to leverage his nuclear weapons for badly needed economic and security benefits.In their speeches at the General Assembly last week, both President Joe Biden and South Korean President Moon Jae-in expressed hopes to diplomatically resolve the standoff with North Korea while sidestepping the fresh tensions created by the North’s latest tests.Biden, whose pullout from Afghanistan underscored a broader shift in U.S. focus from counterterrorism and so-called rogue states like North Korea and Iran to confronting a rising authoritarian superpower in China, said his administration would seek “serious and sustained diplomacy” to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.Moon, who wants North Korea to remain a priority in Washington, made a more ambitious push to break the diplomatic deadlock, calling for the leaders of the Koreas, the United States and China to declare an end to the Korean War. The 1950-53 conflict, in which North Korea and ally China faced off against South Korea and U.S.-led U.N. forces, ended with an armistice, but there was never a peace treaty.North Korea rebuffed Moon’s offer last week, saying such a declaration would end up being a “smokescreen” to cover up U.S. hostility. But Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of the North Korean leader, said her country will take steps to repair ties with the South, and may even discuss another summit between their leaders — if Seoul drops its hostility and public criticism about North Korean military developments.Nuclear negotiations have stalled since the collapse of a meeting between Kim Jong Un and former President Donald Trump in February 2019, when the Americans rejected the North’s demands for a major removal of U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program in exchange for dismantling an aging nuclear facility.Kim in recent political speeches has vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent in face of U.S. pressure. His government has so far rejected the Biden administration’s offer to resume talks without preconditions, saying that Washington must abandon its hostile policy first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-accuses-us-of-hostility-continues-weapons-tests-101632788905889.html
28-09-2021||World||World Rabies Day 2021: Know its history, significance and theme||World Rabies Day is observed on September 28 every year to raise awareness about the impact of the viral disease and how to prevent it. This day is also observed globally to mark the death anniversary of French biologist, microbiologist and chemist, Louis Pasteur, who developed the first rabies vaccine. This is the only global day of action and awareness for rabies prevention.History of World Rabies DayWorld Rabies Day was observed for the first time on September 28, 2007. The event was a collaboration between the Alliance for Rabies Control and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, along with the World Health Organization (WHO). The organisations started observing this day after the world suffered from the adverse effects of rabies.Significance of World Rabies DayWorld Rabies Day is observed every year to raise awareness about the impact of rabies on humans and animals, provide information and advice on how to prevent the disease in at-risk communities and support advocacy for increased efforts in rabies control. It is an important day for the world to acknowledge the terror in people of the disease. The day focuses on better care for animals and spreading knowledge on tackling an adverse situation like rabies.Theme of World Rabies DayThis year, the theme for World Rabies day is ‘Rabies: Facts, not Fear’, based on ending the fear from the people and empowering them with the facts. The theme is aimed at sharing facts about rabies and not spreading fear about the disease by relying on misinformation and myths. Last year, the theme of World Rabies Day was ‘End Rabies: Collaborate, Vaccinate’ and the theme in 2019 was ‘Rabies: Vaccinate to eliminate,’ followed by 2018's theme which was ‘Rabies: Share the message, save a life’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-rabies-day-2021-know-its-history-significance-and-theme-101632785868467.html
28-09-2021||World||R Kelly convicted in sex trafficking trial||R Kelly was convicted by a federal jury on Monday in his sex trafficking trial, where prosecutors accused the R&B singer of exploiting his stardom over a quarter-century to lure women and underage girls into his orbit for sex.Jurors in Brooklyn federal court deliberated for a little more than a day before voting to convict the 54-year-old Kelly on all nine counts he faced, after a 5-1/2 week trial.Kelly kept his head down as the verdict was read, with his face shielded by a white mask.A woman watching from an overflow courtroom cried as the verdict was read, as did others who had waited to learn Kelly's fate in a park adjacent to the courthouse. One supporter played the singer's music there, including the song "Shut Up."Deveraux Cannick, a lawyer for Kelly, told reporters that the defense was disappointed. "I'm sure we'll be appealing," he said.Kelly faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years behind bars, and could face up to life in prison at his May 4, 2022, sentencing.The singer, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is one of the most prominent people tried on sex charges during the #MeToo movement, which amplified accusations that had dogged him since the early 2000s.Like Kelly, many of his accusers were Black, differentiating the case from recent #MeToo convictions of comedian Bill Cosby and movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Cosby's conviction was overturned in June.Kelly also had Black supporters.One, Sylvia Tumusiime, said in an interview that the verdict left her "angry, upset and seeing that this is white American. White America," after she had attended the entire trial."I'm going to try to raise some money for him to try to get this appeal process started," said Tumusiime, from the state of Georgia. "I'm going hard and I'm not giving up. I'm not."Kelly had been charged with one count of racketeering and eight counts of violating the Mann Act, which prohibits transporting people across state lines for prostitution.The racketeering charge gave prosecutors leeway to offer evidence that might otherwise be too old to prosecute."We hope that today's verdict brings some measure of comfort and closure to the victims," Acting US Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis told reporters.SHARING THEIR STORIESProsecutors said Kelly took advantage of his fame and charisma to recruit victims, including some plucked from crowds at his concerts, with the aid of people in his entourage.Witnesses said some victims had hoped Kelly could jumpstart their careers, only to find he demanded their strict obedience and would punish them if they failed.Trial testimony from the 45 government witnesses portrayed, often in graphic detail, an unseemly side to Kelly's 30-year music career, whose highlights include the 1996 Grammy-winning smash "I Believe I Can Fly."Kelly has repeatedly denied sexual abuse accusations.His alleged victims included the late singer Aaliyah, who Kelly briefly and illegally married in 1994 when she was 15. Aaliyah died in a 2001 plane crash.Many accusations against Kelly were included in the January 2019 Lifetime documentary "Surviving R. Kelly.""We commend the survivors for their bravery in speaking out and sharing their stories," Lifetime and the documentary's producers said in a joint statement. "They have opened up important conversations on sexual abuse that needed to happen."Several witnesses testified that Kelly instilled fear if his victims did not fulfill his every need, sexual and otherwise.Jurors heard how Kelly would compel victims to follow "Rob's rules," including that they call him "Daddy" and get permission to eat or go to the bathroom.Witnesses said Kelly pressed accusers to write "apology letters" to potentially absolve him of wrongdoing, and concealed before intercourse that he had contracted herpes.'NO MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'One witness, who identified herself as Sonja, testified she had hoped to interview Kelly for a radio station where she was interning, when he locked her up for at least two days without food or water and then assaulted her."I've been hiding from Robert Kelly in fear," Sonja said in a statement read by her lawyer Gloria Allred. "I'm ready to start living my life free from fear and to start the healing process."Allred alluded after the verdict to Cannick's closing argument where he invoked the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in urging jurors to show courage and acquit Kelly."Despite the fact that he thought he could control all of his victims, he was wrong," Allred told reporters, referring to Kelly. "Based on the evidence, the jury must have concluded that R. Kelly is no Martin Luther King Jr."Kelly did not testify in his defense.His lawyers had sought to portray Kelly's accusers as former fans who felt jilted when they fell from his favor, and that their sex with Kelly was consensual.They also tried to show how some accusers stayed with Kelly long after the alleged abuses began, and questioned why they failed to go to the police or waited years to come forward.On top of the conviction, Kelly still faces federal charges in Chicago on child pornography and obstruction, and state charges in Illinois and Minnesota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/r-kelly-convicted-in-sex-trafficking-trial-101632785635887.html

28-09-2021||World||Joe Biden gets Covid-19 booster shot after authorisation||President Joe Biden joked about his age Monday as he rolled up his sleeve for a Covid-19 booster shot, encouraging Americans to get vaccinated against the virus that has killed 688,000 in the US and for those authorized to get their booster doses for more enduring protection.Days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration recommended a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine for Americans 65 and older and approved them for others with preexisting medical conditions and high-risk work environments, Biden said vaccination was essential to ending the pandemic.“Let me be clear: Boosters are important, but the most important thing we need to do is get more people vaccinated,” Biden said before getting the booster. He added that he did not have side effects after his first or second shots, and hoped for the same experience with his third.Biden, 78, got his first shot on Dec. 21 and his second dose three weeks later, on Jan. 11, along with his wife, Jill Biden. Biden said the first lady, who is 70, would also receive the booster dose, but she was teaching Monday at Northern Virginia Community College, where she is a professor of English.“Now, I know it doesn’t look like it, but I am over 65 — I wish I — way over,” Biden joked. “And that’s why I’m getting my booster shot today."Biden emerged as a champion of booster doses in the summer, as the U.S. experienced a sharp rise in coronavirus cases from the more transmissible delta variant. While the vast majority of cases continue to occur among unvaccinated people, regulators pointed to evidence from Israel and early studies in the U.S. showing that protection against so-called breakthrough cases was vastly improved by a third dose of the Pfizer shot.But the aggressive American push for boosters, before many poorer nations have been able to provide even a modicum of protection for their most vulnerable populations, has drawn the ire of the World Health Organization and some aid groups, which have called on the U.S. to pause third shots to free up supply for the global vaccination effort.Biden said last week that the U.S. was purchasing another 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine — for a total of 1 billion over the coming year — to donate to less well-off nations.“So, we have plenty, plenty of opportunities to make sure we get everyone in the world — to play our part — the largest part in the world of getting everyone vaccinated,” Biden told reporters.Biden continued to take questions from reporters about his vaccination experience, as well as ongoing congressional negotiations about government funding and his efforts to pass both an infrastructure bill and an expansion of the social safety net through the House this week, as a military nurse injected the dose into his arm.On Capitol Hill, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, 79, a polio survivor, encouraged Americans to get vaccinated and revealed he had also received a booster dose Monday.“Like I’ve been saying for months, these safe and effective vaccines are the way to defend ourselves and our families from this terrible virus," he said.Vice President Kamala Harris, 56, received the Moderna vaccine, for which federal regulators have not yet authorized boosters — but they are expected to in the coming weeks. Regulators are also expecting data about the safety and efficacy of a booster for the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot soon.At least 2.66 million Americans have received booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine since mid-August, according to the CDC. About 100 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 through the Pfizer shot. U.S. regulators recommend getting the boosters at least six months after the second shot of the initial two-dose series.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-gets-covid-19-booster-shot-after-authorisation-101632778808484.html
28-09-2021||World||UK puts army on standby as fuel pumps run dry||Britain on Monday put the army on standby to help with the ongoing fuel crisis as fears over tanker driver shortages led to panic buying, leaving many of the country's pumps dry."Limited number of military tanker drivers to be put on a state of readiness and deployed if necessary to further stabilise fuel supply chain," the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said in a statement issued late on Monday.Desperate motorists queued up at fuel pumps across Britain, draining tanks, fraying tempers and prompting calls for the government to use emergency powers to give priority access to healthcare and other essential workers.The government says a lack of tanker drivers to deliver fuel and unprecedented demand is behind the crisis.The military drivers will receive specialised training before deploying if the crisis does not ease in the coming days."While the fuel industry expects demand will return to its normal levels in the coming days, it's right that we take this sensible, precautionary step," said Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng."If required, the deployment of military personnel will provide the supply chain with additional capacity as a temporary measure to help ease pressures caused by spikes in localised demand for fuel," he added.The government has already made a drastic U-turn on tighter post-Brexit immigration policy, offering short-term visa waivers to foreign truckers to help plug the shortfall.Fuel operators, including Shell, BP and Esso, said there was "plenty of fuel at UK refineries" and expected demand to return to normal levels in days, easing pressure."We would encourage everyone to buy fuel as they usually would," they added in a joint statement.But long queues were seen outside filling stations, even overnight, frustrating drivers and stoking concern about the effects on the wider economy."People are desperate. If I don't get petrol now, I can't get work anymore," one driver, David Hart, told AFP as he queued at a garage in London after a fruitless search at the weekend.Britain's biggest public sector union, Unison, said key workers, including doctors, nurses, teachers and police staff, should be given priority access rather than having to wait in line."The government could solve this problem now by using emergency powers to designate fuel stations for the sole use of key workers," said general secretary Christina McAnea.Medical bodies have already said some healthcare staff have struggled to get to work, while schools have warned that online teaching could resume if teachers are unable to reach their classrooms.The Petrol Retailers Association said almost half of the UK's 8,000 fuel pumps had run out of petrol on Sunday, blaming "panic-buying, pure and simple" for the issue. Brexit linkCritics blame government inaction on tackling shortages of lorry drivers after Britain's departure from the European Union in January and the pandemic, which saw many foreign truckers leave the country.As well as fuel deliveries, the shortage has led to empty supermarket shelves and raised fears about deliveries of food and toys for Christmas.Germany's weekend election winner Olaf Scholz linked the problems directly to Brexit and said low wages in the sector could make the job less appealing."We worked hard to convince the British not to leave the union," Scholz said.The situation has evoked the dark days of the 1970s, when energy supply problems led to a three-day working week and fuel rationing in Britain.It is reminiscent also of late 2000, when people protesting over high fuel prices blockaded oil refineries, bringing the country to a virtual standstill for weeks.The government called for calm and urged people to buy petrol as normal.Too little, too late?The government, which campaigned during Brexit for an end to European free movement, is banking on a short-term visa waiver to plug the gap in drivers, which it says is a Europe-wide problem.It said on Saturday it will issue up to 10,500 temporary work visas from next month to December 24 to lorry drivers and poultry workers to ease chronic staff shortages.The head of the British Poultry Council, Richard Griffiths, welcomed the move but warned it could be too little, too late to avert food shortages."Supply chains are not something that can be simply switched on and off, so plans for production are already well under way and the necessary cutbacks due to ongoing labour shortages have already been made," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-puts-army-on-standby-as-fuel-pumps-run-dry-101632778344679.html
28-09-2021||World||UK govt considers calling in army to ease shortages at fuel stations||Long lines of cars formed at British gas stations for a fourth day on Monday, as the government mulled sending in the army to help ease the supply disruptions, triggered by a shortage of truck drivers.As unions called for emergency workers to be given priority for fuel supplies, Petrol Retailers’ Association (PRA) chairman Brian Madderson said training had been taking place “in the background” for military personnel to drive tankers.The British government said it had “no plans at the moment” to deploy troops, but was making preparations, just in case the move is necessary. Ministers were meeting on Monday to discuss the fuel squeeze.The PRA, which represents almost 5,500 independent outlets, said on Sunday that about two-thirds of its members had run out of fuel, as the truck driver shortage set off rounds of gas panic-buying.Long lines of vehicles have formed at many gas stations across Britain since Friday, causing spillover traffic jams on busy roads. Tempers have frayed as some drivers have been waiting in queues for hours.Olaf Scholz, leader of Germany’s Social Democrats, the party that came first in the country’s election on Sunday, linked Britain’s worker shortages to Brexit.“The free movement of labour is part of the European Union, and we worked very hard to convince the British to not leave the union,” he said.“Now they decided different, and I hope they will manage the problems coming from that.”French European Affairs minister Clement Beaune said on Monday that the petrol station problem currently faced by Britain reflected the “intellectual fraud” that was Brexit.“Every day, we see the intellectual fraud that was Brexit,” Beaune told France 2 television on Monday in sharp remarks on the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-govt-considers-calling-in-army-to-ease-shortages-at-fuel-stations-101632773799254.html
28-09-2021||World||Pfizer begins testing of Covid pill as preventive medicine to ward off virus from an infected person||Pfizer has started testing its potential Covid-19 treatment as a preventive medicine aimed at warding off the virus if a close contact gets it.The drug maker said Monday that it will study the pill it is developing in combination with a low dose of the HIV drug ritonavir in people who are at least 18 years old and live in the same household with someone who is infected.Pfizer plans to enroll 2,660 people in the late-stage study. Those participating will get either the treatment combination or a fake drug orally twice a day for five to 10 days.Researchers expect that the use of ritonavir will help slow the breakdown of the potential treatment so it remains active longer to help fight the virus.“If successful, we believe this therapy could help stop the virus early – before it has had a chance to replicate extensively,” Pfizer chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten said in a statement from the drug maker.Pfizer Inc. also is studying its potential treatment in people who are already infected with the virus. It’s designed to be prescribed at the first sign of infection without requiring patients to be hospitalized. The drug maker expects to see results from those studies by the end of the year.The pill aims to block a key enzyme that the virus needs to replicate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-begins-testing-of-covid-pill-as-preventive-medicine-to-ward-off-virus-101632767095082.html

An IMD official told Hindustan Times that a red alert has been issued for South Bengal, including East Medinipur, West Medinipur, and South 24 Parganas.According to the IMD bulletin, the low-pressure over Vidarbha is expected to move northwestwards and weaken gradually in the next 24 hours. However, the weather department made a  forecast that this low-pressure will emerge into Arabian Sea and adjoining Gujarat coastal regions around September 30, thereby paving way for it to intensify into yet another depression over the Arabian Sea.Also Read | Visakhapatnam airport almost submerged as Cyclone Gulab triggers heavy rainThis forecast follows close on the heels of Cyclone Gulab’s landfall in Andhra Pradesh on September 26, which also impacted Odisha. As many as three people were killed in the two states, while heavy rainfall has been continuing in several other states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat as the cyclone weakened into a depression during the afternoon of Monday.In view of the red alert issued in Bengal, 35,000 people have been evacuated from low-lying areas in South 24 Parganas.Here are the IMD alerts for five states who are likely to receive heavy rainfall till September 30:1.     According to the IMD bulletin, heavy to very rainfall with extremely heavy downpour at isolated places is very likely over Gujarat on September 29.2.     Heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places is very likely over Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, north-central Maharashtra, and north Konkan on September 29. Marathwada – which, along with Konkan, is located in Maharashtra, is expected to receive heavy downpour at isolated places on September 29.3.     The IMD bulletin has forecasted heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Saurashtra and Kutch in Gujarat on September 30. Isolated places over Gangetic West Bengal, Gujarat and Odisha are also likely to receive heavy rainfall on September 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-gulab-weakened-into-low-pressure-to-bring-heavy-rainfall-in-5-states-101632852906457.html
28-09-2021||India||Post-poll violence: SC admits Bengal plea over Calcutta HC order||The Supreme Court on Tuesday admitted the West Bengal government’s plea challenging the Calcutta high court’s order for a CBI investigation into the post-poll violence in the state. However, it did not bar the central agency from filing fresh cases. A bench of justices Vineet Saran and Aniruddha Bose said the state government’s case for an appeal against the high court’s August 19 order was made out. But when senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the West Bengal government, asked the court to consider issuing an order that “further investigation by CBI shall be subject to the outcome of the appeals”, the court refused to do so and instead posted the matter for hearing on October 7. “Nothing is going to happen in one week,” the bench said as it sought responses from the central government, Election Commission of India, National Human Rights Commission, and West Bengal Human Rights Commission. It also sent a notice to Priyanka Tibrewal of the Bharatiya Janata Party, one of the petitioners before the Calcutta high court who is contesting the by-elections against chief minister Mamata Banerjee at Bhabanipur on September 30.Earlier in the day, the top court asked the West Bengal government to briefly indicate the reasons for their challenging the HC order. Sibal crystallised his arguments into seven points, which the bench referred to as the “lucky seven”.The moot point was the definition of what constituted “post poll violence”. Sibal asked the court to fix the time period of “post poll”. The state argued that the HC considered complaints just after May 2 when the model code of conduct was in vogue and the Election Commission was responsible for maintaining law and order. But more complaints continued to be filed that extended from May 5, when Mamata Banerjee was sworn in as chief minister, up to July. Sibal also argued that the seven-member committee set up by the National Human Rights Commission on the direction of the HC whose report formed the basis of the HC judgment was biased as three lead members of it — Rajiv Jain, Atif Rasheed and Rajulben Desai — had alleged links with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the party in power at the Centre. HC had also set up a special investigation team monitored by former Calcutta HC chief justice Manjula Chellur. “This kind of proceeding has never happened in the past. Some of these members have stated on their Twitter handles their association with BJP. Their report was not shared with the state despite request made to the Court. The chart filed by the state police indicating status of probe into complaints was dismissed as it was not accompanied by an affidavit. The fundamental rule of natural justice was denied to the state,” Sibal submitted before the top court. “The High Court castigates the state and passes strictures against us based on facts gathered by the Committee. This is published in all newspapers and the reputation of the state is at stake. Only way facts can be discovered is through a criminal investigation prescribed under the Code of Criminal Procedure or the Protection of Human Rights Act for probing human rights violations. This Committee had no powers of investigation. And the Court followed a procedure unknown to law,” Sibal said. The state asked the court if it was fair to appoint people affiliated to a political party against another “in a federal system of governance, when electoral battle is bitterly fought between two political parties having ideological differences”. “Nobody knows the remit of this Committee and despite no direction to submit interim report, the Committee submits one and it is relied upon by the Court treating allegations in complaints as established facts. It is hard to understand how this bifurcation is made by which rape and murder cases go to CBI while all other cases of violence are with SIT,” Sibal added.The state also objected to the HC ordering en masse transfer of complaints pending investigation by the state police without undertaking a case-to-case analysis. The state received over 2,800 complaints that led to 651 criminal cases and 405 non-cognisable reports, but over 1,300 were found to be bogus and dismissed. “The High Court gave the state seven days to come out with the investigation report,” Sibal said, citng the example of Muzaffarnagar riots where the Supreme Court analysed each case probed by Uttar Pradesh Police for over five months. “Can anybody find out the truth of the substance in these thousands of complaints in seven days?” the state questioned. “On the face of it, we find you have made out a case for issuance of notice,” the bench told Sibal, adding that some of the issues raised are “unchartered”. But the court added that it needed to hear the other side too before proceeding with the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/postpoll-violence-sc-admits-bengal-plea-over-calcutta-hc-order-101632853259918.html
28-09-2021||India||White House defends Biden's 'better behaved' remarks about Indian media||The White House has tried to pacify an upset American media over Joe Biden's off the cuff remarks that the Indian press is "better behaved" than their US counterparts, with a senior official saying the President's comments were not meant as a "hard cut" on them.President Biden, during his first in-person bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House on Friday, praised the Indian press, calling it "better behaved" than the US media, criticising American reporters for asking questions that are not "on point" in front of a foreign head of government/state.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Monday faced a number of questions on Biden's comments from American journalists but defended the President's remarks."I think what he said is that they’re not always “on point.” Now, I know that isn’t something that anyone wants to hear here. But what I think he was conveying is, you know, today, he might want to talk about Covid vaccines; some of the questions were about that. He might want to talk about — and some of the questions are not always about the topic he’s talking about that day," Psaki said."I don’t think it was meant to be a hard cut at the members of the media — people he has taken questions from today and on Friday as well," she said.At the White House briefing, another reporter objected to the comparison between Indian and the American media.The reporter said, "The Indian press is ranked 142nd in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), for press freedoms. How does he say that about the US press compared to the Indian press?"To this Psaki said, "I would just say to you that having now worked for the President — serving in this role for nine months, having seen that he’s taking questions from the press more than 140 times… that he certainly respects the role of the press, the role of the freedom of the free press.""We ensure that we have a press with us, of course, when we travel; that we have a press with us for sprays in foreign — in foreign capitals; and we will continue to. And I think that should speak to his commitment to freedom of the press around the world," she said.According to RSF, the US media is ranked 44 for press freedoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/white-house-defends-biden-s-better-behaved-remarks-about-indian-media-101632845932899.html

The decision was taken following a meeting by chief minister MK Stalin along with state officials to control the spread of Covid-19 in the state, the state government said in its order.Already, students belonging to classes 9 to 12 have been attending schools physically from September 1 in the state.1 முதல் 8 ஆம் வகுப்பு மாணவ, மாணவியருக்கான வகுப்புகள், கொரோனா நிலையான வழிகாட்டு நடைமுறைகளைப் பின்பற்றி நவம்பர் 1 ஆம் தேதி முதல் நடத்த அனுமதிக்கப்படும் என மாண்புமிகு முதலமைச்சர் @mkstalin அவர்கள் அறிவித்துள்ளார். #School #lockdown pic.twitter.com/uiXqZDkeQxThe government said that the decision has been made considering the suggestions of medical experts, academicians and parents, who said that the students have been subjected to a lot of stress and learning gaps due to the closure of schools in view of the pandemic. It also said that schools would be allowed to function for classes 1 to 8 following the standard operating procedures (SOP) from November 1 and the school education department should make all the necessary arrangements for the same.Earlier in August, the Tamil Nadu government issued SOP for reopening schools for classes 9 to 12, in which it gave several advisories to the schools such as staggered timetables for classes and 50% attendance. It had also suggested running classes in two shifts in schools where the enrollment is higher and also emphasised on the sanitisation of the premises, wearing facemasks and maintaining social distancing.Also read | Covid-19: These five states are reporting more than 1,000 cases dailyAmong other major announcements, the government said that the Covid-19 restrictions in place in the state have been extended till 6am on October 31.

The collectors have also been asked to hear the grievances of farmers monthly, following Covid appropriate behaviour.Meanwhile, the state has already taken measures considering the upcoming festive season. All social, political and cultural events in the state would continue to remain banned. All places of religious worship have been shut for the public on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and would continue to be so.The announcement came as the Union home ministry wrote to the states urging them to enforce Covid appropriate behaviour to be followed during the festive season. “With the decline in the COVID-19 cases, there is a possibility that Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) is not adhered to strictly, especially during the upcoming festivals. It is therefore critical to enforce adherence to guidelines which allows regular festivities in a cautious, safe and Covid-appropriate manner,” the ministry said.On Tuesday, 1,630 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu and 17 lost their lives as the state’s tally reached 2,660,553 and the death toll climbed to 35,526, a bulletin from the health department showed.

The saga was kickstarted by Navjot Singh Sidhu, who submitted his resignation as the party’s state unit chief earlier in the day. In his resignation letter addressed to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Sidhu cited being required to “compromise” as the reason behind his move that shocked the state’s political fraternity.“The collapse of a man’s character stems from the compromise corner; I can never compromise on Punjab's future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab,” his letter read.However, Sidhu noted that he will continue to serve the party.The cricketer-turned-politician’s exit garnered widespread reactions, including former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh who stressed on his viewpoint that Sidhu is “not a stable man.” “I told you so…he is…not fit for the border state of Punjab,” Captain tweeted without naming or tagging anyone.Meanwhile, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi – who was Sidhu’s choice in the top post of the state cabinet, said that all issues that “upset” the latter will be “settled.” Channi, however, cleared the air around himself, saying that Sidhu is “not upset with him.”

28-09-2021||India||Section 144 imposed in poll-bound Bhabanipur till voting ends on September 30||Ahead of the crucial Bhabanipur bypolls, the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday imposed Section 144 in the assembly constituency in the heart of Kolkata. The prohibitory order against the assembly of five or more people will remain in force from 6:30pm on Tuesday till the end of the poll on September 30, the EC notification stated. The Bhabanipur assembly bypoll was necessitated after West Bengal agriculture minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay vacated the seat recently.Although Trinamool Congress won the assembly elections with a thumping majority and formed the government in West Bengal for the third consecutive time, chief minister Mamata Banerjee lost against Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Suvendu Adhikari from Nandigram assembly constituency. Chattopadhyay’s resignation paved the way for Banerjee to contest from the seat she had won in the 2011 and 2016 elections, to continue to hold the chief ministerial post.Meanwhile, the BJP accused the Trinamool Congress of fanning violence ahead of the bypolls. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh alleged that he was attacked by TMC workers during the last day of the campaign for the September 30 bypoll. He also alleged that one of the BJP workers who were accompanying him during campaigning was also beaten up. On the other hand, the Trinamool Congress rubbished the charges and said the BJP was trying to foment unrest ahead of the polls.Subsequently, the West Bengal BJP unit wrote to the Chief Electoral Officer of the state demanding a ‘free and fair’ poll in the Bhabanipur constituency. In the letter, the BJP also alleged that its candidate for the Bhabanipur bypoll, Priyanka Tibrewal, was "molested" by the deputy commissioner of police of Kolkata's South division.The BJP urged the EC to impose Section 144 in the constituency to ensure no untoward incident or malpractice takes place during polling.Calcutta high court orders Bhabanipur by-poll to be held as scheduledThe Calcutta high court on Tuesday refused to stay the September 30 Bhabanipur bypoll, stating that the information furnished by the chief secretary of the state to the Election Commission was contrary to the facts regarding Covid-19 restrictions that had been extended up to September 30.However, the bench, headed by Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj, observed: "We record our strong reservation about the conduct of the Chief Secretary in writing a letter to the Election Commission stating that there would be 'constitutional crisis' in case by-election to the Bhabanipur Constituency is not held."The court further said that what constitutional crisis the government could face with one person losing or winning the election, was not explained.Bypoll will be held in the Bhabanipur constituency on September 30 and results will be declared by October 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/section-144-imposed-in-poll-bound-bhabanipur-till-voting-ends-on-september-30-101632839623714.html
28-09-2021||India||In Kanhaiya’s inaugural speech, a dash of new lingo and call for greater unity||Announcing that India needs Bhagat Singh’s courage, Mahatma Gandhi’s unity, and BR Ambedkar’s equality, Kanhaiya Kumar, one of India’s prominent young politicians, joined the Congress from the oldest Communist party on Tuesday.His entry marked a new chapter in the Congress’ efforts to unite forces from different spectrums of polity to take on the formidable Bharatiya Janata Party led by PM Narendra Modi. Kanhaiya’s inaugural speech, a dash of a new lingo invoking a host of freedom fighters and a call for greater unity, repeatedly mentioned “this is time for urgency” and hailed the Congress as the only force that “can lead in this ideological war to save the idea of India.”He also clarified, “I alone can’t do anything,” echoed many pet talking points of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and pointed out that “out of 545 Lok Sabha seats, 200 seats are where the Congress is in a direct fight with the BJP.”Independent MLA in Gujarat, Jignesh Mevani, sitting beside Kumar, also pledged support to the Congress. He didn’t officially join the party as it would result in losing his assembly membership. But the entry of these two firebrand young leaders was a welcome relief for the Congress that has lost at least three key young leaders such as Jyotiraditya Scindia, Himanta Biswa Sharma and Jitin Prasad in recent years to the BJP. Both Mevani and Kumar harped on the need for larger participation of people. While the Gujarat MLA hoped to create the “charm and ambience of the freedom struggle”, Kumar said, “when the entire shopping mall is on fire, you can’t save your shop” indicating a larger fight against the BJP.Kumar wasted no time in hitting out at the Sangh Parivar and even compared PM Modi with Bollywood actor Govinda for frequently changing attires. “Which pariwar would ask people to shun their families to join the pariwar?” he said, hinting at the RSS. He invoked Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Azad, Sarojini Naidu, Jagjivan Ram Bhagat Singh, Ashfakulla Khan, Buddha, Kabir, Nanak and said, “Many people felt if the Congress doesn’t survive, the country won’t survive.”Mevani claimed that “the story that started in Gujarat” has now led to devastation in the country. “It’s a war against democracy, Constitution and idea of India,” the MLA said, “If we have to save all these, we have to be a part of the party that fought freedom struggle.” He also announced that he will fight the next assembly election, due next year, on the Congress ticket. He acknowledged that he was “born” in the CPI, but left it as “we need to speed up our struggle and open up our ideological barrier.” Kumar announced that he doesn’t take the BJP seriously and quipped, “Those who sought clemency, have now become Veer (a dig at Savarkar). Those who vowed to create a Godse’s India, are now chanting Gandhi’s name” to underline how the political legacy is now being diluted. He announced that he will be taking some responsibility in the organization. Both Mevani and Kumar repeatedly referred to Rahul Gandhi and echoed his lines. Congress general secretary (organization) KC Venugopal described Kumar as “a symbol of fighting freedom of expression” and said, “the way he fought against fundamentalism throughout his student period, his joining will enthuse cadre of Congress party.”“Jignesh is also fighting for the same cause. Jignesh believed in Congress ideology to carry everybody along. It will give a very strong message that young people fighting for needy, poor people, fighting for freedom, non-violence are joining the Congress,” he said. Mevani presented a copy of the Indian Constitution to Rahul Gandhi while Kanhaiya gave him a photo of Mahatma Gandhi, Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kanhaiya-s-inaugural-speech-a-dash-of-new-lingo-and-call-for-greater-unity-101632839940916.html

Mevani was in Delhi along with the former Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Kanhaiya Kumar, with the latter joining Congress in the presence of former party president Rahul Gandhi.Addressing a media briefing, Mevani said that he might not have continued as an independent MLA, had he joined the party. The convener of the Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch was referring to the anti-defection law under which an independent lawmaker becomes disqualified if the person joins a political party after the election. Mevani, however, stressed that he is ideologically aligned with Congress.“I could not join the Congress formally due to technical reasons. I am an independent MLA, if I join a party, I may not continue as an MLA... I am part of the Congress ideologically, will fight the upcoming Gujarat polls from Congress symbol,” the Gujarat lawmaker from Vadgam constituency said.“To save democracy and the idea of India, I have to be with a party that lead the Independence struggle and dragged the British out of the country. This is why I am here with the Congress today,” he added.In the 2017 Gujarat Assembly elections, Mevani had contested from Vadagam seat of Banaskantha district as an independent candidate had but received outside support from Congress. Then sitting Congress MLA Manibhai Vaghela said that the party's state unit had asked him to contest from the seat, reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC), “as a part of an agreement” with Mevani.Kanhaiya Kumar told the press conference that Congress is like a “big ship” that can protect the aspirations of Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh and BR Ambedkar.“Congress party is like a big ship. If it's saved, I believe many people's aspirations, Mahatma Gandhi's oneness, Bhagat Singh's courage & BR Ambedkar's idea of equality will be protected too. This is why I have joined it,” the former JNU student union president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-i-join-jignesh-mevani-cites-this-reason-for-not-joining-congress-101632837850697.html

It eased the restrictions on flights in certain countries with which India has had an air bubble arrangement during the past year.The air bubble pact between the two countries allows the operation of special international flights by the national carrier between their territories. India has formed air bubble pacts with around 25 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, the Maldives, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Qatar and Bhutan.India was considering lifting the restrictions on international commercial flights on September 30. However, it extended the ban in the face of a looming threat of the third wave of infection and the rising cases of the Delta variant of the Covid-19 in several countries.Even as the restrictions on international air travel continued, India allowed operating special flights on specific routes, especially to repatriate stranded citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-suspension-of-international-flights-extended-till-october-31-101632836954203.html

It also asked them to take proactive containment measures in districts with a high positivity rate. “It is important to identify warning signs of potential surges early on and to take appropriate measures to curb the spread. This would require a localized approach,” the letter said.It also said that administrations should not divert from the main tenets of containment of Covid-19 which is — Test-Track-Treat-Vaccination-Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.

Before that, Singh made a number of rounds to the national capital to meet the top brass of the Congress party which stepped in to end the infighting and present a united front ahead of assembly elections in Punjab.Part of the plan devised by the high command to calm the tempers in Punjab was to elevate Sidhu as chief of the party's state unit despite opposition from Singh.

28-09-2021||India||IAF seeks to take over rape case against officer||A Tamil Nadu court will on Thursday decide whether to hand over a rape accused officer to the Indian Air Force (IAF) or allow the local police to continue investigating the matter. A colleague has accused flight lieutenant Amitesh Harmukh, 29, of raping her on the campus of Coimbatore’s Air Force Administrative College on September 10. The local police arrested Harmukh and the court on Monday extended his judicial custody until Thursday.Harmukh’s lawyer, N Sundaravadivelu, argued since the accused and the complainant belong to the IAF, they are subject to the special Air Force Act, which is beyond the purview of the Code of Criminal Procedure. “...the Indian Penal Code... will be applied by the court-martial authorities. There is a transgression by the civil police of Coimbatore; they have no right to investigate this matter. So, the judiciary...subordinate courts also have no jurisdiction. This has to be investigated only by the air force authorities by a court of inquiry and court-martial.”He said the trial should happen before the air force authorities because that is the right forum. “I cannot be defending my client in the wrong forum.”Also Read: 4 men rape 2 UP girls in cyber cafe, extort ₹10,000 not to leak video: Police The IAF filed a petition in the court seeking the transfer of the case to it for the probe and a court-martial. “We have cited all rules and procedures for the flight lieutenant to be handed over to us,” said an IAF spokesperson.The police have maintained that the complainant was unhappy with the college’s inquiry and that is why she approached Coimbatore commissioner Deepak M Damor on September 20. Based on her complaint, a police station for women carried out preliminary inquiries, registered a case, and arrested Harmukh on Saturday. “Police have jurisdiction all over,” said a police officer in Coimbatore. “She was assaulted...and they (college) initiated action.

28-09-2021||India||Moral policing in Bengaluru and why I remain hopeful||Do you want to know what the sad thing is? It was done for “likes.” The only way that this particular moral policing story is different from the countless others that are sprouting up all over India is that it is a social media phenomenon. In case you didn’t know about this viral video, it happened on Friday, September 17.In it, two men stop a Hindu man (identified as such by the red tikka on his forehead, visible underneath the helmet he is wearing), and his Muslim woman colleague, wearing a burqa. They ask the Muslim woman-- in Kannada and Urdu-- why she is travelling with a non-Muslim. They abuse and threaten the two, even as the woman tries to explain that her colleague is merely giving her a lift home. In between, they slap the man, call the woman’s husband and abuse him as well. They force the woman to get off the bike and put her on an auto. You can see the whole sorry scene on many channels.The weird twist? The accused-- the perpetrators of the attack-- filmed and posted the video of them caught in the act themselves. In other words, the accused publicised their attack. And I thought it couldn’t happen in a cosmopolitan, genteel, progressive city like Bengaluru. Happens in Mangaluru where communal tensions are rife, said my journalist friend, but generally not in Bengaluru.The two accused were arrested quickly, something that Kamal Pant, the Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru tom-tommed on Twitter. “Acting swiftly, @BlrCityPolice has identified and secured two accused persons for assault on a bike rider travelling along with a woman of a different faith. A case is registered and firm legal action is initiated.”Not to be outdone, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai got on the bandwagon and said that such miscreants would not be tolerated by his administration. The surprise was the defence. The two youths, Suhail and Nayaz said that they had posted many such videos in the past and got an appreciation for their “work.” They thought that they would get applause, not an arrest for this escapade too. They told the police that they expected to be lauded for their actions. Ah, the irony-- caught on social media, and caught by posting on social media.When I moved to Bengaluru some 15 years ago, there were some things about its culture that I took for granted. Good weather was a given, as were the drooping rain trees. It was a cosmopolitan progressive city where women went to pubs and pensioners rode on bicycles down MG Road. While there were enclaves-- the Basavangudi Brahmins, the Christians in Cooke Town, the Muslims in Benson Town, everyone came together in places such as Koshys, MTR or MM Road during Ramadan. The difference today is social media which does three things. It holds a mirror to what is happening around us. It accelerates extremes, both the positive and the negative. And it allows for anonymity or at least it gives that false sense of security. When we troll on Twitter, we expect that nobody will find us out. We don’t know that there are ways to harvest data and identities even if we attack and abuse using false names. This is what happened to the two attackers. Although you don’t see their faces, you hear their voices. Plus, they bragged about their ‘work’ on their social media channels. The second is the reactions. When sentiment becomes a hashtag such as #gharwapsi, the encapsulated idea stirs up emotions and a sense of collective angst. This is what happened with #lovejihad and the selective outrage it invokes. The question then becomes: how real is the religious polarization that is supposedly happening in India? The answer is as nuanced and multi-layered as this great country itself. While all of us are in a froth about moral policing evident in the video of these goons, the real story is that at the end of the day, we witnessed one inescapable fact. Actually, several facts nested inside the main story. And each of these small facts gives us hope for India. Let me present them.A man gave his female colleague a lift home. He is Hindu, she is Muslim. She is married. He has been giving her a lift home for many days. Her husband knows about this. She wears a burqa. He wears a tilak. They are comfortable in their faith. They are also comfortable mingling with other genders and other faiths. Each of these sentences offers hope. The greatest hope of all: this continues to happen in Bengaluru and Meerut even though moral policing has become a hashtag.Recently, the company, Manyavar and actress, Alia Bhatt have been trolled because of an advertisement in which Bhatt playing a Hindu bride talks about updating the tradition of “kanyadaan” to “kanyamaan.” Immediately, outraged Twitter trolls rained abuse on the ad, the company and the actress. Many of them said that they would boycott Manyavar although how many would follow through is doubtful. Certainly, Tanishq’s revenues remain healthy even though the company found itself in the middle of a similar controversy sometime back.I, for now, remain hopeful. I believe that India is too vast, heterogeneous and multi-layered country to fit into a Twitter troll’s suffocating label. You can generate as much outrage as you want online. You can brag about morals on social media. But at the end of the day, an Indian Hindu male is still going to offer his married female Muslim colleague a lift. For that, I say, thank God-- this is still India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moral-policing-in-bengaluru-and-why-i-remain-hopeful-101632829498515.html

The company also said that it did not want to speculate or comment further about the regulatory process and the timelines.“As a responsible manufacturer with past approvals for our other vaccines, we do not find it appropriate to speculate or comment on the regulatory approval process and its timelines.

However, the Strategic Advisory Group of Expert on Immunization (SAGE) meeting regarding Covaxin’s approval still remained scheduled for October 5 and has not been deferred.Bharat Biotech in its statement, has asked the media organisations “to exercise restraint while reporting on public health related issues and timelines, as it has an impact on millions of lives and livelihoods.”Also read | WHO's nod for Covaxin delayed again over technical queries: Reports“At appropriate times, we will make announcements to indicate the availability of regulatory approvals,” it added.Covaxin is one among the three vaccines being used in the country’s immunisation programme against Covid-19, the other two vaccines being Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. Alongside Covaxin, the company is also in the process of developing BBV154, an intranasal vaccine against the disease.Obtaining an EUA from the WHO would imply that the vaccine could be accepted for travel to other countries.

Top quotes from her book||Indra Nooyi, the former chairperson and CEO of PepsiCo, is in the news again as her book—‘My Life in Full: Work, Family, and our Future’—published by Hachette India is out. In the memoir, she talks about how she navigated space dominated by men conventionally and her journey on climbing the corporate ladder becoming the global chief executive of PepsiCo in 2006 and only the 11th woman to lead a Fortune 500 company.Apart from that, she also shares her experience of settling in America negotiating the boardroom and balancing work and family life. She also describes events that shaped her life from childhood to her becoming PepsiCo CEO, a position from which she retired in 2018.1. “Leave that crown in the garage," Nooyi quotes her mother as saying in the book. When Nooyi got promoted as president of PepsiCo, her mother asked her to go out and get milk, an incident that hit headlines in 2017. However, when Nooyi rebelled, her mother said, ‘Leave that crown in the garage’.2. Nooyi goes on to talk about the importance of organisational support in working women’s lives. She mentions she was given three months of paid leave by BCG when her father was diagnosed with cancer. “I believe I would have curtailed my career, by quitting BCG to be with my dad and to help my family, had I not received this paid leave... we would have been in real financial trouble and unsettled,” she writes.3. “I was never sexually assaulted. I did witness and hear about plenty of male behaviour early in my days in the corporate world that offended my sense of decency and my values. I later made it a priority to shut down offensive behaviour as soon as I saw it or it became known,” Nooyi writes. Nooyi says after she became PepsiCo’s president, she instructed the compliance department to address harassment complaints made to their anonymous Speak Up Line immediately. “We were quick to fire confirmed harassers,” she writes.4. As she penned the book during the Covid-19 pandemic, she stresses the importance of job flexibility and remote work to help people take care of home life obligations. “I believe job flexibility and remote work for everyone who needs it should be entirely routine. This will give families the chance to take care of home life obligations during the workday without feeling loaded with emotional consequences,’’ she writes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indra-nooyi-s-memoir-hits-bookstores-top-quotes-from-her-book-101632815190352.html

28-09-2021||India||PM Modi releases climate resilient crop varieties: How will they help India||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched 35 crop varieties which are climate resilient. He said that climate change is a big challenge for agriculture and the entire ecosystem and stressed on the need to step up efforts to fight it.According to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the crops launched today have special traits and will lead to awareness about the adoption of climate resilient technologies.What are these crop varieties with special traits?The crop varieties have been developed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to address the twin challenges of climate change and malnutrition. They are climate resistant and have high nutrition content, the PMO said in a release.The 35 varieties include a drought tolerant variety of chickpea, wilt and sterility mosaic resistant pigeonpea, early maturing variety of soybean, disease resistant varieties of rice and biofortified varieties of wheat, pearl millet, maize and chickpea, quinoa, buckwheat, winged bean and faba bean.Climate change and its impact on agricultureA report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last month said that climate change will have economy-wide repercussions in India if not mitigated, and could lead to shrinking of the agriculture cover in the country.The IPCC report also said that the impact of climate crisis, like changing monsoon patters, rising sea levels, deadlier heat waves, intense storms and flooding will pose an acute risk to the agriculture sector.According to ongoing studies by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), farming now consumes up to 30% more water due to “high evaporative demand and crop duration due to forced maturity” in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan.The need for climate resilient cropExperts have been warning about the adverse effects of climate change for years. And India turned it into an important area of concern for India to ensure food and nutritional security for growing population. Accordingly, National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) was launched under ICAR on 2011.According to ICAR, the project aims to enhance resilience of crops to climate change through strategic research and technology demonstration. It also covers livestock, fisheries and natural resource management. The ICAR also said that climate change is predicted to reduce agricultural yields by 4.5 to 9 per cent.According to a June presentation by the Union finance ministry, Indian scientists are focussing on developing climate resilient crops, instead of just going for higher yield varieties. "Varieties tolerant to diseases, insects pests, drought, salinity, and flooding, early maturing and amenable to mechanical harvesting also developed," the ministry said in its presentation.The crops will also address the anti-nutritional factorsAccording to PMO, these special traits crop varieties also include those that address the anti-nutritional factors found in some crops that adversely affect human and animal health.According to national library of medicine, anti-nutritional factor can be defined as those substances generated in natural food substances by the normal metabolism of species and by different mechanisms which exert effects contrary to optimum nutrition.The PMO said that crop varieties like Pusa Double Zero Mustard 33, first Canola quality hybrid RCH 1 with <2% erucic acid and <30 ppm glucosinolates, and a soybean variety free from two anti-nutritional factors namely Kunitz trypsin inhibitor and lipoxygenase. Other varieties with special traits have been developed in soybean, sorghum, and baby corn, among others, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-releases-climate-resilient-crop-varieties-how-will-they-help-india-101632817619148.html

28-09-2021||India||Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali’s aide held in money laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED), late on Monday, arrested Saeed Khan, an aide to Bhavana Gawali, the Shiv Sena Member of Parliament (MP) from Maharashtra’s Yavatmal-Washim, in connection with a money laundering case linked to a trust associated with the lawmaker. Khan was expected to be produced in a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court on Tuesday.The ED last month carried out searches at premises linked to Khan and Gawali. Khan is accused of converting the trust into a company and becoming its director for wrongful gains. The ED has filed a case over alleged financial irregularities related to the trust. It suspects Gawali’s involvement in money laundering and embezzlement of ₹17 crore as well as misuse of power in obtaining government grants and funds.ED officials said the alleged irregularities related to a loan of around ₹43 crore from the National Cooperative Development Corporation. The money was allegedly misused and not utilised for the purpose for which it was provided.Harish Sarda, a former vice-president of Shiv Sena’s Washim district unit, first raised allegations of misappropriation of funds and complained against Gawali. He also filed a petition in the Bombay high court alleging police inaction. In his complaint, Sarda accused Gawali of money laundering, embezzlement, and misuse of power in obtaining grants and funds for a factory. Gawali’s father Pudalikrao, who also represented the region in the Lok Sabha, was its chief promoter. The factory was set up in 1998 to collect crop residue and use it for making furniture, etc. The basic aim was to provide employment to local farmers.The factory never started functioning. In 1998, the estimated project cost was ₹43.85 crore, but it was allegedly undervalued to ₹7.9 crore before it was sold to Gawali-run Bhavna Agro Products. Sarda accused Gawali’s father of illegally transferring 14.90 hectares of factory land without obtaining necessary permission from competent authorities. Sarda maintained the land belonged to a cooperative society and could not have been transferred to any public trust without the government’s approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-mp-bhavana-gawali-s-aide-held-in-money-laundering-case-101632817078727.html

28-09-2021||India||NIBRI reaches an all-time high of 105 in the week ending September 26||The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) reached an all-time high of 105 in the week ending September 26.The NIBRI is a weekly indicator of economic activity which takes into account Google mobility indices, driving mobility from Apple, power demand and the labour force participation rate. A NIBRI value of 100 refers to pre-pandemic level (23 February 2020) of economic activity and subsequent data entries have been indexed to it. It has emerged as one of the most popular high frequency economic trackers in the post-Covid phase.After the imposition of the 68-day -long nation-wide lockdown beginning March 25, 2020, NIBRI fell sharply, reaching a minimum of 44 in the week ending April 26, 2020. There was a gradual recovery since then, and it come close to the level of 100 (99.3) in the week ending February 21, 2021, before the second wave created another round of disruption. NIBRI fell to 60.3 once again in the week ending May 23, 2021. It started recovering first gradually and then sharply and crossed the psychological threshold of 100 for the first time in the week ending August 15, 2021 and stayed above the 100-mark in the subsequent weeks.To be sure, the latest surge in NIBRI value might not represent a broad-based improvement in economic activity. “The rise was primarily due to a sharp 18 percentage point spike in the Apple driving index over the week, which reflects higher traffic localised in the cities of Hyderabad and Pune”, said a Nomura Global Markets Research note, while releasing the numbers. “Excluding the Apple driving index, we estimate the NIBRI rose by a more modest 2 percentage point (4.6 percentage point with the Apple index included)”, it added.“The upcoming festive season in Q4 2021 and the release of the arrears of ‘dearness allowance’ for public sector employees should support consumption, although supply-side bottlenecks may weigh on near-term manufacturing growth,” the note said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nibri-reaches-an-all-time-high-of-105-in-the-week-ending-september-26-101632814856928.html

28-09-2021||India||Amazon replies to ‘East India Company 2.0' remark, uses ‘Make in India’ rebuttal||A day after the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-linked weekly termed Amazon Inc as “East India Company 2.0”, the e-commerce giant issued a statement on Monday highlighting how Indian small businesses have expanded in exports by selling crores of 'Made in India' products to customers across the world. The statement comes in response to an article "East India Company 2.0" in Panchajanya magazine, which accused the leading e-commerce company of conducting activities similar to ‘whatever the East India Company did in the 18th century’. Hitesh Shankar of the Panchajanya posted a cover of the weekly's latest edition on Twitter with a picture of Jeff Bezos, titled “East India Company 2.0”. After receiving criticism for the same, Shankar went on to defend the poster as “factual” in a video message."Whatever the East India Company did in the 18th century to capture India, the same is visible in the activities of Amazon," the article read. It also claimed that Amazon was creating a monopoly in the Indian market as "it has started taking initiatives for seizing the economic, political and personal freedom of the Indian citizens."The allegations come in support of many Indian retailers who have frequently accused e-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart and others of giving preferential treatment to large-scale sellers over small businesses, an accusation that Amazon has previously denied.Amazon responded to the cover story saying: “During the pandemic three lakh new sellers joined us... of which 75,000 were local neighbourhood shops (dukaans) from 450+ cities (selling) furniture, stationery, consumer electronics, beauty products, mobile phones, garments, medical products.” "Amazon's exports program is witnessing rapid momentum... today there are 70,000+ exporters from metros as well as Tier II, III and IV cities, selling crores of 'made in India' products to customers in 200 countries across the world - truly taking (it) global," it added.Notably, Amazon is locked in a legal tussle over the takeover of Future Group and is facing a probe by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Congress has even demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the alleged bribery case involving the e-commerce giant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amazon-replies-to-east-india-company-2-0-remark-uses-make-in-india-rebuttal-101632810837903.html

The assembly passed the Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill and the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill.The bills seek to “protect the interest of farmers, farm labourers, those engaged in ancillary and incidental activities relating to production, sale, and marketing of agricultural produce as also consumers and for adherence to the minimum support price mechanism”.Political commentator Avadhesh Akodia said Constitution’s Article 254(2) allows a state to make changes to Central legislation on a subject on the concurrent list only if it gets the Presidential assent.Ruling Congress spokesman and minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said the intention and policy of the state government are clear: “We are with the farmers.” He added they hope the governor will do justice.Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ram Lal Sharma said the three bills have no constitutional validity. “...the state has no right to bring amendments in Central laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-governor-yet-to-clear-bills-brought-to-counter-central-farm-laws-101632809936523.html

It is likely to move west-north-westwards and weaken into a well-marked low-pressure area later on Tuesday. The system is likely to emerge into the northeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Gujarat coast around September 30 evening and there is a likelihood for it to further intensify over the northeast Arabian Sea during the subsequent 24 hours. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said it has not ruled out chances of formation of another cyclone--Shaheen--over the Arabian Sea from the remnant.The cyclonic circulation over east-central and adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal off Myanmar coast now lies over the northeast and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal. Under its influence, a low-pressure area is likely to form over northwest Bay of Bengal off West Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh coasts during the next 12 hours. In association with these systems, winds are likely to strengthen along the west coast during the next two days. The monsoon trough is lying to the south of its normal position and is likely to remain so during the next four to five days. Heavy to very heavy rain is likely in Gujarat, Madhya Maharashtra, Konkan, Marathwada, Saurashtra, and Kutch, etc., for the next two to three days. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places in Saurashtra, Kutch and heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places in Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal during next two to three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chances-of-formation-of-another-cyclone-over-the-arabian-sea-imd-101632804415750.html

Ramabai made the remarks during a meeting with the residents of Satua village, who approached the MLA with complaints against two employment assistants, according to reports. The villagers alleged that both of them took taken thousands of rupees from them to allot houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, they added.The BSP MLA is heard in the video asking the assembled villagers about the amount of money they had to pay to the officials. In response, one of them said he gave ₹9,000, another said he was made to pay ₹5000 and the third told the politician that he gave a bribe of ₹6,000. The now-viral video shows Ramabai talking to the villagers in her assembly seat of Patharia and then telling the officials that asking ₹1000 is alright. “There is no problem. It’s like salt in flour. But it is not OK when you snatch the whole plate away from people. I am not saying don’t take bribes and I also know that a game of andher nagari chaupat raja is on in the state,” she said referring to the Hindi idiom.The Hindi idiom talks about a place where corruption and disorder is the rule of the land. The video was published by Live Hindustan, the sister publication of the Hindustan Times.म.प्र: दमोह जिले के पथरिया की महिला विधायक रामबाई का यह वीडियो इस समय वायरल हो रहा है। रामबाई वही हैं जिनके पति पर हत्या का आरोप है। समय-समय पर उनके अपने क्षेत्र के लोगों की समस्या के निराकरण के दौरान उऩके संवादों के वीडियो वायरल होते रहते हैं #ViralVideo pic.twitter.com/TAcb6x65FTRamabai also reprimanded both the officials and ordered them to return the money to the villagers. “It is enough that I am not punishing you. All I am saying is you have to return their money to them,” she said.In 2019, Ramabai was suspended by BSP chief Mayawati for supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslim refugees who came to India before December 31, 2014, to escape religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

28-09-2021||India||Petrol prices hiked for first time since July 17, diesel costlier by 95 paise||State run fuel retailers on Tuesday raised petrol rates by 20 paise a litre for the first time since July 17 as international oil prices soared to a three-year high, breaching the $80 a barrel mark following rising demand and supply concerns.Diesel price also jumped by 25 paise per litre on Tuesday, the fourth hike in five days, which made the fuel costlier by 95 paise a litre. The recent diesel price rally started from Friday (September 24) after it was last hiked on July 15 to reach ₹89.87/litre mark on Tuesday.Petrol is currently sold for ₹101.39 per litre in Delhi and diesel at ₹89.57. The previous price hike of petrol that took place 73 days ago had raised its rate to an all-time high of ₹101.84. While fuel rates of the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies.Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) are forced to raise petrol and diesel rates as international oil prices are surging and the rupee is depreciating against the dollar, making import costlier, two executives working in these firms said, requesting anonymity. India imports more than 80% crude oil it processes and pays in dollar.Before the recent rally, oil companies had reduced petrol and diesel rates in small doses by 65 paise per litre and ₹1.25 respectively between mid-August and early September to pass the benefit of softening of global oil price, which had plunged to $68.23 per barrel on August 18. Since then, benchmark Brent crude has surged by over 17%. HT on Tuesday reported that petrol price increase was imminent as OMCs were not expecting any respite from surging international prices. Companies do not expect any immediate relief to the consumer expecting the fuel prices to surge further.There are indications that imported energy would be costlier, the executives mentioned above, said. “As per both IEA [International Energy Agency] and OPEC [Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries], global demand is expected to outpace supply due to which international oil prices will likely remain firm in the near to mid-term. A simultaneous rally in natural gas is also likely to drive demand for alternate fuels, including crude oil,” the first executive said.Global demand for crude oil has been increasing consistently with the easing of pandemic restrictions and improving vaccination rates, the executives said. “Crude Oil prices have reached to near three-year high as global output disruptions have forced energy companies to draw more crude oil out of their stockpiles. Accordingly, US crude oil inventory levels are also nearing a three-year low,” the first executive added.“On the supply side, OPEC+ [including Russia] alliance has been slow in easing output restrictions, contributing to the tightened supply in the market. Additionally, hurricanes Ida and Nicholas have impacted crude oil production in the US Gulf of Mexico region, when they hit in late August and September respectively,” he said.“Companies were holding prices, and expecting some tax relief from the government in terms of GST [Goods and Services Tax], but the proposal to include petroleum products in GST was declined in the GST Council meeting on September 17, forcing companies to think about raising fuel rates,” the second executive said. International oil rates, which are often volatile, directly influence pump prices of petrol and diesel in India. Heavy loads of Central and state taxes are also responsible for astronomically high rates of the auto fuels.Through 2020, as global crude prices plunged (below $20 a barrel in April last year), the Central government raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit as their revenues were hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the Central and state levies on petrol and diesel are over 50% of their retail prices currently. According to official data, the petroleum sector contributed ₹371,726 crore Central excise revenue in 2020-21, and ₹202,937 crore state levies or value-added tax (VAT). In Delhi, Central levies account for over 32.5% of petrol’s price, and state taxes (VAT) 23.07%. On diesel, the Central excise is over 35.8% while VAT is more than 14.6%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-prices-hiked-for-the-first-time-since-july-17-diesel-costlier-by-95-paise-a-litre-101632803575924.html

Agarwal moved the court after the Mumbai Police booked him this year.Police inspector Ravindra Katkar said a representative of DRC in India on May 21 complained against Agarwal saying the latter continued misusing the post for years after MEA approved the request to cancel his appointment in October 2017. Agarwal was accordingly requested to stop the misuse.“...Agarwal kept on misusing the post and allegedly enjoyed many privileges and took direct and indirect benefits by attending government and social functions and contacted organisations under the state and Central governments. (He has claimed) authorisation given to him (by Congo and MEA) is still valid,” said V Dhurat, an assistant police inspector.Public prosecutor Sagar Agarkar said they opposed his bail plea and presented in the court government documents, emails, and other accounts explaining how he misused the post. “The judge was convinced...and felt that a thorough investigation is needed and rejected Agarwal’s anticipatory bail application.”Agarwal, who has been charged with cheating by impersonation, was unavailable for his comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hcrejects-bail-plea-of-former-drc-honorary-consul-booked-for-misusing-his-position-101632802195458.html

The letter condemned the police action and alleged that the two Indian Police Service officers “went to kill” Thangkhiew without any evidence on the orders of police chief R Chandranathan and inspector general (law and order) Mukesh Kumar Singh.“...it (the letter) is full of untruths and mischievous loopholes,” a person aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.The letter claimed there were pending cases against Chandranathan related to his tenure in Assam and blamed Singh for the alleged murder of the criminal.Chandranathan said: “All I can say is one must first verify the facts before publishing anything...” He said he was awaiting a report on the letter.In a press release on Monday, the police accused media houses that reported about the letter of “irresponsible reporting of unverified information”. The police maintained Thangkhiew had a role in a blast in July and was planning another one in Shillong in August.Thangkhiew’s death sparked protests in Shillong with many accusing police of staging the shootout in which the former rebel leader was killed.Police claimed when a police team went to Thangkhiew’s house on August 13 to interrogate him, he “attempted to assault and cause fatal injury to a member of the police team”.

28-09-2021||India||Assam scientist bags Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar award for pioneering work||After a gap of twenty years, a scientist from Assam has bagged the prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award for his pioneering research on coal and energy. Dr Binoy Kumar Saikia is among the 11 scientists under 45 years of age who bagged the award given for seven categories by Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) this year. He is the lone recipient in the Earth, Atmosphere, Ocean and Planetary Sciences category. “Dr. Saikia has made outstanding contributions on the formation of fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) from Indian coal. His indigenous patented CQD technology for diverse applications falls under ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India programme), leading to import substitution,” the CSIR citation for Saikia read. Discovered accidentally in 2004, CQDs are small carbon nano-particles with size less than 10 nm (nano metre). Number of studies have been done worldwide in using fluorescent properties of CQDs, which have high stability, good conductivity, low toxicity and are environmental friendly, for various applications including medicine and environmental science. “I am elated to have been selected for this honour. The award recognises the last five years of work I have done in this field,” said Saikia, a senior scientist at Jorhat-based CSIR-North East Institute of Science and Technology (CSIR-NEIST). Based in Jorhat since the past 11 years, the 44-year-old, who hails from Golaghat in Assam, has been involved in various projects related to coal and petroleum found in the state and the rest of northeast. With 65 published works and several awards including RP Bhatnagar Award in 2015-16 and Rajiv Gandhi Excellence Award in 2012, Saikia plans to continue his research in the field and help bring down import of CQDs. “The fluorescent CQDs of Indian coal developed by us is much cheaper than imported ones and will help reduce dependency on other countries. It can have multiples uses including in medical science,” said Saikia. Saikia is the 5th person from Assam to bag the award after Mihir Kanti Chaudhuri (1989), Jitendra Nath Goswami (1994), Bhupendra Nath Goswami (1995) and Prashant Goswami (2001).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-scientist-bags-shanti-swarup-bhatnagar-award-for-work-on-carbon-quantum-dots-101632799375091.html

28-09-2021||India||Khori Gaon rehab scheme: SC cautions over pseudo allottees||The Supreme Court on Monday told the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) to ensure that only Khori Gaon residents, evicted from Aravalli forest, are rehabilitated under a Haryana government scheme and imposters are not allowed to buy out the accommodation from genuine allotteesA bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said, “We know that in rehabilitation schemes, in general, the genuine people encash the benefit provided to them and go and encroach somewhere else while pseudo persons come forward to take the benefit.”The court observed while recounting a similar matter dealt with by the Madhya Pradesh high court. “Public property and assets get compromised and the public exchequer affected in the process.”The court made the observations after the municipality submitted details of the alternative housing scheme Haryana government has prepared for residents of the demolished Khori Gaon homes in Lakkarpur village. Of the 2,416 applications received till September 19, only 899 were found eligible as the remaining either had no document to prove they were from Khori Gaon or were persons residing outside Faridabad.Senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj, representing the MCF, said, “After we notified the scheme last month, there has been a rush of people applying for documents that will make them eligible for housing under the rehabilitation scheme.”The state government scheme proposes to house the residents of Khori Gaon at the economically weaker section (EWS) flats at Bapu Nagar and Dabua Colony in Faridabad. To be eligible, residents need to show either a Pariwar Pehchan Patra (PPP) of an adult member of the house, an election ID card of Badkhal constituency, or an electricity connection bill of their premises at Khori Gaon.Bhardwaj said, “Only 899 persons out of 2,416 applications have been found to be eligible. The remaining failed to supply even one of the documents listed above. Some persons from adjoining Delhi have also been found to have applied under our scheme.”The bench asked MCF to consider if additional documents, such as Aadhaar Card, could be considered for deciding the eligibility and file an affidavit by Monday on whether an amount of ₹17,000, to be paid upfront by eligible persons, could be reduced.Senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, who was appearing for some of the evicted residents, had cited the example of Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojna (PMAY) where Aadhaar is an acceptable document of proof for establishing eligibility.Parikh said that nearly half of the residents in Khori Gaon had one of the documents but many lost it at the time of demolition and others have applied for the same. He stated that evacuees can’t deposit ₹17,000, the first instalment of the ₹3.77 lakh, which is payable for the EWS accommodation over a period of 15 years. Parikh enquired if ₹10,000 could be paid initially, with the remaining amount payable in the next 20 years. The court sought the views of the MCF on this suggestion.Unlike PMAY, which provides housing for the homeless, this was a rehabilitation scheme for persons dispossessed of their houses, the bench said. The bench had an interaction with MCF commissioner Yashpal Yadav during the proceedings to know if Khori Gaon properties are numbered.“We carried out a drone survey but have not conducted a physical survey of the area,” the commissioner said, adding, “The structure numbers are given.”Bhardwaj later clarified that structure numbers were privately assigned by residents and not the corporation.If the Aadhaar card is to be relied upon as a document of proof to establish residence in Khori Gaon, the bench said then it should mention the exact premises along with an undertaking that there won’t be multiple applicants for one premise.The bench also reminded the MCF that on October 4, the next date of hearing, it required the chart showing area wise action taken report against unauthorised properties in the forest area.

28-09-2021||India||Maharashtra records lowest daily new Covid-19 cases since February 8||Maharashtra on Monday recorded 2,432 new Covid-19 cases, the lowest number of daily infections since February 8, when 2,216 Covid infections were recorded, at the start of the second wave 231 days ago. In a sign of decline, the number of active Covid-19 infections have also witnessed a major dip, data showsOn Monday, Maharashtra had 37,043 active Covid cases. This is 27.47% less than 51,078 active cases recorded on September 1. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate attributed the dip to the decreasing number of daily new cases.“The active cases are directly connected to the number of daily infections and since they are declining, it translates into a drop in the active cases. The decline in active cases indicates we have been effective in containing the Covid-19 virus,” said Dr Awate.Currently, there are 37,043 active cases in the state and Pune has most of these with 9,243 cases followed by Thane and Ahmednagar with 5,888 and 5,506 cases respectively. The peak of the virus during the second wave saw active cases climb to more than 0.6 million.Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, said Pune continues to be worst affected due to a variety of reasons. “People from across India come to Pune for work and many don’t follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Another factor is that since Pune has good hospitals, we see people from rural areas coming there for treatment,” said Dr Gilada. He said Ahmednagar has been seeing a surge in cases due to the large number of religious, political and grand wedding events being held.Maharashtra on Monday recorded 32 Covid-19 related deaths. Mumbai recorded 376 new infections with seven deaths, taking the toll to 16,091. The total number of Covid-19 patients registered in Maharashtra so far has now reached 6,541,762.A total of 128,036 Covid tests were done on Monday.The Covid death toll in the state has now reached 138,902 with Pune recording 19,418 deaths followed by 16,091 in Mumbai and 11,367 in Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-recorded-lowest-daily-covid-infection-since-feb-8-101632794274092.html
28-09-2021||India||WHO's nod for Covaxin delayed again over technical queries: Reports||The World Health Organization (WHO) has once again delayed the emergency use authorisation (EUA) for Covaxin, the Covid-19 vaccine developed in India, and sent for more technical queries to its Hyderabad-based manufacturer Bharat Biotech, according to reports. This comes even after Bharat Biotech has said it has submitted all data required for clearance of Covaxin. News18 news television channel cited a person familiar with the matter as saying that this is a routine process and there is no concern in the matter. “It’s the usual process. Experts raise queries, which need to be answered by the company,” the person cited above said.“No, it should not be delayed… Maybe a few weeks,” the WHO official told News18 when asked if the fresh set of queries will delay the approval further.Without the WHO nod, Covaxin will not be considered an accepted vaccine by most countries across the world and the delay is likely to affect students, medical tourists, business travellers and those who want to travel abroad.Also read | Bharat Biotech completes phase 2/3 trials of Covaxin in childrenLast Friday, the Union ministry of health and family welfare hinted that the global health body was likely to give its nod anytime soon. "There is a procedure of submitting the documents for approval. WHO's emergency use authorisation to Covaxin is expected soon," Dr Bharati Pravin Pawar, Union minister of state in the health ministry, said, according to news agency ANI.Before that, Dr VK Paul, chairperson of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration, also said that WHO's approval for Covaxin was likely to come before the end of this month.Also read | Court seeks Centre’s stand on cancer patient’s plea to take Covaxin as 2nd doseBharat Biotech said it has submitted all the necessary documents required for approval on July 9. “ The review process has now commenced with the expectation that we will receive EUL from WHO at the earliest,” Dr Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech, said in a statement.Covaxin and Serum Institute of India’s Covishield were the Covid-19 vaccines first used by the central government in its massive nationwide inoculation drive launched in January this year. Russia-made Sputnik was later added to the country's vaccination drive. Covishield is the only India-made vaccine on the WHO list now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whos-nod-for-covaxin-delayed-again-over-technical-queries-reports-101632789558234.html
28-09-2021||India||Bengal post-poll violence: Supreme Court to hear today Mamata govt's final arguments against CBI probe||The Supreme Court is expected to hear on Tuesday the final arguments of the West Bengal government against the move by the Calcutta high court to hand over the post-poll violence cases to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The top court last week decided to go ahead and hear the final arguments on September 28 since the respondent parties were already present in the hearing on caveat. The matter is likely to be taken up as the first case of the day, as consented to by all the parties present.The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal argues that a “fair probe” in the post-poll violence case is unlikely since the CBI is allegedly acting at the behest of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the Bengal government, also told the Supreme Court that the victim in one of the murder cases registered by the CBI was still alive.Also Read | On BJP's post-poll violence claim, Mamata cites NRC deaths in AssamA bench of justice Vineet Saran and justice Aniruddha Bose hearing the petition sought to clarify whether the CBI was conducting an investigation or an inquiry, to which Sibal replied that the central sleuths were only handling the alleged murder and rape cases, while the rest of the cases were with a special investigation team (SIT), monitored by a retired judge.When asked how long he would take to complete his submissions regarding the petition, Sibal said that it would take him “two to three hours”. The bench observed that it would be better to hear the case continuously on September 28 without any interruptions as the first case of the day; by this time all the documents – including all pre-hearing formalities – can be filed.Also Read | 58% of accused named in post-poll violence cases held, Bengal tells SCIn August this year, the Calcutta high court ordered a court-monitored CBI probe into the incidents of post-poll violence in West Bengal. It also directed to set up the SIT for investigation of relatively less serious crimes. The CBI, which is probing the more serious crimes, like murder and rape, during post-poll violence, has already registered at least 40 first information reports (FIRs).Several incidents of violence were reported at various places after the announcement of the West Bengal assembly poll results on May 2, after which a four-member team deputed by the Union ministry of home affairs also visited the violence-affected areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-post-poll-violence-supreme-court-to-hear-today-mamata-govt-s-final-arguments-against-cbi-probe-101632785931675.html

28-09-2021||India||Clashes mark the last day of Bhabanipur campaign||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has sought that the by-election in Bhabanipur assembly constituency, scheduled for September 30, be held after imposing prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and under the supervision of central forces -- a move prompted by an incident that saw one of its leaders being surrounded and heckled by a crowd of Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporters, forcing his bodyguards to brandish pistols. The section restricts movement and assemblies as well as the carriage of anything that can be used as a weapon.The TMC was quick to highlight images of the pistols being waved around by the bodyguards as another instance of the BJP trying to provoke people into creating an incident.The two parties fought a bitter battle in the assembly polls earlier this year that the TMC won easily, although its leader and chief minister Mamata Banerjee lost. She is now contesting the Bhabanipur by-election, which saw the last leg of campaigning on Monday.On Monday, BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh was among the 80 leaders from the party who hit the streets to campaign for the party’s candidate, Priyanka Tibrewal , but at Jadu Babu Bazar, he ran into a crowd that obstructed his path and shouted “go back”. He shouted “Jai Shri Ram” in return. But as the crowd swelled, people started pushing and jostling each other and Ghosh’s guards had to draw their weapons to keep an angry crowd at bay and escort him to safety.While the BJP alleged that two its workers were assaulted by the crowd, the ruling party countered by saying one of their men landed in hospital after being hit by Ghosh’s guards. BJP state vice-president Arjun Singh, who was campaigning at Sambhunath Pandit Street, faced similar demonstrations when he approached the location where Ghosh was surrounded and had to leave the spot.The EC sought a report on the incident. The returning officer was also asked to examine video footages, an official said on condition of anonymity. There was no further update from EC till the time of going to press,About an hour after Ghosh talked of deferring the poll, the BJP moved EC, accusing the Kolkata Police of not taking any action. In its official letter to EC, the BJP demanded that deputy commissioner of police (south) Akash Magharia be removed from election duty and TMC legislator Madan Mitra, who lives in Bhabanipur, asked to leave the area. The letter, addressed to the chief electoral officer of West Bengal, Aariz Aftab, did not demand postponement of the election. However, BJP MP Swapan Dasgupta, who signed the letter along with two other leaders, said the election in Bhabanipur can be held only after imposing prohibitory orders under CrPC Section 144.TMC leaders alleged that the BJP leaders came to Bhabanipur to create trouble on the last day of campaigning. “I saw on television that Dilip Ghosh was laughing and shouting the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan. The protests were held by local people and not TMC workers. We want to know what prompted Ghosh’s security personnel to point their guns at people. This is the disruptive politics BJP is known for,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy.Adhikari moves HC, seeks Roy’s disqualificationBJP leader Suvendu Adhikari on Monday moved the Calcutta high court seeking disqualification of the party’s former national vice-president Mukul Roy as a member of the West Bengal legislative assembly. Roy, who joined the BJP in 2017 and returned to the TMC on June 11 this year, has not yet officially resigned from the BJP. Mukul Roy, who is unwell, could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clashes-mark-the-last-day-of-bhabanipur-campaign-101632782457730.html

28-09-2021||India||‘Hold judiciary in high esteem’: Tripura CM Biplab after row over his ‘contempt’ remark||A day after courting controversy with statements on contempt of court, video of which went viral on social media, Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb on Monday defended himself, saying that his speech was distorted and taken out of context. He also said that he holds all judicial institutions in the ‘ highest esteem’ and never told officers to disregard courts. “The reporting of my speech on 25/9/21 is being twisted and wrongly reported by some print and electronic media to project disregard to the judiciary and judicial institutions. I firmly and unequivocally clarify that I hold all the judicial institutions in the highest esteem and am duty-bound to uphold the majesty of the judiciary. I have not told the officers or even remotely intended to convey any message to disregard courts or disrespect court orders as reported. My words have been published out of context,” Deb wrote on his Facebook. In the meantime, RTI activist Saket Gokhale wrote to the advocate general of Tripura high court Siddhartha Shankar Dey and requested court proceedings against Deb for his comments on the judiciary. Gokhale has recently joined Trinamool Congress. In the letter, Gokhale said that no person, including the chief minister of a state, is above law and orders of the judiciary apply to all. “Your consent is, therefore, sought in this matter to enable the undersigned to initiate proceedings for criminal contempt of court against Sh. Biplab Kumar Deb for the aforementioned comments about the judiciary, “ he wrote in his letter.No petition was known to have been filed in the high court. However, no comment from the advocate general was made available on the issue. Deb, while speaking at a biennial conference of the Civil Service Officers’ Association on Saturday, said that the officers should work for people without thinking about contempt of court. His comments became viral on social media, especially after Trinamool Congress general secretary Abhishek Banerjee tagged a video clip of Deb’s speech in his tweet on Sunday. In the video, CM was heard saying, “ Contempt of Court is said in such a way as if a tiger is sitting. I am the tiger. The power lies with the person who runs the government. It means that all power lies with the people. We are a ‘ by the people’s government and not ‘ by the court ‘ government.”He made this comment while speaking on holding back promotions of public servants following a pending court matter.

28-09-2021||India||India increasingly important for Germany due to role in Indo-Pacific, says ambassador||India is an increasingly important partner for Germany because of its strategic role in the Indo-Pacific and the next government in Berlin is expected to continue a policy of working closely with New Delhi, German ambassador Walter Lindner said on Monday. Speaking shortly after the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) claimed victory in Germany’s federal election by securing an edge over Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, Lindner said all German political parties have largely similar security, global strategic and environmental interests in which the “importance of India is obvious”. With India set to become the world’s most populous country, major global issues – including global warming, climate change, population growth, vaccines, trade and terrorism – cannot be resolved without India, both at the multilateral and bilateral level, Lindner told a group of journalists. India and the Indo-Pacific may seem far away from Germany, but the region is increasingly taking on a central role in the German government’s vision because of its importance to global trade. Noting that a significant chunk of trade routes used by an export-driven economy such as Germany pass through the Indo-Pacific, Lindner said these routes could be “blocked by turmoil” or affected by states that don’t follow international rules. Germany’s focus on the Indo-Pacific is not a military strategy but part of an overall effort to protect the country’s interests, the ambassador said. As a part of these initiatives, Germany has sent a frigate to the Indo-Pacific, with the warship making stops in several countries. This was done despite some resistance to the move in Germany because of the increased interest in the Indo-Pacific and the frigate will also travel to Mumbai, Lindner said. The enhanced cooperation between the militaries of the two countries has dovetailed with the increased interest in the Indo-Pacific, he added. The two sides have also had a very strong strategic partnership for 12 years and bilateral trade is currently worth more than $20 billion. Some 2,000 German companies have a presence in India with 600,000 jobs and Germany is one of India’s biggest development partners. Germany is also home to about 25,000 Indian students, one of the largest concentrations in Europe. Lindner was confident that the next German chancellor would have enough advisers to help steer relations with India. Relations between France and Germany, which are the “motor of the European Union”, too will be crucial, he said. Responding to questions on the situation in Afghanistan, Lindner said Germany and other countries will have to talk to the Taliban to ensure preservation of human rights and formation of an inclusive government, to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid, to ensure the evacuation of those who wish to leave, and to prevent any “fostering of terrorism”. “Do we talk to the Taliban? Yes, we do [like others] but not to establish relations, but to get those people out whom we still have there...we still have people there who worked for us,” he said. States will also have to talk to the Taliban to provide immediate relief through the UN and “so that we have some sort of influence” on issues such as human rights, guaranteeing the rights of women and children, inclusiveness of the government, and “no more fostering of terrorism”, he said. Lindner acknowledged that there was a “misjudgement of the Taliban and the velocity of the spread of the Taliban everywhere” by most countries. “No one predicted this outcome, everyone thought it would take longer and there would be more time to get people out,” he said about the fall of Kabul on August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-increasingly-important-for-germany-due-to-role-in-indo-pacific-saysambassador-101632772849051.html
28-09-2021||India||Bengaluru police extend Covid curbs despite a dip in daily cases||Even as the city continues to see a dip in Covid cases, police commissioner Kamal Pant on Monday extended prohibitory orders in Bengaluru till October 11, 6 am. Night curfew will remain in force from 10 pm till 5 am. The order restricts the assembly of more than four persons in public places and activities except those which are permitted under the guidelines. Any violations of this order will be dealt with under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act, 2020, and under Section 188 of the IPC, according to the order. The prohibitory orders come despite the state government’s decision to extend further relaxations from October 1.A member of the Technical Advisory Committee said that the recent decision of the government to allow cinemas, auditoriums, multiplexes, and pubs to operate at100% seating capacity was against the recommendation of the TAC. “We understand that the decrease in Covid cases, especially the positivity could be a motivator to allow more relaxations, but the R-value in the city is still above 1,” said the experts who didn’t want to be named. R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average. “We have seen in the past that after a big dip, an increase in the cases are witnesses. So, at least till the entire population has received at least one dose of vaccination, no further relaxations should be allowed,” said the expert. Talking to the media, Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar said that the government is preparing for a potential third wave, even though the numbers are coming down. “We have augmented our capacity in beds and oxygen supply significantly. The number of ICU beds in Karnataka before Covid was only 725. Currently, the state has 3,877 ICU beds in government medical colleges and government hospitals -- an increase of 5-6 times. There were 4,847 oxygenated beds before Covid,” he said. He also added that decision to allow 100% occupancy in theaters was announced after realizing the vaccination programme had reached a large number of people. “We are only allowing people with at least 1 dose in these places. We have allowed the economy to pick up as well, but we are doing it all precautions in the place,” he said. Karnataka on Monday reported 504 new Covid-19 cases, out of which 181 were reported in Bengaluru. Apart from Bengaluru, all other districts reported less than 100 new cases. 20 deaths were reported on Monday, out of which 5 were reported in the city. The total number of active cases in the state is at 12,804. While the positivity rate for the day stood at 0.54%, the case fatality rate (CFR) was at 1.16%. The state has been consistently reporting less than 1,000 cases a day for more than two weeks now, which begs the question of whether more relaxations should be provided. Meanwhile, shopkeepers and business owners have voiced their dissent against the state government’s decision to continue with the daily night curfew from 10 pm till 5 am, claiming to shut down shops while keeping the traffic movement normal at night shows the ineffectiveness of the Covid-19 regulation. A member of the Bangalore Commercial Street Merchants Association said that they have been given assurances that the curbs will be relaxed since the number of Covid cases have come down, but so far nothing has happened. “This night curfew has been in place for more than 200 days now. When the government announced a lockdown to control the spread of the virus, we cooperated because it was important. But we can’t understand the purpose of the night curfew now,” said the officer bearer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-police-extend-covid-curbs-despite-a-dip-in-daily-cases-101632772549537.html
28-09-2021||India||Bengaluru traffic police to install cameras to check speeding||As the city continues to witness instances of speeding resulting in accidents, the Bengaluru traffic police are now planning to install speed monitoring cameras capable of recording registration plates of the vehicles. In the initial phase, the traffic police have identified 14 flyovers in the city, where the cameras will be installed. “We have been seeing instances of drag racing and another speeding on empty roads at night very often. Since most of such instances are reported post-midnight, we don’t have any traffic police present on the road. To tackle this, we will be installing these cameras, and based on these inputs from their feeds we will act,” said senior officials of the Bengaluru traffic management center. The officer added that deploying traffic police in the middle of the night is not a viable option since large manpower is required to cover all major streets in Bengaluru. “Unlike a drink and drive test, we can’t set up checkpoints because they would race in a different location. So, the cameras will be an effective way to stop this menace,” said the officer. According to official records, the Bengaluru traffic police have a sanctioned strength of 5,262 personnel to regulate traffic across 44,000 intersections and they are 600 men short of the sanctioned strength. The officer added that the use of technology will help the department cope with this shortage as well. It will also work as a pilot project for Bengaluru police’s plans to introduce an artificial intelligence-based CCTV network in the city. In the last Karnataka budget, ₹699 crore has been set aside to install 7,500 surveillance cameras which will enable the state capital’s police to introduce facial recognition technology and machine-learning-based video monitoring. The implementation of these cameras by traffic police is expected to be the first step towards the project. A senior police officer said on condition of anonymity that the 7,500 cameras will include fixed day-and-night surveillance cameras, body-worn cameras, and drones equipped with high-resolution image capturing devices. The police will also procure facial recognition cameras and registration plate recognition devices. All cameras will be connected to a 40-seat Command and Control Centre, with two centers that will be mobile. The 7,500 cameras are only the front-end of the entire project. According to another senior officer, close to 30% of the funds will be used to create a back end. The officer said that to optimize the CCTV network, the police will introduce technologies such as facial recognition. “We want to have surveillance capability where a vehicle spotted at one traffic signal can be identified and tagged so that other cameras can trace the vehicle and predict its possible path. Similarly, we want to track ‘persons of interest’ using facial recognition and other AI-based technologies,” said an officer who is in charge of the project implementation. On September 25, a luxury car that was speeding rammed into a private taxi on HAL Airport Road in east Bengaluru before hitting a compound wall late night. The impact of the crash was such that the taxi with two passengers inside it overturned, however, no injuries were reported. The driver of the Porsche, identified as Zuhair Mevani, 32, a resident of Fraser Town, allegedly lost control of the wheel. This was the third incident in last month, where speeding cars on joyrides have crashed in Bengaluru. On September 1, DMK MLA Y Prakash’s son Karunaa Sagar and six of his friends died after the SUV they were in jumped onto the pavement and rammed into the compound wall of a building. On September 15, two friends were killed on Electronics City flyover when they were mowed down by a speeding car.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-traffic-police-to-install-cameras-to-check-speeding-101632772249680.html
28-09-2021||India||UP withdraws plea on closure of sugar mills from SC ahead of polls||Just months ahead of assembly elections in the state, the Uttar Pradesh government on Monday withdrew from the Supreme Court an appeal that was filed in 2010 to reclaim the state’s authority to shut down its sugar mills and transfer the land for other purposes.The appeal was filed during the regime of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati (2007-12) after the Allahabad high court held in April 2010 that the state could not have passed a law assuming the power to close down the sugar mills or change the land use where the sugar factories stood.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, permitted withdrawal of the state’s appeal after it was informed that the state government has taken a decision to repeal all the provisions in the 2009 law that paved way for divestment, sale or closure of the sugar mills owned by the Uttar Pradesh State Sugar Corporation Limited.The development came less than 24 hours after chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced a ₹25 per quintal hike in the purchase prices of sugarcane. Addressing a gathering of farmers in Lucknow on Sunday, the chief minister had also attacked Mayawati for allegedly selling 21 sugar factories at throwaway prices during the BSP’s rule.Adityanath’s statements, ahead of the upcomig polls in 2022, was viewed as an outreach to farmers, a section of which has been protesting the three contentious farm laws since November last year.During the hearing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the state government, submitted that the state does not wish to prosecute its appeal any further since it wants to do away with all the contentious provisions relating to the 2009 amendment in the Uttar Pradesh Sugar Undertakings (Acquisition) Act, 1971.“As the legality of the high court’s judgment dated April 1, 2010, dealing with constitutional validity of the 2009 Amendment Act, is pending for adjudication before this court in the present matter, the state government is bringing to the court’s notice its decision to repeal the five sub-sections inserted through the amendments,” the solicitor general told the bench, which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.Senior advocate Vivek Tankha, appearing for one of the successful bidders in the sale of sugar mills, resisted the state’s move, saying the bidders had trusted the government with prosecuting the case before the apex court.The bench, however, pointed out that the bidders had not filed any appeal against the high court order independently and therefore, if the state has decided to withdraw its main petition, others cannot oppose. It added that the bidders had also not taken steps to transpose themselves as petitioners in the case.The bench then allowed the state government’s plea while adding that successful bidders could avail of other remedies available to them in law.There are 119 sugar factories in Uttar Pradesh. At least half of them are state-run mills. Uttar Pradesh is the leading producer of sugarcane and the second largest producer of sugar in the country.By inserting sub-sections 3-A, 3-B, 3-C, 3-D and 3-E in the Act in 2009, the Mayawati government had assumed powers to divest, sell, transfer or otherwise part with the sugar mills run by the corporation, besides changing the land use in relation to the land belonging to the schedule undertakings of the corporation.After the amendments, 21 sugar mills were sold between 2010 and 2011 during the BSP’s rule. The controversy began in 2013 when the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said in a report that the sugar mills had been sold at dirt cheap prices and the irregularities led to a loss of ₹1,179 crore to the exchequer.Naseemuddin Siddiqui, once a close aide to Mayawati and a former minister in her government, claimed in 2017 that the “sugar mills were sold on the instructions of then chief minister Mayawati and BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra”. After his claim, Mayawati said Siddiqui, who was later ousted from the party, alone was to blame for the irregularities.While the Akhilesh Yadav government (2012-17) did not take any action in the matter despite the CAG’s report in 2013, in April 2018, the Yogi Adityanath-led Bharatiya Janata Party government in Uttar Pradesh handed over the investigation into the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The state government asked the CBI to investigate the entire sale proceedings of 21 sugar mills, including use of bogus companies and documents in the purchase of seven closed mills in Deoria, Bareilly, Laxmiganj, Hardoi, Ramkola, Chittauni and Barabanki.In his address at the farmers meet held in Lucknow on Sunday, Adityanath had highlighted how his government started reviving the sugar industry in Uttar Pradesh. “During BSP’s rule, 21 sugar mills were shut down and 11 were closed during the rule of Samajwadi Party. Sugar factories worth ₹250 crore to ₹300 crore were sold at throwaway prices,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-withdraws-plea-on-closure-of-sugar-mills-from-sc-ahead-of-polls-101632771948713.html
28-09-2021||India||Karnataka to set up Forensic labs in 6 cities: CM Bommai||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday said that Forensic Science Laboratories (FSL) would be set up in six cities across the state to help speed up investigations and crime detection.New laboratories would be set up in Kalaburagi, Hubballi-Dharwad and Mysuru, he said.The chief minister also stated that he has already discussed this issue with the Union home minister Amit Shah.There have already been discussions over the need for forensic science labs to be used more to help not just in solving crimes but also increase the rate of prosecution.The conviction rate in Bengaluru, known for its prowess in technology and science, is just around 50% that is below the state average of around 51.2%, data from National Crime Records Bureau show.The conviction rate in Bengaluru is the lowest among the biggest cities in India that includes Delhi and Mumbai. The state conviction rate average is only second to that of West Bengal with 13.4% but miles behind Delhi which has a rate of 85.6% and Tamil Nadu’s 66%, data shows.Bommai further said that a training centre in the model of National Defence Academy in Khadakwasla (near Pune) would be set up for the mid level personnel of the state police department.“For the first time officers on crime scene are being appointed in the state. Apart from this, 16,000 police constables and sub-inspectors are being appointed, he said. Officers of rank of deputy SP and above should not restrict themselves to the office and administrative works, instead, they need to visit police stations and also should work on field,” according to a statement by the chief minister’s office (CMO), attributing the comments to Bommai.He also added that an additional 500 police stations would be built over the next five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-to-set-up-forensic-labs-in-6-cities-cmbommai-101632771948970.html
28-09-2021||India||Congress leader Sudheeran quits AICC, days after resigning from pac in Kerala||Two days after he quit the party’s political affairs committee (PAC), sulking Congress leader V M Sudheeran on Monday announced his resignation from the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the second-highest decision-making body of the party after the Congress Working Committee. His announcement came in the wake of his scheduled meeting with AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar who rushed to the state to sort out problems arising out of the recent elevation of a new set of state and district leaders. While Sudheeran, former PCC chief and five-time MP, did not disclose reasons behind his sudden decision leaders close to him said he was not happy with the functioning of new PCC chief K Sudhakaran and opposition leader V D Satheesan. There are complaints that decisions are taken unanimously, and senior leaders are often ignored. But the PCC chief said Sudheeran was consulted before announcing the DCC list. Hectic efforts are on to placate the senior leader, and Anwar is expected to call on him in the evening. Former CM Oommen Chandy and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala also termed his resignation unfortunate and asked the party leaders to talk to him. Known for his clean image he quit the PCC chief’s post after the party’s rout in the 2016 assembly elections. But there are allegations against him that he forced then CM Chandy to take some unpopular decisions like the new liquor policy. Firework started in the faction-ridden party with the appointment of new party president K Sudhakaran, a tough leader from Communist heartland Kannur and opposition leader V D Satheesan, sidelining two powerful blocs led by former CM Oommen Chandy and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala who ruled the party for more than one and a half-decade. Problems aggravated after the DCC presidents’ list was released last month. Now the party has 150-odd secretaries, and many other office-bearers and the PCC chief made it clear that all new party bodies would be lean and mean. To protect group equations earlier leaders filled maximum posts with their supporters, and often the party took backstage with the rise of powerful groups. And those who were not part of these factions were ignored. Many see it as a major generational shift, but group leaders refuse to buy it, saying it is difficult for the party to surge ahead by sidelining two senior leaders and their followers. After the public display of anger, three senior leaders have quit the party, A V Gopinath, K P Anil Kumar, and PS Prashanth. The last two later joined the ruling CPI(M).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-sudheeran-quits-aicc-days-after-resigning-from-pac-in-kerala-101632770568900.html
28-09-2021||India||Supreme Court grants Tamil Nadu poll panel four months to hold local polls||The Supreme Court Monday granted the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission four more months to conduct urban local body elections.On June 22, the court directed the state election commission to conduct the local body polls in nine new districts carved out of four existing ones in Tamil Nadu by September 15 this year. On Monday, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India N V Ramana, took note of the submissions that six more municipal corporations and 28 new municipalities have been added now for which it needs to complete the poll-related formalities. “Even if the reasons are very silly, we want to give some more time,” remarked the bench, which included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohi, while giving four months for completion of the poll process. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the state poll panel, had sought time till April end of next year, but the bench asserted only four months will be given as the final extension. During a brief hearing, the bench also expressed surprise over the consent of the PIL petitioner S Shankar, who had filed the plea for holding the local body elections in the grant of extra time to the poll panel. “Mr (P) Wilson (senior advocate representing the petitioner), you have filed this petition for election. Now you are agreeing for the time and the adjournment,” the bench observed. The senior lawyer replied the poll panel has to conduct elections for more than 600 urban bodies and now, six municipal corporations, 28 municipalities have been constituted and it will lead to a decrease in the number of existing 528 town panchayats in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-grants-tamil-nadu-poll-panel-four-months-to-hold-local-polls-101632770088955.html

If children are not safe outside the home, this is a matter of huge concern,” the judge said, underlining the gravity of the offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-man-gets-death-penalty-for-raping-killing-8yearold-101632770031341.html
28-09-2021||India||Arrested YouTuber’s ‘links’ with political bigwigs in Kerala under scanner||After self-proclaimed antique collector and YouTuber Monson Mavunkal was arrested in Kochi on Sunday for allegedly swindling money, many photos and videos have started appearing in social media showing how he flaunted his high connections to cheat people. He is currently in judicial custody.Senior politicians like state Congress president K Sudhakaran and deputy inspector general of police S Surendran figure in some of the photos and videos. Hindustan Times could not verify the authenticity of these photos and videos. Sudhakaran, in his response on Monday, said that he knew him and visiting him for skin treatment but was unware of his unlawful activities. “I approached him in connection with skin treatment. I was recommended by one of my old friends in Kochi. I was not aware of his past or his degree,” he said in Kannur (north Kerala). He said many VIPs used to visit him and that his name has been singled out and is deliberately being dragged to defame him. Sudhakaran, who is a betnoire of the CM Pinarayi Vijayan, blamed the CM’s office for this. Like Sudhakaran, DIG S Surendran also said he was unaware of his unlawful activities.Mavunkal runs a big museum in the port city and many VIPs were frequent visitors here. Police said he promised partnership for gullible investors in an upcoming archaeological museum in Kochi and collected money from many businessmen. There are also complaints that he gifted antiques to many VIPs and that he collected money from them later saying his payments were delayed due to some technical glitches abroad. Police, however, later found that he did not have any foreign bank account and his doctorate and medical degrees were also fictitious. There were many attempts to hush up cases against him and around six victims later approached the CM who later directed a special team to investigate complaints against him which later led to his arrest. He was reportedly close to many senior police officers as well. “We have been complaining about him for quite some time. But he used his influence with the police to hush them up. Many VIPs were frequent visitors there. He claimed he’s a cosmetologist from Germany. Many people were cheated but fearing backlash and bad publicity they didn’t lodge a complaint,” said one of the complainants K T Shameer who said he was duped of ₹3 crore, by offering a share in the fictitious museum. In his YouTube videos Mavunkal claimed that he possess many antique pieces like Mysuru emperor Tipu Sultan’s throne, silver coins Judas received for betraying Jesus Christ, Soloman- era gold coins and rare books on Maratha warrior Shivaji and Mughal emperor Aurangazeb. He also claimed that he is a German-trained cosmetologist and treated many VIPs. Police said that during interrogation, he claimed that the antique gifts he gave were replicas and not the original ones. A senior police officer, who did not want to be identified, said he was a master conman and owned a fleet of luxury cars. “There are around 30 cars in his yard. We have information that he even brought used and abandoned high-end cars to show off. It seems most of the VIPs were not aware of his shady past,” he said, adding he also used private security guards and surrounded by many secretaries. He said graft cases worth ₹20 crore have surfaced so far and more complaints are likely to be filed. He also heads a number of self-made organisations and NGOs. There are unconfirmed reports that some central agencies also sought details about him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrested-youtuber-s-links-with-political-bigwigs-in-kerala-under-scanner-101632770030234.html
28-09-2021||India||Brahmin groups protest Andhra Pradesh order on welfare department||A gazette notification issued by the Andhra Pradesh government last week bringing the AP Brahmin Welfare Corporation under the control of the Backward Classes Welfare Department sparked controversy as Brahmin groups strongly protested move to club them with the OBCs.Hitherto, the Brahmin welfare corporation was under the purview of the Revenue (Endowments) department, and the gazette notification issued by chief secretary Adityanath Das on September 23 sought to transfer the same to the Backward Classes welfare department.The notification said necessary amendments would be made to the second schedule of the Andhra Pradesh Government Business Rules, 2018. “The decision was taken to improve the synergy among various welfare corporations and make it part of Economically Weaker Sections Corporations in the BC welfare department,” the chief secretary said.Former chairman of AP Brahmin Welfare Corporation Vemuri Ananda Surya said the gazette notification bringing Brahmin welfare under BC Welfare Department was atrocious and showed how much contempt the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had towards Brahmins.“This is not only insulting the Brahmin community but also an attempt to create differences between Brahmins and OBCs. Before the last assembly elections, the YSRC had promised to allot ₹1,000 crore for Brahmin welfare in every budget and construct Brahmin Bhavans in every district. Instead of honouring the promise, the Jagan government is clubbing the Brahmin welfare with that of the OBCs,” Surya said.He warned of state-wide agitation by Brahmins, if the government does not withdraw the gazette notification.All India Brahmin Federation vice-president Dronamraju Ravi Kumar said it was the question of self-respect for Brahmins. “We want the state government to create a separate department for Economically Weaker Sections and bring the Brahmin Welfare Corporation under its purview, instead of creating unnecessary controversies,” he said.A senior official in the state government, who preferred anonymity that it was the previous Telugu Desam Party government led by N Chandrababu Naidu that the AP Brahmin Welfare Corporation was first incorporated under the Backward Classes Welfare Department through a government order (GO No. 11 dated December 8, 2014).“Subsequently, the Naidu government transferred the Brahmin welfare corporation into the Revenue (endowments) department, in March 2015, following protests from the Brahmin community,” the official said.However, some people had moved the court later, challenging this decision, alleging that the government was diverting funds meant for the restoration of temples for Brahmin welfare. “The issue is still in the court. To avoid litigations, the government has decided to transfer the Brahmin welfare corporation back into the BC Welfare department,” the official added.The latest decision of the Jagan government also angered Brahmin seers. “We strongly oppose the move to bring Brahmin welfare corporation into the purview of BC Welfare Department. We shall discuss the issue with the chief minister’s office to see that the notification is withdrawn,” said Swamy Swaroopanandendra of Visakha Sarada Peetham, considered to be the spiritual advisor to the chief minister.“We propose to create a separate department for EWS and bring all the upper caste welfare corporations under this department. We hope to get a positive decision in this regard,” the seer said.A senior Brahmin leader from YSRCP and deputy speaker of state assembly Kona Raghupathi defended the government’s decision. He said it was meant only for ensuring the release of adequate funds under the BC Welfare Department.“The government has not issued any order including the Brahmins under OBC list. They continue to be under the open category and get the benefits of all the welfare schemes envisaged in the corporation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brahmin-groups-protest-andhra-pradesh-order-on-welfare-department-101632769968851.html
28-09-2021||India||After four beheadings, Tamil Nadu police arrest 3k in 52 hrs||Tamil Nadu police have arrested 3,325 criminals in a 52-hour long statewide crackdown, triggered by four beheadings reported from Dindigul and Tirunelveli districts earlier this month, the police said on Monday. Despite arresting several people in connection with the killings, the police said such operations would be conducted in future to maintain law and order in the state.The crackdown, called ‘Storming Operation’, started on Thursday on directions of Tamil Nadu DGP Sylendra Babu, in which 21,592 people with criminal backgrounds were questioned, of whom 3,325 were arrested, and 1,117 weapons seized from them, the police said. Of the arrested criminals, 2,526 were released based on a one-year peace bond signed by them. “Peace bond is a judicial power with the police under the Criminal Procedure Code where we ask the offenders to sign a bond for a year promising that they will not be involved in any unlawful activities and if they break it, they will be arrested,” explained a senior police officer in Chennai. “The power for this procedure is with the deputy commissioner for every police division.” In Chennai, the police arrested 257 people after questioning 2,439 people with criminal backgrounds. “During this operation, we also arrested high-profile criminal ‘Arcot’ Suresh, who has five murder cases pending against him,” a senior police official said, not wishing to be named. ‘Arcot’ Suresh, alias V Suresh, is a gangster whom the Chennai police arrested in 2014, but went absconding after getting out on bail. During the operation, police received a tip about his whereabouts and on Sunday, he was arrested from Chennai’s Pulianthope. Suresh, 43, is the main accused in a 2015 murder case, which happened in front of a city court in Chennai and has overall 20 pending cases against him, including five attempts to murder cases. Chennai police also arrested several other notorious criminals, including Vimal Kumar (24), S Ranjith (26), K Venkatesan (51) and S Rathinam (37), who have pending cases against them. The recent beheadings in Tamil Nadu, suspected by police to be revenge killings, were the tipping point to conduct the unannounced operation. On September 23, Nirmala Devi (70) was beheaded in Dindigul and a senior police official of the district said that her severed head was kept in front of the house of a deceased Dalit leader, C Pasupathi Pandian. Devi allegedly gave shelter to the suspects in the killing of Pandian in 2012, and the case is pending at the district’s trial court. Police have so far arrested eight people for Devi’s murder, the official said on the condition of anonymity. On the same day, a textile trader, Stephen Raj (38), was beheaded by unknown assailants. His decapitated head was left at the spot where he was murdered. The police are probing the reason behind the murder. “It’s a coincidence that the two murders happened on the same day, but they are unrelated,” said the official quoted above. In Tirunelveli district, a farmer, Sankara Subramanian (38), belonging to the Thevar caste, was murdered on September 13, and his decapitated head was found near a lake. “How they murdered him and left his head led us to conclude that this was in revenge for the murder of a Dalit man, named Manirathnam, back in 2013,” said a senior police official in Tirunelveli. “The two murders were similar,” he said. Police arrested six people, including Manithiram’s son Maharaja (20). In two days, Subramanian’s killing saw retaliation and a gang murdered a Dalit, Mariappan (32), on September 15. His severed head was found on the same spot where Subramanian was murdered. Mariappan was accused in a murder case of 2014. Police arrested eight people in the case. “Those accused of murder and are out on bail are behind these attacks, but the law-and-order situation is back to normal now,” said the official quoted above. Tirunelveli is heading to rural local body elections on October 6 and 9. AIADMK’s coordinator and deputy opposition leader O Panneerselvam last week urged chief minister M K Stalin to ensure peace in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-four-beheadings-tamil-nadu-police-arrest-3k-in-52-hrs-101632769909423.html

T Shreedhar, the superintendent of police, Koppal, said the incident took place on September 14, but it came to light on Friday when the man was forced to offer the feast as a punishment. Police said the incident was reported from Lakshmi Devi temple at a village in Karatagi taluk of the district. According to the senior officer, after a theft was reported in the village some time ago, the temple’s priests restricted the entry only to themselves. “The Dalit man had made a vow to conduct some prayers in the temple and on September 14, he entered the temple. When the priests came to know about this on Friday, they demanded that he must make amends by offering a feast,” said the officer. Police said based on the information from the man, they have registered a case under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). So far, eight people have been detained for questioning in the case, a police officer said, adding further probe was on. In a similar incident on September 4, parents of a Dalit boy were fined ₹23,000 after their 2-year-old son entered a Hanuman temple on his birthday at Miyapura village near Hanumasagar in the same district. According to people aware of the incident, Dalits in the village are not allowed inside the temples and they only pray from outside. Police had said that the man wanted to pray from outside the temple. However, the toddler in excitement ran inside the temple, after which the temple authorities leveled a fine of ₹23,000. Upon receiving the information regarding the incident, the police registered a case and arrested five people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-dalit-man-forced-to-spend-11k-on-feast-for-entering-temple-101632769728048.html
28-09-2021||India||Minority institutes receiving govt aid have to comply with terms, says SC||The Supreme Court on Monday held that minority institutions receiving aid from the government have to comply with conditions imposed on it under the law. The remark was made in a judgment where the top court upheld a 2010 policy decision of the Uttar Pradesh government to outsource appointment of Class IV employees in all state-run and aided institutions and schools.Stating that the institutions receiving aid from the government cannot be distinguished based on their minority character, a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh said, “When it comes to aided institutions, there cannot be any difference between a minority and non-minority one. Article 30 of the Constitution of India (dealing with rights of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions) is subject to its own restrictions being reasonable. A protection cannot be expanded into a better right than one which a non-minority institution enjoys. Law has become quite settled on this issue and therefore does not require any elaboration.”The apex court further stated that there cannot be a fundamental right to get an aid from the government and no institution can seek aid on its own terms. “With the grant of an aid, the conditions come. If an institution does not want to accept and comply with the conditions accompanying such aid, it is well open to it to decline the grant and move in its own way. On the contrary, an institution can never be allowed to say that the grant of aid should be on its own terms.”The top court was deciding on a petition by the UP government that challenged a November 19, 2018 Allahabad high court order, which scrapped the state’s policy of outsourcing class 4 employees due to huge financial burden. The high court order came on petitions filed by colleges and individuals, who challenged a government order of September 8, 2010 that abolished recruitment of all permanent posts of Class IV staff.The appeals by the state filed through advocate Harish Pandey and argued by additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati questioned the order of the HC in examining the policy decision of the state which applied equally to all aided and state institutions. The state argued that by way of a law notified in 1992, the state’s approval was mandatory for filling up vacancy of any non-teaching posts in recognised aided institutions. In 2013, this regulation was amended by which Class “IV” employees were to be filled up by the institutions through “outsourcing”.The minority institutions argued before the top court that a distinction has to be carved out for minority institutions, otherwise the regulation would violate the fundamental rights granted to minority institutions under Article 30(1) of the Constitution of India.Referring to a 2020 decision of the Supreme Court in SK Mohammad Rafique case, the bench held, “The haze between a minority and non-minority institution is no longer in existence….On the aforesaid issue we have no hesitation in reiterating the principle that an institution receiving aid is bound by the conditions imposed and therefore expected to comply. Once we hold so, the challenge made on various grounds, falls to the ground.”The court further stated that the decision to grant aid is by way of policy where the government is not only concerned with the interest of the institutions but the ability to undertake such an exercise. “Financial constraints and deficiencies are the factors which are considered relevant in taking any decision qua aid, including both the decision to grant aid and the manner of disbursement of an aid,” the bench added.The decision came as a succor to the state reeling under the impact of the HC order. The burden to pay the salaries of the contractual Class IV employees was transferred to the institutions. Justice Sundresh, writing the judgment for the bench, said, “The respondents/writ petitioners and similarly placed persons who are recruited by the institutions including the respondents shall be continued with the same scale of pay as if they are recruited prior to 08.09.2010 for which the entire disbursement will have to be made by the institutions alone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minority-institutes-receiving-govt-aid-have-to-comply-with-terms-says-sc-101632769368815.html

28-09-2021||India||Cyclone Gulab: Heavy rains batter Andhra Pradesh, red alert in 14 Telangana districts||HyderabadHeavy rains battered Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts in Andhra Pradesh on Monday, after cyclonic storm ‘Gulab’ made a landfall between and north coastal parts of the state and south Odisha around midnight on Sunday.Neighbouring Telangana, too, witnessed moderate to heavy rains in several parts as the cyclonic storm, which weakened into deep depression, moved towards northern Telangana and Chhattisgarh in the last 12 hours.Hyderabad meteorological department director Dr K Nagaratna said red alert had been sounded in 14 districts in North Telangana, which are expected to receive heavy to very heavy rains in the next 24 hours.The Telangana government asked the administrative machineries in Nirmal, Nizamabad, Kamareddy, Jagitial, Rajanna Siricilla, Siddipet, Peddapalli, Karimnagar, Jangaon, Warangal, Hanamkonda, Mahabubabad, Khammam and Bhadradri Kothagudem districts to gear up for any eventualities.Srikakulam district collector Shrikesh B Lathkar said there were reports of six fishermen, all belonging to Manchineelapeta village of Vazrapu Kothuru block, missing in the sea at the time of the Cyclone Gulab making the landfall. “However, five of them managed to swim ashore and another person is feared drowned in the sea,” he said.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who held a virtual meeting with district collectors and other officials over the impact of Cyclone Gulab, directed them to expedite relief measures in affected areas.He announced an ex gratia of ₹5 lakh to the families of the deceased, if any, during the cyclone, besides ₹1,000 to each affected family when they return from relief camps.Andhra Pradesh chief secretary Adityanath Das, who had been monitoring the situation from Visakhapatnam, told the chief minister that heavy gales at a speed of 80-90 km per hour caused extensive damage at several places in the north coastal parts of the state. There were reports of uprooting of trees and electric poles, but steps were taken to clear them immediately, the chief secretary said.He added that thousands of people from the affected areas were evacuated to safer areas. Relief measures are in full swing in Visakhapatnam city, which witnessed heavy waterlogging in several areas, including the roads leading to the airport. There was no disruption of flight services from Visakhapatnam, airport authorities confirmed.Several trains passing through north-coastal Andhra districts were cancelled in the last 24 hours, while some trains were running late. The Yeshwanthapur-Howrah Special Express was running five hours behind the schedule, besides Visakhapatnam-Guntur special train, Visakhapatnam-Hazrath Nizamuddin and Chennai Central-Howrah Express were also been three to eight hours behind schedule, according to East Coast Railway authorities.The Andhra CM instructed the authorities to restore power as soon as the rains subside and suggested to keep monitoring the situation every 30 minutes. He asked them to ensure adequate food and water, besides proper medical care to the people in the relief camps, people aware of the details said.Reddy also asked the officials to prepare the report on the enumeration of crop damage in a generous manner and provide immediate relief to farmers. The CM also ordered the authorities to move the people residing in the villages close to Vamsadhara and Nagavali rivers to the relief camps, as these two rivers are expected to receive flash floods due to heavy rains in Odisha, the people added.State disaster management commissioner K Kanna Babu said the Bay of Bengal continued to be turbulent due to cyclonic storm. He appealed to fishermen not to venture into the sea till Tuesday evening while asking the people of north-coastal Andhra not to come out of their houses.The Srikakulam district collector said there was a heavy impact of Cyclone Gulab in Santha Bommali and Vazrapu Kothuru blocks. “Electricity supply in entire Srikakulam district was affected due to uprooting of electric poles and damaging of power distribution network. Instructions have been issued to all the departments to take up restoration works. Teams of national and state disaster response forces are working round the clock to take up rescue operations,” the collector said.Rehabilitation centres were set up in 30 places in Srikakulam district and around 1,500 people were shifted to safer places. The district collectorate has set up a control room and issued toll free number, 08942240557, for those affected.Vizianagaram district witnessed heavy rains since Sunday night, with Gazapathinagaram block receiving the highest rainfall of 20 cm in the last 12 hours, followed by Pusapatirega (19 cm), Nellimarla (14 cm), Garividi (12 cm), Kothavalasa (11 cm) and Saluru (10 cm), officials said.Meanwhile, in Telangana, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao reviewed the rain situation in the state with chief secretary Somesh Kumar and other higher officials. He asked the authorities to ensure that all measures are taken to prevent loss of life and property.The chief secretary said services of NDRF teams in Hyderabad, Kottagudem and Warangal will be sought for rescue operations in the event of any such requirement. A separate control room will be set up in each district collectorate and information regarding the same will be provided to the control room set up in the secretariat, Kumar said.He added that the situation should be reviewed by appointing special officers at affected areas such as inland areas, ponds, ditches and bridges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-gulab-heavy-rains-batter-andhra-pradesh-red-alert-in-14-telangana-districts-101632769073025.html
28-09-2021||India||2 locals held for inciting violence during Assam eviction drive, say police||Assam Police on Monday arrested two persons for allegedly instigating violence during last week’s eviction drive in Darrang district, in which two civilians were killed and nearly 20 others, including 11 policemen, were injured. The clashes between those who were being evicted and the police took place on September 23 at Dholpur-3 village, located nearly 65 km away from Guwahati.District police officials familiar with the development said Chand Mamud, 47, a resident of Kirakara village and Asmat Ali Ahmed, 37, of Dholpur 3 were arrested in connection with a case registered at Sipajhar police station under several sections of Indian Penal Code, including criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, rioting with deadly weapon, wrongful restraint, causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from doing duty, assault and attempt to murder. Both are representatives of panchayat bodies in Dholpur.“The two were arrested for instigating the people to attack the police during the eviction drive. They were responsible for inciting violence in the area, which left two persons dead and several others injured, including 11 policemen,” a district official was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. The areas where the eviction drives are underway are part of Assam government’s Garukhuti Project, which aims to remove encroachers from 77,420 ‘bighas’ (25,595 acres) of land located on a massive sandbar close to the Brahmaputra river to hold agricultural and other allied activities for indigenous youths in the region.This year’s state budget mentioned that the government plans to “develop this cluster as a beacon of resurgent Assam” and earmarked ₹9.6 crore for it. Residents of these areas mostly comprise Bengali-speaking Muslims, many of whom are engaged in agriculture. Following the incident last week, the Assam government had decided to institute a judicial inquiry by a retired judge of Gauhati High Court. Assuring rehabilitation to deserving landless residents who have been evicted, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had alleged on Saturday that there is evidence that the Popular Front of India (PFI) was involved in the violence during the eviction drive and has written to the Centre to ban the outfit. The PFI, however, denied the charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-local-residents-arrested-for-inciting-violence-during-assam-eviction-drive-police-101632768889795.html
28-09-2021||India||Gulab after-effects may lead to cyclone on western coast : IMD||Cyclone Gulab, which made its landfall in Andhra Pradesh on Monday, may weaken further into a deep depression on Tuesday but intensify into a new cyclone later in the week, officials in India Meteorological Department (IMD) familiar with the developments said.The cyclonic storm is expected to turn into a well-marked low pressure area on Tuesday and emerge in the northeast Arabian sea and Gujarat coast around Thursday. The system may probably intensify on Friday, leading to the development of cyclone Shaheen in the region, the officials cited above said.“Though chances are less, we cannot rule out the possibility of its intensification into a cyclone. The low-pressure area (remnant of Gulab) will move westwards across central India, bringing a lot of rain in the region. It will cross Maharashtra and Gujarat as a low-pressure system. With an incursion of moisture from the Arabian Sea, the system will be reinvigorated. Rapid intensification of the low-pressure system cannot be ruled out now because the ocean and atmospheric conditions are favourable. The cyclone or depression will move towards northern parts of the Arabian Sea,” Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD, explained.In association with the system, winds are likely to strengthen along the western coast in the next two to three days. The monsoon trough is currently lying to the south of its normal position and is likely to remain there for the next four to five days, the weather body said.According to Devi, an east-west trough is also running from north Konkan to a cyclonic circulation associated with the deep depression over south Odisha. It is likely to persist for the next two days. A remnant from a cyclone over the Pacific has also emerged as a cyclonic circulation over east central Bay of Bengal. “These consecutive systems will bring widespread rain over different parts of the country for a week,” she said.Under the influence of these systems, very heavy rainfall to extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) is very likely at isolated areas over north coastal Andhra Pradesh, south Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha, Kerala and Telangana. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is also expected at isolated regions over south Odisha, central Maharashtra, Konkan, Gujarat, north interior Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for the next two days.Sea conditions, the IMD said, will be rough to very rough over west central and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal, and along and off Andhra Pradesh and adjoining Odisha coasts on Monday night.As on Monday, there has been a 2% deficiency in monsoon rain over the country since June 1. There has been 10% excess rain over south Peninsula, 1% excess over central India, 4% deficiency over northwest India and 24% deficiency over east and northeast India.Patchy to scattered rain is also likely over several parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, due to movement of the remnant of Gulab in a westerly direction. “We are only expecting scattered rain here. However there will be rain in many other parts of the country due to formation of low pressure systems one after the other mainly due to remnants coming from the Pacific. The monsoon season will officially end on September 30 but its withdrawal may be delayed,” K Sathi Devi, head of national weather forecasting centre, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gulab-after-effects-may-lead-to-cyclone-on-western-coast-imd-101632768829050.html
28-09-2021||India||Wildlife Institute of India drops MSc, PhD courses after losing affiliation||Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has suspended its doctoral programmes and postgraduate courses in wildlife science and heritage conservation and management after its affiliation to Rajkot-based Saurashtra University was withdrawn.Saurashtra University in Gujarat withdrew its affiliation earlier this year, citing a 2008 University Grants Commission circular that said that no off-campus study or outreach centre should be established by the university outside the territorial jurisdiction of the state, according to an official at WII, who declined to be named. “We do not have affiliation to any other university now,” said the official at the autonomous institute under the union environment ministry. WII director Dhananjai Mohan said: “The MSc and Phd programmes have been kept in abeyance because of some serious issues pointed by the office of the director general of audits. We are trying our best to get affiliation in Uttarakhand.” Conservationists and WII alumni are concerned about the sudden suspension. “The crown jewel of the academic programmes at WII is one of the oldest and most reputed Master’s courses for Wildlife Science in India. Its national and international impacts can be assessed by looking at the sheer number and contribution of ecologists and conservation leaders who were trained at WII,” the alumni wrote in an online petition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 18.WII is a unique institution in Asia, where scientists, researchers, Indian Forest Service officers and policymakers work in close collaboration, enabling effective translation of research into policy, the alumni said.WII has been a centre for excellence for Saurashtra University since 1987.“We have Phd programmes under Forest Research Institute, which is a deemed University, and (also) under Saurashtra University. Those under Saurashtra University had to be suspended because of a Supreme Court orderwhich states that state universities cannot establish off-campus centres beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the concerned state. A UGC circular also states the same,” said a conservation scientist at WII. “This was brought to the notice of the administration when there was an internal audit a couple of years back. The administration should have acted immediately to get a fresh affiliation, which did not happen,” the scientist said, requesting anonymity. “Last year they tried to get affiliation from Doon University, but it did not materialise. So, the masters and Phd programmes had to be suspended.”“We are aware of the issue. They are also having issues with funding,” an environment ministry official said, but declined to be named. “We will discuss the matter with them.”The alumni of WII, which is running an online campaign to demand resumption of these programmes, tweeted last week: “So far, we have received 134 #signatures supporting the petition that includes @UniofOxford and @Cambridge_Uni. Consider urging @wiiofficial1 well-wishers and alumni you know to support us. MSc & PhD Courses delayed = #wildlife courses denied during #wildlife courses denied during #pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wildlife-institute-of-india-drops-msc-phd-courses-after-losing-affiliation-101632768588739.html
28-09-2021||India||4 men rape 2 UP girls in cyber cafe, extort ₹10,000 not to leak video: Police||Two girls, aged 15 and 16, were allegedly taken hostage and gangraped in a cyber cafe, in Uttar Pradesh’s Kannauj district, where they had gone to get some documents photocopied, police said on Monday.While one person has been arrested, three others were detained in connection with the case, they added.According to the police, the incident took place on September 13 when the minors had visited the cafe run by one of the accused. The girls alleged that they were held captive for several hours and raped by four men who also recorded a video of the incident. The accused later extorted ₹10,000 from the girls by threatening to circulate the clip, police said.The incident, however, came to light when the families of the two survivors found a huge amount of money missing from their homes, Kannauj superintendent of police Prashant Varma said. The 16-year-old alleged that she and her friend (second survivor) stole money from their respective houses to meet the accused’s demand. Subsequently, a first information report (FIR) was filed at Sadar Kotwali against four people under section 376 (rape) of Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act on the basis of the 16-year-old’s statement on Sunday night, Kannauj superintendent of police Prashant Varma said. While one person was arrested from Gorakhpur on Monday evening, the remaining three were nabbed from Kannauj district and detained.The girls, meanwhile, were sent to a district hospital for medical examination. Police said they found signs of prostitution from the cafe. One of the girls also told police that the wife of one of the accused made her phone calls, pressurising her into prostitution, the SP said.Bhanu Bhaskar, additional director general of police, Kanpur zone, said several teams were formed to arrest the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-girls-gang-raped-in-cyber-cafe-in-up-s-kannauj-district-say-police-101632768348618.html
28-09-2021||India||Police align with government, then have to pay back with interest: CJI Ramana||Police officers who do the bidding of a government have to “pay back with interest” when the political regime changes, cautioned the Supreme Court on Monday as it took a grim view of the “growing trend”.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana was emphatic that such police officers should not expect mercy from a court of law if they choose to align themselves with a particular party in power. “When you (police officer) are too close to the government, a day will come when you will be on the other side and will have to pay for your actions. When you are good with a government, you may extract money, benefits and all...then you have to pay back with interest when the government changes,” remarked the bench, which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli. The comments came as the court heard a petition by suspended senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Gurjinder Pal Singh, who faces arrest in a case of extortion. Singh, who was on August 26 granted protection from arrest by the top court in two separate cases involving sedition and corruption charges in Chhattisgarh, approached the apex court for similar relief in a third case of extortion. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the suspended officer, apprised the bench of the previous order and sought protection from arrest in the new case. The bench, however, expressed anguish at the state of affairs. “You cannot get protection in every case. You started extracting money because you were close with the government. This is what happens if you are close with the government and do such things...you have to pay back one day.”It added: “This is too much...why should we grant protection to such officers? This is a new and growing trend in the country. Why should we protect someone like you?” The senior lawyer replied that officers such as his client need the protection of the court because they are targeted out of vendetta. “This court had come across the facts in the previous cases when he (Singh) was protected from arrest earlier.” To this, the bench said that it would want to hear all the petitions filed by the IPS officer together. The court issued a notice to the Chhattisgarh government and fixed all three petitions for a detailed hearing on October 1. It clarified that Singh will not be arrested till the next date of hearing.In his first petition before the top court, the 1994-batch IPS officer asked for the quashing of a sedition FIR lodged at Raipur on July 8. This followed the FIR registered by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) for allegedly amassing assets.According to the Chhattisgarh Police, when Singh’s house was raided by ACB, the police found some pieces of paper in a drain behind the house which were later reconstructed into some notes and reports against various functionaries of the state government. As per the police, these were intended to tarnish the image of the government and destroy peace and harmony in the state. Subsequently, in addition to a corruption FIR, another FIR invoking the sedition charge was registered against Singh.The third FIR was lodged on a complaint by Kamal Kumar Sen, who cited an incident in 2015 when Singh allegedly extorted money from him after threatening to implicate him in a false case. Singh approached the top court after the high court on September 16 did not protect him from arrest.In his petitions, Singh has claimed that the criminal cases were foisted on him since he did not accede to a demand made by Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel to frame the previous chief minister of the state in certain cases of illegal gratification. Singh has pleaded that the cases be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation for an unbiased probe. During the hearing of the first two petitions on August 26, the Supreme Court urged police officials to conduct themselves in a responsible way so that the rule of law can endure. It pointed out that till the time they keep favouring political parties, such instances will keep happening.“It is a very disturbing trend...In some way, the police department will have to be held responsible. Rule of law will not exist if police officers do not feel responsible and are made accountable for such behaviour,” the court said then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-align-with-government-then-have-to-pay-back-with-interest-cjiramana-101632767988606.html
28-09-2021||India||Bharat Bandh: Trains halted, highways blocked as farmers’ strike impacts states||The Bharat Bandh call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a collective of over 30 farmer organisations, affected Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, eastern Rajasthan and parts of northern Madhya Pradesh, but its impact in the rest of the country was limited to opposition parties and farm bodies holding symbolic protests.The 10-hour-long national strike was to mark one year of the Centre’s refusal to revoke three farm laws that the organisations are dead against.“There was an unprecedented response to Bharat Bandh,” SKM said in a statement. “The bandh was observed in almost all the states and memorandums were submitted to local government officials.”Among opposition leaders, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to talk to agitating farmers and listen to their legitimate grievances. “Kisano ka ahimsak satyagraha aaj bhi akhand hai, lekin shoshankar sarkar ko ye nahi pasand hai, isliye aaj Bharat Bandh hai (Farmers’ non-violent satyagraha is resolute even today, but the exploitative government does not like this and that’s why it is Bharat Bandh today),” he tweeted.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, however, said the strike was “politically motivated”.“The bandh is politically-motivated to mislead the people and create a divide in the society. Modi ji has tirelessly worked for benefit of farmers and have ensure they get maximum from participation of private players in agriculture sector while protecting their interests,” Reddy said.In Punjab, the protesters laid siege to nearly 500 locations, blocking interstate highways and key rail routes. Educational institutions and government offices reported thin attendance. According to the railways, 14 trains were cancelled, eight were rescheduled, and two short terminated in the Ferozepur rail division. In the Ambala division, 19 trains were cancelled and 15 rescheduled.Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi appealed the Centre to repeal the three farm laws. He held a meeting with his Cabinet colleagues and passed a resolution against the laws. “We urge the central government to repeal the three farm laws and accept demand of farmers,” a government statement read.“It is a near-total bandh in Punjab. The response is overwhelming. We are thankful to social organisations and farmer groups who have come out in support,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), a constituent of SKM.In Haryana, the highways from Rohtak to Delhi, Hisar and Chandigarh were blocked for 10 hours, and rail traffic was hit due to protests in Sonepat and Jind districts. The strike also evoked total response in Rohtak, Hisar and Bhiwani, as most traders kept their business establishments closed. The entry and exit gates of Metro stations from Tikri to Bahadurgarh on the outskirts of Delhi were closed, officials said.SKM leader Inderjit Singh said, “Shopkeepers and small factory owners also shut their establishments in support of farmers till 4pm. We occupied highways and rail tracks to raise our voice, though medical staff and ambulances were allowed passage.”In western Uttar Pradesh, farm leader Rakesh Takait led the protests. Highways and roads were blocked in close to 200 locations including the Delhi-Agra expressway. There was, however, little or impact of the strike in central, eastern or Bundelkhand regions of the state. The strike was peaceful as adequate police and security was deployed at different places and they helped stranded vehicles to travel through alternative routes, officials said.Bhartiya Kisan Union’s media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said the strike was successful, and received support from lawyers and traders across districts. “We would continue our fight for rights of farmers,” Malik said.In Madhya Pradesh, where protests were held at agriculture produce markets (mandis), some shops remained closed in cities such as Indore, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Ujjain and Mandsaur. In Bhopal’s Karond Mandi, former chief minister Digvijaya Singh of the Congress party joined the protest, and requested farmer leaders to invite politicians from both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party to fight against the central government’s three farm bills.The response in Rajasthan was mixed, with farmer organisations taking out rallies in every district, but roads were blocked only in eastern and northern parts of the state. Convener of the All India Kissan Sabha, Sanjay Madhav, said more such protests will take place in the coming days.In the eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, the strike call evoked a tepid response, with political parties such as Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Bihar blocking traffic at some locations in the morning. RJD lawmakers and workers burnt tyres to disrupt traffic and forced closure of shops at several locations.In Jharkhand, the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and Congress held symbolic protests, with shops closed in smaller towns having influence of Left labour unions, officials said. There was no impact of the strike in the northeastern states, officials said.Among the southern states, the strike had some impact in Kerala, where the ruling Left and the opposition Congress supported the bandh. In Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, farmer bodies held symbolic protests in the state capitals, Bengaluru and Chennai, and in some district headquarters.Bengaluru Police arrested some farmers from Maurya Circle in the city to prevent them from protesting, said Kurubur Shanthakumar, a farmer leader from Karnataka.Devendra Sharma, an expert on farm issues, said the government should listen to the farmers as they know what is best for them. “Across the world, there are examples where farmers have lost income in the long run due to the introduction of the corporate sector. Countries have come up with provisions to protect farm produce prices,” he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-trains-halted-highways-blocked-as-farmers-strike-impacts-states-101632767809485.html
28-09-2021||India||Kerala HC declines to stay single bench order on early second jab||A division bench of the Kerala high court on Monday declined to stay an order by a single judge bench of the court directing the Union government to the allow the administration of the second dose of Covishield vaccine after a four-week gap to people who wanted it.Declining an interim stay, bench of chief justice S Manikumar and justice Shaji P Chaly posted the plea for further hearing on Thursday.The Centre moved the court questioning the order, on September 6, saying it was not in tune with the vaccine policy of the government. The counsel for the government, assistant solicitor general P Vijayakumar, contended that the verdict will affect the ongoing vaccination drive and create more confusion.Last month, justice PB Suresh Kumar ordered the Union government to allow the second dose of vaccine after a gap of four weeks for those who wanted to take it early, and directed it to make necessary changes in the CoWin portal to facilitate this. The verdict came on a petition filed by the Kitex Group, a Kochi-based apparel making unit, last month questioning 84-day gap between two doses of vaccine.The gap between two doses of Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, was increased from 4-6 weeks in January to 12-16 weeks in May. While the government cited scientific evidence for this, it was widely believed that the gap was also increased to account for a shortage of vaccines. The gap between two doses of the other vaccine widely administered in India, Covaxin, has stayed constant at 4-6 weeks.People who need the vaccine to travel for higher studies, however, are allowed to take the jab after four weeks on furnishing visa documents.The single Judge on September 3 had said that if the central and state governments can permit persons travelling abroad to choose between early and better protection from Covid-19, there is no reason why the same privilege cannot be extended to those here who want early protection in connection with their employment or education.On this, the Centre, in its appeal, has said it had offered relaxations in favour of certain persons who were a separate class by themselves and for valid reasons and Kitex cannot claim parity with them.However, in its September 6 order, the high court asked the Union government to allow the administration of the second dose of the Covishield vaccine after a gap of four weeks for those wishing to take the jab early, and willing to pay for it. It also asked the Union government to make necessary changes on the CoWin portal.On Monday, P Vijayakumarsaid any changes in the vaccine policy can be carried out on necessary approvals by a scientific or medical team, and needs clinical trials, and will delay the entire process.But experts have disputed this. Last week, NK Arora, the head of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) said having a different dosing regime for different people is not possible. He also said that scientifically, evidence supports a longe gap.“Scientifically we are very firm on our decision at the moment. But of course, it is a dynamic situation, and if in future there is data to support benefits of reducing the gap, then our experts will look at it. The decision will be driven purely by science,” he told HT on Wednesday.Earlier, on August 27,the Union government opposed the plea saying that 84-day gap between two doses of vaccine was related to efficacy and it was nothing to do with the shortage of doses. It also cited the study of the national expert group on vaccination administration for Covid-19 -- which said what -- to support its point.Kitex, in its plea, contended that it had vaccinated around 5,000 of its workforce with the first dose but unable to administer the second dose due to the prevailing restrictions. It sought judicial intervention to speed up the process in view of high cases in the state and cited recent relaxations allowed by the state and central governments for students, and others.Earlier on September 6, the company counsel had said that if the shorter period was not allowed the vaccines it had bought would get wasted.In United Kingdom, the gap between two doses of Astra Zeneca (called Covisheild in India) is 12 weeks. Recommended gap for two doses of Pfizer in United states is 21 days. “Gap is good as it gives extended immunity and many studies have proven it. I feel at least six-week gap is necessary for efficacy,” said public health expert Dr Padmanabha Shenoy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-declines-to-stay-single-bench-order-on-early-second-jab-101632767403916.html

28-09-2021||India||Accept Google’s all requests regarding confidentiality, CCI tells Delhi HC||New Delhi: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Monday informed the Delhi high court that it has no objection in accepting all requests by Google regarding confidentiality in the interests of expediting proceedings related to an investigation into the technology company’s agreements with smartphone makers for its Android OS.Justice Rekha Palli was informed by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) N Venkatraman that even though CCI stands by the legality of its September 8 order in which it rejected Google’s appeal to reconsider the confidentiality issue, it is accepting the company’s request to fast track the ongoing investigation. The court was hearing a plea by Google against the leak of sensitive information such as revenue figures, payments made to partners, key agreements with partner OEMs, market shares, etc. to the press in an ongoing investigation by the Competition Commission of India (CCI).Google last week moved the high court seeking an ex-parte injunction directing CCI to ensure that there is no further publication of any part of the Director General’s Report available with the media outlets after several reported parts of the report.The plea sought that CCI write to all media outlets that claim to have a copy of the DG Report or have reported on it requesting them to return all copies and materials in relation to the case or to confirm to CCI that they have destroyed all copies.Additionally, it also sought that the order of September 8, passed by CCI rejecting Google’s appeal against the Director General’s order to reconsider the confidentiality issues, be set aside.On Monday, the ASG maintained his earlier stand that CCI did not leak any information to the media and submitted that the assumption of leak was wrong. He said that an enquiry into the same has been ordered.“CCI was willing to maintain confidentiality..,” the ASG said and wished Google on its 23rd birthday.“It is Google’s 23rd birthday today. We greet them through their counsel and wish them all the best.”Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, for Google, said that in view of the submissions by CCI, its grievances stood satisfied.Taking note of the submissions, Justice Palli disposed of the pleaThe court, however, said that in case Google has any further grievance that the information is being leaked it will be open to take legal recourse.“This court has not expressed any opinion on the claims made by the petitioner (Google) that it is respondent 1 (CCI) which is responsible for the said leaks,” the judge said.Google has said that the “unlawful disclosure” of the Director General’s Report and CCI’s failure to preserve confidentiality “severely affects their right to conduct business, damages its reputation, is prejudicial and renders its rights of defense and due process redundant in proceedings before the CCI and the DG”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accept-google-s-all-requests-regarding-confidentiality-cci-tells-delhi-high-court-101632766729608.html
28-09-2021||India||In Kerala, Muslim woman performs last rites at crematorium||At the break of dawn, 29-year-old Subeena Rahman, a Muslim woman, is busy cremating a body in Kerala’s Thrissur district.While there are no relatives around because the middle-aged man died of Covid-19, Rahman, clad in protective gear, lights a lamp and performs basic rituals she learned from Hindu friends in order to give the departed a decent final journey.Rahman has been working as a cremator for the past three years in a Hindu cremation ground at Irinjalakuda in Thrissur. Initially, there were loud protests from her community as well as from Hindus, but all came around after noticing her commitment towards her work.According to the Hindu tradition in many parts of the country, women usually don’t accompany the deceased to cremation grounds. An undergraduate (she is yet to complete her B Com), Rahman was initially recruited as a clerk at SNBS Samajam crematorium. Later she took up all jobs like her two assistants.Now, the three employees share their work and each body fetches them ₹500 in fees, which they divide among themselves. Earlier, three to five bodies were cremated every day at the gas-based crematorium, but the number has increased to 10 to 12 due to Covid-19.“After every cremation, I pray no more bodies, but I need money also. It is a big conflict between my need and emotions. A number of times I cried in my PPE (personal protective equipment) kits. But as an employee, we are not supposed to show our emotions in public,” Rahman said.She candidly admitted her work was not part of women’s lib or breaking of another glass ceiling. She said she knocked at many doors as the situation in her home deteriorated, and when the offer came to be a crematorium clerk, she grabbed the opportunity.“Initially, some of them took a dig calling me a tandoor maker. When they criticise, I do ask them to give me a proper job. But they have no answer to offer. I have to keep my hearth burning,” she said, adding her husband KV Rahman fully supports her. They have an eight-year-old son.“I know this is a job any woman would hate to take up, but situation at home was really compelling,” she said, recalling how her husband was without work for many months after the outbreak of Covid-19. Her father, who worked as a woodcutter, is bedridden after a near-fatal fall. Her mother is also down with lifestyle ailments. The family’s economic condition broke down after her sister was married off, Rahman said.“We are staying on rent. I have to meet my son’s school fees also. Thanks to this job we manage it somehow,” she said, while acknowledging that people who looked down upon her have started recognising her work. “It is a profession for me. If people feel it’s a taboo, let them. I am least bothered,” she said.SNBS Samajam president MK Viswambharan recalled how initially he was reluctant to hire a woman for cremation work. “When she came to us three years ago, we initially discouraged her, saying a woman that too from a different community will pose problems. But she was persistent and told us she viewed it as a vocation. A hardworking woman, she is fully committed to her job and we never had any problems with her,” said Viswambharan.SNBS Samajam is a social organisation working for the uplift of Ezhavas, the largest Hindu community in Kerala, comprising roughly 23% of the state’s population. Viswambharan said besides Hindus, members of the Christian community also use the SNBS crematorium.Rahman recalled an unusual experience when a cremation was booked for 2.30 pm, but the body did not arrive until 3 pm. When she enquired, she was told “the old man was yet to die.”She said it takes at least two hours to get the ashes after cremation, and on some days, she has to work for almost 14 hours.Talking about her job, she said cremating young accident victims (mainly two-wheeler drivers) and children really moves her, but she has least regard for those who die by suicide.Rahman wants to become a police officer and has started preparing to complete her graduation. Despite her long duty hours and domestic chores, she keeps abreast of the world around her. She won ₹1.50 lakh in a TV reality show (Flowers Channel) on Sunday. “I dream of a world where there is no hate or mad race. All religions exhort us to love each other,” she said.“Subeena is very particular about the customs of different communities. When my mother died of Covid-19 last year, she arranged a priest in a PPE kit to do her last rites. She is a symbol of brotherhood,” said PK Dayanandan, a schoolteacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kerala-muslim-woman-performs-last-rites-at-crematorium-101632766429728.html
28-09-2021||India||ED questions Rajasthan CM AShok Gehlot’s elder brother in PMLA case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday questioned Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s elder brother Agrasain Gehlot in connection with a money laundering probe against him and others linked to the alleged illegal export of fertilisers meant for Indian farmers, people familiar with the development said.Gehlot appeared at the agency’s headquarters in Delhi along with his lawyer around 11.30 am, following which his statement was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The agency had raided his office premises in July last year, around the time a political slugfest was going on in the ruling Congress in the state between his chief minister brother and then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot.The Rajasthan high court last week asked Agrasain Gehlot to cooperate with the probe, while ordering the central anti-money laundering agency not to take any coercive action against him, people cited above said on condition of anonymity.ED’s money laundering probe is based on an investigation by the customs department and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in 2009 in the export of muriate of potash (MOP) worth ₹57 lakh in 12 consignments the same year. MOP is a restricted commodity for export under India’s foreign trade policy.The customs department’s investigation report, reviewed by HT, states that Agrasain Gehlot’s company – M/s Anupam Krishi – allegedly played a key role in the irregularities. It is suspected that the MOP was exported to companies in Malaysia and Singapore.The customs probe report states that Agrasain Gehlot “knowingly opted to become a part of the syndicate in the entire chain of conspiracy by facilitating the said consortium (of private companies) by supplying subsidized MOP, which was meant for sale to farmers only and forged documents for which he admittedly gained certain amount as his commission”.(Comments to be updated after examination gets over)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-questions-rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-s-elder-brother-in-pmla-case-101632766368296.html
28-09-2021||India||‘Goa unit cruel parody of Congress’: Ex-CM Luizinho Faleiro quits, may join TMC||Former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro on Monday resigned as member of Goa legislative assembly and from the primary membership of the Congress, alleging that the party had become a “cruel parody of what the Congress stands for”.Speculations are rife that Faleiro, who was recently made the Goa Congress’s campaign committee chief for the state polls next year, is likely to join the Trinamool Congress soon. He is also expected to travel to Kolkata on Tuesday.In his resignation letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, the Congress leader claimed that the Goa unit of the party is led by a “coterie” of leaders whose priority is personal gains. “Madam, the Congress in Goa is not the same party for which we had sacrificed and fought. It is functioning contrary to every ideal and principle of its founding fathers upheld by Smt Indiraji, Shri Raviji and you,” he wrote. “Shri Rahul Gandhi too has been uncompromising in his fight against the forces that seek to destroy the fabric of our nation. However, the Goa unit of the party has become a cruel parody of what the Congress stands for. Led by a coterie of leaders who prioritize personal gains over the responsibility we owe to our people. We have utterly failed to be an effective opposition... I see absolutely no hope or even the will to prevent the collapse of the party and the change for the better,” he added. Faleiro was a member of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) and was known to be close to Sonia. The MLA from Navelim assembly seat handed over a terse resignation letter to Speaker Rajesh Patnekar shortly after noon. “I, Luizinho Faleiro, hereby tender my resignation of my seat in the house w.e.f. 27th Sep 2021. I thank the people of #Navelim for placing their trust in me & look forward to their continued support in all future endeavors. #Goa #newbeginnings,” he tweeted. Minutes before resigning, Faleiro heaped praises on West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, saying the country needs a leader like her to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“I have been a Congressman for 40 years and I will continue to be a Congressman of the Congress family. This family has to come together if we have to fight Modi. Among all the four Congresses, it is Mamata Banerjee who has given a tough fight to Modi and their juggernaut… the Mamata formula has won. She has been able to stand. We in Goa are also going through difficult times. We need such fighters. I would like all the larger parties to come together and fight the next Parliament elections,” he told reporters. “I interacted with my constituents from Navelim, they are my family, and it was important to me to seek their blessings for a #NewBeginning. I might be old, but my blood is young. I am determined to change things. Let’s end this suffering of #Goans and bring a new dawn in #Goa,” he added. Following a bitterly-fought and intense battle with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Banerjee and her party swept the West Bengal assembly elections in May this year and returned to power.Faleiro had earlier remained tight-lipped on his political plans only revealing that he had met members of the Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC) led by political strategist Prashant Kishor as part of their regular surveys in Goa. While on Monday, he did not declare that he was joining the TMC, he hinted at a possible announcement. Faleiro dismissed reports that he was peeved at the party high command’s decision to stick with incumbent state Congress chief Girish Chodankar, who succeeded him back in 2017. “The leadership role they would have given me anytime. My Goa is suffering, my Goa is bleeding and I will fight for Goa. I am a Congressman. I believe in the Congress ideology, philosophy and programmes. I will never join any other party other than Congress,” he said. He said his resignation was to start a ‘movement’ to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “Today my Goa is suffering from maladministration, bleeding because of wrong policies, programmes and I cannot allow Goa to bleed. My resignation is a call for a unification. The Congress of Jawarharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabbhai Patel was not a party but a movement. I belong to the Congress family, ideology and for what Congress has stood for. The Congress is a divided Congress, there is a need for a unified Congress and those leaders who have shown the way to fight BJP,” he said. ‘It is my dream that in this assembly election we start but in Parliamentary elections ,we should all come together and ensure a movement. Goa needs a credible alternative. My resignation is a call for unification,” he added. With his resignation, the Congress’s strength in the 40-member Goa assembly has been reduced to four. The Congress had won 17 seats in the 2017 state assembly elections, but later a number of MLAs resigned from the party. In July 2019, 10 MLAs quit the party and joined the ruling BJP. Besides Faleiro, several of his loyalists also quit the party earlier in the day. Faleiro was elected to the Goa Legislative Assembly in 1979 and has represented the Navelim constituency since then, except between 2007 and 2017, when he lost the seat to rival Churchill Alemão of the Save Goa Front. Alemão is presently a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator. Faleiro has had short stints as chief minister during Goa’s turbulent political years when the state saw 13 chief ministers in 12 years between 1990 and 2002. In 1999, when he served as chief minister, he travelled on a junket to Australia only to return to find his place taken by Francisco Sardinha, the present Congress South Goa MP. As general secretary of AICC from 2013 till 2017, he was in-charge of the seven north eastern states of Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Tripura. The TMC’s entry into Goa’s political space is likely to further splinter an already crowded political space in the state. Besides the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress, the Goa Forward Party with three MLAs, the NCP and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) with one MLA each also are vying for a slice of power. Trinamool MLA Derek O’Brien was in Goa over the weekend and announced that the party was “very serious” about contesting the upcoming polls in Goa but didn’t divulge any detailed plans.Reacting to the developments, Congress Goa incharge Dinesh Gundu Rao said that Faleiro had opted for a ‘voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) package’. “Sometimes when you are retiring, you take a VRS. This could be a VRS. When you feel that now there is nothing for me here, just take something and go. I was not convinced by anything he was saying. It was only very pure I would say, self motivation was there. It is sad that people at the fag end of their careers take these kind of decision... I wish him luck,” Rao said. “For the moment, it is a psychological disadvantage for the Congress because it gives the impression that it is a sinking ship. Faleiro himself is in the twilight of his political career and was unlikely to be re-elected. Beyond that, however, the damage the TMC can potentially cause will be determined by how many people they can bring into the fold and their capacity to split the anti-BJP vote,” political analyst Cleofato Almeida Coutinho said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-unit-cruel-parody-of-congress-ex-cm-luizinho-faleiro-quits-party-may-join-tmc-101632766008378.html
28-09-2021||India||Tired of asking for special status for state, dropping demand: Bihar minister||Bihar’s planning minister Bijendra Yadav on Monday objected to the Niti Aayog’s way of ranking states based on the index of sustainable development goals (SDGs), and said the eastern state needed special assistance from the Centre for faster development.“We have dropped the demand for the status of a special state, as we are now tired of asking for it from the Centre. But now we are seeking special packages for all sectors,” Yadav, an influential member of chief minister Nitish Kumar’s cabinet, said in his remarks on the government think tank’s 2020-21 report that ranked Bihar at the bottom of the table.The state government had sent a memorandum to the Niti Aayog, asking for change in the way to evaluate progress, Yadav said. “The state registered remarkable growth in 10 out of 15 SDG index as compared to last year. But there are some areas, which the state can’t compete with other states owing to its natural limitations, for which the state requires a special package,” the minister said.Buttressing his claim, Yadav said Bihar stands at the front on progress in health care. “Bihar ranked the 5th in case of potable water and sanitation sector. In per capital development expenditure index, the state grew by 17.9% over the last year as compared to the national average of 11.6%. Total fertility rate has come down to 3 (2019-20) vis-à-vis 3.8 in 2011. Still, the state’s progress was adjudged to the bottom,” said Yadav, adding that life expectancy has also improved considerably in the province.The Niti Aayog chose unrealistic data to assess Bihar on the index based on percentage of population below the poverty line, Yadav alleged. “The state can’t help improve on the index for quality employment and economic development based on the number of automated teller machines (ATMs), as it depended on the discretion of banks. Moreover, the index that assess the state based on the percentage of the forest cover to development was not justifiable. The state did well when assessed on the index of change in forest cover, which was done away with in the latest assessment,” the minister pointed out.Through the memorandum, the minister demanded that the index and objectives of development to assess the status of states by Niti Aayog should be finalised in consultation with the states. “Special assistance shall be doled out to those states, which are backwards but striving to grow faster. The Niti Aayog shall frame short, medium and long-term strategies for different states depending on their limitations to achieve the SDGs for progress,” the memorandum said.This is the second time in the recent past when the state government has sounded a dissenting note with the central government. Taking exception to the Centre’s refusal to a caste-based census, the demand for which an all-party delegation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi made on August 23, chief minister Nitish Kumar urged the central government to rethink its decision.The ruling Janata Dal (United) has been demanding the status of a special state for Bihar since 2012. It was a main political agenda of the party during the state’s assembly polls last year. The state legislature had in the past passed unanimous resolutions, asking for the special status to Bihar.However, it was not considered by the Centre. “Even the special package promised by Prime Minister Modi during 2019 election rallies were not considered,” said Prem Chandra Mishra, a leader of the opposition Congress party. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tired-of-asking-for-special-status-for-state-dropping-demand-bihar-minister-bijendra-yadav-101632765948467.html
28-09-2021||India||Indian scientists working on 1st ever dengue DNA vaccine||The world’s first DNA vaccine was approved for use in India recently. Developed by the Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, ZyCoV-D is, as the name indicates, is a vaccine against Covid-19. Now, some researchers believe the technology -- considered superior because DNA vaccines are easier to make and store, and, most importantly store an enormous amount of information -- can be used to develop a vaccine for another tropical disease, dengue, a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes.“We know that there are four serotypes of the virus, but what we found was that there were genetic variations within the serotypes -- any sequence with over 6% difference is considered to be a different genotype. So, the team created a consensus sequence that is the same across the genotypes as well,” said Dr Easwaran Sreekumar, senior scientist at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology-Thiruvananthapuram and one of the corresponding authors of the yet-to-be peer-reviewed paper uploaded on MedRxiv. With the DNA vaccine platform allowing them to pick pieces of genetic material that can be used in the vaccine, the researchers resorted to sequencing the virus from four regions in the country that report dengue cases and selecting the common parts.The virus that causes dengue has four types with four different viral antigens – essentially proteins that cause the infection and against which antibodies are created. The researchers selected a part called EDIII (short for envelope protein domain III) from all the four serotypes of the virus, which is widely considered the most important viral protein. In addition, the researchers also selected the NS1 protein from the DENV2 serotype, which is known to cause severe dengue with internal bleeding and drop in blood pressure. “In the traditional vaccines, the whole envelope protein is used that can lead to Antibody Dependant Enhancement (a phenomenon where the viral antigen is bound to less effective antibodies, something that actually makes the virus more effective) . We have used only the domain III of the envelope protein from all four serotypes to avoid ADE. And, we have added the NS1 protein from DENV2 that is known to generate both T cell and B cell response,” said Dr Arun Sankaradoss, project lead and scientist at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research-Bangalore. T and B cells are lymphocyte or white blood cells that are part of the immune system. This, they say, is likely to provide effective immune response against all four serotypes of the virus, without causing ADE or antibody-dependent enhancement where antibodies generated against some of the serotypes by the vaccine can lead to a severe disease by the other serotypes. This is what is believed to have happened with the only approved vaccine against dengue, where the vaccinated individuals developed more severe disease in the Phillipines. The vaccine uses live weakened virus to elicit immune response. The DNA technology based vaccine candidate was tested on a mice model for DENV2 dengue and a good response was seen. “We still do not have mice models for the other three serotypes; we are trying to create it. The vaccine candidate was found to be protective in the mice model and also neutralised the other three serotypes of the virus effectively in lab experiments. It is usually the DENV2 against which the immune response is the least and we have tested that,” said Sreekumar. This is the second dengue vaccine candidate from India, with the other one being developed by researchers from International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB). The ICGEB vaccine uses a virus-like particle using the same EDIII portion of the dengue virus. “So far, DNA vaccines hadn’t been successful in producing good immune response; but with ZyCoV-D we now have a safe and effective DNA vaccine. It is a very versatile platform. It brings down the manufacturing cost. It is stable at room temperature for a year, and at 4 degrees forever. This means it will be a very good candidate for resource constrained settings. That is the reason we have also used sequences from Eastern Africa for the vaccine,” said Sankaradoss. Globally, there are at least five vaccines under development against dengue. Traditionally, the four serotypes have posed a challenge for dengue vaccine. Once developed, the vaccines cannot only help India but the neighbouring countries. Asia contributes nearly 70% of the total dengue burden in the world. The World Health Organisation estimates that there are 390 million dengue virus infections every year, of which 96 million become symptomatic. One hundred twenty-six countries or territories saw dengue infections according to Global Burden Disease (GBD) 2019. The global number of dengue episodes increased 85.47% from 30.67 million in 1990 to 56.88 million in 2019, highlighting the importance of developing an effective vaccine against the viral disease that is a major public health concern globally. “The dengue vaccine is very important as there are pockets across the country that report a flare up in cases every few years, and lead to deaths especially in children like we saw in Firozabad. A vaccine can prevent these deaths. Dengue cases are going up not just in urban centres but also across the rural parts of the country wherever construction activities such as for the roads are being undertaken,” said Dr PL Joshi, former head of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-scientists-working-on-1st-ever-dengue-dnavaccine-101632765827609.html

28-09-2021||India||Bandh in Bharat brings chaos to Capital’s doors||Several of the Capital’s borders were choked on Monday morning as the police set up barricades in response to the nationwide shutdown called by farmer groups opposing three laws passed exactly a year ago, stranding thousands of rush hour commuters in hours-long jams.Transport and businesses within Delhi were unaffected, but interstate and intercity connections were hit, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, where people sat in protests at national highways and railway lines. In all, the Indian railways said roughly 50 trains were affected until the protesters vacated the tracks.The Bharat Bandh was in force from 6am to 4pm, and marked the anniversary of the Union government passing three farm laws that farmer groups oppose. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said the response was “good” from across the country, and contended it proved that the issue resonated across the country. “Some people had described the protest as an issue of farmers only in three states (Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh). But the response and support to today’s bandh across the country has proved that it is a pan-India protest,” said the national spokesperson of the BKU, which is part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha – a collective of roughly 40 farmer groups. “Some people may have faced inconvenience due to the Bharat Bandh today, which is natural, but they should forget it for just one day in the name of farmers,” Tikait said in a statement.Among the worst hit was the Delhi-Gurugram border, where traffic moved slowly for the first half of the day. Other stretches that were badly hit were around Ghazipur and Noida. In most of these places, Delhi Police put up security barricades, often randomly checking cars. “To keep a check on law and order due to the Bharat Bandh, we barricaded a section of Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway at the Sirhaul toll plaza. There was no fixed time for setting up the barricades as such and we could have continued with it for the rest of the day had there not been heavy traffic congestion arising on the national highway from it. We opened more lanes for traffic movement around 10.30am and reduced the barricades,” said Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police (south-west), Delhi Police.Gurugram police officials said there was no gathering of protesters or any disruption on the national highway on Monday. The traffic backlog due to the security checkposts stretched to about 2km into Gurugram. But farmers gathered at one of the other Delhi borders. “Our protesters also staged sit-ins on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME), besides the Delhi-Meerut Road. Our call was largely successful. We, however, did not stop any emergency services. We regret the inconvenience to commuters but would like to say that our agitation -- which has been going on for the past 10 months -- is for them,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader and UP-Gate site spokesperson from Samyukta Kisan Morcha.As protesters closed down DME at UP Gate, commuters were forced to use other border roads near EDM Mall, Anand Vihar, Surya Nagar, and Seemapuri, leading to heavy traffic on these narrower stretches. “Farmers staged sit-ins at many spots of the DME. Vehicular movement was also affected on Eastern Peripheral Expressway and the Dasna to Hapur section of the DME,” said Mudit Garg, project director, National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).The Ghaziabad traffic police said that the sit-in by protesting farmers ended around 4:15pm.Traders in major markets of Ghaziabad said that they did not down their shutters or support the Bharat Bandh, because they had already suffered financial losses when they had to shut down operations due to pandemic-related restrictions last year.“Our traders have already been facing losses since last year due to the pandemic. So we kept our shops open and did not support the Bharat Bandh call. There were traffic disruptions, which delayed the arrival of our employees at shops, but shops were not closed,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti, a traders’ union in Indirapuram, Ghaziabad.At the city’s biggest market in Turab Nagar, shops were open as usual, but traders’ association members said that footfall was low.As hundreds of protesters gathered at the several highways and railway tracks, crowds at the three Delhi borders – Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri – that have become home to a constant sit-in for the last 10 months remained thin.Protesters across the three agitation spots said that several among them had camped at the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) expressway while many others had returned to their villages to work on the fields. Tikait added that the agitation will go on. “If need be, we will continue our protest for the next 10 years. People will say that the Bharat Bandh was a flop, but it is not the case. It has been successful. As part of the protest, we only held up roads and it was not like sealing the roads. If the union agriculture minister calls us for talks, we will go,” he said. Farmer union leaders and the central government have held 11 rounds of talks, but each time the talks have ended in a stalemate. The last time the two parties held talks was on January 22.The government has defended the laws as opening the path to long due reforms, but farmer groups have argued that it will erode their earnings and expose them to coercive trade by big businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bandh-in-bharat-brings-chaos-to-capital-s-doors-101632765652901.html
28-09-2021||India||SC pulls up govt over changes in NEET-SS entrance pattern||The Supreme Court on Monday told the Union government not to “treat doctors like footballs”, and gave it a week to reconsider its decision on last-minute changes in the entrance examination pattern for super speciality medical courses.The National Eligibility Entrance Test for super specialty courses (NEET-SS) is to be held on November 13 and 14. The examination was notified on July 23, but on August 31, the National Board of Examinations (NBE) came out with an information booklet announcing a change in the examination pattern starting this year.This led to complaints from doctors sitting for the exam since they had prepared based on the pattern used since 2018. NBE’s decision was challenged in the apex court by 41 doctors led by Prateek Rastogi, and notices was issued last week seeking a response from the Centre.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna on Monday pulled up the government for its late decision. “You can’t play with the lives of these young doctors in this manner. What was the urgency for you to change the examination pattern after the notification for the examination is issued? Just because somebody has power, you think you can wield it in any manner. Don’t treat these doctors as footballs in this game of power,” the bench said.The Union ministry of health & family welfare was represented by additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, NBE by senior advocate Maninder Singh, and the National Medical Commission (NMC) by advocate Gaurav Sharma.The bench asked the three lawyers to get their clients to consider deferring the decision for this year since the doctors have put in years of preparation, and are to appear for the examination in just two months. “We are dissatisfied with the way the authorities have acted. Be prepared for strictures to be passed on next date if you cannot set your own house in order. We cannot allow these young doctors to be placed at the mercy of these insensitive bureaucrats,” the bench said.In all, roughly 16,000-17,000 post graduate doctors appear for NEET-SS for admission to DM, M.Ch (Master of Surgery) and DrNB (Doctorate of National Board) for getting admission to over 4700 seats.The information booklet for NEET-SS released on August 31 said that all the questions would be from general medicine, which is a feeder course. Since 2018, 60% of the questions for the exam have been from the super specialty course opted for by the candidate, and 40% of the questions from the feeder category, which also included general medicine.The petition by the doctors, filed through advocate Javedur Rehman ,said: “The petitioner aspirants who have had the most challenging experiences of their professional lives in this time, being at the forefront of the battle against Covid-19, have all through this period prepared for the NEET-SS 2021 exam legitimately expecting that the pattern is unchanged, just like it was in the previous three years.”Finding fault with the proposed new pattern, the petition argued that if all questions are from general medicine, it will put students from four of five broad postgraduate specialities at a serious disadvantage. Postgraduates from general medicine, anaesthesiology, emergency medicine, paediatrics, and respiratory medicine are all eligible for Doctorate of Medicine (DM) course.Singh, who represented NBE, told the court that changing the examination pattern was not a last-minute decision. “The authorities are mindful of the situation. The exercise for change of examination was going on for a while. The final notification got delayed as NBE was under an impression that approval of ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) and NMC is pending. When they realised these were already in place, they issued the August 31 notification,” he said.To this, the bench replied: “The pattern of study will depend on the pattern of exams to be given. Students begin preparations at least two years in advance. They will be unnecessarily ruffled. Why rock the boat after the notification has been issued? At least allow this batch to go through.”It told ASG Bhati to convene a meeting of MoHFW with authorities from NBE and NMC and take a call before next Monday, when the matter will be heard.“If you are right, we will dismiss these petitions. But be open to strictures from the court on the manner your officers have gone about this decision,” the bench said.Referring to how the authorities at NBE or NMC could also be doctors who passed through the same grind, the bench added: “These doctors who have come on the panel of NBE cannot play with the lives of these young doctors having come from the same system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-pulls-up-centre-over-changes-in-entrance-examination-pattern-for-super-specialty-medical-courses-101632765588146.html
28-09-2021||India||Varun Gandhi writes another letter to Yogi on sugarcane prices||In a fresh letter to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Varun Gandhi on Monday raised the demand for re-visiting prices of sugarcane crop, saying farmers are in “misery” and have been hoping for a higher increase. On Sunday, Adityanath had announced a ₹25 per quintal hike in the purchase prices of sugarcane in the state, taking it to ₹350 per quintal.While Gandhi thanked the chief minister for increasing the cane rates, he claimed the hike was insufficient amid “rising cost and inflation”.Sharing a copy of the letter on Twitter, the BJP leader said: “Sugarcane rate in the upcoming crushing season in Uttar Pradesh ₹350. Thanks to Yogi ji for declaring ₹350/quintal. I request that please reconsider this according to the rising cost and inflation and declare the rate of ₹400 or please give a bonus of 50/quintal, from the government, above the declared rate separately.” In the letter, the BJP MP from Pilibhit pointed out that the cost of sugarcane had increased significantly in the last four years, but in the last four seasons, it had risen by only ₹10 per quintal. “In the last four years the input cost for farmers such as prices of seeds, fertiliser and power have substantially increased....Farmers are in misery due to economic distress and have been hoping for a higher increase in cane prices,” he wrote. “Expenditure is increasing but prices are not. Sugarcane is a major crop in Uttar Pradesh… 50 lakh farmer families are engaged in (its) cultivation. Lakhs of labourers also get employment from this… With continuous rise in input cost for farmers, cane prices should be fixed at a minimum price of ₹400 per quintal,” he added. Cane is mainly grown in western Uttar Pradesh, which is the epicentre of the farmers’ protest in the state against the Centre’s contentious agricultural laws.This is the second time Gandhi has written to the chief minister on the matter. On September 12, besides seeking more remuneration for sugarcane crop, the BJP leader had sought subsidy in diesel and electricity prices, and doubling of money provided to farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme.Prior to that, he had advocated for re-engaging with the protesting farmers and insisted that their hardships be taken into consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varun-gandhi-writes-another-letter-to-yogi-on-sugarcane-prices-101632765529684.html
28-09-2021||India||‘India will continue to work in framework’: Shringla at UNSC meet on nuclear non-proliferation||India will work within the framework of the UN’s “disarmament triad” to strengthen nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation architecture, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Monday.The country is also ready to support the beginning of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) at the Conference on Disarmament without prejudice to the priority it attached to nuclear disarmament, Shringla said.He made the remarks while addressing a UN Security Council meeting on the theme “Non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction: Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty” in New York. India is currently a non-permanent member of the Security Council.Recalling India’s credentials as a proponent of nuclear disarmament, Shringla said it was the first country to call for a ban on nuclear testing in 1954 and a non-discriminatory treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in 1965. India committed to the goal of a nuclear-weapons-free world and complete elimination of atomic weapons, he added.“India would continue to work in the framework of the Disarmament Triad consisting of the Conference on Disarmament, the UN Disarmament Commission and the First Committee of the UN General Assembly, to strengthen nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation architecture,” Shringla said. The Conference on Disarmament, as the world’s sole multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, is well placed to advance the global disarmament agenda and negotiate legally binding instruments on items in its core agenda.“Without prejudice to the priority we attach to nuclear disarmament, India has expressed its readiness to support the commencement of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) in the Conference on Disarmament on the basis of the mandate contained in CD/1299,” he added. In this context, India has participated in the work of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the High-level Preparatory Group (HLEPG) on FMCT. India has also contributed to the GGE on Nuclear Disarmament Verification through its membership of the earlier and the current group, which will meet in Geneva later this year. India has supported the strengthening of the global nuclear security architecture and participated in the Nuclear Security Summit process and international conferences on nuclear security organised by the IAEA. India is also a key partner in global non-proliferation efforts and has piloted an annual UN General Assembly resolution on “measures to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction” since 2002, which is adopted by consensus. Shringla said there is a need for the world community to pay closer attention to the illicit proliferation of networks of nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, components and relevant technologies.With the objective of strengthening the non-proliferation architecture, India has also joined export control regimes such as the Australia Group, Wassenaar Arrangement and Missile Technology Control Regime and harmonised its controls with the Nuclear Suppliers Group lists, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-would-continue-to-work-in-framework-shringla-at-unsc-meet-on-nuclear-nonproliferation-101632760549778.html
28-09-2021||India||Unease in CPI amid reports of Kanhaiya joining Congress||Communist Party of India (CPI) leader and former president of Jawaharlal Nehru University’s (JNU) students’ union, Kanhaiya Kumar kept his colleagues waiting last Tuesday at party headquarters in Delhi, where he was instructed to address a press conference to refute strong speculations of him joining the Congress, CPI leaders told HT.There is a growing uneasiness between Kumar and his party amid media reports of him joining the Congress with Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani on Tuesday, September 28. CPI leaders told HT that last Monday, party general secretary D Raja had asked him to address a press conference to “refute” the rumours. But on Tuesday, while his party colleagues waited patiently at Ajoy Bhavan, the CPI headquarters in Delhi, “Kumar’s phone and messages went unanswered”, said a senior leader on condition of anonymity. “So far, he has not publicly denied or reacted to the speculations about him,” noted another party leader. Last Saturday, Gujarat MLA and Dalit leader Mevani told a section of the media that he and Kumar will join the Congress on September 28. “On September 28, I will be joining the Indian National Congress along with Kanhaiya Kumar,” Mevani was quoted as saying. When contacted for a response, D Raja said, “Let us see.” Kumar is reported to be unhappy with his current party where he wanted to play a larger role. On Sunday, a group of CPI leaders in Bihar met Kumar at the party headquarters, ostensibly to persuade him to stay. “During the discussion, Kumar told them that he should be made the state party chief and the chairman of the party’s top election committee that decides candidates for elections,” said a second CPI leader, who didn’t wish to be named. “In any party, no one can make such a demand. It is the party that decides and gives responsibilities to its people. If he has any such ambition, (then) he should tell the top authorities,” said a second party leader. All eyes are now on the party’s national council meeting on October 2. In the meeting, Kanhaiya Kumar’s issues are likely to be discussed among other things.Kumar unsuccessfully contested the Begusarai Lok Sabha election as a CPI candidate and lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stalwart and Union minister Giriraj Singh in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanhaiya-kumar-keeps-cpi-guessing-over-reports-of-joining-congress-101632734805358.html

28-09-2021||Today's||India’s dilemma on cryptocurrencies||When it comes to cryptocurrencies, governments of the world have arrived at one of three conclusions. One, cryptocurrency is an inevitability. It cannot be banned or walled out through any meaningfully enforceable mechanism. Thus, regulation is required to offer investors a degree of protection, ensure compliance with norms, and provide clarity with regard to taxation. This seems to be the most common view, with countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and almost all countries in the European Union choosing to adopt some form of regulation. Two, it represents a means to bypass sanctions or traditional geopolitical structures. Countries subscribing to this view have adopted bitcoin as legal tender (such as Cuba and El Salvador). Iran too saw the potential of cryptocurrency in helping circumvent sanctions, and encouraged “mining”, provided the resulting tokens are sold to the central bank (though, due to excessive electricity consumption, a four-month moratorium was imposed on mining in May). Three, it is too volatile to be regulated effectively. Countries that subscribe to this view believe that private cryptocurrencies represent a threat to the integrity of the financial system, are too vulnerable to manipulation to be regulated as an asset and can enable illicit transactions in a myriad ways. Countries that ban the trading, holding, and mining of cryptocurrency include China, Bolivia, Nepal, North Macedonia, and Indonesia.So where does India fall on this spectrum? From a reading of the 2019 interministerial report, the view seems to be one of caution. This is consistent with preceding Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circulars and press releases discouraging cryptocurrency trade, and warning investors of associated risks. Last week, in an interview with this newspaper, finance minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated the need to be cautious when it came to cryptocurrency and to “think it through”. She cited protests on the streets of El Salvador, following the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender, in support of her point. So, it remains unclear which conclusion the government is likely to reach.An outright ban would be difficult to sustain unless it is accompanied by a coordinated global effort to wipe out cryptocurrencies. While the government has exclusive rights in the legislative domain, the same is subject to the limits of legality, necessity, and proportionality imposed by the Constitution. In March 2020, the Supreme Court, in Internet and Mobile Association of India v Reserve Bank of India struck down an RBI notification imposing a blanket ban on all regulated entities from dealing or facilitating services for virtual currencies. While striking down the notification, the court found it to be violative of the Constitution and against the doctrine of proportionality — there was no evidence of the adverse impact argued to support the drastic measures advocated by RBI. In August, the Madras High Court struck down legislation that introduced a blanket ban on online betting games. The court, in unambiguous terms, held that any legislation which introduces a wide-ranging ban can be struck down if it is found to be violating the least intrusive test or the doctrine of proportionality. Here it must be noted that the FM, in July, told Parliament that the government has not collected any data on, inter alia, narcotic drug trafficking and money laundering being committed through cryptocurrency exchanges. Thus, it would be difficult to advance the moral hazard argument in a vacuum. Alternatively, if the government wishes to regulate, then it must necessarily bring more transparency to the ongoing pre-legislative process. When the Lok Sabha bulletin for expected bills was published on January 29, 2021, it included the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021. The bill sought to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India” while making exceptions for the use of the underlying technology. Given that the bill wasn’t introduced, and the subsequent statements of the FM about the need to “think it through”, it can be inferred that the government is reviewing its position from that of a simple ban to something more nuanced. In this regard three suggestions are important. One, if the government wishes to protect existing legitimate investors (currently estimated at anywhere between 7-10 million Indians), then it must publish a draft bill by way of forward guidance, and invite comments under the Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy of 2014 (currently more honoured in the breach than in the observance). Two, the government must impose duties on cryptocurrency exchanges to educate investors, so they may be able to distinguish between genuine private cryptocurrencies from ersatz ones. Three, evolve an approach on crypto mining with states. Electricity falls under the Concurrent List and taxes on consumption and sale of electricity fall under the State List. Thus, no decision can be reached without proactive engagement with state governments.Currently, the trade of cryptocurrencies exists in a state of legal blankness. With any innovation, there is always a risk that it may bring unintended harm. Governments with vision seek to create a path that illuminates the best aspects of innovation while minimising its misuse. Governments that are protectionist seek to ban such innovations. But for either choice to be legitimate, it must be made in consultation with people and in the full light of day.Muhammad Ali Khan is the additional advocate general for Chhattisgarh in the Supreme Court.

28-09-2021||Today's||From Tibetan resistance to international tensions, China’s obstacles in TAR||The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has stepped up activities in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) to achieve President Xi Jinping’s directive of “one people, one culture, one language and one country”. Visits in July-August by Xi and Wang Yang, chairman of the Chinese People’s Consultative Conference, underscored this priority. However, the contours of major obstacles that loom ahead are already visible. A stream of senior CCP cadre visits has followed. Their visits add emphasis to the major projects approved by the 14th five-year plan and long-range objectives — 2030. The visits also indicate that the 20th Party Congress will endorse Xi for another term next year.Senior cadres visiting TAR include Chongqing Party secretary and politburo member Chen Min’er, politburo member and Guangdong Party secretary Li Xi, whose delegation included Guangdong governor Ma Xingrui, who is a CCP central committee (CC) member; Cai Qi, party secretary of Beijing; and Yu Wenxia, vice-minister of the CCP CC propaganda department.Most recently, Chen Wenqing, minister for national security, arrived in Lhasa with a high-level delegation and convened a meeting attended by TAR party secretary Wu Yingjie, commander of the Tibet military region lieutenant-general Wang Kai, and others. Among the topics discussed were maintaining unity, “diluting the influence of religion”, and eliminating the 14th Dalai Lama’s “negative influence” among the masses. A major focus of the CCP’s efforts to “blend” Han and Tibetan cultures, and dilute the religious beliefs of Tibetans, is selecting the 14th Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. China wants to avoid a situation where there are two Dalai Lamas, with the one recognised by Tibetans residing outside communist China. Gyaltsen Norbu, appointed by the Chinese as a Panchen Lama, is not accepted by the Tibetans even after 26 years.China’s efforts, however, are facing resistance. The adverse international environment provoked by Xi’s aggressive policies is fuelling opposition to China. The Dalai Lama’s message, thanking those who wished him on his 86th birthday on July 6, would have been a dampener for the communist regime. He stated that he will live till the age of 113. The message would have given hope to Tibetans everywhere. Chinese nervousness about the situation in Tibet has been especially noticeable during this period of enhanced military tension between India and China. Central and TAR propaganda, public security, and united front teams have been visiting border counties opposite Arunachal Pradesh. All stressed the need for loyalty to the party and strengthening border defence. Meanwhile, confrontation is growing between the United States (US) and China. The US navy has increased activities in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, as have British, French, and German warships. After Quad, India is conducting the Malabar exercises. Japan’s latest defence White Paper explicitly stated, “The stability of the situation around Taiwan is important... for the stability of the international community.” With its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the US will now focus its resources on dealing with China — its primary threat. Globally, the anti-China sentiment is high because of Covid-19. The US Congress passed the Tibet Policy Act, 2020, which specifically opposes any effort by Chinese authorities to identify, select, and install Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders, including any future Dalai Lama, in a manner inconsistent with the Tibetan Buddhist faith and community. India’s location is critical in the context of Tibet. Indian public opinion, traditionally partial to the Tibetan cause, is now negative on China due to China’s military build-up and intrusions in Ladakh since 2020. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday greetings to the Dalai Lama were publicised this year as were US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s meetings in Delhi with Ngodup Dongchung, head of the Dalai Lama’s bureau and Geshe Dorji Damdul, director of the Tibet House. Indian public opinion has also begun to question India’s recognition of Tibet as part of China.Jayadeva Ranade is former additional secretary, Cabinet secretariat, Government of India, and is president, Centre for China Analysis and StrategyThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/from-tibetan-resistance-to-international-tensions-china-s-obstacles-in-tar-101632837899125.html
28-09-2021||Editorials||The incoherence in the Congress||The Congress leadership — which in the current context primarily means the brother-sister duo of Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra — invested their political capital and authority in Punjab. They first decided that Captain Amarinder Singh would not be able to lead the party to victory in 2022 and appointed his arch-rival Navjot Singh Sidhu as party president. The leadership thought this would neutralise anti-incumbency, but all it did was deepen the factional divide. Then, within weeks, they decided that a dual power arrangement won’t work and orchestrated a situation which made Captain Singh’s continuation untenable. After a series of names did the rounds as replacements — Ambika Soni, Sunil Jakhar, and Sukhjinder Randhawa — the party appointed Charanjit Singh Channi, a Dalit leader, as the new chief minister (CM). It patted itself on the back for what it thought was a masterstroke in creating a Jat Sikh-Dalit Sikh alliance with Mr Sidhu as party chief and Mr Channi as CM, but as this newspaper pointed out last week, the party had possibly sown the seeds of a deeper divide. From two major factions, that of Captain Singh and Mr Sidhu, five factions emerged — that of Mr Sidhu, Mr Jakhar, Mr Randhawa and Mr Channi, besides that of the former CM.
28-09-2021||Editorials||Germany’s political churn is significant||In Germany, a closely contested election has seen the Social Democrats (SPD) pull marginally ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Both parties are in a race to form coalitions though, by most accounts, SPD’s Olaf Scholz is seen as having an edge through his efforts to forge an alliance with the Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). The race to choose Ms Merkel’s successor is happening at a time when, across Europe, states are looking to Germany and France to play a larger role in shaping the European Union (EU)’s response to a range of challenges, from the climate crisis to China’s growing assertiveness. Germany is also keen to see France patch up its differences with the United States (US) over AUKUS.
