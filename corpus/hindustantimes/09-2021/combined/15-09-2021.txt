He has nothing to do with illegal activities, let alone terrorism,” said Amir’s brother Abdullah here on Wednesday. He said Amir and the entire family were into the business of dates. He informed that he, Amir and their other brother Mohammed were rounded up by a team of UP ATS from their house for questioning on Tuesday and were later detained for a few hours at the ATS headquarters in Lucknow’s Sarojini Nagar. He said he and Mohammad were allowed to go after a few hours of questioning while Amir was arrested. According to family members, Amir graduated from Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulema or Nadwa College in Lucknow and started a fruit business. They said Amir got married in 2019 and had a six- month-old son. “My son remained busy with work to support his family. He cannot have any links with terrorist activities,” said Amir’s mother Humaiya Yasmin. Turning down the UP ATS claims of Amir’s visit to Pakistan, Amir’s father Aslam Javed said he worked in Saudi Arabia between 1994 and 2003 and thereafter returned to India along with his family. He said Amir was merely seven years of age then and since then, he had never gone outside the country. The family met representatives of Rehai Manch, an NGO fighting for atrocities against minorities, on Wednesday. Mohammed Shoaib, chairman of Rehai Manch, extended support to the family and questioned the working of UP ATS. He said that this was not the first time when the UP police had framed innocent Muslim youths in terror activities and sent them to jail. On Tuesday, the kin of Zeeshan Qamar, held from Prayagraj, also claimed he was innocent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amir-has-no-links-with-terror-activities-kin-of-lucknow-suspect-101631730480049.html

The government will bear 50 per cent of the total cost of the project, while the remaining 50 % will be contributed by the interested people. In return the project can be named after the relatives of the collaborators as per their wish,” said the CM. He made the announcement while inaugurating and laying the foundation stones of various roads under PM Gramin Sadak Yojana(PMGSY) and District Panchayats using hot mix and full depth reclamation (FDR) method. The CM also asked the departments of rural development and panchayati raj to submit an action plan for the formal launch of the new scheme. He said that continuous work was being done by the central and the state governments for the overall development of villages. “The Uttar Pradesh Matra Bhumi Yojana can prove to be a good attempt in the establishment of health centre, Anganwadi, library, stadium, gymnasiums, open gym, cattle breed improvement centre and fire service station, among others, in villages,” Yogi Adityanath said. He further said that whether for setting up CCTVs for smart villages, development of funeral sites or for installation of solar lights, there could be public participation in every work. “Through this new scheme, the person concerned will be able to take full credit for the project by bearing half of the total cost,” he pointed out. Interacting with the presidents and members of Gram Panchayat, Kshetra Panchayat and District Panchayat, the CM said that the panchayats needed to be self-reliant. Stressing on rural development, the CM further said that roads were not just a means of transport but also a powerful means of strengthening the rural economy. “Countries with developed infrastructure are also economically prosperous. In a state like Uttar Pradesh, about 80 percent of the population lives in rural background. To strengthen the rural economy, good roads and better connectivity are essential which is being done continuously through PMGSY”, he said. He pointed out that the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, which was started by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the year 2000, had become a medium for the progress of villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yogi-announces-launch-of-up-matra-bhumi-yojana-101631729640564.html

She could not see their faces as they were wearing helmets. The incident was recorded in a CCTV camera installed in the locality but as of now, there is no clue about the perpetrators.Neither the victim nor her family know the reason behind the crime that claimed vision of her right eye. “I want to know why they did this to me. But police have failed to do their job even after almost a year,” said the victim.She is mother of three boys, and her husband works at a factory. “I used to work at a factory at ₹5,000 per month but after the incident, I lost vision in one eye and cannot work. Also, I hesitate to go out,” she added.She had told the police the names of two suspects who used to harass her and one of them is her relative. She had filed a complaint against him about six years ago.Police officials associated with the investigation said there is no evidence to prove the involvement of suspects in the case. Police have closed the investigation after announcing a cash reward of ₹1 lakh for any information on the accused.“We had investigated the case but police could not identify the accused even as a cash reward was announced,” said Panipat DSP Satish Vats.On the victim raising suspicion against two people in the case, he said, “We did not have any evidence to prove her allegations and their involvement in the case.”Police had promptly registered an FIR against the unknown accused under Sections 326 A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Quila police station. But now, the victim has lost hope that the accused will ever be arrested or sent behind the bars.“Most acid attack victims in our country know the accused. But in my case, police could not trace them,” she said. The victim had sustained serious injuries in her right eye and burns on her face.Women protection officer-cum-child marriage prohibition officer Rajni Gupta said she is provided financial assistance by the women and child development department and the legal services authority.“Now, we are providing her free legal assistance so that she can get benefits of government schemes meant for acid attack victims,” she added.Panipat SP Shashank Kumar Sawan said, “The case is untraced and the accused are still unknown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/panipat-acid-attack-victim-awaits-justice-101631729461075.html
15-09-2021||Mumbai||Terror suspect was under watch, Maharashtra home minister denies intelligence failure||State home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Wednesday said the police have all the right to arrest people from other states if they have concrete information. He, however, added that Jaan Mohammad Shaikh alias Sameer Kalia, a terror suspect, was under police surveillance and denied the allegations of intelligence failure. He also refused to disclose if Intelligence Bureau (IB) had shared any alert or input with the state police on the terror module. The home minister further asked the opposition parties not to bring politics in the extremely sensitive matter and they are required to cooperate with the state and the police.He was responding to the allegations made by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashish Shelar over intelligence failure of the state police and no free hand to the force by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.“Police have the right to make arrests in other states on the basis of concrete information and accordingly Jaan Mohammad Shaikh alias Sameer Kalia was arrested,” the home minister said after holding a meeting with senior police officials following the arrest of a terror suspect from Dharavi in Mumbai for his alleged association with a Pakistan-organised terror module.“A case was registered against Shaikh in 2001 since then there is no criminal record against him. Police keep a watch of all the people who need to be under surveillance, and he was also under watch. There is no intelligence failure,” Patil said.“Sometimes the information of IB is shared with the states and sometimes it is not,” he said while refusing to share details if the information of Intelligence Bureau was shared with the Mumbai Police or not.He said that the case is very sensitive, and he won’t be able to share many details as it may impact the investigation. He was talking to reporters in Mantralaya after his meeting with senior police officers.On Tuesday, the special cell of Delhi Police arrested six people who were part of an alleged “Pakistan-trained terror module” and claimed to have averted serial blasts and targeted killings in at least three states including Maharashtra during the upcoming festive season. One of them, Shaikh, is a Dharavi resident. Delhi Police have claimed that Shaikh was part of the six-member ‘Pakistan-trained terror module’ and arrested him from Kota in Rajasthan. Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s brother Anees Ibrahim, suspected to be hiding in Pakistan, was connected to this module and trying to smuggle arms and ammunition into the country.On Wednesday, Shelar squarely blamed the MVA government over alleged negligence by the state intelligence unit. “Were the police that issued a lookout notice against a Union minister (Narayan Rane) for a non-cognizable offence, another lookout notice for a sitting MLA and misbehaved with a journalist, sleeping for the terrorists? If the police had the intelligence, then why action was not taken? Or they want to take a moderate stand against a particular community for political purposes?,” Shelar accused. He further alleged that though the state police force is capable enough, they are being involved in other matters such as extortion, and that is the reason such cases happen.“Instead of raising questions on the law-and-order situation, the Opposition party should cooperate with the police. They also should not hold protests by violating the government’s order. I don’t want to give importance to his (Ashish Shelar) statement. Mumbai police too have arrested two people in Delhi two days ago though in a different case. Police have the right to make an arrest,” Patil said in his response.“The police have been given free hand in the state. They are not engaged in any other work. I don’t think there is any sort of political interference. They are doing their job properly,” he added further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/terror-suspect-was-under-watch-maharashtra-home-minister-denies-intelligence-failure-101631729399909.html

Mayawati in a tweet on Wednesday said that like the law-and-order machinery, the road network too is in a mess in the state. “It is difficult to decipher if there were potholes on roads or roads on potholes,” Mayawati said. “Several accidents have happened due to these potholed roads. Newspaper reports are full of people dying due to accidents caused while driving on these potholed roads. This is sad and proof of government’s failure,” Mayawati tweeted. “Roads were among the basic requirements of the people as they are directly linked to development. The truth is that no matter how many slogans the government coins or makes claims, people are unable to understand if potholes are on roads or roads on potholes.

We have proposed some biodiversity management plans like treatment of water, controlling the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) levels of the water, and designated the fisheries department to enhance the ecology of the area.” On September 17, 2020, the NGT, hearing a petition filed by the Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (INTACH) for protection of the water body, said, “In view of the fact that there is a large transboundary water body which partly falls in Delhi and partly in Haryana, it will be appropriate that an environment management plan is prepared jointly by the State of Haryana and NCT of Delhi.” Delhi had submitted a draft plan earlier this year, which focused on objectives like restoration of wetland habitat, removal of invasive species, efficient treatment of sewage received within the wetland and maintenance of diversity of biota within Najafgarh Jheel, among other objectives. The green court is scheduled to hear the matter next month. As per the orders of the NGT, the Haryana government was supposed to submit the environment management plan within three months from the hearing, i.e., by December 2020. However, due to technical procedures like identification of area that falls under the ambit of the lake and monitoring by technical committees, the submission of the environment management plan got delayed.The seven-square-kilometre Najafgarh Jheel is an important water body for Gurugram as it acts as a large aquifer to recharge groundwater. Many creeks in the Aravallis flow into the Najafgarh Jheel, which is further carried to the Yamuna river. The lake is located in a natural depression in southwest Delhi, close to the Gurugram-Rajokri border on National Highway-48. It is fed by the Najafgarh drain, which has a sizeable catchment area in Gurugram. A portion of the lake falls in Haryana. On Wednesday, officials said that the Haryana State Wetland Authority is likely to meet next week under the chairmanship of the chief minister to take a decision on declaring the lake a wetland. “There are a lot of issues that need to be looked into, like acquiring private land around the lake before declaring it as a wetland. Experts are also exploring how a dam can be constructed around the lake so that water flowing into the lake does not flow back into the Gurugram city during peak monsoon. All these issues will be discussed in the meeting before taking a final decision,” an official from Gurugram, requesting anonymity, said.In August 2020, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that the government was considering the construction of check dams (bundhs) around the lake to prevent flooding of around 5,000 acres of agricultural land located in its vicinity. Stating that he was aware of the problems faced by villagers, Khattar had said, “Activities are ongoing at the state level to resolve the issue. The deputy commissioner has submitted the report to the state wetland authority. Under this, technical and financial subcommittees have been formed. Also, the plan is to build a dam on the slope side of the lake to stop water from inundating the agricultural land.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/najafgarh-jheel-haryana-to-submit-environment-plan-to-ngt-next-month-101631727424953.html

Officials of the health department said that the district was set a target of 145,000 but it managed to cross the target despite the first-dose inoculations having exceeded 100% coverage prior to the mega drive.“We got a very good response during these three days; whether it was drive-through vaccination, vaccination in markets in the evening hours or at vaccination centres set up in government and private hospitals. We had kept slots for both first and second doses of vaccine as due to floating population, many people are still taking their first dose in Gurugram district,” Dr MP Singh, the district immunisation officer, said.

According to the health department data, of the 62,408 doses of vaccines administered on Wednesday, 37,622 doses were administered as the first shot, while 24,786 were administered as the second shot. Almost 94% (59,252 doses) of the inoculations took place at government vaccination centres and the remaining at private hospitals. According to the data, over 2.77 million people in the district have been administered the Covid-19 vaccines since the start of the Covid-19 vaccinations on January 16. According to Singh, the district has exceeded its target of inoculating people in the 18-45 years age bracket, with a coverage rate of over 120%.

The next review of the situation is scheduled for September 23, according to the statement. According to MCG officials, developers of Mayfield Garden, Malibu Towne, Vipul World, Sushant Lok-2, Sushant Lok-3, Greenwood City, Rosewood City, Uppal Housing have agreed to hand over the colonies, while developers of Ardee City, DLF Phase-4 and DLF-5 are yet to give their consent for the transfer. The MCG takeover of these colonies was announced in November 2019 under the second phase of the transfers, after the transfer of nine private colonies under the first phase in 2016. The Haryana government started the transfer of private colonies in 2016 as residents wanted government agencies to take care of civic issues in colonies developed by private realtors.In December 2020, MCG councillors of wards across the city had taken up the issue of colony transfer with Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and pressed him to expedite the transfer of private colonies to the MCG. Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, who attended the meeting said that service estimates have already been obtained for the eight colonies and now, reports of deficient work need to be prepared to execute the pending works and services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/colonies-transfer-mcg-to-assess-deficient-infra-prepare-estimates-for-eight-colonies-101631727422019.html

He said this while launching a month-long 20,000 km ‘sankalp samaj utthan arakshan’ yatra from Lucknow. The yatra started days after Sanjay Nishad was caught in a sting operation, making highly objectionable remarks about how he planned to win the elections. On the occasion of the yatra’s launch, he dismissed the sting and said it was carried out by his opponents who were jealous of his rise and his ability to unite the riverine community. “I openly want to tell all that yes, I need money, but not for myself. It’s for the poor community of mine. I would like to invite those liaison people who are out to discredit me to be part of my yatra,” he said. The yatra would conclude with a rally in Lucknow on October 15, said Nishad. While making it clear that his party would contest the 2022 UP polls with BJP, the Nishad party top leader, who targeted all the opposition parties, also took a swipe at the BJP. “This yatra will also remind our ally BJP about the promises it made to us ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. These include promises of reservation, taking steps for the betterment of the community and withdrawal of political cases on cadre,” he said. “Our party cadres and 18% voters have now stopped voting for the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress and you can well see their fate. If our ally doesn’t keep its promises, then Sanjay Nishad would remain the only Nishad voter of the party. That’s why we feel that BJP should quickly fulfill its promises,” he said. “On October 15 at a massive ‘sarkar banao, adhikar pao (form government, get rights) rally at Lucknow’s Ramabai Ambedkar grounds, we will put all the issues before the Nishad community. Whatever decision the community takes would be acceptable to us,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sanjay-nishad-rolls-out-yatra-takes-swipe-at-ally-bjp-101631727119653.html

The money was sent in the account of Ranjit Das, a native of Bakhtiyarpur village under Mansi police station area on April 25, 2020, due to a lapse on the part of the Dakshin Bihar Gramin Bank (DBGB). Once the error was detected, Das, who also had an account in the same branch, was served notice to return it. “I felt that due to Covid-19 and the lockdown, the government had sent the amount into my account. These days, a lot of banking frauds take place and so I did not return. As I had some needs, I spent ₹1,60, 970. I was happy that the government had sent some money when I needed it. How else could money reach my empty account,” he told the police. Deepak Kumar, station house officer (SHO) of Mansi police station, told HT that the branch manager of DGDB Satyanarayan Prasad lodged an FIR against Ranjit on August 17 this year.

15-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai ranks fifth in crimes among 19 cities in India||Amid the spate of Covid-enforced restrictions, Mumbai saw only a marginal drop in registered crimes in 2020, ranking fifth among 19 metropolitan cities, according to the latest crime statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Tuesday.Data showed that Mumbai recorded 58,676 cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and special and local laws in 2020, down from the 60,823 offences in 2018 and up from the 57,073 recorded in 2018. Delhi (262,443), Chennai (168,450), Ahmedabad (82,609) and Surat (59,604) registered more crimes registered than MumbaiThe NCRB report also revealed that Maharashtra saw a rise in crimes in over the last three years. The state recorded 394,017 cases in 2020, a rise of 47,726 from 2018 (346,291)Experts said that although registered IPC cases showed an increase of around 1,000 in Mumbai (when comparing 2018 to 2020), this was because of violations committed by people under section 188 of the IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) for violation of lockdown restrictions.According to the police, incidents of street crime also decreased considerably, owing to the movement in restrictions in 2020 as there were fewer people on the streets. Officers said that the heavy presence of police personnel on the road, including more than 150 checkpoints across the city during the lockdown period, directly contributed towards getting the crime rate down. The statistics revealed that in 2020, at least 16,181 cases were registered under section 188 IPC in Mumbai.“Last year, the government had announced a total lockdown due to which people did not get out to register a complaint even if a crime was committed,” said an officer.Mumbai was yet in the second place for cases registered for grievous hurt and assault with 4,229 cases, coming after Kolkata with 4,51.“Steady increase in crime rate could be the result of increasing unemployment in a metropolis like Mumbai. However, several reasons can be behind the increasing crime rate, which can only be determined by examining the data closely,” said professor Vijay Raghavan Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) centre for criminology and justice.Some experts claim that since Mumbai is still a growing metro with several job opportunities, many people migrate to the city, making it difficult to know about their background. “There are several people who do not even know who is their neighour or have never even spoken to them. It becomes easy for criminals to blend in such circumstances and commit crime without leaving a trace,” said an IPS officer, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-ranks-fifth-in-crimes-among-19-cities-in-india-101631723819519.html
15-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai ranks third in country in cybercrimes in 2020||Mumbai ranked third nationwide in terms of cybercrimes committed in 2020, as per the latest statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Bengaluru, Silicon Valley of India, topped the list, followed by Hyderabad. While majority of cybercrime cases in Mumbai are for fraud, extortion, sexual exploitation, personal disrepute as per the offences registered in 2020, other cities have several cybercrimes that involve personal revenge, prank, political motives, terrorist activities and inciting hate against the country.In 2020, the Mumbai Police registered around 2,433 cases of cybercrime through various cyber cells and local police stations, as revealed in the statistics released by NCRB late on Tuesday. The number of cybercrimes saw a drop than 2019 when it stood at 2,527. However, it rose compared with 2018 when the number of cybercrimes was 1,482.The city ranks behind Bengaluru which registered around 8,892 cybercrimes and Hyderabad with 2,553 cases.Cyber experts feel that these numbers do not reflect an accurate picture which, according to them, is more grim. “These figures of NCRB only show figures of registered cases and not the real picture,” said cyber security expert Ritesh Bhatia.“A lot of under-reporting happens everywhere in the country,” Bhatia said, adding that, “The government of India’s portal to lodge online complaints against cyber frauds receives several complaints daily. However, not everyone manages to register an FIR in the matter.”The NCRB statistics further revealed that most of the cases registered in Mumbai were related to identity theft, cheating by personation by using computer devices, publication or transmission of obscene or sexually explicit acts in electronic form, publication or transmitting of material depicting children in sexually explicit acts, cyber stalking or bullying of women and children, data theft, fraud, debit card and credit card frauds, OTP frauds, creating fake profiles, blackmailing and fake news. The motive behind most of the cybercrimes registered in Mumbai, as per the statistics, was fraud, extortion, anger, causing disrepute and sexual exploitation. The city had around 4,828 cases pending investigation from 2019. In 2020, the Mumbai Police investigated around 7,261 cases by registering around 2,433 new offences. The cyber cell could not find sufficient evidence and closed around 968 cases, though the allegations were found to be true. The police completed investigation and filed charge sheet in 151 cases in 2020, whereas Karnataka’s Bengaluru Police filed charge sheet in 2,632 cases.In 2020, investigations were pending in around 6,071 cyber offences in the city. The pendency percentage in the city stood at 83.6% compared to cities like Bengaluru with 87.4%, Coimbatore with 96.8%, Hyderabad 77.8% and Chennai with 82.5% pendency percentage.Speaking on pendency, Bhatia said in most cybercrimes, accused persons sit in one part of the country and commit crimes in another part, therefore it becomes difficult for police to arrest them. In view of this, the pendency is high in cybercrimes. He also expressed the need to create awareness to educate people about cybercrimes.In terms of court disposal of cases, around 1,242 cases were pending for trial in various courts in the city. The prosecution could manage to get conviction only in two cases while one case was acquitted by the court. The conviction rate stood at 66.7% in Mumbai. Bengaluru saw 14 acquittals in 2020. Around 7,139 cases were pending before various courts for trial in 2020 across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-ranks-third-in-country-in-cybercrimes-in-2020-101631723459487.html

The conviction rate in the city stood at 18.7%, far less than New Delhi which had a conviction rate of 53%. The pendency percentage of most metropolitan cities having more than 2 million people stood at 98%, as per NCRB.Mumbai Police arrested around 2,385 people for crimes related to economic offences and charge sheeted 1,727 people. They got conviction against 56 persons in white collar offences in 2020 while six were acquitted. A total of 228 people were acquitted by various courts from cases registered by the Mumbai Police for economic offences.The conviction figures of Delhi police, Jaipur police and Kanpur police were better than Mumbai. Delhi Police witnessed around 160 convictions, while Jaipur police managed to bring to book around 174 accused and Kanpur police 383 accused.“Investigation in economic offences cases is mostly lengthy as most of the time the prosecution depends on documentary evidence. Reports of various agencies like forensic, bank statements, handwriting experts form a part of the charge sheet, which delay the investigations. That is the reason why the officials take time to investigate cases and several cases are pending,” said Ramesh Mahale, retired police inspector and an expert who trains police personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-29-per-cent-dip-in-economic-offences-in-2020-101631723399379.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||Dengue cases in Delhi under control; govt is alert and prepared: Health minister||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Wednesday that dengue cases recorded in the national capital till now are in control and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government is alert and prepared to deal with any situation arising out of the vector-borne disease.Delhi has so far recorded 158 cases of dengue this year, according to a weekly report released by the city’s municipal corporations. The report showed that 34 dengue cases have been recorded since last Saturday (September 11). However, no deaths have been reported till now, it added. On the other hand, Delhi has also seen 68 cases of malaria and 40 cases of chikungunya since the beginning of 2021. Civic bodies in Delhi have ramped up their measures to control the spread of the above mentioned vector-borne diseases.“About 34 cases (of dengue) have been recorded in September till date. Last year, 188 cases were reported in the entire month of September. So, cases are under control. We are alert, and all prepared to handle any dengue situation,” Jain was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. The health minister said his government’s anti-dengue drive ‘10 Hafte, 10 Baje, 10 Minute’, has been running for the past two weeks to raise awareness and it will be further intensified.However, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the Delhi government of indulging in campaign politics when it came to combating vector diseases.BJP leader Mukesh Suryan, who is the mayor of South Delhi, said on Tuesday that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was taking credit for work done by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) in curbing the spread of vector-borne diseases in the Delhi, adding that the anti-dengue campaign is an eyewash in the fight against such diseases.“The Delhi government is playing campaign politics as their anti-dengue drive, ‘10 Hafte, 10 Baje, 10 Minute’ is just an eyewash in the fight against vector-borne diseases,” Suryan said while speaking to reporters on Tuesday. The South Delhi mayor also sought an explanation from the Delhi CM as to how “how vector-borne diseases can be controlled through advertisements.”Concerns over dengue cases in Delhi arise amid a widespread outbreak of the vector-borne disease in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh. Several districts in UP including Firozabad, Agra, Mathura, Noida, among others, have been hard hit by dengue. Last week, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that it had detected the D2 strain of dengue in the specimens from Uttar Pradesh, which is fatal, impacts the platelet count and can often cause haemorrhage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dengue-cases-in-delhi-under-control-govt-is-alert-and-prepared-health-minister-101631723194432.html
15-09-2021||Mumbai||Afghanistan guns down opponents, here Pegasus is used to defeat them, says Sena||Shiv Sena slammed Centre over its refusal to file an affidavit regarding the Pegasus snooping row, stating it is a matter of national security. Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Wednesday attacked Centre saying in Afghanistan opponents are gunned down, while here means like Pegasus are used to defeat political opponents.The government on Monday said it had nothing to hide but cited “national security” as a reason to not file a detailed affidavit in response to petitions in Supreme Court seeking a formal inquiry into the Pegasus spyware row.An editorial in Sena mouthpiece said that the Centre was playing ‘hide and seek’ on the issue and has been running away from replying to questions from Opposition in the Parliament, and now by the Supreme Court. In an attack on the Central government, the editorial remarked, “Centre has decided that Parliament and courts must not be given importance.”International media had earlier in July reported that more than 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including of two serving Central ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders, activists in India could have been targeted, for hacking through the Israeli spyware, which is sold only to government agencies. “What was the exact threat to the nation from two Central ministers, Rahul Gandhi and Opposition leaders, a few journalists, army officers that Pegasus had to be used to spy on them?” the editorial asked. It further said that the Centre told the SC that the issue involves aspects of national security, hence it cannot be debated on affidavit.“The issue of national security is important, there are no differences over that. But it does not mean that only the Modi government is worried about national security and not the Opposition parties in Parliament and our Supreme Court... In Afghanistan, opponents are shot dead. Here mediums like Pegasus are used to defeat opponents,” the mouthpiece said.As a policy of the Maharashtra unit of Bharatiya Janata Party, it does not respond to criticism or remarks made in Saamana editorials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/afghanistan-guns-down-opponents-here-pegasus-is-used-to-defeat-them-says-sena-101631723100633.html
15-09-2021||Lucknow||BrahMos missiles unit to come up between Lucknow and Kanpur||KANPUR Next-generation BrahMos missiles would be manufactured in UP’s Defence Corridor at a facility between Lucknow and Kanpur. The land was nearly finalised and would be handed over to the DRDO by the end of this month, said Satish Mahana, minister for industrial development.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) had asked the UP government for 200 acres of land for the project and around ₹300 crore would be invested in its first phase. “The government will not charge for the land. It will be given to the DRDO at a token amount of Re 1. In all probability, we will be giving away the land by the month-end,” he added. Mahana had met Brahmos Space Technology director general Sudhir Mishra last month and the latter had proposed a manufacturing facility for Brahmos missiles and defence systems in Uttar Pradesh. In the first phase, 70 ancillary units would also be set up at the facility between Lucknow and Kanpur. As many as 400 more supporting units would come up by the time the Brahmos facility gets rolling. The defence sector in Kanpur already has 300 small and big units producing defence equipment worth ₹1,500 crore every year. The Ordinance Factory is producing one of most important components for Pinaka missile systems. The DRDO had asked for land on the Lucknow, Kanpur and Jhansi stretch of the Defence Corridor and officials saw several locations during the past two weeks. The land between Lucknow and Kanpur topped priority, said officials. Brahmos supersonic cruise missile is considered one of the most lethal weapons, which flies at a speed of 3.5 mach (or 4,300 km per hour) having a range of 290 km. The missile was tested successfully last year in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/brahmos-missiles-unit-to-come-up-between-lucknow-and-kanpur-101631722980055.html

Four more members of an Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI-backed) terrorist module, involved in a bid to blow up an oil tanker with an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) tiffin bomb last month, were arrested on Tuesday. Those held are Rubal Singh, Vicky Bhutti, Malkeet Singh and Gurpreet Singh, alias Gopi. Rubal, also wanted in a murder case of September 1, was picked up from Ambala, the other three were nabbed from their villages in Ajnala, Amritsar. Their fifth accomplice, Gurmukh Brar, had been arrested on August 20.Two Pakistan-based terrorists, including a Pakistani Intelligence Officer, have also been identified and named in the case registered in August.Taking note of the ‘increased attempts by terror groups to disturb the state’s peace’, the CM has directed the police to be on high alert, particularly in view of schools and educational institutions reopening, the festive season and the assembly polls. Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said the two terrorists from Pakistan named in the case are International Sikh Youth Federation chief Lakhbir Singh Rode and Qasim, an intelligence officer. The DGP added that Qasim and Rode had promised to transfer over ₹2 lakh to five arrested accused for carrying out the blast. “Rubal and Vicky Bhutti were in touch with Qasim, who had reportedly tasked the four members to blast an oil tanker for causing maximum damage to people and property,” the top cop said, adding that the blast was made on August 8 when, at about 11.30 pm, the Ajnala police received information that an Oil Tanker (PB-02 CR 5926) parked at Sharma Filling Station Ajnala, located on the Amritsar-Ajnala Road near village Bhakha Tara Singh, had caught fire. Ultimately, the fire brigade doused the flames.Preliminary investigations revealed that Gurmukh had placed the tiffin IED at Hambowal on Jalandhar-Amritsar highway, from where, on August 6, 2021, Vicky, Malkeet and Gurpreet Singh picked it up on the directions of Rode and Qasim. The trio hid the bomb near a canal in the Rajasansi area. A pen-drive was attached with the tiffin box, which contained intructions to operate the Tiffin Bomb IED. On August 8, 2021, these terrorist operatives carried out a recce of Sharma Filling Station during the day and placed the IED at about 11pm, with the timer set to eight minutes.

15-09-2021||Mumbai||Byculla zoo welcomes two penguin chicks||The Byculla zoo welcomed two penguin chicks this year, said Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in a statement on Wednesday. The male penguin chick, named Oreo, was born to Humboldt penguins Donald and Daisy on May 1 this year and is four months old now.Meanwhile, another penguin chick was born to Flipper, the oldest female among the Humboldts, and Mr Molt, the youngest male in the zoo, on August 19. The baby penguin is stable and under the observation of zoo authorities. The sex of the penguin will be determined by a DNA test later.Dr Sanjay Tripathi, director of Byculla zoo, said, “The reason behind naming the male chick Oreo was spontaneous. We will also name the 25-days-old baby penguin in the coming days after sex determination.”Tripathi added, “The enclosure of penguins has a capacity of housing 25 penguins at a time and with the addition of two, we have a total of nine penguins in the enclosure.” As part of its revamp project, the Byculla zoo, also known as the Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan, bought eight penguins from Seoul in South Korea on July 26, 2016, at the cost of ₹45 crore.However, on October 23, 2016, one of them, named Dory, died owing to bacterial infection, which led to protests from political parties and activists.The seven others – Bubble (5 years), Mr Molt (5 years), Donald (5.5 years), Daisy (5.5 years), Popeye (6 years), Olive (7 years) and Flipper (8 years)– were displayed to the public in March 2017.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said, “Bubble, who did not have a mate till now is taking good care of Oreo.” Oreo, now four months old, has mixed well with the colony, added Pednekar.Pednekar also slammed those who criticised the BMC over its spending on the upkeep of the penguins. Pednekar said the revenue of the zoo has gone up drastically after the penguins came. Recently, political parties, including BJP, Congress and Samajwadi Party (SP), had cornered the BMC over floating tenders worth ₹ 16 crore for maintenance and upkeep of the penguins.The BMC, under which the Byculla zoo comes, said, “Oreo has been completely parent reared and a team of vets only assisted the parents by feeding the parents every two-three hours. This ensures that parents feed the chick well. In addition, the vets also check the chick’s weight every morning, which helps them decide whether the chick needs supplemental feeding.” The statement added, “Oreo has switched to eating fish like an adult penguin now and doesn’t need any special diet. He is in his juvenile coat and will undergo moulting into his adult coat at about 1 year. This moulting is very stressful for young penguins; hence we are taking utmost care.”According to zoo authorities, the 25-days-old baby penguin is also being kept under close observation. According to authorities, up to three months of age, young penguins are very susceptible to diseases since they have weak immunity. The vets do a physical check every morning, auscultate the chick and give formula feeding.Humboldt penguins usually mate after the age of 3.5 in two mating seasons — March to April and October to November. Penguins pair up during the entire mating period. After mating, a female penguin lays eggs in 1.5 months, and parents take turns to incubate them.Meanwhile, the Byculla zoo is shut for general public since April 05, 2021 as the second wave of Covid hit the city. There are no plans to open the zoo to the general public yet, in anticipation of a third wave, said zoo authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/byculla-zoo-welcomes-two-penguin-chicks-101631722559596.html

15-09-2021||Lucknow||Farm laws one of boldest moves ever made by govt: Rajnath||LUCKNOW Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday termed the centre’s three farm laws as one of the boldest moves ever made and said these would strengthen the farmers economically and also boost agricultural reforms. “There was a dire need for agricultural reforms in India. But, the previous governments did very little in this regard. It was only our government that took a bold step and passed three bills that would help farmers gain financial security and also strengthen agricultural reforms,” he said while inaugurating the UP Session at the 18th Indo-US Economic Summit organized on a virtual platform by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce-North India Council (IACC-NIC). The coronavirus pandemic had brought newer challenges in terms of disruption to supply chains, a downturn in industrial activities, negative growth in travel and tourism industry and there was no doubt that the Indo-US cooperation will go a long way to restore normalcy and further boost economic dynamism, said the defence minister, who was also the chief guest at the inaugural session of the summit. Singh listed a range of measures initiated by the NDA government to boost economic growth, saying global investors were now receiving a “red carpet” welcome in India instead of “red-tapism”. He said the trust between the government and the industry had increased following the scrapping of the retrospective taxation regime.“This was the much needed move that was never initiated by the previous governments. We have formulated progressive and investor-friendly tax policies. We have said ‘Good Bye’ to retrospective taxation,” added Singh. He said the government was preparing for “dynamic growth” in this entire decade and noted that there was a lot of scope for American and Indian defence firms to go for co-production and co-development of military equipment. The high-profile session moderated by Mukesh Singh, chairman, Lucknow Chapter, executive council member, IACC-NIC and State Head Arthur D. Little, senior advisor, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Uttar Pradesh, also saw discussion on the UP-US economic ties in the ‘Partner States-Uttar Pradesh-Partners in Progress’ session of the summit. Michael Rosenthal, director, North India Office, US Embassy in his address said that India-US relations were very old. “At present, in the global political equation, relations are being established between these meaningful democratic powers of the world not only through political but also through economic, cultural, social, military, technical, partnerships. We strive to strengthen UP-US relations and encourage American companies and investors to invest in Uttar Pradesh,” said Rosenthal. Arvind Kumar, ACS, industries, information technology and electronics department, UP highlighted various schemes run by the government to improve the economy of UP and attract investment. He said the land bank was being expanded to attract foreign investment in UP. “For the ease of industrial units, construction of new expressways, metro rail projects, elevated national expressway, dedicated freight corridor and Jewar International Airport in western UP is going on at a brisk pace,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/farm-laws-one-of-boldest-moves-ever-made-by-govt-rajnath-101631720759028.html

In 2019-20, the utility had reported a loss of ₹1,158 crore. Transmission and distribution losses also came down slightly. Elaborating, chairman and managing director A Venu Prasad said, “We saw a reduction in finance cost of ₹1,306 crore due to the Ujwal-DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme; there was an increase in carrying cost of ₹577 crore for delayed payment of subsidy, increase in grant by ₹570 crore on account of loss funding of previous years and increase in delayed payment surcharge of ₹156 crore from consumers.” He added that annual accounts were approved on Tuesday at a meeting of board of directors of the PSPCL, where Anurag Aggarwal, additional chief secretary (power), and principal secretary finance, KAP Sinha, were also present. Prasad added that the utility decreased its borrowing by 4% and it had reduced its financial cost by restructuring of loans. “PSPCL earned a rebate of around ₹150 crore in 2020-21 against payments towards power purchase by efficient handling of its working capital,” he added, mentioning smart meters as another major initiative towards a better system. “To further control expenditure on power bills by the citizens, smart meters may also be used as prepayment meters in future. This measure will unquestionably be going to improve the operational competence of the corporation by significant reduction in transmission and distribution,” he claimed, adding that cheaper power replaced expensive power bought from other sources. In the process, PSPCL procured around 724 million units at ₹2.76 per KWH, leading to a 6.4% decrease in power purchase cost over the last fiscal.Prasad also thanked the Punjab government for its continued support to the power sector, as it had released subsidy of ₹9,657 crore during 2020-21, covering important sectors like agriculture, industry, and weaker sections of the society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/financial-prudence-cut-in-loan-has-pspcl-in-profit-for-1st-time-in-5-years-101631719858848.html

Bathinda airport director Varinder Singh confirmed on Wednesday that according to the new schedule for October 27-March 28 issued last week, air connectivity will continue to remain grounded indefinitely.Bathinda was the only district in southern Punjab with air connectivity. Alliance Air (AA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Air India, has been the sole service provide from here since 2016, and it chose not to extend operations after its contract ended last year.The airline had discontinued air services on the Delhi route from November 28, 2020, whereas flights to Jammu were suspended on October 27, 2019. Flights from the Bathinda airport were grounded after a lockdown was imposed due to the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020. Even as domestic flights have restarted over the past few months, Bathinda has continued to be a ‘no-go zone’ among players from the public and private sector.Before the suspension of the flight service, Bathinda was connected to New Delhi thrice-a-week, with an average occupancy of 80%. Flights to Jammu had an average occupancy of 70% with most taking it to reach Vaishno Devi and Amarnath. Bathinda-Jammu flight operated five days a week, barring Tuesday and Thursday.“Early this year, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had approached two private service providers to consider running the Delhi-Bathinda flight. We are yet to get a response,” said the director. Sources said since the Covid-19 outbreak aviation sector was struggling to get back to normalcy as there are few takers for the air services.Air service to Bathinda was started with much fanfare in December 2016 as part of Centre’s ambitious regional connectivity scheme (RCS) of Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (Udan), with fares were kept low. Less than four years of this launch, air connectivity to the under-developed south Malwa was suspended.

15-09-2021||Delhi||Court pulls up Delhi govt for ‘lethargy’ in constructing 100-bed hospital||The Delhi high court on Wednesday pulled up the Delhi government and cited its ‘lethargic approach’ as the reason behind its failure to process a forest clearance to construct a 100-bed hospital in the city’s Najafgarh area despite the Centre’s nudge. The bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) by a lawyer, Rajesh Kaushik, seeking a direction to the two governments to finish the construction of the hospital at the Rural Health Training Centre in Najafgarh. “Do something so that the construction is over. You can say no also but don’t sit tight. You decide as per law,” the bench said during the hearing, news agency PTI reported. “It is the misfortune of the public at large that a 100-bedded hospital could not be completed because of the lethargic approach on part of the Delhi government,” the bench was quoted as saying. The bench further stated that the Union of India has been writing “letter after letter” and yet “no reply” is being given on part of the Delhi government. “No counter has been filed (by Delhi government),” the bench said, according to PTI. Advocate Anurag Ahluwalia, who was appearing for the Centre, said that the project was 80% complete and is waiting for Delhi government’s forest department’s go-ahead since December 2018 as the site needs a sanction for the “transplantation of trees.” The petition noted that the structure of the building is complete, and it was “utmost essential” for the general public that the hospital becomes operational prior to the arrival of the possible third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It also stated that the Najafgarh area lacks good hospitals and the setting-up of the 100-bed hospital would “cater to the needs of 15 lakh people” living in 73 villages. In the end, the bench rendered time for the Delhi government to file response to the plea and mention the “least possible time” within which the sanction for the tree transplantation will be granted. The matter has been posted for next hearing on November 8. In August, Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal said that his government will add as many as 6,800 additional beds in government hospitals across the Union territory (UT) – which will be operational in the next six months. He added that the addition of the new beds would ramp up the bed capacity in Delhi government hospitals – which currently has around 10,000 beds, by 70%. Kejriwal said that these additional beds will be helpful if the national capital sees another Covid-19 wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-pulls-up-delhi-govt-for-lethargy-in-constructing-100-bed-hospital-101631715996547.html

15-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC to undertake mandatory Covid test of occupants in sealed buildings||Anticipating a possible surge in Covid-19 cases after the festival season, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to run reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests on occupants, especially, those suffering from comorbidities, residing in sealed buildings across the city.As of September 15, Mumbai has 37 sealed buildings and 1,528 sealed floors. Of the 4,696 active Covid-19 patients, 42% are asymptomatic, 47% symptomatic and 11% critical.It was observed in the second wave that high-rise buildings recorded a higher number of Covid-19 cases than slums. “Residents in high-rise buildings constituted almost 90% of the cumulative Covid-19 cases in the second wave. We, therefore, want to run RT-PCR tests on occupants in sealed buildings, mostly those who have underlying health issues,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.Members of the state’s Covid-19 task force have welcomed the move as the RT-PCR test is considered gold standard for diagnosing Covid-19. “The reliance should be more on RT-PCR which has a higher efficiency rate than Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT). We still don’t know about the epidemiological pattern of the possible third wave, but the civic body has to keep a close eye on non-slum areas,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state Covid-19 task force.HT has previously reported that the civic body plans to increase daily tests to 60,000 after the festival season. But their main focus would be those above 50 years due to their co-morbidities. Ward officers have also been instructed to mandatory test all close contacts of infected patients immediately, to avoid the transmission of the infection amid the relaxation of the Covid-19 restrictions.“We are making a list of all the elderly with underlying health issues who haven’t taken the jab as yet. We will contact them and encourage them to get fully vaccinated. We have also increased contact tracing per infected person to 25 individuals which were 15 earlier,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.As per data provided by BMC, individuals above 60 years are most vulnerable to breakthrough infection after vaccination. The breakthrough infection rate among beneficiaries above 60 years with one vaccine jab is 1.52%, while it is 0.52% among fully vaccinated individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-undertake-mandatory-rt-pcr-test-of-occupants-in-sealed-buildings-in-mumbai-101631714998833.html

They shared the information with the Delhi Police. We have recorded statements of Shaikh’s family members and the ATS Mumbai team will visit Delhi and will share the information with them,” said Agarwal.Shaikh was allegedly involved in firing at a businessman’s office in south Mumbai in 2001 and a case was registered at Pydhonie police station. He was arrested in the case, but was acquitted, said a crime branch officer. He added that there were also a couple of non-cognisable offences registered against him in Dharavi.“Shaikh was in contact with Fahim Machmach who was reportedly staying in Karachi, Pakistan and was believed to be a loyalist of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. Machmach died a few days ago and so Shaikh might have come in contact with Anees Ibrahim. Shaikh was hired by the gang for freelance work. Apart from ATS, the Mumbai crime branch was also keeping watch on him,” added the officer.“Shaikh had planned to travel to Delhi on September 13 and had transferred funds to a travel agent in Dharavi, on September 10. His ticket was booked in sleeper class in Golden Temple Express, said Agarwal. Shaikh lost his job two months ago and was driving a cab. He had taken a loan from a cooperative bank to buy a taxi,” said an ATS official. Delhi Police have claimed that Shaikh was part of the six-member ‘Pakistan-trained terror module’ and arrested him from Kota in Rajasthan. Delhi Police also claimed that the arrested accused were planning serial blasts in three states during the upcoming festive season. Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s brother Anees Ibrahim, suspected to be hiding in Pakistan, was connected to this module and trying to smuggle arms and ammunition into the country.The Delhi Police said that they have seized RDX, which was smuggled from Pakistan and meant to carry out blasts in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, but police did not specify the location in states. Delhi Police said that Shaikh was in contact with Anees Ibrahim and was tasked by a Pakistan-based person connected with an underworld operative hiding in Pakistan to ensure the smooth delivery of IED (improvised explosive device), sophisticated weapons and grenades to different entities in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pakistantrained-terror-module-jaan-mohammad-shaikh-was-also-on-our-radar-says-maharashtra-ats-chief-101631714758434.html
15-09-2021||Mumbai||Suspended cop moves HC, seeks CBI probe against Maharashtra minister Anil Parab||While holding that courts cannot be used to fight out political battles, the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday refused to grant an urgent hearing on a petition of a suspended inspector from Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO). The petitioner, Gajendra Patil, alleged that there existed rampant corruption across RTOs in the state. He has also accused transport minister Anil Parab and others of corruption as regards to transfers and postings in the transport department.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was informed that the petitioner was suspended after he complained about corruption to his superiors. His counsel advocates VP Rane and Venkatesh Shewale submitted that the suspended officer was seeking an independent investigation into his allegations by a central agency, preferably the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). In his petition, Patil claimed that after his suspension he was not given an opportunity to defend himself, nor was his complaint addressed by anyone. Patil alleged that apart from corruption in RTO’s there was corruption at border check posts and illegal registration of BS-4 vehicles was also taking place. Patil alleged that police officers were using their position to settle cases against some private operators. Recently, the transport minister had been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering case, whereas former state home minister Anil Deshmukh is accused of channelising extortion money through an educational trust. Parab has also been accused by arrested assistant inspector Sachin Vaze, who in a letter written to the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in April, alleged that Parab had directed him to extort ₹50 crore from a private trust. When the advocates for Patil sought an urgent hearing of the petition, the bench declined to do so and observed that “courts should not be used for political battles.”The court has posted the petition for hearing on October 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/suspended-cop-moves-hc-seeks-cbi-probe-against-maharashtra-minister-anil-parab-101631714338219.html
15-09-2021||Patna||Bihar tops in property disputes and attacks on police, 2nd in murders and riots||The latest data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has painted a grim picture of Bihar on the law-and-order front with the state recording the second highest number of 3,195 murder cases in 2020 after Uttar Pradesh’s 3,939. However, when it comes to land and property related disputes, it left all others behind with 4,838 cases, as Maharashtra ranked second with 1,340 cases registered in 2020 . Bihar also earned the dubious distinction of registering 77 cases of attack on police and government officials last year - the most in the country.Disputes, especially over property, emerged as the biggest factor behind murders in Bihar. With 13,202 cases of attempt to murder, Bihar was only behind West Bengal, which registered 14,751 such cases in 2020, as per the NCRB data.The data revealed that in 2020, 815 persons were killed in the state over land disputes, 170 over love affairs, 115 over illicit relations and 16 for political reasons.Bihar also saw 7,262 cases of rioting behind Maharashtra’s 9,422 cases. In cases of caste conflicts, 234 people were killed in Bihar in 208 incidents last year. Bihar also ranked second in dowry-related cases with 2,555 registered matters following 3,031 such cases recorded in Uttar Pradesh and followed by Jharkhand’s 1,535 cases. The cases of atrocities against Dalits across Bihar rose in 2020 with registration of 7,368 cases, only behind UP, where 12,714 such cases were registered last year.Bihar also reported second-most instances of kidnapping for ransom with 42 reported incidents reported, however, in the overall statistics for kidnapping and abduction related crime, Bihar was at the fourth spot with 7,889 cases, behind states such as Uttar Pradesh (12, 913) and West Bengal (9309). With 15,359 recorded incidents in 2020, Bihar ranked ninth in crime against women. Uttar Pradesh with 49, 385 cases, West Bengal with 36, 439 and Rajasthan with 34, 535 cases, were the three worst-performing states on that front.Bihar recorded 860 rape cases, far less than 5,310 recorded in Rajasthan and 2,769 in UP. In cases of assault on women with intent to outrage modesty, Bihar was 21st among states with most reported incidents in 2020. Another silver lining was seen in the significant decline in the number of crimes against children in Bihar during the year 2020. In 2019, Bihar ranked fourth, registering 9,320 such cases, but in 2020, the state registered only 6,591 cases.Similarly, in cases related to Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) and crime against senior citizens, Bihar was ranked behind several states like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Telangana.Overall, Bihar recorded a 4.3 % decrease in the number of crimes under the Indian Penal Code and Special and Local Laws (SLL) compared to 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-tops-in-property-disputes-and-attacks-on-police-2nd-in-murders-and-riots-101631711157980.html

In all, 18 candidates secured 100 percentile. Pal was delighted over her achievement because normally it’s the boys who usually perform better in this exam. “It’s indeed a joyful moment for me but more than that it is a source of motivation to do well in JEE Advanced. I feel that the first 20 years of our life are just like an insurance policy, which will give lifelong results, if we invest something daily. So, instead of wasting this precious time, we should give our best in everything we do,” said the passout of Seth Anandram Jaipuria, Noida.Pal got 100 percentile in physics, mathematics and chemistry. But there were no major celebrations at her place. “The celebrations can wait for now as the most important exam, JEE Advanced, is scheduled for October 3. I have covered the syllabus thoroughly but still there are areas which I need to work on,” she said.Pal aspires to become an astronaut and wants to graduate in astrophysics. She secured 99.988 percentile in session 1 (February), skipped session 2, obtained 100 percentile in session 3 Pal and skipped session 4 exam. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NTA conducted JEE Main four times, beginning from February and the best score of the four exams was considered to prepare the final merit for JEE Main this year. Pal said, “I am grateful to my parents, teachers and all those from whom I have learnt something in my life.”“My advice to future aspirants is that one should study not just for the exams, but for one’s own self. It is then that we start enjoying the subject and excel in it without any stress,” she added.Pal’s mother, Rakhi Aggarwal, a clinical psychologist, said: “It’s a proud moment for us that our daughter has bagged AIR 1 in JEE Main. I believe that emotional well being is the foremost requirement for academic excellence. Also, children should use the Internet wisely instead of getting lost in this carnival of distractions. Focusing on the goal day and night will definitely fetch you good results.” Her father, Vishal Aggarwal, is a businessman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/jee-main-ghaziabad-girl-shares-all-india-rank-1-with-17-others-101631710498011.html
15-09-2021||Lucknow||‘Abba jaan’ remark triggers political war ahead of UP polls||LUCKNOW As the din over chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s ‘abba jaan’ remark gets louder, the political discourse appears to be changing ahead of 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. A political war has ensued over the use of ‘abba jaan’, which are otherwise respectable words to address or refer to a father. Yogi made the jibe while addressing a public meeting at Kushinagar recently. “Those who said ‘abba jaan’ used to get all the rations,” said Yogi while claiming that most of the people were not getting their rations before 2017. Yogi obviously made the remark to make his point about Muslim appeasement during the Samajwadi Party regime. Yogi’s jibe irked the opposition more than once in recent months. “As they know that their government is on its way out, the language of its head has changed,” said former chief minister and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in an obvious reference to Yogi’s “abba jaan” comment in Kushinagar. Yogi used these words in another speech earlier, albeit in a different context. While referring to the Covid vaccination in August 2021, Yogi said those who used to oppose vaccination were getting the jab after ‘abba jaan’ got vaccinated. Without naming any leader or his father, Yogi had apparently referred to Akhilesh Yadav’s apprehensions about the Covid vaccination. Yadav had initially called the Covid-19 vaccine as “BJP’s vaccine” though he later decided to get vaccinated. His father and SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav too got vaccinated. Yogi maintained that ‘abba jaan’ was not an un-parliamentary word. The SP, however, asked chief minister to mind his language. UP government spokesman and minister for MSME Sidharth Nath Singh said the chief minister only highlighted how the previous government was using distribution of rations for appeasement. “Whenever the BJP talks about development programmes, the opposition sees polarization and there is no question of changing political discourse,” he added. Besides the SP, others were also targeting the chief minister for his jibe ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. UP Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu said the Yogi government had failed on all fronts. He said use of such language was an indication about the CM’s frustration, who was now trying to mislead people. Lallu said the chief minister apparently wanted to divert attention from real issues that were affecting the people of Uttar Pradesh. All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi also joined the debate on the issue. Giving details about the low number of primary health centres, community health centres and sub-centres during the BJP government’s regime in the state, Owaisi said there would not have been any shouts of “abba, abba” if some work had been done. “Use of words should be balanced by all leaders irrespective of their political affiliation, be it during or after the elections. Leaders of all political parties should mind their language and follow values of healthy politics,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, head of department, political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/abba-jaan-remark-triggers-political-war-ahead-of-up-polls-101631708217766.html

It is being ensured that no crime against women and children goes unreported, undetected, unregistered, uninvestigated and unprosecuted,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/murder-cases-up-by-30-in-himachal-in-covid-year-101631706597908.html

Raju requested the CBI court to cancel Jagan’s bail on the grounds that the latter had violated the bail conditions and was trying to influence witnesses in the CBI case against him.The CBI court also dismissed a separate petition filed by Raju seeking cancellation of bail of Jagan’s close aide and YSRCP parliamentary party leader V Vijay Sai Reddy, who is also accused in the case.Also Read | 14-feet statue of PM Modi, made with scrap materials, to be erected in BengaluruIn 2012, the CBI filed a case against Jagan alleging that he had, in a criminal conspiracy with others, received bribes from various companies and individuals who had invested in his group companies as a ‘quid pro quo’ deal for securing undue favours from then combined Andhra Pradesh government headed by his father late Dr YS Rajasekhar Reddy during 2004-2009.Simultaneously, the Enforcement Directorate also filed cases of money laundering against Jagan. The CBI arrested Jagan in May 2012 and was let off on bail in September 2013. He became the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh in May 2019.Raju contended in his petition that Jagan tried to influence several officials, who were co-accused in his case, by posting them in key positions.The CBI court disagreed with the arguments of the rebel YSRCP MP that Jagan had violated the bail conditions in connection with the quid pro quo case.The court observed that there was no complaint from any of the witnesses stating that Jagan tried to intimidate them or influence them after coming to power. It also felt that Raju’s apprehensions were purely hypothetical and not substantiated by any material evidence.Reacting to the CBI court’s judgement, the rebel YSRC MP said he would challenge it in the high court. “If I don’t get justice in the high court, too, I will move the Supreme Court,” he said.Earlier in the day, the Telangana high court dismissed Raju’s petition requesting transfer of his petition in CBI court to another criminal court, on the suspicion that the judgement could have been leaked to Sakshi, the media house owned by the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbicourt-dismisses-plea-seeking-cancellation-of-andhra-cm-jagan-s-bail-101631705037467.html
15-09-2021||Patna||Congress Bihar in-charge proposes new candidates for state party chief||Congress’s Bihar in-charge Bhakta Charan Das has proposed a panel of new candidates for appointment of the state party president. This comes in the wake of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) disagreeing to his initial proposal for reconstitution of the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC).A senior AICC leader familiar with the development said Das has proposed a set of four leaders —former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar, former governor Nikhil Kumar and Kutumba legislator Rajesh Ram—for the appointment of a new BPCC president in place of incumbent Madan Mohan Jha. He has also recommended the names of four working presidents including Kumar Ashish, Pravin Kushwaha and state Mahila Congress chief Amita Bhushan, against the previous list of eight leaders. A senior party leader said the high command expressed its reservation over appointment of eight working president against the set norm of four. Also Read | Life term for kidnapping and killing 2.5 yr old child in BiharDas had last month submitted the proposal of nominating Rajesh Ram as the BPCC chief, but the party high command had turned it down in view of the protests lodged against him by many senior party leaders. They feared that any decision in the state unit would not be impartial if the in-charge, co in-charge and president were all from the Dalit community. Former BPCC president Chandan Bagchi said the AICC should be cautious while reconsituting the BPCC. “The party high command shall not solely rely on the in-charge,” said Bagchi, who has served as AICC in-charge of five states in the past. Though Das could not be reached for his comments despite repeated attempts, leaders close to him said he was still in favour of appointing Rajesh Ram or Meira Kumar so he could have a direct control on the BPCC. “Das has rented a flat in Patna so that he could spend more time in the state. He is also looking to contest the Lok Sabha election from the state,” said a working president. A section of senior party leaders, who are aspiring key positions in the new committee have already rushed to New Delhi to bolster their chances of induction. In the last Lok Sabha polls, the Congress won only one out of nine seats it contested, while the party’s tally in the assembly came down to 19 against the previous strength of 27 in the House of 243.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/congress-bihar-in-charge-proposes-new-candidates-for-state-party-chief-101631704557281.html

They are forced to cross the railway tracks and then immerse the idol into the creek on the other side. As per the villagers, there is a long standing demand for better connectivity and an artificial pond in the village itself as around 1,000 idols are immersed in the creek every year during Ganesh Chathurthi. Meanwhile, to ensure the safety of these residents, local police along with the railway police have now deployed a team at the track to guide the villagers. “Earlier, we used an underpass tunnel but it hasn’t been maintained well. We are forced to cross the tracks to immerse the idols in the creek. This year, the municipal corporation provided a small tank but people want to immerse the idol in a proper water body,” said Manoj Chaudhari, 41, a villager.

The personnel are from local police, GRP and RPF. We also inform the railways to control the speed while approaching this area as people keep crossing the tracks in groups.” KDMC ward officer Vasant Bhongade said, “After the residents placed a demand to provide an artificial pond at the village this year we provided them with a tank.

15-09-2021||Chandigarh||‘Sukhbir Singh Badal favoured farm ordinances for being pro-farmer, opposed resolution’: Navjot Singh Sidhu||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu hit out at Shiromani Akali Dal’s (SAD) Sukhbir Singh Badal, alleging that Badal cited the three farm ordinances as “pro farmer” and “withdrew” when the Punjab government passed a resolution demanding unconditional withdrawal of the three laws during the budget session of the state assembly in March.Sidhu alleged that Badal “favoured the ordinances, opposed resolution arguing that there was nothing wrong in ordinance, describing it as pro-farmer”.Akali Dal members had created an uproar in the assembly when chief minister Amarinder Singh was replying to the Governor's address on the day the resolution was passed in the House in early March. Singh had lashed out at Badal and his wife and former Union minister Harmsimrat Kaur, accusing them of brazenly cheating the people of Punjab with their double-speak on the farm laws.Sidhu also hit out at the Badals calling them “neeti nirmata” of Centre’s three farm laws, alleging that these laws were similar to the Punjab Contract Farming Act, 2013, that was passed by the BJP-SAD government in March of 2013, after being tabled in the assembly by then chief minister Prakash Singh Badal of SAD.The Contract Farming Act was also cited by Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in the Rajya Sabha in February of this year while arguing in favour of the new farm laws. Tomar has stated in the House that "Punjab Contract Farming Act provides for jail and fine up to ₹five lakh for the farmer. In the Act made by the Government of India, the farmer can come out of contract farming at any time."Sidhu’s allegations come as SAD is gearing up to observe September 17 as a ‘black day’ on the completion of one year of the enactment of the three laws to protest against the laws. Badal has urged protesting farmers to join the protest march from Gurdwara Rakab Ganj to Parliament demanding repeal of the three laws.Sidhu also talked about the pro-farmer policies brought by the Congress party while it was in power, stating that “it's Congress that brought MSP, mandi, National Food Security Act, The Public Distribution System was also brought by the Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-singh-badal-favoured-farm-ordinances-for-being-pro-farmer-opposed-resolution-navjot-singh-sidhu-101631703033032.html

Citing the Punjab Contract Farming Act, 2013, Sidhu told reporters in Chandigarh: “These (the three farm laws) were implemented by the Badals in Punjab first and then the Narendra Modi Government framed the three laws. The Centre’s farm laws are a photostat copy of the Act brought by the Badals.” Also read: Farmers are angry for valid reasons, but there are no easy solutionsHe called the then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal the “niti nirmata (policymaker)” of the farm laws. Flanked by the four working presidents of the Punjab Congress and state unit general secretary Pargat Singh, Sidhu aimed to step up the attack on the rival Shiromani Akali Dal on the contentious farm laws that have become the main rallying point among political parties in the run-up to the assembly elections early next year. Badals playing double game: Capt Amarinder Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had also taken on the Badals as he sounded the poll bugle at Balachaur on Monday. He accused SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal and his son and former deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal of playing a double game on the farm laws passed by the Modi government last year. He said that the SAD, as an ally of the Modi-led NDA government, first endorsed the three farm ordinances but later did a U-turn under pressure from its rural constituency of farmers in Punjab. “The three farm ordinances were made in agreement of the Shiromani Akali Dal, as Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal was a part of the cabinet that passed the ordinances,” Capt Amarinder said. He said that the former chief minister, Parkash Singh Badal, had issued a video statement, endorsing the farm laws and advocating that there was nothing wrong in the new ordinances. He accused the SAD of abandoning the interest of farmers when its backing was needed and supporting them now when they are protesting the farm laws tooth and nail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-chief-navjot-sidhu-says-badal-niti-nirmata-of-farm-laws-101631701617087.html

The state is already on alert and surveilling districts bordering Kerala for Nipah-like symptoms.“ILI (influenza-like illness) kind of infection is witnessed during monsoon year on year. This year we're also witnessing. We're closely watching, taking inputs from private and government hospitals. There has been a marginal increase in ILI cases and viral fever,” Sudhakar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.States across the country have been reporting an uptick in dengue, viral and ILI cases. West Bengal reported a spurt in viral fever cases, with the paediatric ward of the state-run Jalpaiguri district hospital currently treating 50-60 children. The state government has formed a team of experts to monitor such cases and recommend measures. Delhi has also reported a spike in the number of dengue, viral and scrub typhus cases among children in hospitals, and doctors have urged for precautionary measures to be followed."Cases of viral fever among children are exponentially high this year. The OPD is functioning round-the-clock. Normally OPD sees 700-800 patients every day, but for the past one week more than 1,800 patients are coming every day only during the day and evening time. We are seeing approximately 300 patients each night," Dr Mamta Jajoo of Chacha Nehru Hospital told news agency ANI on September 11.Elsewhere in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) took cognisance of the dengue situation. “The situation is bad. 40-50% of patients suffer from dengue and viral fever. 60% of the patients are children,” president of IMA’s Agra unit, Rajeev Upadhyaya told news agency ANI.Sudhakar also told reporters that those exhibiting symptoms of ILI are also being tested for Covid and 99.5% of them are testing negative for it.“So, from Covid-19's perspective, we're relieved.

15-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi completes liquor licence allotment in all 32 zones; earns ₹8,900 crore||The Delhi government has completed the process of appointing new licensees for the retail sale of liquor in each of the newly carved 32 excise zones of the national Capital. Data accessed by HT showed that the state excise department earned at least Rs8,900 crore through the bidding process of these zones alone, which is about 26.7% higher than the reserve price set by the government.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s excise minister, is likely to reveal these details in press conference scheduled at 2pm on Wednesday. All the new retail liquor licensees have been asked to begin operations from November 17 this year. This will also mark the departure of the Delhi government from the retail business of liquor in the city as the entire segment will be privatised as mandated under the latest Delhi Excise Policy, 2021.Of the 32 zones, the draw for 20 zones was done on August 5 and 6. The remaining 12 were allotted this week. The excise department had kept a total reserve price for all the 32 zones at around Rs7,041 crore, whereas it actually managed to earn about Rs8,917.59 crore through bidding.Also Read | DDMA allows exhibitions in Delhi; schools to remain closed for classes up to 8Excise reports seen by HT showed that in terms of absolute amount, Zone 28 covering areas such as Dwarka-A, Deoli, Bhajanpura, Kardampuri and Quraish Nagar won the highest bid (Rs357 crore). But when analysed in terms of the highest profit earned by the government in terms of the base price, Zone 32, which is the Airport zone, topped the list as it went for Rs235 crore against the reserve price of Rs105 crore -- about 124% higher than the reserve price.In addition to the bid value for the 32 zones, the excise department will also earn about Rs650 crore from excise duty, import fees, value added tax and other licence fees, an excise official said on condition of anonymity. Another Rs900 crore to Rs1,000 crore is expected to come from licensing of new brands, distributor licenses, etc.This will mark a new record for the Capital, and push annual earnings growth rate from the current 5-7% to over 30% -- highlighting that the new excise policy, which aims to reform the city’s liquor business by improving user experience, cleaning up the liquor mafia and eradicating pilferage, is making an impact within two months of being adopted.The average revenue of the city over the past three years stood at around Rs5,500 crore annually, according to government data. The new policy was implemented on June 11. Under the new policy, retailers are free to decide the selling prices in a competitive environment, rather than an MRP being mandated by the government. Each zone will have at least 27 liquor vends — all of which will go to one successful bidder.The newly appointed retail licensees will have to build bigger and modern liquor vends from November 17. Customers will get the facility to walk in and choose their preferred liquor brands. Under the new policy, business hours have been fixed as from 10am to 10pm, while those at the airport may open round-the-clock.The policy, among other things, envisages five new super-premium liquor shops for high-value products. It includes a rule that any liquor shop in the city should be at least 500 square feet in size. It gets rid of the iron grilles at the front of most liquor vends in the Capital, and allows buyers to browse and purchase the brands of their choice. For this, the shops have to be spacious, well lit and air-conditioned to allow customers a walk-in experience and must be under camera surveillance. Shop owners will have to ensure that liquor sale and pick-up takes place properly inside the shop premises. It also allows home delivery of liquor in the Capital through websites and apps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-completes-liquor-license-allotment-in-all-zones-earns-rs-8900cr-101631692856041.html

15-09-2021||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal bans sale, use & storage of firecrackers in Delhi during Diwali over dangerous pollution levels||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced that there would be a “complete ban” on the usage, storage or sales of any type of firecrackers inside the city during the festival of Diwali. Further, Kejriwal also appealed to the traders in the national capital to not stock up on firecrackers in view of the ban and in order to avoid losses.He cited the dangerous pollution levels in Delhi as the reason behind the announcement. Taking to Twitter, the Delhi CM said, “In view of the dangerous condition of Delhi's pollution during Diwali for the past 3 years, like last year, a complete ban is being imposed on the storage, sale and use of all types of firecrackers. So that people's lives can be saved.” पिछले 3 साल से दीवाली के समय दिल्ली के प्रदूषण की खतरनाक स्तिथि को देखते हुए पिछले साल की तरह इस बार भी हर प्रकार के पटाखों के भंडारण, बिक्री एवं उपयोग पर पूर्ण प्रतिबंध लगाया जा रहा है। जिससे लोगों की जिंदगी बचाई जा सके।His appeal to the traders came in a subsequent tweet, in which he said, “In view of the seriousness of pollution after the stocking of firecrackers by traders last year, a complete ban was imposed late, which caused losses to the traders. It is an appeal to all the traders that this time in view of the complete ban, do not do any kind of storage.”पिछले साल व्यापारियों द्वारा पटाखों के भंडारण के पश्चात प्रदूषण की गंभीरता को देखत हुए देर से पूर्ण प्रतिबंध लगाया गया जिससे व्यापारियों का नुकसान हुआ था। सभी व्यापारियों से अपील है कि इस बार पूर्ण प्रतिबंध को देखते हुए किसी भी तरह का भंडारण न करें।However, the CM did not mention the exact time duration for which the cracker ban would be in place. Last year too, the Delhi government had banned all firecrackers, including green crackers, in the national capital. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had imposed a ban on firecrackers in Delhi and the adjoining National Capital Region (NCR) between November 9 and 30. Diwali was celebrated on November 14 last year. The NGT then extended this ban until Christmas and the new year in a bid to control pollution.The ban was announced last year with only a few days left for the festival due to which several traders in the city had expressed their concerns about incurring losses and asked the government to reconsider their decision. However, the government went ahead with the ban and also earmarked 800 open spaces in the city where people were allowed to burst only green crackers for two hours in the night.Earlier in 2017, the Supreme Court of India had temporarily banned the sale of crackers in 2017 before the festival of Diwali. However, after that, the court had allowed the sales of low-emission firecrackers in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-bans-sale-use-storage-of-firecrackers-in-delhi-during-diwali-over-dangerous-pollution-levels-101631690718523.html

He was arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002 and the special PMLA court remanded him to five days in ED custody. Earlier, ED had arrested the proprietor of Shree Maharani Steel, Dewesh Kumar, a resident of Bari Dariapur under Jamalpur police station area of Munger district. His wife Mitu Ravikar is a member of the Munger district board. ED started probing the case following an FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on February 9, 2018 following a complaint by senior deputy general manager (DGM) and vigilance officer of the Eastern Railway against Patna-based Shree Maharani Steels, unknown railway officials posted at Jamalpur and unknown private persons.According to the complaint dated October 16, 2017, Eastern Railway found misappropriation and irregularities in the disposal of condemned wagons and other excluded fittings from Dhobi Ghat siding of Eastern Railway in Jamalpur between 2013 and 2017.During a preventive check conducted by the vigilance department of the Eastern Railway, it was found that 100 condemned wagons and 3,220 released wheel sets along with other excluded fittings, having a net value of ₹34 crore approximately, were misappropriated by an outside private agency and auction purchaser Dewesh Kumar, also proprietor of Shree Maharani Steel in connivance with unknown railway officials and other unknown private persons.

15-09-2021||Patna||Bihar: ₹10 crore tax evasion on tobacco products detected in raids||The Commercial taxes department has detected tax evasion worth ₹10 crore in tobacco-related products by 26 firms across Bihar during surprise inspections on Tuesday and Wednesday. In total 39 firms, mainly dealers and distributors of commodities like cigarettes, paan masala and areca nut, were covered under the raids. The department officials said the inspections were based on data intelligence and inputs from field officers that a large number of firms dealing in cigarettes, paan masala , areca nut and bidis were evading taxes by not paying cess and also not reflecting value addition. “We have seized goods worth ₹15 crore and detected tax evasion worth ₹10 crore. The godowns of these firms engaged in clandestine trading have been sealed. Heavy penalty and other legal action would follow against the erring firms,” said Dr Pratima, commissioner cum secretary, Bihar commercial taxes department. Officials in the department aware of the developments said the firms engaged in tax evasion on tobacco products were bringing stocks illegally from states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam and not showing them in their books of accounts to evade taxes. Paan masala stocks were being brought in from UP and sold illegally without any books of records. “The dealers of paan masala, a product with a huge market, used to get consignments from UP clandestinely and keep it in their godowns from where it used to be channelized in the market. Some of the dealers caught in the raids have confessed to have brought in consignments of paan masala and other tobacco products from neighbouring states and also from Assam and Bengal by showing it as stocks of sugar, jaggery and other products just to evade taxes,” said one officer, engaged in the raids. One primary reason for Tobacco products to be considered an evasion-prone commodity is it falling in high tax category under the GST regime. Paan masala attracts 28% tax and 60% cess while cigarettes and tobacco fall in 28% tax and 160% cess category.“The dealers were mostly showing sale of cigarettes at lower price than retail rate to avoid cess payment,” said the officer quoted above. Dr Pratima said the generation of bills on eway portals was negligible by these firms. “These firms were evading taxes and cess in a big way. They were not showing value addition on goods and paying taxes through input tax credit. The inspections were carried out as part of the department’s regular monitoring of goods considered evasion-prone commodities,” she said. The commissioner also highlighted that the department in the last few months had seized 29 commercial vehicles laded with paan masala and detected tax evasion worth ₹2.96 crore. Commercial taxes is one of the main revenue generating departments of the state. In August, 2021, the GST collection in Bihar was ₹1037 crore, which was 7% higher than the corresponding period last year. In August 2020, the GST collection in the state was ₹967 crore, as per Press Information Bureau of Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-rs-10-crore-tax-evasion-on-tobacco-products-detected-in-raids-101631688235726.html
15-09-2021||Chandigarh||High court grants anticipatory bail to Punjabi singer Gurdas Maan||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday granted anticipatory bail to singer Gurdas Maan in a case of hurting religious sentiments. On September 8, a Jalandhar court had dismissed Maan’s plea for the same. Also read: Jalandhar court denies anticipatory bail to Punjabi singer Gurdas MaanMaan was booked under Sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code at Nakodar city police station in Jalandhar on August 26. The high court bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan granted the bail, observing that custody is not required as nothing is to be recovered. Gurdas Maan asked to join probe in week The bench said that the issue as to whether words used by the petitioner while performing on stage were deliberate/malicious so as to invoke Section 295A would be subject to investigation, Maan’s counsel Arshdeep Singh Cheema said. The court observed that Maan is a noted singer and is not a personality who will abscond from investigation. He has been asked to join investigation in a week. Maan’s remark at Nakodar fair triggered row During a religious fair in Nakodar on August 24, Maan had described Ladi Shah of Dera Baba Murad Shah as a descendant of the third Sikh master, Guru Amar Das. When a social media campaign started against his statement, Maan put out a video online, offering an apology for his statement. However, a case was registered against him. Maan has argued that no offence under Section 295A of the IPC can be said to be made out against him. To be booked under the section, it has to be demonstrated that an act has been committed with deliberate and malicious intention to outrage the religious feelings of any class of citizens and such act insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class. In the present case, the first information report (FIR) prima facie fails to disclose that the essential ingredients of offence were made out, it has been argued. The plea says the trial court judge apparently got “influenced by the show of public outcry, generated by some sections through a sustained campaign”. “As a humble Sikh and a sensitive citizen, the petitioner made a widely circulated public apology. His words ought to be interpreted in the total background of his lifelong devotion to Sikh Gurus and to the principles of Sikhism,” the plea says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-punjabi-singer-gurdas-maan-101631686855496.html

In 2020, the temple doors remained shut and all the rituals were banned. This year the temple has been allowed to receive pilgrims during the Pitri Paksha—beginning September 20--- but no one will be allowed without masks. Pilgrims have also been asked to carry negative Covid test and vaccination certificates by the temple management committee.Pitru Paksha is a lunar phase during which Hindus pray and make offerings to the souls of their ancestors for their peace. Since ancient times these rituals have been held at the Vishnupad temple at Gaya and also on the banks of Falgu River and Akshay Vat- the ancient age Peepal tree on the temple premises. Some of the rituals are also observed atop the Brahmayoni hills, Ramshila hills and Pretshila hills at Gaya. Every year, seven to nine hundred thousand Hindus from across the world visit Vishnupad temple during the Pitri Paksha period to perform Pind Dan rituals while the local administration makes special arrangements for their safety and security. This year the Pitri Paksha is to begin on September 20. “We will not stop anyone from observing the rituals at the temple. But officially, the Pitru Paksha Mela has not been allowed even this year. The chance of a third wave of Covid-19 pandemic is still there and so the administration cannot take the risk of allowing big gatherings,” Abhishek Kumar, district magistrate (DM), Gaya, said. The administration has planned to carry out Covid tests of the visitors, he added. Shambhu Lal Bitthal, the chairman of Vishnupad Prabandhkarini Samiti, said though the Pitru Paksha Mela has officially been cancelled even this year, pilgrims have started arriving. “In fact, those who need to perform the rituals as per the tradition, cannot stop coming here. Also, everything is open now, ranging from the Vishnupad temple to railways to air services,” he said. But the temple committee is also aware of the risks posed by mass gathering and is taking precautions to avoid Covid infections. “We have already made appeals to the pilgrims to carry their Covid test and vaccination papers. The Corona guidelines will be put on display at the entrance of the temple. The use of a mask and sanitiser is a must. We will also provide masks at the main entrance while a sanitisation machine has also been installed there,” he said. He added that the temple administration will be meeting Gaya DM to discuss arrangements to quarantine pilgrims if they are found to be infected in tests carried out by the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pind-daan-at-gaya-temple-during-pitru-paksh-to-take-place-amid-covid-protocols-101631681935534.html

15-09-2021||Bhopal||Medical courses to be also taught in Hindi medium in MP||Madhya Pradesh education department will teach medical and paramedical courses in Hindi medium, medical education minister said on Hindi Diwas on Tuesday.“An expert committee will be formed to decide how to introduce Hindi medium in MBBS course, nursing and other paramedical courses. It will be a joint effort of the medical education department and Atal Bihari Vajpayee Hindi University,” Vishwas Sarang said.Earlier in 2016, Atal Bihari Vajpayee Hindi University announced engineering and medical education in Hindi. It even introduced engineering in three streams in Hindi medium but only three students took admission in the first year, and later, the university discontinued the course, and the students were shifted to private colleges to continue their engineering in English medium.However, the university couldn’t start the MBBS course in Hindi as it didn’t get the permission from the Medical Council of India.Now, the state government has decided to take permission for the course and the syllabus will be prepared by Hindi university, said Khem Singh Dehariya, vice-chancellor, Hindi University.“The reason behind the failure of engineering in Hindi medium project was translation of engineering terminology in Hindi. But now, we have decided to retain the terminology of medical course from English language so that students will not find any difficulty in learning about medical education.”Earlier, Medical Education University in Jabalpur and Rajeev Gandhi Proudyogiki University in Bhopal allowed students to write exams in mixed Hindi-English language to promote learning and to end the barrier of language. The teachers have been asked to evaluate the answers on the basis of knowledge of the subject and not the language.Some in the Medical fraternity said that teaching medical science in Hindi will make budding doctors suffer.“The state government should teach Hindi to students but not at the cost of English. Medicine is a vast field and doctors attend seminars organised in different countries to know about new technologies and treatment plan. Hindi medium students will suffer and will not be able to upgrade themselves. This is not a good decision,” said Dr Anurag Gupta, state president of Indian medical Association’s student wing.The opposition also attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government for experimenting with students’ future.“Engineering in Hindi didn’t succeed, para-medical didn’t succeed, and now the state government wants to try one more time with MBBS courses. They shouldn’t experiment with the courses to spoil the future of students just to take their agenda ahead. Hindi is a good language and people should know it but by introducing Hindi in medical colleges they want to make the student disabled,” said JP Dhanopia, spokesperson, MP Congress Committee.However, BJP leaders said the move was only aimed to ensure that Hindi medium students do not get disadvantaged on the basis of language of learning.“This step is not only to promote a language but also to promote Hindi medium students, who face difficulties in learning things due to language barriers. They will get five years to learn English and understand it while gaining knowledge in their mother tongue. It is a very good step,” said Rajneesh Agrawal, spokesperson, BJP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/medical-courses-to-be-also-taught-in-hindi-medium-in-mp-101631676234671.html

Of the 22 districts, 14 have received deficient rainfall, while districts like Kapurthala have received twice the amount of rainfall. Meanwhile, the rainfall deficit in Fazilka, Mohali, Barnala and Mansa has been around 50%.Meteorologists say rainfall after September 20 could be harmful for the paddy crop as it will not only result in lodging of the crop, but will also curtail the crop maturity cycle.“There has been a serious mismatch in terms of distribution of rainfall in the region. Take Kapurthala for instance, it has received 672.5mm of rainfall so far, while the average rainfall recorded till the second week of September in the district remains 329mm. On the other hand, in districts like Fazilka, there has been a deficit of 53%. The average rainfall recorded in Fazilka remains 260.3mm in the monsoon season, but the bordering district has so far recorded only 123.4mm of rainfall,” said Dr Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head, department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, adding that mono-cropping could be the reason behind erratic rainfall.In a recently conducted study, the department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, had found that in the last 21 years, monsoon in Punjab remained mostly below normal. The average rainfall remained 19 to 59 % lower than normal in at least 10 years, while in nine years the average rainfall remained 19% below normal. The state recorded normal or above normal rainfall for just two years in this period.“This year too is no different. A similar rain patter was witnessed this year as well,” said Sidhu, adding that during the study it was found that the dip in rainfall was due to cloud formation over the region. Cloud formation is usually witnessed during the Kharif season (paddy season), when a huge amount of underground water is used for irrigation.“The formation of cloud cover for an extended period has an adverse effect on the growth and photosynthesis process of the crop” said Dr Sidhu.She said that decline in the rainfall especially in the Kandi areas of Gurdaspur, Ropar, SBS Nagar and some areas of Mohali, is a matter of concern. Earlier, the Kandi belt used to witness 1,100 to 1,200 mm rainfall during the monsoon season, but now these areas are not even witnessing 900mm rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monsoon-mismatch-rain-deficit-in-14-punjab-districts-deluge-in-amritsar-tarn-taran-101631658817703.html

15-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police chase after parole jumpers||Deepak Pandey(26) was convicted in a 2013 murder case and sentenced to life imprisonment years behind bars.In April 2020, he was released from Delhi’s Tihar jail as part of efforts to decongest the city’s cramped barracks. Pandey was asked to surrender in February-March 2021, when cases in the Capital were low. He never showed up.Police teams searched his registered address in outer Delhi’s Nangloi, then a relative’s place in Punjab’s Ludhiana. Both turned out to be false leads. Then, working on a tip, police travelled to a remote mountain village in Himachal Pradesh’s Solan district on September 8 , and found Pandey disguised as a factory worker.He isn’t the only one. Over the last two weeks, police have caught at least 40 such “parole jumpers” who are yet to surrender. Police have now formed separate teams to nab these people, coordinating with informers, raiding small towns, holding out inducements, and luring prisoners with money.“We have formed dedicated teams to trace such parole jumpers. We are also coordinating with the police forces of other states,” said a mid-level police officer from a police station in Dwarka.Shortly after the nationwide lockdown was clamped on March 25, Delhi’s three jails in Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini moved to release prisoners to enforce distancing and other Covid protocol inside prison, in line with the recommendations of a a high-powered committee appointed by the Delhi high court. At the time, the three prisons had at least 18000 prisoners.The prisoners were asked to surrender in February and March 2021. But according to jail records seen by HT, of the 5,556 released undertrial prisoners, 2,458 are yet to surrender. Of the 1,184 convicts, 94 are absconding.During the crushing second wave of the pandemic in May 2021, another 3,492 undertrial prisoners and 845 convicts were released, but they were not given any date to surrender.“As part of keeping check on crime and criminals, our police teams are on the lookout for such fugitives. Police are checking with informers to ensure that any prisoner, who has come out of prison, is not active in crime. We take stern action against such fugitives,” said deputy commissioner of police and Delhi Police spokesperson, Chinmoy Biswal,In some cases, police said it averted further crime by putting these “parole jumpers” back in jail. On September 10, another “parole jumper”, Sudhir Kumar Paswan, was arrested from the New Delhi railway station minutes after he stepped off the train from his village in Bihar -- thanks to an elaborate inducement scheme by the police.Paswan, a convict in a kidnapping and rape case, was supposed to surrender in March 2021 but instead skipped parole and went to Bihar.Trying to trace him, police teams posed as jail officers and called Paswan’s brother.“The brother was contacted and was told by the team that the jail authorities had sent a payment of ₹1.5 lakh to him as wages for the work he had done in jail. Sudhir returned to Delhi on being contacted by his brother and was arrested on September 9. He has been sent back to Mandoli jail,” said deputy commissioner of police(North) Anto Alphonse .To be sure, prisoners who work in different factories of Delhi’s Tihar jail receive daily wages, which is saved in their bank account.Some fugitives continued to commit crimes and were arrested more than once while on the run. On August 29, the crime branch arrested a man named Sunder Singh, who was released from Tihar in April 2020. Singh who did not surrender in February 2021 because he was involved in at least five robberies since last year, said police.He was arrested by Ghaziabad Police in April 2021 for a robbery at Sihani Gate but was released on bail within a month, resuming his crimes. Police said on August 29, they received tip off about Singh, and arrested him from Loni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-chase-after-parole-jumpers-101631658004062.html

Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, during his tenure as CM of the erstwhile state, had introduced ‘healing touch’ policy, she said. Presiding over a party meeting of senior functionaries at Surankote in Poonch, Mehbooba said, “This is your future, your land, your job, your life and dignity. There was a time when entire traffic used to be stopped for the movement of army convoys. But when Mufti Sahib became CM for the first time, he stopped this practice. There was an unethical practice of detaining people on suspicion. If a militant had eaten food at someone’s house, the security forces used to arrest them and beat up the family. Mufti Sahib stopped all these, but ironically the situation is again back to square one.” Sayeed had participated in the 2002 assembly elections and won 18 seats for the PDP. He went on to form a coalition government with the Indian National Congress and was sworn in as the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir for a term of three years. Talking to mediapersons later, Mehbooba reiterated her stand on abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A and said that her party (PDP) will continue to constitutionally explore all the possibilities to get the special status back.She also criticised the BJP government for the rising inflation, unemployment and bringing controversial farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-continue-to-explore-possibilities-to-get-j-k-s-spl-status-back-mehbooba-101631657677860.html

The woman’s father, an auto driver, said his daughter was being treated for mental health issues at a charitable hospital in Sarabha Nagar. On February 22, the hospital carried out a few tests, which found her positive for HIV. “We were shocked when we saw the report. We were told to visit the civil hospital and follow a course of medicines,” said the woman’s father.“The diagnosis shattered us. My son, wife and daughter could not sleep for days fearing social stigmatisation. My daughter’s mental health declined further due to the stress caused by the diagnosis,” he said. When they sought treatment at the civil hospital, the doctors carried out the test again and found that the victim was HIV negative. When the patient’s father raised the matter with the private hospital, they allegedly told the complainant to return the report. “I refused and decided to pursue the matter and have been visiting the civil surgeon’s office for seven months. Earlier, the matter could not be pursued due to the pandemic, later the employee’s strike sent the matter to the back burner. I was asked to appear on Tuesday and have sought damages for the mental agony caused to my family due to the incorrect report,” said the patient’s father. Assistant civil surgeon Dr Vivek Kataria said the complaint has been marked to the senior medical officer (SMO) of the civil hospital. “She will constitute a board of doctors who will conduct an inquiry. In case the hospital is found guilty, a case will be recommended to the district administration for taking necessary action,” Kataria said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-private-hospital-wrongly-diagnosis-26-year-old-with-hiv-101631657497976.html

15-09-2021||Chandigarh||Jai Ram-Nadda meeting fuels HP cabinet rejig speculation||Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Tuesday made a sudden dash to Delhi to meet the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command, fuelling speculations of impending cabinet reshuffle. Thakur met BJP’s national president Jagat Prakash Nadda in the capital with party’s Himachal chief Suresh Kashyap and organisational secretary Pawan Rana accompanying him along with state in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna and co-incharge Sanjay Tandon. Their discussion lasted for nearly three hours. This was HP chief minister’s second visit to New Delhi within a week. He had last visited the capital on September 8 to invite President Ram Nath Kovind for a special assembly session. He had then also met few Union ministers, including finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The discussions in Delhi primarily focused on the preparations and the BJP’s prospects in the upcoming bypolls. The byelections are due for HP’s three assembly segments — Jubbal- Kotkhai, Fatehpur and Arki — and Mandi Lok Sabha seat that fell vacant after the demise of MP Ram Swaroop Sharma, who was found hanging at his residence in New Delhi. The byelections are likely to take place after the festive season. It has been learnt that party’s top brass discussed the possibility of cabinet reshuffle. It is likely that CM Thakur would drop a minister from Kangra district and induct a new one, while two more ministers are expected to be replaced. Jal Shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur is likely to be fielded from Mandi. The BJP leaders also discussed in detail the decisions taken at the core group meetings to accommodate dedicated party workers and leaders in the party as well as the government. CM Thakur is likely to appoint chairmen and vice-chairmen of several boards and corporations as well. During the meeting, better coordination between the Centre and state government was also sought. Speaking to the media in New Delhi, CM Thakur said during his previous trip, he had invited President of India to visit the state. “As Himachal has completed 50 years of its statehood, we have called a special session of the state legislative assembly on September 17 which will be addressed by the President,” he added. He said we were here for a followup on important projects being implemented in Himachal. “We had met Union finance minister, Union health minister and Union minister for civil aviation to discuss the progress of those projects,” he added. “Today, I am here to attend an important meeting of the party. This meeting was fixed few days ago,” the CM said. “I will return tomorrow and would welcome the President of India in Himachal on September 17,” he added. Meanwhile, Himachal Congress president Kuldeep Singh Thakur said in Shimla that the party was likely to replace chief minister Jai Ram Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jai-ram-nadda-meeting-fuels-hp-cabinet-rejig-speculation-101631657077581.html

15-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC fails to keep rabid dogs on tight leash||Rabid dogs are emerging as a pestilent issue in the city, and have become a sore point for the municipal corporation, which incidentally has been unable to trace the diseased dog that bit around a dozen people in the areas near the cremation ground at Civil Lines three days ago.The incident was not a one-off case, as four rabid dogs have been caught in different areas of the city over the last year. One diseased dog was caught near the Gill road grain market last week. The diseased dogs had died at the sterilisation centre of the Haibowal dairy complex. A postmortem had revealed that the canines were suffering from rabies, a fatal viral disease that spreads to people from the saliva of infected animals.With a large number of dog bite cases being reported in the city on a daily basis, authorities have appealed the residents to be wary and report any dogs suspected to be suffering from the fatal virus.Not all rabid dogs are caught. Significantly, an 11-year-old boy from Jaspal Bangar village succumbed to rabies in the last week of July, while a five-year-old girl who succumbed in Sarabha Nagar in October 2018, had exhibited symptoms typical of rabies before her death.“Rabid dogs are certainly a cause of concern. On September 12, the department was notified about the presence of a rabid dog near the cremation ground in the civil lines area. Teams were dispatched to catch the dog and are still making rounds in the area. It is suspected that the dog might have succumbed to the disease. Announcements are being made in the area so that residents remain alert,” said MC veterinary official Dr HS Dhalla.Social activist, Keemti Rawal, said panic has gripped residents after the dog bit a dozen residents, including two nurses. Do not panic, but beware: Ludhiana MC vet  Dhalla said, “Residents should not panic. However, as there is no cure to the disease, residents are appealed to take precautions and report any suspected diseased canines to the civic body. Rabid dogs attack people, causing the disease to spread.”“Those bitten, must immediately get the anti-rabies vaccine. Those bitten on the throat or on the mouth should also get the anti-rabies serum. The vaccine is available free of cost at the civil hospital. The teams carrying out sterilisation are also checking strays for viral symptoms,” said Dr Dhalla.Rabies-free cityAround 50,000 dogs have been sterilised to reduce the population of stray dogs and that the capacity of the sterilisation centre has also been increased to expedite the process.The civic body is also working on the ‘Rabies-Free City’ project wherein free anti-rabies vaccines will be given to the stray dogs in the city. Dhalla said, “The finance and contracts committee (F and CC) has already given approval for the project and the department is working to rope in the animal husbandry department for administering the vaccine to dogs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-fails-to-keep-rabid-dogs-on-tight-leash-101631654138225.html

The leadership of the party will have to think something. Chawla ji, think of something. The leadership of the party is in your hands, my words may sound bitter to you, but there is truth in this.”He continues, “I am a true soldier of the party, I feel sad when my fellow soldiers leave. You would not be a soldier, you are a general, the strength in the army comes from the soldiers.”In response, Chawla reportedly stated, “Babla ji, if I want to double the army of Congress today, I have some leaders of BJP and AAP in my contact who want to come to Congress, but the condition is that they need tickets (for municipal elections). You tell me should I deny tickets to 12 senior Congress leaders and induct these people in Congress?”To this Babla retorts, “Chawla ji, instead of bringing people from outside, take care of the house. You are the head of the party. It hurts when companions leave. You would be hurt too.”Talking to HT, Babla said, “I am not against the leadership, but the leadership must think twice why old Congressmen left the party.” Chawla, however, didn’t respond to repeated calls.In the last one month, several current and former office bearers and workers of Congress have left the party including former party chief Pardeep Chhabra.

15-09-2021||Chandigarh||Minorities 100% secure under Modi govt, says NCM chief Lalpura||Minorities are 100% secure under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and the narrative that hate incidents have gone up during the present dispensation is “wrong”, National Commission for Minorities chairperson Iqbal Singh Lalpura said on Tuesday. Lalpura, who took over as the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) chairperson last week, asserted that his priority would be to dispel “false narratives” fuelling insecurity among minorities. His remarks come amid vociferous criticism of the government by opposition parties, including the Congress, and several civil society members who have argued that the hate incidents targeting minorities have gone up under the BJP-led rule at the Centre. There have also been reports of incidents of mob violence recently in various parts of the country with the victims belonging to a minority community, including a Muslim scrap dealer who was allegedly threatened and forced to chant ‘’Jai Shri Ram’’ by two men at a village in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain district. Lalpura claimed that looking at statistics, the figures have come down now with respect to incidents like rioting, murder and lynching. “Look at the past, we used to hear of riots in Aligarh when the BJP government was not there. We have heard of riots elsewhere also when the BJP government was not there. I am here as a constitutional person...and when we look at the statistics, the figures have come down -- (be it) rioting, murder, lynching,” Lalpura told PTI in an interview. “But cases have happened and cases are happening and that is why we need the National Commission for Minorities,” the former IPS officer said. On the narrative that hate incidents have gone up, Lalpura said this is a “wrong narrative”. Lalpura said that as NCM chairperson his priority would be to look after the interests of the minorities and ensure that no injustice is done. “At the same time, I have to see that false narratives are not created. We all are Indians and we have to work to ensure the development of the country, security of all people, and that everyone gets justice,” he said. Asked about the farmers’ issue and Sikh community being targeted by some sections over the farm laws protests, the NCM chief, virtually backing the laws, said the Centre had to intervene because the states did not develop industry and avenues to sell produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/minorities-100-secure-under-modi-govt-says-ncm-chief-lalpura-101631651617868.html

He was earlier in news after his followers clashed with locals over harvesting of wheat crop at Boothgarh village in Majri in April this year.The commission took suo moto note of the case after it came across a Twitter link to a video of Bajinder’s activities. A boy is seen crying in the video and the body language of both the pastor and the child seem unusual, the commission noted.

The commission has asked the DC to submit a report within seven days. The letter was originally sent to the Chandigarh DC, but as the area falls under Mohali district, it was forwarded to Dayalan. The DC said Kharar subdivisional magistrate Akash Bansal will conduct the inquiry and submit a report within seven days.Church of Glory and Wisdom president Avtar Singh called the allegations “totally baseless”. “Some people are trying to malign the image of our church. We will give a proper reply with evidence to the inquiry officer and the child rights commission. ,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-preacher-in-trouble-for-using-children-in-superstitious-videos-101631648797169.html

The country belongs to all. No remarks should be made that harm the country," Singh, a confidant of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, told reporters when asked for his reaction to the BJP leader's comments.In this context, he also took a swipe at JMM leader and Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren for his remarks allegedly aimed at Bhojpuri and Magahi-speaking people of the state. Everybody has a right to settle in whichever part of the country they like, he said.Addressing a programme in Kushinagar on Sunday, Adityanath had alleged that people did not get rations before 2017 like they do now."Because then, people who say 'abba jaan' used to digest the rations. The rations of Kushinagar used to go to Nepal and Bangladesh. Today, if anybody tries to swallow the rations meant for poor people, he will land in jail," the chief minister had said.'Abba jaan' is the Urdu term for father.In his press conference, the JD(U) president, a Lok Sabha MP from Munger, also played down the decision of his party, the biggest BJP ally, to send its senior leader K C Tyagi to a rally being organised in Jind on September 25 by INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, seen as part of efforts for forming a non-BJP, non-Congress front."We are strongly part of the NDA (BJP-led alliance)," he said, and dismissed talks about a third front, saying his party will attend the rally as it is being organised to mark the birth anniversary of Devi Lal, a towering third front leader of his era.Singh also cited Kumar's old association with Chautala.Chautala had invited the Bihar chief minister, who has expressed his inability to attend it.The JD(U) leader also named former MLA Khiru Mahto and Gulab Mahto as the party's president and vice-president respectively for its Jharkhand unit.Singh said the JD(U) used to be a strong party in the state and added that the appointments are part of its effort to strengthen the regional party in different parts of India.The party will also strongly fight the upcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and Manipur, he said, adding that it would like to be a part of the BJP-led alliance and fight on its own if the tie-up does not happen.JD(U) sources said the party is likely to organise its national executive meeting in Uttar Pradesh in November and its office-bearers meeting in Manipur as it works to tone up its organisational machinery in the two states.

It will also analyse the pattern in the other states where such policy has been formulated,” said a UT official. Earlier, the UT transport department had also prepared a draft EV policy. But later this year, the CREST was entrusted with finalising the policy.Under the proposed policy, in order to incentivise buying of electric vehicles, the registration fee, road tax and 50% MC parking charges are likely to be waived off.The policy also envisages making registration of private and commercial e-vehicles easier and quicker by offering “immediate online registration.” Registration will be allowed for two, three, and four-wheelers retrofitted with electric motors.“The aim of the policy is to encourage e-vehicles to reduce pollution in the city by bringing down emissions from the transport sector,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/electric-vehicle-policy-in-chandigarh-three-member-panel-to-fine-tune-final-draft-101631647419027.html

But when his wife Sujata Singh, who works in a book marketing agency, asked him to try his luck in digital marketing, he started a book marketing company. He registered the company under the Goods and Service Tax (GST) Act to avail its benefits. At present, Singh earns around ₹75,000 a month. Gaurav Sharma of Greater Noida has a similar story. Before the pandemic, he was working in a packaging company. After losing his job in June last year, he opened an online stationery store and registered it under the GST Act. Nowadays, Sharma earns at least ₹50,000 per month through his online firm. Despite a major slowdown in commercial activities across the country during the Covid-19 pandemic, over 22,000 firms were registered under the Goods and Service Tax (GST) Act in Gautam Budh Nagar district, a significantly higher number than previous years. Manavendra Pratap Singh, additional commissioner of state GST in Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the number of firms registered under the GST Act in the district has increased every year. “While in the fiscal 2018-19, the number of registered firms in the district was 11,664, it was 14,613 in the next fiscal 2019-20. While as many as 15,472 firmed were registered under the GST Act during the fiscal 2020-21, over 6,812 firms were registered in the current financial year 2021-22 far,” he said. He said that to encourage more entrepreneurs to register their firms the GST Act, the state government has eased the application and approval processes. “We are providing business owners with GST registration numbers within a week after they upload the mandatory documents on the department’s portal. We have registered several small and medium firms, set up by people who lost their jobs due to the pandemic. As per our records, these firms are doing good work now,” he said. Singh also said that the owners of all these registered firms have accidental insurance coverage of ₹10 lakh. “Earlier, this insurance scheme was being run by different insurance companies. But now, the state GST department immediately provides the entrepreneurs’ dependants with the insurance amount in case of their accidental death. It is also one of the major reasons that more and more entrepreneurs are turning up for GST registration,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/over-22k-firms-registered-under-gst-act-after-covid-outbreak-in-gb-nagar-101631647417474.html

We do not have dengue cases in clusters; they are scattered across the district. Our teams are conducting fogging in about 50 nearby houses whenever a dengue case is being reported from a particular area,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. He added that in case more cases are reported from a particular area, teams take up infection control activities for about 500 nearby houses or to the extent where they feel proper sanitisation has been done. Officials said rapid response teams, response team from integrated disease surveillance program, a team led by a local medical officer and sanitisation teams act within hours of a dengue case being reported from a particular area. “With the containment approach, we are ensuring that there are no cluster of cases. Our teams are taking efforts to break the chain of infection. Moreover, we have also initiated sampling of symptomatic patients at our IDSP laboratory in MMG District Hospital. Of the 550 symptomatic patients tested so far, there are 16 patients who have tested positive for dengue. The positivity rate is on the lower side, at about 3%,” said Gupta. The district also reported 11 malaria cases till Tuesday against 13 such cases in 2020, 142 in 2019, 150 in 2018, 293 in 2017 and 128 in 2016. Experts said utmost precaution is the need of the hour as dengue can also lead to fatalities. “Heavy rainfall, and the resultant waterlogging that has been plaguing the district in the last one month , has led to an increase in dengue cases. Residents must ensure water doesn’t accumulate in their houses or in the premises where larvae can breed,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). The health department has also come up with dengue wards in the district hospitals to treat patients. “The cases of dengue and viral fever are on rise. We receive around 100-150 patients suffering from fever daily in our outpatient department. We have reserved 20 beds in the dengue ward and so far, only one patient has been admitted and also recovered,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dengue-cases-at-all-time-high-since-2017-in-ghaziabad-officials-resort-to-containment-approach-101631647178806.html

The couple paid ₹1.32 crore as stamp duty for the deal. The 5 BHK (bedroom-house-kitchen) bungalow, spread across 9,000 square metres (sq m) of land in a village called Mapgaon, will be the couple’s second home. According to the documents scanned by real estate analytics and research firm Zapkey.com, the couple purchased the property through their firms. The buyers are KA Enterprises LLP – where Padukone is a partner – and RS Worldwide Entertainment Private Limited, where Singh is a director. The property has been purchased from Rajesh S Jaggi. According to Sandeep Reddy, co-founder, Zapkey.com, the deal signifies the growing demand for second homes. “We are seeing people buying their second home in recent times within the vicinity of Mumbai. Due to Covid-19, people look at a second home as an alternative and the work-from-home culture has given a boost to this sector,” said Reddy. Several celebrities such as Shah Rukh Khan, Anushka Sharma and her husband Virat Kohli and Rahul Khanna have their pads in Alibag, which has been rivalling the Khandala-Lonavala belt for weekend breaks. Several top builders, such as Hiranandani, are selling plots at Alibag. The roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) ferry service which originates from Ferry Wharf at Mazgaon and Mandwa has been a runaway hit as it also carries vehicles. This is apart from the ferry services from Gateway of India to Alibag, where one can reach within 45 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/deepika-padukone-ranveer-singh-purchase-bungalow-at-alibag-for-rs22-crore-101631647177323.html
15-09-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali MC to act against encroachments in markets||The Mohali municipal corporation has divided the area under its jurisdiction into four zones to tackle encroachments in markets. While chairing the civic body’s monthly General House meeting on Tuesday, mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu said the area inspectors heading the teams will be responsible to get rid of encroachments within one month. “If they fail to do so, they will be charge-sheeted or suspended,” he said. A similar order was passed by the then MC commissioner Bhupinder Pal Singh in September 2019, when the city was divided into three zones. However, enforcement remained poor and no action was taken against any of the officials in six months before a countrywide lockdown brought things to a standstill in March 2020. For years, the MC has failed to stop illegal vendors from operating in main markets of the city. The worst-hit are Phases 7, 3B1, 3B2, 9, 10, and 11, where several vendors have set up their kiosks, selling bags, perfumes, jewellery, footwear, apparels and food items, leaving little space in the corridors and parking areas. The issue has been debated several times in the General House meetings, but to no avail. Former deputy mayor Manjit Singh Sethi said the number of vendors has gone up in the past three years. “Encroachment drives in the past remained an eyewash as there was collusion between MC officials and vendors,” he said. The four new teams will be headed by area inspectors Anil Kumar (Zone 1), Varinder Kumar (Zone 2), Harmesh Singh (Zone 3) and Ashok Kumar (Zone 4). The mayor said he is hopeful that they will be able to tackle the encroachment menace. On the MC enforcement wing having only two vehicles to cover the entire city, the mayor said only one team will go on a round at one time. Meanwhile, an enforcement wing official, who did not wish to be named, said the teams are often hassled by frequent disputes with shopkeepers and vendors, and police presence would aid their efforts. Mohali MC House approves fire station at Sector 78The Mohali municipal corporation General House also approved a second fire station in Sector 78 to be built at a cost of ₹2.92 crore. The House unanimously passed resolutions mainly on the policy of taxi stands and the policy of providing green belts for maintenance. A few councillors asked for a reduction in taxi fee.Apart from this, various development resolutions worth ₹19 crore have been passed including road works, paver block works, zebra crossings, painting of centre verges, laying of centre lines and some other development works. All these development works are mainly in Sectors 76 to 80.A sum of ₹2.64 has been earmarked for the purchase of boots, gloves, uniforms, rehris, trolleys and other items for the nearly 1000 employees to be recruited for the manual cleaning by the Mohali Municipal Corporation. This resolution was passed through table item.In addition to this, another important resolution has been passed to outsource the work of mechanical sweeping of city roads. Under this, wall-to-wall sweeping of A roads of the city as well as B roads will now be done mechanically; ₹37 crore will be spent for three years. Some opposition councillors made allegations of discrimination against their wards regarding which mayor said that the work of all the wards was being done with full transparency and no one was being discriminated against. He said that if there was any work of a councillor in a ward, he or she could meet him directly at any time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mc-to-act-against-encroachments-in-markets-101631647118074.html

The figures are in line with the centralised CoWin portal.As per the data provided till 5pm, 7,90,102 (100.01%) beneficiaries have received their first dose and 3,88,054 (49.12%) are fully vaccinated. The eligible population in the district is 7,90,088.Chief medical officer Dr Kuldeep Singh said, “People are already familiar that other than the vaccine, there is no other option to win against the pandemic. I would urge those who are yet to receive their second dose and have covered the prescribed gap to take it without delay. Department is also alerting them through calls.”A three-day mega vaccination camp is underway in the district and more than 38,000 doses have been administered in two days at over 200 sites. To cover more population, department staffers were seen making announcements at chowks and other busy public sites on Monday.However, there has been a marginal disparity in terms of percentage figures of the CoWin portal and those collected by the health department. Ambala, the home constituency of health minister Anil Vij, has rarely faced a shortage of vaccine for a day.DC Vikram said, “I will get it checked.” Meanwhile, an official, who didn’t wish to be named, said that to rectify the error, the department has started doing online portal entries on the spot, instead of registering entries first that are later entered on the portal. Also, due to its geographical location, residents of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and various districts of Haryana usually get their vaccine dose here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-vaccine-ambala-achieves-100-target-101631646881870.html
15-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad allows walk-ins for second dose of Covid vaccine||With the increase in the supply of Covid-19 vaccine, officials have now facilitated walk-in registration for beneficiaries scheduled to take their second dose, cutting down on the need to go online and booking a slot to take the jab. According to figures available on the Co-Win portal, Ghaziabad district administered total 23,49,380 doses till 8.30pm on Tuesday, which includes 5,53,037 second doses. Officials said the decision to facilitate walk-in registrations for beneficiaries scheduled to take their second dose was taken by district magistrate RK Singh, who issued a statement to this effect on Tuesday evening. “Now, beneficiaries, who wish to take their second dose, can walk in to any Covid vaccination centre and take the jab. They can also come after booking online slots. The decision has been taken up to increase the second dose coverage as we have been allocated more Covid-19 vaccines,” said chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar. Till August end, Ghaziabad received around 16,000 doses per day, which has now been scaled up to about 25,000 doses. “We are also trying to increase the allocation of vaccines we get from the state. This will help us vaccinate more beneficiaries. The walk-in facility is available for beneficiaries both in the 45+ age group and the 18-45 group,” said the CMO. In terms of overall vaccination coverage, Lucknow stands at the top with total 32,24,019 doses administered till Tuesday evening, followed by Ghaziabad.

The district administered 129,884 doses between August 14 to August 20; 136,050 from August 21 to August 27 and 135,660 from August 28 to September 3. More than 200,500 doses were administered from September 4 to September 10. “We feel that it is vital to increase the second dose coverage so that people are better protected in case a third wave of Covid-19 breaks out. Walk-in will ease issues for beneficiaries as many a times, they cannot book online slots,” said Dr V B Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). Starting August 14, the UP government also declared Saturday as ‘second dose day’ and directed that it will be reserved only for beneficiaries, who wish to take their second dose.

15-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai-Goa highway work can get over by March ’22 if we get funds: NHAI||The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has assured the Bombay high court (HC) of completing the road-widening work of the Mumbai-Goa Highway by March 2022 – well before the December 2022 deadline – provided the State Bank of India (SBI) lends an additional ₹200 crore at the earliest for the project. The affidavit stated the highway was in a motorable condition before the onset of monsoon. However, due to heavy rainfall and traffic, potholes, patches and water stagnation had developed on certain sections of the highway, which was being repaired immediately. The affidavit was filed by NHAI project director Prashant Fegade in response to the public interest litigation (PIL) by advocate Owais Pechkar, a resident of Chiplun and a regular user of the highway. Fegade submitted before the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni that it was complying with HC’s July directions to provide an update on the status of the project. The affidavit, apart from responding to Pechkar’s petition for the expeditious completion of the road-widening project, also responded to his plea for fixing and repairing of potholes on National Highway-66, which is prone to accidents. Pechkar’s petition stated that in the past 10 years, accidents had claimed 2,442 lives due to potholes and ongoing road-widening work. The bench had directed the authorities to put in place safety measures to avert mishaps. While responding to the contention of ‘slow progress’ of the project, the affidavit stated that due to financial constraints, the authority had resorted to a one-time fund infusion (OTFIS) and had managed to assign ₹540 crore for the project. The amount to be raised through lenders was pending. The affidavit stated that if SBI and other lenders would extend a further ₹200 crore the project could be completed by March 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaigoa-highway-work-can-get-over-by-march-22-if-we-get-funds-nhai-101631646879574.html

15-09-2021||Mumbai||Slum dwellers can’t insist for on-site rehabilitation: Bombay high court||In an order that may have far reaching consequences for the state capital, the Bombay high court (HC) has held that slum dwellers cannot insist on getting rehabilitated on site or in the vicinity and dismissed a petition filed by residents of a notified slum in Shivajinagar, Pune that will be demolished in order to make way for a metro line. The order was delivered by a division bench comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni last week, but the 11-page document was uploaded late Monday. The Pune metro line between Vanaz and Ramwadi stations is expected to pass through the Kamgar Putala slum, a notified slum pocket home to 1,264 hutments. Three residents moved the HC after the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) issued an ultimatum on May 21 asking them to vacate their hutments within 10 days. At present, part of the slum stands demolished and work on the metro line is progressing. “At the outset, we may observe that the petitioners who have encroached cannot elevate their protection to such an extent that such slum dwellers have to be rehabilitated either on the same land or be provided a permanent alternate accommodation within the vicinity,” a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said, dismissing the petition filed by Abdul Majid Patvekari and two others on July 15. The HC bench expressed “grave doubts” over the policy of the state government “which rewards the encroachers of the public land by a free of cost accommodation.” “In our opinion, such policies qua the Government land not only violate the principles of equality but certainly falls foul of the doctrine of public trust,” the bench said. On their part, the petitioners claimed that they had the right to be rehabilitated on site as they are eligible and protected residents of the slum. Under the Maharashtra Slums Act (1995), occupants of notified slums can form a society and appoint a developer for implementing slum rehabilitation schemes on their own, which would need the approval of the SRA. All slum dwellers settled on public lands before January 1, 2000, should be treated as eligible for rehabilitation and should be protected, according to the act. Housing minister Satej Patil said that the state government would study the order before undertaking further steps. “We will study to order as our aim is not to cause inconvenience to the slum dwellers as well as boost the slum revamp process. After that we will take further action,” he said. The petitioners said that they came to know about the metro line passing through their slum pocket, in 2019. Following this, they made representations to various authorities to realign the line so that the slum dwellers were rehabilitated at the site and did not have to be shifted to distant places. They asked in their petition to be rehabilitated in the balance land after the completion of the metro line construction. Alternatively, they prayed for rehabilitation within a radius of two km of the slum. The HC dismissed the plea, observing that the right of slum dwellers to get rehabilitated cannot be stretched to the extent to claim rehabilitation on site. “In our clear opinion, any encroachment on public land at the threshold ought not to be tolerated and prompt action is required to be taken to remove such encroachment,” the bench said. Experts said that the judgment would likely have far-reaching consequences in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, where similar infrastructure projects were also held up on account of the rehabilitation of slum residents. “Our urban centres face a scarcity of land and we cannot offer rehabilitation nearby due to various constraints. This will speed the pace of projects,” said a senior Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. According to the SRA, Mumbai has around 6.2 million citizens residing in 1.25 million slums. Till date, residents of only 210,000 slums have been rehabilitated. “The judgement will offer flexibility in rehabilitation and housing schemes will get boost,” an officer of the SRA department said on condition of anonymity. Housing rights activist Bilal Khan of Ghar Bachao-Ghar Banao Andolan said slum dwellers are opposed to shifting to far off places because of livelihood opportunities. Shifting to far off places, Khan said, also affects the education of their children. “Rehabilitation camps mostly comprise only housing and are not only located outside city limits, but also lack necessary facilities like hospitals, schools, markets etc.,” he said. In the 11-page order, the HC also expressed a dire need of undertaking an audit of encroached government lands or lands belonging to public authorities. “As to how many such lands have vanished due to encroachment and as to what steps have been taken to preserve such lands are questions which need to be answered to “we the people” and accountability fixed for negligence in this regard.”“We hope that the Government awakens on such issues before it is too late and restores all the encroached Government lands for the benefit of public and strictly to be used for public purposes. This would certainly require a genuine political will and consciousness towards larger public benefit,” the order read. Deepak Goradia, President, Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (MCHI- CREDAI) welcomed the order. “It will give boost to slum rehabilitation schemes and even the slum dwellers will be benefitted by new homes,” he said.“We have witnessed in the past how slum dwellers held up the Airport land and metro projects insisting on in situ rehabilitation. The projects suffered immensely and delayed increasing the costs considerably. The verdict clears the hurdles,” said Gulam Zia, executive director, Knight Frank India, a real estate consultancy firm.

15-09-2021||Chandigarh||Sonepat DC holds parleys with farmers to clear national highway||Following the observations of the Supreme Court that the central and state governments should coordinate to ensure that inter-state roads and national highways do not remain blocked due to farmers’ protest, the Sonepat district administration on Tuesday held parleys with the protesting farmers to clear the blockade at Kundli-Singhu border.Officials said during the meeting, Sonepat deputy commissioner Lalit Siwach told the farmers’ representatives that Kundli-Singhu border on NH-44 be cleared to give way to the common man.An official spokesperson said the DC told the farmers that the construction work of NH-44 under the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has also been hampered for long-time due to the farmers’ protest and is causing inconvenience to people.With completion of the construction work of the national highway, the general public will be at ease. In such a situation, if the farmers give way on one side of the road, then the construction of the national highway will be completed soon.On request of the DC, farmers’ representatives have assured to give a positive reply in this matter, the spokesperson said.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Doaba’s leader Manjit Singh Rai, who lead the farmers’ union with the Sonepat administration, said they will discuss the matter with senior Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders pertaining to opening the highway near Singhu border.“The final decision will be taken by Samyukt Kisan Morcha senior leaders. We have appraised the same to the district administration,” he added.An apex court bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, in its August 23 order, had said that the solution lay in hands of the central and the state governments concerned. The bench said they should coordinate to ensure that if the protests are on, at least the inter-state roads and national highways are not blocked in any manner whatsoever so that to-and-fro on those roads does not cause great inconvenience to other persons who use those roads.A Noida-based woman, Monicca Agarwaal, had petitioned the apex court contending that though she stays and works in Noida she has to travel to Delhi as she is in marketing job.Aggarwal told the court that she is a single parent and has some medical issues. And it has become a nightmare to travel to Delhi where it is taking two hours instead of normal 20 minutes.She contended that despite multiple directions passed by the apex court to keep the to-and-fro passage clear, the same still does not happen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sonepat-dc-holds-parleys-with-farmers-to-clear-national-highway-101631646516961.html

15-09-2021||Mumbai||Centre seeks clarification on appointment of non-IAS officers as civic heads in Maha||The Central government has sought a clarification from the Maharashtra government over the appointment of non-IAS (Indian Administrative Service) officers to head municipal corporations in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The state government has appointed non-IAS officers in Mira-Bhayandar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur and Panvel municipal corporations despite the Centre’s 2018 diktat to appoint IAS officers in emerging civic bodies.The clarification has been has sought by the department of personnel in a letter to chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, dated September 8. The letter has also stated that appointment of any non-IAS cadre officers on posts meant for IAS cadre by the state government, without obtaining the prior approval of DoPT, amounts to violation of Rule 9 of IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954. “The Maharashtra government is requested to furnish comments on posting of non-cadre officers on cadre posts and to furnish details of all officers occupying the cadre poses in the state,” the letter, accessed by HT, read. On September1, HT had carried a report on how the state flouted the Centre’s norms while appointing commissioners to head Mira-Bhayander, Bhiwandi-Nizampur municipal corporations a few months ago. DoPT, by issuing a notification on June 15, 2018, stated that D-class municipal corporations in the list of civic bodies should be mandatorily headed by an IAS officer. Six of the nine corporations (Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Kalyan-Dombivli and Panvel) in MMR were in the list, while the remaining three (Mumbai, Thane and Navi-Mumbai) are already in DoPT’s list that mandates the state to appoint IAS officers to head these civic bodies. In case of non-availability of an IAS officer, the state can appoint a non-IAS but not for a period of more than three months. Incumbent Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation’s (MBMC) commissioner Dilip Dhole was personal secretary to Eknath Shinde. Shinde heads the state urban development department (UDD), which appoints officers for smaller civic bodies. The appointments of non-IAS officers in MBMC and Bhiwandi-Nizampur civic body were done by removing IAS officers, who held MBBS degrees and were deliberately appointed when the Covid-19 was at peak last year.An official from the general administration department, which appoints IAS officers, said that UDD had not informed them while appointing non-IAS officers for these bodies. Former Mira-Bhayander corporator Sanjay Pange had complained to Governor BS Koshyari about the flouting of the Centre’s diktat. The Governor, too, had on August 27, sought clarification from the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-seeks-clarification-on-appointment-of-non-ias-officers-as-civic-heads-in-maha-101631646396883.html

In the first phase, elections to gram panchayats are proposed to be held and thereafter in the second phase, elections for panchayat samiti and zila parsihad.The response has been submitted in a bunch of petitions in which the government move to amend Haryana Panchayati Raj law, which bars women from contesting on general seats has been challenged.The law was passed in December 2020 in state assembly providing 50% reservation to the women in panchayati raj institutions (PRIs). It was notified in April 2021.The plea alleges the amendment restricts women candidates from contesting from odd numbered wards which are otherwise open or general wards. Hence, it is discriminatory.There are also some petitions against reservation roster to some categories and the manner in which reservation for backward classes is to be carved out.The HC has sought response to the government’s move from various parties by October 10. There are a dozen petitions on the panchayat elections pending before the HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/want-to-hold-panchayat-polls-haryana-to-hc-101631646098171.html
15-09-2021||Chandigarh||HC allows Haryana to proceed further with recruitment on 3,206 posts by HSSC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has allowed Haryana to proceed with recruitment of 3,206 persons under the ministry of skilled development and physical training on regular basis.The high court bench of justice GS Sandhawalia acted on an application filed by the state government seeking vacation of stay imposed in December 2019.The recruitment for 3,206 posts in a dozen odd categories were to be carried out by Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) for the posts of engineering drawing instructor , computer operator and programming assistant instructor, employability skill instructor, computer instructor among others.The stay was granted on pleas from some contractual employees who had argued that on account of the Regularisation Policy of 2014, they could not get favourable consideration as three year period of service was required. They are contractual employees who had served for more than 11 years and thus, in view of an apex court order of 2018 in which protection was given by the Supreme Court in some categories, they are entitled for the benefit of status quo.The HC observed that the petitioners are contractual employees and if the government is going ahead to appoint regular persons, benefit of status quo cannot be extended in a blanket manner. “The same would go to the persons who had sought regularisation and were entitled for, it is on the strength of the earlier policies,” the court observed.It said that it would not be appropriate for the selection process to come to a grinding halt on that account. The HC has now modified the December 2019 order stating that government will be entitled to complete the selection process. However, the same will be subject to the final decision of these petitions. The court made it clear that this order does not mean that the government has licence to dispense with the services of the petitioners immediately. “As and only when the selection process is completed and the regular persons are duly selected, it would be open to the state, at that stage, to dispense with the services of the petitioners in a phased manner, on the joining of the regular candidates,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-allows-haryana-to-proceed-further-with-recruitment-on-3-206-posts-by-hssc-101631646036946.html

Hence, heavy cost be imposed on them.In the reply, the court found that the temple area in its entirety is being protected from any untoward damage by extending the length of flyover. The photographs too reflected that the flyover is not obstructing the location of the temple at all.The court dismissed the plea filed in July this year and ordered that by way of imposition of costs, the petitioners would plant trees of deciduous and perennial nature, on both sides of the proposed expressway, at a running stretch of 1km each towards the right and 1km towards left side of the highway (a total of 4km), by taking temple as the central point.Petitioners shall give a proof of the plantation along with a letter of proof issued by the area official of horticulture department, who shall supervise the plantation as per norms, the court said, adding that compliance be made within a period of three months.High court registry has also been asked to follow up the compliance and report the same to the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/court-finds-allegations-false-asks-kaithal-villagers-to-plant-trees-on-4km-of-highway-101631645984993.html

15-09-2021||Delhi||Despite govt efforts, water still out of reach of disadvantaged groups||Despite huge investments to improve access to urban water supply and sanitation by the Union and state governments, urban slums and informal communities have fallen out of its ambit, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic when the focus on hand-washing facilities and overall physical hygiene was utmost to keep the viral infection at bay, experts said on Tuesday, while speaking at the 2021 edition of the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) India’s annual flagship event, Connect Karo. The five-day conference seeks to highlight ways and the need for making cities inclusive and resilient, have access to water, sanitation, hygiene and healthy spaces. Hindustan Times is the media partner of the conference.In the session “Water Tales: Inclusion Stories from the AACO (Accelerating Access Coalition) Services”, experts discussed how the lack of access to WASH (safe water, sanitation and hygiene) services is impacting disadvantaged and vulnerable communities, thereby posing a serious risk to the health of the community at large, in particular during the times of the pandemic. The session highlighted various initiatives that voice the stories of such communities across Indian cities including the national capital.Experts said despite schemes such as Smart Cities Mission and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) being launched, an estimated (US) $123 billion is needed to meet universal WASH provisioning for all urban areas. Equity and inclusion are key components that remain missing even at present, as seen in urban slums and informal communities-- people are often seen crowding around the water tanker to fulfil their daily water needs unmindful of social distancing.Around 24% of urban poor households depend on communal or shared sanitation facilities. Slum households were forced to ignore social distancing protocols at public stand-posts and water tankers to collect the limited water available. “Shared toilet and bathing facilities increased the risk of transmission of the coronavirus disease in these communities. Almost 32% of slum residents across India were exposed to the virus in 2020,” a commentary titled “Accelerating Access to WASH and Healthy Spaces to Slum Communities in Urban India: Renewed Urgency Post-Covid-19” by the WRI India said.One of the stories shared on the issue highlighted that last year, with the pandemic-induced lockdown, in Safda Ghevra, a resettlement colony in Delhi, the water tanker would come only once in two or three days. People would not take bath for three or four days. Community toilets were two for all 13 blocks of the colony, housing around 4,000 people.“The issue of toilets is an equally pressing issue in slum communities. Swacch Bharat Mission prescribes one seat per 35 men and one seat per 25 women. Informal communities in Mumbai are severely underserviced with one seat per 190 user; Delhi had a shortfall of about 50% in 2016 of the required 36,000 seats in community toilets,” the commentary continued.Ruchika Shiva, India Country Coordinator of IRC (an international think tank that works with NGOs, governments across the world for WASH), said that all of these issues -- water supply, sanitation, municipal solid waste --- cannot be addressed in silos. “All these are interlinked and hence integrated long-term solutions are required for addressing these at a mass level. For instance, in Delhi, the leachate from Bhalaswa landfill has contaminated groundwater, which has been impacting the health of people living around the landfill,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/connect-karo-2021-despite-govt-efforts-water-still-out-of-reach-of-disadvantaged-groups-101631645862036.html
15-09-2021||Chandigarh||Investing in tech: Haryana to get its own drones, pilots, experts for aerial mapping||The Manohar Lal Khattar-led Haryana government plans to go big on the use of drone technology by investing in the establishment of a company to help undertake aerial surveys, imaging, mapping and facilitate decision support activities for various organs of the government.Officials said the soon to be incorporated government-owned company will be named Drone Imaging and Information Systems of Haryana (DRIISHYA).The company aims to provide innovative, flexible, and cost-effective drone-based geographical information solutions to the state government, he said. It will acquire, manage, operate and maintain drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as imaging and information collection platforms with sensors of various kinds.Officials said the acquisition, management, operations and maintenance of drones will be in accordance with the guidelines of the director general of civil aviation and the central government.Images and raw information collected will be processed at a data processing, applications and management centre to be established by the company. The base maps generated can be used along with other information layers for utilisation by departments in the state government.Drones and pilotsInitially, the company plans to acquire around 20 drones and set up a data processing, applications and management centre at an approximate cost of Rs.20 crore. The share capital raised will be utilised to create assets such as drones, sensors, rovers, information systems hardware and applications software and licenses.Headquartered at Karnal, DRIISHYA will utilise the facilities at Karnal airport for undertaking its operations. Officials said Karnal is centrally-located and has a landing strip which can be utilised for drone and UAV operations. The facilities at the Karnal airport can be used for testing and housing the drones with the sensors.The company also plans to hire 10 trainee pilots who will be put through training for drone-flying operations at the flight civil aviation centre, Manesar. They will have to obtain the requisite licences from DGCA before deployment for drone operations.The company will also recruit GIS professionals and experts in imaging, image processing, surveying, data processing and applications development. The CM will be the chairperson and the chief secretary will be the senior vice-chairperson of the company’s board.Principal secretary to the CM, V Umashankar said drones and unmanned aerial systems have emerged as a cost-effective medium for imaging and location-based geographical information collection which on processing can provide decision support systems for governance.“The state government has launched a project for imaging and mapping properties through a large-scale mapping project where drones were used as the platform for capturing high resolution aerial images for mapping activities. With the growing use of drones and UAVs for imaging and information collection, we felt a need to set up a government corporation,’’ he said.From urban planning, mining to crowd controlOfficials said DRIISHYA will provide imaging, processing, information collection and analysis, and decision support systems to the town and country planning department for urban development planning and identifying unauthorised colonisation.Similarly, it will help in assessment of mining activities in mining zones, will be used for property assessment and spotting unauthorised constructions in municipal areas, used for updating land maps and records.“It can also provide planning support for construction of roads and canals, crowd monitoring by the police, forest protection and management activities. It will act as a repository for geographical imaging and information systems,” Umashankar said.DRIISHYA’S MANDATE- Conduct drone-based activities to provide authentic and quality imaging data with analytics for aiding good governance- Do aerial surveys, cadastral mapping, land records, base maps for planning, aerial surveillance for law-and-order monitoring- Build authentic data repository and analytics unit for servicing various geospatial requirements- Recommend policy recommendations to expand and facilitate the ease of operations of drones||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/investing-in-tech-haryana-to-get-its-own-drones-pilots-experts-for-aerial-mapping-101631645860960.html

These methods were being used to prevent speeding and red light violation cameras from reading their number plates and in turn saving them from challans. My message to these drivers is that such ‘hacks’ are not going to work,” Chander said.He added, “Delhi traffic police is keeping a close eye on such vehicles. Algorithms can figure out the correct registration number of the car and traffic cops will reach their homes to prosecute them.”Chander said that in the special drive started against such vehicles, local traffic teams were manually inspecting registration plates of vehicles and any obstruction to the plates were removed and drivers were fined. On the first day of the drive, till 5pm, over 250 vehicles were prosecuted.A week back, the Delhi traffic police had also started a drive against construction vehicles that hide their registration numbers by splashing cement mix onto the plate.Last week, 149 vehicles working on construction sites, were fined after being caught with hidden registration plates.“Many cement concrete mix carriers hide their number plates deliberately to avoid prosecutions by traffic police. If the drivers want they could keep it clean. Such vehicles will continue to be prosecuted now,” the traffic chief added.Senior traffic officials said that the aim of such drives are to ensure that policing and prosecutions are done effectively and drivers are not able to dodge the law in any way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi250-fined-for-trying-to-hide-vehicle-registration-numbers-101631645498362.html

In 2013, the then chief minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit, laid the foundation stone of the in-situ redevelopment. It was to be done in a phased manner. A senior DDA official said, “The flats (3,024) have been constructed near the existing slum cluster on three hectares of land and 93% of the work has been completed. We plan to finish the work by October 2021.”Housing for residents of the remaining two clusters (Jawahar Lal Camp and Navjivan Camp) will come up on the land that will be vacated by shifting residents of Bhoomiheen camp to the newly constructed flats. “The housing for these two camps will be developed on the public private partnership model, according to the new policy,” the senior official said. The land-owning agency has carried out the survey of eligible families at the Bhoomiheen camp. DDA officials said that eligible families will have to pay ₹1.12 lakh as beneficiary contribution and ₹30,000 for maintenance charges for five years, under the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board policy adopted by the DDA.DDA said it will also relocate slum dwellers of two rehabilitation projects in north Delhi, comprising three JJ clusters (GP Block in Pitampura, Kohat Enclave and Golden Park, Rampura) having about 2,068 households to the EWS flats at Bhalswa.Regularising alterations in DDA flatsFollowing regular complaints from DDA flat owners regarding access to common spaces, roof rights, illegal constructions by some allottees, permission to install solar panels etc, the DDA has approved some amendments in the policy for regularisation of addition/alterations to DDA flats, a second DDA official said.DDA has clarified that solar panels for domestic use are allowed but a decision on electric vehicle charging points will be taken later.A senior DDA official said, “Like group housing societies, balconies can be covered. However, common areas, including roof terrace and common staircase, up to rooftop, can’t be blocked by any resident for their exclusive use.”The land-owning agency has constituted a board of inquiry for hearing the public suggestions and objections before finalising the Master Plan of Delhi-2041.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dda-to-allot-flats-to-2-700-families-from-jj-cluster-101631645437330.html

Thackeray said the Maharashtra government will adopt measures at the earliest to keep the state ahead in terms of education. He added that the government will also focus on innovative concepts in education as it is the need of the hour. The report will be tabled before the state cabinet soon. NEP 2020 was cleared by the Centre last July, but the state government did not implement it immediately. It formed an 18-member panel under Dr Mashelkar in October 2020 to study the policy and make recommendations to the state.Thackeray said education is an important topic and will shape the future of the generation. He added that education is going to be a very important part of the post-Covid world as education will lead to employment. CM said that the pandemic had given push to work from home and online learning, which has to be carried forward. “All the steps will be taken to keep Maharashtra on the path of academic progress by implementing the suggestions [of the task force] at the earliest. Digital education is important in changing times, but it also requires the creation of necessary infrastructure... It is also necessary to reduce the burden in school bags. With changing times, digital learning and learning different languages such as English, German are also essential,” he said in a statement. He added that children immediately grasp what is taught if they are taught through animation or creative visuals. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on such innovative concepts in the future, he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/task-force-submits-report-on-nep-to-maharashtra-cm-thackeray-101631645377098.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||900 more ICU beds for kids as Delhi prepares for next Covid wave||This month, hospitals run by the Delhi government will create 640 paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) beds, while those run by the Centre, the municipal corporations and private bodies will add another 263 such beds under the government’s plan to prepare for a possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. These will be part of a total of 2,328 beds for children created across hospitals, said a Delhi government order issued on August 31.After the huge second wave of infection, when Delhi saw daily cases peak to over 28,000, the government set up a committee to prepare for a third wave. It recommended the creation of over 37,000 Covid beds, including 12,000 for ICU. But as children might be more vulnerable to the third wave and there aren’t enough ICU beds for them in the capital, the committee recommended the creation of additional infrastructure for them.Lok Nayak hospital, to take one example, is one of the biggest hospitals run by the Delhi government. There were just 20 ICU beds for children before the pandemic. Now, the hospital is working towards adding 150 more.“After the upgrade, we will have 170 ICU beds for children. The beds will be the same that the hospital has, but there is a need for special equipment for children,” said a senior doctor of Lok Nayak hospital on condition of anonymity.The order factors that in as it has ordered the creation of new beds with ventilators, intubation kits, medicines and other such things appropriate for children and babies.At Burari hospital, which was operationalised last year for treatment of Covid-19 patients, 85 beds will be earmarked for children. Of these, 20 will be ICU beds. “All major hospitals will earmark nearly 10 to 15% of the beds for children. These beds might be used for adults also, if needed, but they will be equipped with ventilators and other equipment that can be used for children. We will arrange for medicines and food fit for children, and also train our staff to treat them. We will also make provisions for admitting one Covid-positive family member along with the children,” said a senior doctor from the hospital, requesting anonymity.Thirteen existing hospitals and new blocks in Delhi government hospitals will add 1,475 Covid-19 beds for children, of which 640 will be ICU beds. Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council and one of the members of the aforementioned Delhi government committee, said, “We recommended creating hybrid beds that can be used for adults as well as paediatric patients. This is because there is uncertainty over whether there will be a third wave and whether it will affect children disproportionately. However, we will be prepared for any scenario.”He added, “There has always been a shortage of PICU and NICU (neonatal ICU) beds, especially in the government hospitals. A 20-bed ward would usually have 30 children and these are the children born within the hospitals; it is very difficult for other children born in private hospitals to get transferred into a government hospital. The Delhi government had plans to increase the NICU and PICU beds in their forthcoming hospitals anyway, the pandemic has sped up the process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/900-more-icu-beds-for-kids-as-delhi-prepares-for-next-covid-wave-101631645258805.html

It has also said that the compensation period should be extended by three to five years beyond its five-year period ends in June 2022. The Centre has also been requested for devolution of additional excise duty (AED), Road and Agriculture cess levied on petrol and diesel. “Against Maharashtra’s contribution of ₹32,432 crore towards central taxes in 2020-21, we received only ₹383 crore in devolution. Similarly, against the collection of ₹14,032 crore in the form of petrol in 2020-21, we received devolution of ₹138 crore,” the state has said. Amid the pandemic, the state has requested for early sanction of ADB loan worth ₹5,176 crore for construction of districts, sub-districts, mental, women hospitals and trauma centres. Maharashtra government has also demanded 100% contribution by the Centre in the second phase of Emergency Covid Response Package for Covid mitigation measures. The second phase, to be implemented till March 2022, costs ₹1,368 crore with the state’s share of 40%. The state wants the Centre to bear the entire cost on the lines of the first phase worth ₹1,185 crore implemented till March 21. “The meeting has been fruitful as the members of Niti Ayog assured to take up the issues with the departments concerned,” said an official from the finance department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bats-for-kanjurmarg-plot-for-metro-at-niti-aayog-meet-101631645196909.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi University prepares for phased reopening for final-year UG and PG students||Delhi University colleges and departments are set to welcome final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students back to campus from Wednesday for practical and laboratory work as part of a phased reopening plan announced last week.While not all DU colleges will resume in-person classes right away, many principals are expecting students to come to access library reading rooms and meet teachers.Several students said they are looking forward to returning to college. Aarushi Sharma, a third-year undergraduate student studying computer science in Miranda House, said she would visit the college library on Wednesday ahead of her “lab-turn” on Friday. Several colleges, including Miranda House, have created a schedule for access to laboratories to ensure physical distancing and only 50% of seating capacity at all times.“I haven’t visited my college since February after the second wave halted all offline activities. Half of my graduation has been spent in online mode so I am really looking forward to going to campus, accessing the laboratory, meeting my teachers and friends. Not all of my classmates are back from their hometowns. Since we are just allowed to visit for practical classes, it won’t be feasible for them to come and rent accommodation only for lab work,” said Sharma.Departmental and college libraries have been allowed to reopen from September 6. While all teaching and non-teaching staff have been asked to be vaccinated at the earliest, DU has made it mandatory for all students visiting campus to be at least partially vaccinated.“Laboratory or practical classes and similar activities for final-year UG/PG students may be allowed in the offline mode from September 15 with a maximum 50% of the working capacity of classroom/laboratory/hall room following the principle of rotation. Only a limited number of experiments/exercises/practicals may be selected that are considered essential or important in the semester,” the university order released last week stated.Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College and general secretary of DU Principals’ Association, said that they are taking it slow for now. The college has two science courses and three lab-based courses.“A very small group is coming to college on Wednesday. For now, departments are calling 10 students per batch and these students are at least partially vaccinated. These students will act as peer mentors in the coming days and train other students, engage in confidence-building measures and create awareness on Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Sinha said, adding that library access to limited students is available every day and issuance of laptops is already ongoing.However, not all colleges are expecting many students on Wednesday. Simrit Kaur, principal of Shri Ram College of Commerce, said, “We have informed students that our library reading rooms would be open and issuing books has also been allowed. Students can come for these activities. Since we have lab work for only one paper, we have asked students to inform us if they want to attend online or offline classes. Accordingly, the lab classes can be arranged on Sunday so that it doesn’t disrupt our timetable.”Several departments have also prepared to welcome final-year postgraduate students back on campus. Ashok Prasad, head of the chemistry department in the university, said the department had conducted an online survey to assess how many students want to come for offline practical lessons.“We asked students for information on their vaccination status and asked about their preferences for practicals. Of around 300 students in the final-year PG course, we have created six groups of 50 students each for practicals. Of 50, 25 are being allowed to come on one day and even among these, around 10 have opted for online practical lessons under which the teachers demonstrate the experiments and share the recorded videos with students. This is because our students have moved out of Delhi and have expressed their inability to come for offline classes as their parents are worried about the third wave,” Prasad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-university-prepares-for-phased-reopening-for-final-year-ug-and-pg-students-101631645076882.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||Tweets highlight run-down state of Delhi’s Begumpuri Masjid||Aam Aadmi Party’s Malviya Nagar MLA Somnath Bharti on Tuesday sought help from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and union tourism minister Kishan Reddy to restore the area’s Begumpuri Masjid to its original state after its deteriorating condition was highlighted on Twitter by several people. “Thanks for bringing this to my notice. Being area MLA, I seek a response and help from you on this issue. Hope they do whatever is required to bring the monument to its original shape and develop this as tourist place,” tweeted Bharti on Tuesday, tagging the Twitter accounts of ASI, the tourism minister, the secretary of the ministry of culture, and historian William Dalrymple. On Monday evening, Dalrymple had shared a photo of the mosque on Twitter and said that the mosque’s roof had collapsed due to the rain. “The roof of the Begumpur Masjid just collapsed in the rain due to ASI neglect. With better management, this vast medieval wonder could still be a major revenue-earning tourist site. Instead, it’s being allowed to collapse & disappear,” he tweeted. On Tuesday, when HT visited the mosque, routine repair works were being carried out at the building. There were huge stones and debris in two corners of the mosque where portions of the roof collapsed. ASI officials and security guards at the mosque said that the roof had collapsed a few years ago and debris had accumulated on account of recent construction activity. HT could not independently verify whether the roof had collapsed recently. “In the past few weeks or months, no portion of the roof was damaged. The roof collapsed much earlier. There is debris since we are cleaning the water channel here. Water collects here and hence repair work is being undertaken,” said an ASI official on the premises.Another ASI official, who did not wish to be named, said that the roof had collapsed in 2019 and no recent damage had taken place during the monsoon season. “The roof collapsed in 2019. During this rainy season, so far, no portion of the roof has been damaged. The debris on location is due to the ongoing construction work. We are cleaning a drain on the mosque premises to facilitate the flow of water,” said the official. He said that repair work on the mosque was being carried out since 2019. “Due to the pandemic, the work has been disrupted but we are constantly carrying out repair work here. We are trying our best to repair the mosque and fix it,” said the official. Historian and author Rana Safvi who visited the mosque recently said that it needed attention. “This is the second largest mosque in Delhi after Jama Masjid. The courtyard is in a bad shape. It’s covered by overgrown grass. During my recent visit, I also saw some waterlogging,” said Safvi. Built during the 14th century, the mosque is said to be among seven renowned ones built by Feroz Shah Tughlaq’s prime minister Khan-i-Jahan-Junan Shah.In 2017, the ministry of culture designated the mosque as a monument of national importance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tweets-highlight-run-down-state-of-delhi-s-begumpuri-masjid-101631645017037.html
15-09-2021||Noida||Noida may see light rainfall for next three days, predicts IMD||The city will see light to moderate rainfall for the next three days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted on Tuesday. There was no rain in Noida on Tuesday. As a result, the maximum temperature in the city increased by a degree Celsius.The Met department recorded the maximum and minimum temperatures in Noida at 34°C and 24.2°C on Tuesday, against 33°C and 26.5°C a day earlier.The IMD predicted that Noida will see light to moderate rainfall on Wednesday and Thursday, which will increase in intensity on Friday.“The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover between 33°C and 25°C on Wednesday,” said an IMD official, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, weather analysts said that a new low-pressure area that had developed over the Bay of Bengal has reached Madhya Pradesh, and this will lead to rainfall in the region including Delhi-NCR (national capital region).“The low-pressure monsoon trough and area over parts of central and northern Madhya Pradesh will lead to an induced cyclonic effect and wind patterns, leading to rainfall in the region, including Delhi-NCR and eastern Rajasthan... The region may witness light to moderate rain on Wednesday afternoon, and the intensity may increase from Thursday. This will lead to a drop in the temperatures, bringing some respite to the people,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.Monsoon trough, a low-pressure line, oscillates north to south and brings rainfall to a region.The Safdarjung monitoring station, which is considered average for the NCR, recorded the maximum and minimum temperatures at 35.4°C and 24°C -- two degrees above and one degree below the season’s average, respectively.The humidity levels on Tuesday oscillated between 98% and 68%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-may-see-light-rainfall-for-next-three-days-predicts-imd-101631644956895.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi high court notices to cops over firm collecting samples for Covid test without licence||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought to know from the city and Haryana police as to what action they have taken on a complaint by the city government regarding an online health service aggregator allegedly collecting samples for Covid-19 tests without license.Justice Najmi Waziri, while issuing notices to the police of both the states, asked them to file their replies within two weeks.“You can’t have people being cheated by entities who are not even licensed to carry out these tests,” the court said and said that it is open for the government to identify more such private laboratories which are conducting Covid-19 tests without licenses.The high court was informed by Delhi government counsel that a complaint was made by the Delhi Health Department to the Commissioners of Delhi Police and Gurgaon Police against one entity identified by it which had violated the Covid-19 norms by illegally collecting samples for coronavirus tests, including RT-PCR.The court was hearing a plea seeking contempt action against the authorities for not adhering to the Delhi High Court’s earlier direction to take action against online health service aggregators which are operating illegally and collecting samples for Covid-19 tests.On Tuesday, the city government informed the court that the entity was found in violation of the confidentiality and privacy law by sharing patient’s information as stated on its website. The counsel said that though the complaint was made on June 24, they have not received any response or update from the two police departments.When the court asked as to whose responsibility it is to monitor the online health service aggregators, the Centre’s counsel said Delhi government was responsible for it while the state government’s advocate said it was not fully its responsibility and it was not that the state was sitting idle and doing nothing.To this, the court said the approach is not correct and “it is like a baby is delivered but nobody is ready to take care of it”.The ICMR, in its affidavit filed in response to the petition, has said that National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) certification is must for enrolment of private labs for Covid-19 testing and NABL certifies the readiness of labs to undertake molecular testing of SARS-Cov-2 before the research body allows them for testing.Regarding the online health service aggregators, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said monitoring of their activities does not come under its purview.The ICMR has said in its affidavit, filed through Central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, that as on August 16, 2021, it has approved 134 (35 government and 99 private) labs in Delhi for RT-PCR, TrueNat, CBNAAT and other M-NAT testing platforms and the information is also available on its website.It said the ICMR has laid down SOPs and standard guidance for setting up Covid-19 testing labs and 14 mentor institutes have been set up in India to guide the labs on implementing these SOPs and set up a testing lab.“For Delhi, the mentor institute is AIIMS, Delhi. NABL certification is must for enrollment of private labs for testing. NABL certifies the readiness of labs to undertake molecular testing of SARS-Cov-2 before ICMR onboards them for testing. Through these parameters, it is ensured that labs meet the statutory standards for Covid-19 testing,” the affidavit said.A division bench of the high court, on August 6, 2020 had directed the AAP government to take action in accordance with law against online health service aggregators, who are operating illegally without any registration, after hearing all the stakeholders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-notices-to-cops-over-firm-collecting-samples-for-covid-test-without-licence-101631644836935.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt agencies told to make pollution combat plans||The Delhi government on Tuesday asked several agencies to submit by September 21 a detailed plan on managing various factors responsible for the spike in air pollution during winters in the city.The exercise is part of the government’s plan to formulate a 10-point winter action plan to combat pollution from internal as well as external factors, and set up specific strategies to prevent the air quality from going into the dangerous zone, like every year.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday organised a meeting of various agencies in the Capital, to set targets for winter. The recommendations by each agency will form a part of the final plan which is expected to be released by September 30. Rai said the effort is aimed at checking pollution sources within Delhi, as well as those in the neighbouring states.Addressing a press conference, Rai said in the Tuesday’s stakeholders’ meeting, agencies were tasked with controlling and managing various aspects of pollution control. The environment minister and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal have also sought a meeting with the Union environment minister to discuss the contribution of pollution from the neighbouring states, and talk about ways in which this can be tackled.Representatives from the three municipal corporations (north, south and east), Delhi Pollution Control Committee, environment department, transport department, Delhi traffic police, Public Works Department (PWD), Delhi Development Authority, Delhi Cantonment Board attended the meeting.“Each agency has been tasked to formulate a detailed plan, which needs to be submitted by September 21. Based on these individual plans, a holistic winter action plan will be released by September 30,” Rai said.Senior environment department officials said they have identified some of the major factors that contribute to the poor air quality in the city such as stubble burning, vehicular emissions, road and construction dust, waste burning and poor management of pollution hot spots.Despite several action plans, including the Supreme Court directed Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), being in place, every year during winters, Delhi’s air slip into emergency zone, turning the Capital’s air hazy and a public health hazard.Meteorological factors such as low temperatures, low wind speed and unfavourable wind directions, along with unchecked local pollution sources such as road dust, garbage burning, and vehicular emissions contribute to turn the national capital into a gas chamber.An analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) showed that in 2020, there were 23 days when Delhi’s particulate matter 2.5 concentration (PM 2.5) was in the ‘severe’ or worse categories.On Tuesday, the environment minister said to monitor the effective implementation of the winter action plan, the environment department has been assigned the task of coordinating with all other agencies.Explaining what tasks each agency will have to undertake, Rai said, “The work of controlling garbage burning has been assigned to the municipalities. They will have to come up with a plan to ensure that this garbage reaches the proper disposal sites.”Similarly, he said, the Delhi Traffic Police have also been asked to come up with steps for smooth traffic at congestion hot spots, and also repair traffic signals.“When vehicles are stuck at a spot for several minutes, it leads to an increase in pollution levels in the area. We have asked the traffic police to make a list of the congestion hot spots and try to come up with solutions to fix them,” Rai said.Environment experts, however, said the true test of this winter action plan will be in its implementation. “While the direction that they have taken with identifying the sources contributing to Delhi’s air is right, but the true test of this action plan will be how well this is implemented,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-government-agencies-told-to-make-pollution-combat-plans-101631644777007.html

Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Hapur and Bulandshahr come under the jurisdiction of the Ghaziabad regional transport department.“We have nearly 600,000 such vehicles in our region, and only 200,000 vehicles have HSRPs. We have requested the owners to get the HSRPs before September 30, 2021, otherwise offenders will have to pay a penalty of ₹5,000,” said Arun Kumar, regional transport officer (RTO).“Vehicles registered before April 1, 2019, must get HSRPs at the earliest. Those registered after the mentioned date already come with HSRPs. As of now, nearly 30-35% vehicles have HSRPs, and the remaining must get HSRPs by September 30. Our vendors have a capacity of installing 25,000-50,000 such plates a day, but the demand is lesser nowadays,” Kumar added.If a vehicle owner can produce a proof/document showing that he/she applied for a HSRP, no penalty will be issued against the person.AK Pandey, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO-Administration), Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “We urge the people to get the HSRPs as soon as possible. The traffic police and the transport department will start an enforcement drive immediately after the deadline.”HSRPs are tamper-proof, as compared to the conventional number plates, and prevents counterfeiting of number plates too, said the officials. Information like engine number, chassis number, among others are required to issue such plates. A person can get a HSRP by making a booking through www.siam.in -- official website of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers -- and the process usually takes up to three days, they added.Showrooms selling vehicles said that the demand for HSRPs has been declining, but may pick up with the commencement of the enforcement.Manish Shrivastava, general manager (sales) of Ace Honda in Noida Sector 11, said that he usually gets seven to eight bookings for HSRP per day. “Even two months ago, the bookings went up to 150 per day. We feel the numbers are likely to rise once the enforcement starts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/get-high-security-registration-plates-or-face-penalty-ghaziabad-transport-dept-to-4l-vehicle-owners-101631644656977.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||62 rose-ringed parakeets rescued from east Delhi||The Delhi forest department along with the help of local police has rescued 62 rose-ringed parakeets that were being smuggled and three snakes that were held captive, over the past two days, said officials.According to officials, the parakeets being carried in bags were rescued from east Delhi’s Mandawali area on Monday. “The local police found two men carrying bags full of parakeets in the area on Monday evening. The two men were arrested for smuggling the parakeets in order to sell them at the bird market better known as ‘kabootar market’, mostly indulging in illegal trade, near the Red Fort in Old Delhi. The parakeets were rescued and released in their natural habitat,” said Aditya Madanpotra, deputy conservator of forests (DCF), central division.He added that though these parakeets are common in forests and wooded areas, they are not commonly seen in residential colonies or other inhabited areas. Rose-ringed parakeets are protected under schedule -IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The smugglers have been booked by the police as well as by the forest department under relevant sections of the Act.Forest officials said that three snakes have also been rescued from snake charmers. A red sand boa and a common sand boa each were also rescued from north Delhi’s Indira Colony, Mukherjee Nagar on Monday. Also, an Indian cobra was rescued from another snake charmer on Tuesday. “The local police have arrested two men in the case. While the sand boas are non-venomous snakes, the Indian cobra is one of the most poisonous snakes found in the country. The snake charmers community trades these snakes amongst themselves and even uses them for robbing people by scaring them of the snake,” the DCF said.Besides, another red sand boa snake was rescued from a park in east Delhi’s Seelampur. “The snake has been rehabilitated. I appeal to people to not panic if they do come across a snake in a public place and ring up the police or the wildlife department. People panicking around stresses the animal and makes it difficult for it to be rescued,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/62-rose-ringed-parakeets-rescued-from-east-delhi-101631644596940.html

These people are of the same mindset – be it Muslims, Christians, Jews or Hindus.” “Of course, the Taliban is barbaric and their actions are reprehensible, but those supporting RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal are also the same.” On September 6, Saamana had published an editorial wherein it mildly criticised Akhtar, saying that linking RSS-VHP with Taliban is disrespectful towards Hindu culture. Akhtar, in Saamana, said he had faced a lot of criticism following his interview and this article was a way to respond to all. “Recently I had said in an interview that Hindus are the most decent and tolerant majority in the whole world. I have also said many times that India can never become Afghanistan because Indians are naturally not fundamentalists. Being moderate and taking a balanced stand is in the DNA,” he said. He, however, stood by his statement on similarities between the Taliban and right-wing mindset and said Taliban set up an Islamic state while the Hindu right-wing intends to form a Hindu Rashtra. Besides, like the Taliban, the right wing are curbing freedom of women, while . “I see a lot of similarities between the Taliban mindset and the right-wing ideology. This has angered people but the reality is that there are truly many similarities. The Taliban are forming an Islamic government, the Hindu right-wing wants a Hindu Rashtra. The Taliban want to curb women’s rights, the Hindu right-wing has also made it clear that they don’t like the freedom of women and girls; from Uttar Pradesh to Karnataka and Gujarat, young men and women have been beaten mercilessly for sitting together in a restaurant or a garden or any public place,” he said. In an indirect jab at Fadnavis, Akhtar said that it is interesting that while supporters of the Hindu-right wing were upset with him, “one of their own prominent political leaders” says the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government has a “Talibani mindset.” “I am not a member of any of the three parties which in a coalition are governing Maharashtra extremely well under the able chief ministership of Uddhav Thackeray. Today, his popularity in Maharashtra rivals that of Mamata Banerjee in Bengal and MK Stalin in Tamil Nadu. Not even his worst critics can accuse him of any discrimination or injustice. How and why can anyone call Uddhav Thackeray’s government ‘Talibani’ is beyond my understanding,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hindus-most-tolerant-india-can-t-be-afghanistan-javed-akhtar-in-shiv-sena-s-saamana-101631644540999.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||India most vulnerable to climate crisis: Report||India is facing the triple challenge of ensuring a successful recovery from Covid-19, pushing forward on its long-term vision for equitable development, and addressing the threats posed by climate change, a report released by the World Resources Institute (WRI) highlighted on Tuesday. In the session, ‘Mainstreaming Climate Action in Indian Cities’, which was part of Connect Karo, WRI’s annual flagship event, which highlights ways to make Indian cities inclusive, sustainable and climate forward, experts highlighted that India was one of the countries most vulnerable to extreme climate events in the coming years, and the pandemic had only made efforts to avert this possibility more challenging. “The language of climate action has to be the language of the cities,” said Hitesh Vaidya, director, National Institute of Urban Affairs. During the session, WRI released a report titled, ‘Seizing the Urban Opportunity’, where experts highlighted how national governments can recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, secure shared prosperity, and also tackle the climate crisis. “Climate change is an impediment to future growth and we need to take collective responsibility for it. For India, this will be an even bigger challenge because 22 out of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are here. The governments need to work on climate-resilient cities,” said Daniel Bradley, team leader (low carbon growth), British High Commission. The report highlighted the challenges that six emerging economies, including China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa face in managing the climate crisis. The report said that these six countries accounted for one-third of the global GDP, but also 41% of carbon dioxide emissions (from fossil fuel use) and 42% of the world’s urban population. “The pandemic has wrought havoc on the global economy, with particularly severe impacts on the poor. It has also highlighted the urgency of building resilience to a wide range of shocks, especially the growing impacts of climate change,” the report read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/language-of-climate-action-must-be-language-of-cities-experts-101631644538454.html
15-09-2021||Mumbai||MSEDCL’s arrears touch Rs73,897 crore in Maharashtra||The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) – India’s largest power supply utility – is in major financial trouble as its pending arrears for non-payment of bills have ballooned to a whopping ₹73,897 crore. Its liabilities till August, too, have increased to ₹45,440 crore.To come out of the difficult situation, the state government has decided to appoint a consultancy firm, said Maharashtra energy minister Dr Nitin Raut. He also said that if the issue is not resolved, then the entire state may go into darkness.The state energy department has sought a loan guarantee of ₹20,000 crore. It has also requested to provide another ₹12,000 crore against subsidy, schemes and dues pending for public water supply schemes, officials said.Of the total pending amount, ₹14,046 crore has been increased in the past two years in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, while and ₹36,609 crore was accumulated during the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government from 2014 to 2019.As the amount for non-payment of electricity bills is rising rapidly, the issue was discussed in the last state cabinet meeting held on September 8, when some of the ministers opposed disconnection of power supply of farmers for non-payment of power bills. The cabinet was told that if the amount was not recovered, it may lead to the question of survival of MSEDCL, which is fully owned by the state government.On Tuesday, Thackeray called a review meeting to understand the matter in detail and deliberate upon the measures that will help revive the company. A presentation of MSEDCL was made before CM.Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, water resources minister Jayant Patil, industries minister Subhash Desai, agriculture minister Dada Bhuse, public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar and animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar were present in the meeting.“CM said the solution to the problem is very important and it should be technical as well. The state may have to face blackout if the problem is not resolved. To study and suggest measures to overcome the issue, we will appoint a consultancy firm by calling an expression of interest (EOI),” said the energy minister.“The state government had approved ₹20,000 crore as loan guarantee in the last fiscal year, which was yet to be implemented. CM was requested to allow the department to use that guarantee in this fiscal year as it will provide some liquidity,” said Dinesh Waghmare, principal secretary, energy department.“We have requested to provide ₹12,000 crore as financial assistance. It comprises of ₹5,000 crore against subsidy given to farmers and dues pending for public water supply schemes,” said an official from energy department.CM was of the view that they can come to a conclusion only after presentations by the Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (MSPGCL) and Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL) were made.According to MSEDCL’s presentation, maximum arrear of ₹49,575 crore is pending from agriculture pumps. Despite that, the recovery rate from the farmers is minimum — 3.1%. The energy minister also faced resentment from Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers during the meeting for disconnecting power connection of the farmers. “The non-payment from farmers is a fact but wrong decisions by the energy cannot be overlooked. Why is it paying ₹3,000 crore as idle charges for not purchasing energy from the companies even after making an agreement with them? The agrarian community is very upset with the move and it has become difficult for us to face them ahead of the local bodies’ elections,” said a senior minister.Dr Raut also blamed the erstwhile BJP-led government and stated that they left a huge amount as arrears against non-payment of power bills. “Natural calamities such as floods, cyclones and Covid-19 made the situation even worse,” he told reporters outside the Sahyadri guest house in Malabar Hill.In response, Fadnavis alleged that the state government wants to recover pending dues forcefully from farmers and hence, is blowing the issue out of proportion. “The figures itself say how much arrears increased in the past two years [of MVA government]. Arrears such as cross subsidy for agriculture pumps and other losses can be adjusted from tariff rate. In my view, common people and farmers are in trouble owing to Covid-19. Instead of providing relief, a drama has been created for forceful recovery of pending arrears from them,” Fadnavis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/msedcls-arrears-touch-rs73-897-crore-in-maharashtra-101631644537161.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Two get bail in constable Ratan Lal murder case, two others denied||The Delhi high court on Tuesday granted bail to two persons accused of allegedly murdering head constable Ratan Lal during the north-east Delhi riots in 2020, and said they cannot be made to languish behind bars for a longer period of time and the veracity of the allegations against them can be tested during the trial.Justice Subramonium Prasad granted relief to Shahnawaz and Mohammad Ayyub, who are in jail for the past 17 months and said the evidence does not indicate clearly whether they were present at the scene of the crime.Prasad said the call detail records (CDRs) of the accused were “inconclusive” and does not definitively establish whether they were a part of the unlawful assembly that day. He also said there is no electronic evidence available with the investigating agency to prove the allegations.“In view of the facts and circumstances of the cases, without commenting on the merits of the matter, this court is of the opinion that the petitioners cannot be made to languish behind bars for a longer period of time, and that the veracity of the allegations against him can be tested during trial,” justice Prasad said in two separate orders.In the judgment granting bail to Ayyub, the judge reiterated that “right to protest and express dissent is a right which occupies a fundamental stature in a democratic polity, and therefore, the fact that the accused was part of the protest is not sufficient ground to refuse him bail”.“Additionally, merely being one of the organisers of the protest as well as being in touch with others who participated in the protest is also not sufficient enough to justify the contention that the petitioner was involved in the pre-planning of the alleged incident,” Prasad said while granting relief to Ayyub.With respect to Shahnawaz, the court said the audio clip recovered from his mobile phone is “inconclusive” at this juncture as it fails to reveal whether Shahnawaz was involved in the acts committed. It said the audio clips also do not indicate whether Shahnawaz was at the scene of the crime, and therefore, they cannot form any basis for keeping the accused in “prolonged incarceration”.The single bench said it is the constitutional duty of the court to ensure that there is no arbitrary deprivation of personal liberty in the face of excess state power.“Bail is the rule and jail is the exception, and courts must exercise their jurisdiction to uphold the tenets of personal liberty, subject to rightful regulation of the same by validly enacted legislation. The Supreme Court has time and again held that Courts need to be alive to both ends of the spectrum, i.e. the duty of the Courts to ensure proper enforcement of criminal law, and the duty of the Courts to ensure that the law does not become a tool for targeted harassment,” the judge said in the two orders.According to the police, on February 24, 2020, a crowd carrying various weapons and stones convened on the main Wazirabad Road and started pelting stones at police and more than 50 personnel suffered injuries. Constable Ratan Lal was shot dead. He added that the protesters burnt private and public vehicles, as well as other properties in the vicinity, including a petrol pump and a car showroom.Meanwhile, justice Prasad dismissed the bail applications of Sadiq alias Sahil and Irshad Ali, accused in the same case, saying their footage at the scene of crime is “quite egregious”, and is therefore sufficient to keep them in custody.Special public prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad had produced three videos shot by one Vishal Chaudhary during the incident, indicating the presence of the accused and their involvement in it.“The clinching evidence that tilts this court to prolong the incarceration of the petitioner is his presence in the Vishal Chaudhary video wherein he is clearly identified at the scene of crime, holding a danda in one hand and pelting stones with his other hand at uniformed officials. The fact that he actively participated and pelted stones at the police officials at the scene of crime justify the invocation of Section 149 IPC read with Section 302 IPC in the instant case,” the judge said in two separate orders.Communal riots broke out in north-east Delhi in February 2020, claiming 53 lives and leaving more than 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-two-get-bail-in-constable-ratan-lal-murder-case-two-others-denied-101631644416945.html
15-09-2021||Mumbai||Rs20 lakh paid to fishermen in Maharashtra for releasing protected marine species||A total of 135 fishermen across coastal districts in Maharashtra were compensated for releasing protected marine species caught as bycatch back into the ocean during the financial year 2020-21, as per the recently published annual report of the Mangrove Foundation, a registered society functioning under the aegis of the state forest department’s mangrove cell. These fishermen were compensated to the tune of ₹2,041,800.“Of the 135 cases processed for compensation in the fiscal year 2020–21, 72 cases were of the release of Olive Ridley sea turtles, 36 cases were of green sea turtle, three cases of Hawksbill turtle, two cases of Guitarfish and 22 cases were of the release of the whale shark,” states the annual report. Of these, the majority of cases were reported from Sindhudurg and Thane districts, where 47 and 39 protected marine specimens were released respectively. In Mumbai, only one such case was recorded during the last year, when a single Olive Ridley turtle was released after getting caught in a fishing net.As of April 2, this year, the total number of cases processed under the state government scheme stood at 178. That number has now grown to just over 200 cases, said Harshal Karve, a marine biologist with the Mangrove Foundation. “The scheme was started in 2018, but the most number of compensations were given out in the last financial year after we undertook outreach exercises with the fishing community. There is a similar scheme in Gujarat for releasing whale sharks, but Maharashtra is the only coastal state which compensates fisherfolk for release of all protected marine species.”According to the compensation scheme, if any fisherman finds a protected marine animal caught in their nets, they are entitled to compensation up to ₹25,000 if they release the animal and their fishing gear is damaged in the process. All applicants have to submit video graphic and photographic evidence of the incident, along with the GPS coordinates of where the animal was caught and released along with details of their boat license.In January this year, the state government revised the compensation structure of the scheme, and fisherfolk are now reimbursed based on the size and degree of protection according to the animal under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. In all, over ₹26 lakhs have been doled out as compensation under the scheme so far. Other species which have been released (outside of the last financial year) include two leatherback turtles and the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rs20-lakh-paid-to-fishermen-in-maharashtra-for-releasing-protected-marine-species-101631644296840.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||Voter roll revision: Delhi CEO seeks review to replace officers not tech-savvy||Citing the computerisation of the voters’ list revision, the chief electoral officer of Delhi on Tuesday issued directions to all 11 district magistrates to conduct “a comprehensive review” of the performance of booth level officers (BLO) and replace those who cannot handle a smartphone with tech-savvy people.Delhi has around 13,500 BLOs who come under the domain of the revenue department. The directions come at a time when Delhi is inching closer to the municipal polls, likely to be held early next year.The central government has launched a mobile application called GARUDA for voter roll revision. Last month, the Union government issued an order asking all BLOs to mandatorily register themselves on the mobile app. In Delhi, around 8,000 BLOs have registered themselves on the app so far, an election commission officer said, asking not to be named.“Keeping in view the need for technological advancements in the electoral process, the chief electoral officer of Delhi, Dr r Singh, has directed all the DEOs (district election officers) i.e. the district magistrates of Delhi to comprehensively review the work of BLOs and those who cannot handle smartphones should be replaced with tech-savvy BLOs. This has been conveyed in a video conference held by the CEO with all DEOs and EROs on September 13, 2021 regarding the ensuing special summary revision-2022,” a statement from the office of the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Delhi said.It further said, “With the introduction of the GARUDA App by the Election Commission of India, the work of BLOs will become faster, smarter and more transparent and the process of voter registration will become easier and more accurate.” “The CEO Delhi has further directed to ensure that 06 images of each polling station are uploaded in compliance with the directions of the ECI. A virtual tour of the polling station should also be made available for the convenience of electors. Dr Ranbir Singh also emphasised the need to tag the EMF (Extended Minimum Facilities) like police station, fire station, hospital, bus stand, parking etc on GARUDA app by the BLOs with an aim to provide complete information about a polling station to electors,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/voters-list-revision-delhi-ceo-orders-review-to-replace-officers-who-are-not-techsavvy-101631643937960.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||By 2022, Delhi will have 150 more EV charging points, says transport dept||By early next year, Delhi will have electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in at least 150 new locations across the national capital, senior transport officials said on Tuesday. While the Delhi government is focusing on creating a demand for EVs, especially in the two and three-wheeler segments, experts on Tuesday said the city administration should consider offering concessions on land lease and new electricity connections that are needed for setting up an EV charging station. Speaking at Connect Karo, a virtual conference organised by World Resources Institute (WRI) India, to discuss the scope of urban mobility in the country, Amit Bhatt, executive director (integrated transport) of WRI India, said 27% of the fixed investment for setting up an EV charging station goes towards getting a power connection, while 67% is incurred on the charger infrastructure itself. The remaining 3% goes into managing the software and so on. Similarly, when it comes to operating costs, 48% goes towards land rent and 48% on technicians and site maintenance, he said. “There is not much scope to reduce costs in the other components. It is only in terms of land rent and electricity connection that the government can help reduce the cost of setting up charging stations. Currently, the cost of setting up a 10KW/15KW Bharat DC charger for a four-wheeler can go up to ₹2.5 lakh. For vehicles such as Tata Nexon, Hyundai Kona, MG 25 EV, the cost increases to about ₹10 lakh. For two and three-wheelers, the charger cost ranges between ₹50,000 and ₹1.25 lakh,” said Bhatt. In July, the Delhi government floated a tender to select vendors for setting up charging stations in shopping malls, theatres, multiplexes, department stores, hospitals and residential areas. This was separate from the tenders floated and work orders issued by the government to empanel vendors to set up 500 charging points across 100 public spaces with most of them being located in bus depots and outside Metro stations.Talking about China, which by now has at least 39,000 charging stations, Daizong Liu, sustainable cities program director, WRI China, said the EV transition there began from 2009. “Between 2009 and 2013, China started pilot projects and I feel that is the way that the other countries or cities should also go about to achieve their targets. During this period, China did the Olympic green vehicle demonstration and also launched the “ten cities, thousand vehicles” program, after which the EV transition took off,” he said. The program that Daizong spoke about was aimed at getting 10 Chinese cities to add at least 1,000 EVs annually over three years.“There should be strong target oriented government policies to execute the transition to EVs. In India, we have some states that have notified good EV policies, but a solid programme with stricter mandates is required at the national level. In China, Beijing and Shanghai are leading the uptake of electric passenger vehicles due to private vehicle purchase and registration incentives. Shenzhen is leading the adoption of commercial electric fleets such as e-buses and e-freights due to traffic restrictions, operational subsidies and also operational will,” Daizong said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/by-2022-delhi-will-have-150-more-ev-charging-points-says-transport-dept-101631643936800.html
15-09-2021||Delhi||Physical, mental health clinics at 15 Delhi govt schools to open on Oct 1||Come October 1, the Delhi government will launch the pilot project of school health clinics in 15 state government schools across the city, which will offer physical and mental health services to its children. The public works department is likely to complete installation of furniture and fixtures, along with electricity and water connection, in the porta cabins and hand it over to the head of the concerned schools by Wednesday.According to a circular issued by the deputy director of education (DDE) of school branch last week, “The departments of Health and Education are coming together to synergise and expand their horizons to provide Physical and Mental health services to children through School Health Clinics in Government Schools of Delhi, GNCTD. The Pilot Project of School Health Clinic in 15 proposed Delhi government schools as per the list…will start on October 01, 2021.”The clinics will have a doctor, a nurse, a psychologist, and a public health specialist and will be operational during the school hours. Along with providing routine check-ups, the clinics will also focus on the emotional well-being of children, address issues related to their mental health,and offer counselling services.“Often, mental health is not given priority in our country so it will be one of the key focus areas. The health clinic project will mainly function on a preventative system instead of a curable system, wherein we work on the cure once a person falls sick. The idea will be to prevent a disease or illness by monitoring the health of children. Several schools in the United States of America or countries in the European Union have school health clinics. We have studied those models before launching the same here,” said an official working on the project, requesting anonymity.The official also explained that a health screening for all children would be conducted as soon as the clinics are set up. “The health screening would comprise different kinds of tests, such as blood tests, heart rate, eyesight, throat issues, among other things. Eventually, we are aiming to have a students’ health card, which will have all this information in a collated format, that will be helpful in the long run,” he said.A senior education department official said, “We are starting with the pilot project in 15 schools for now. Based on the response and lessons, a decision will be taken on how the plan will be executed in other schools. Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital will act as a resource centre and adolescent mental health collective ‘Children First’ will be collaborating with us on this and work with our psychologists. The clinic will be open for all students of the school and conduct health screenings and referral system, to begin with.” Of the 15 government schools where the proposed clinics are expected to start next month, six are in north district, five in south-west district, two in south east district, one in west and northeast districts each.Principals across these schools said they are awaiting instructions from the education department on the role of schools in the project. Harish Kumar, principal of RPVV, B-block, Yamuna Vihar, which is among the 15 selected schools, said, “The health clinics have been set up. We are waiting for directions from the education department on how it would be operate. We will speak to parents and other stakeholders only after getting instructions from the department .” Burari resident Siya Sharan, a school management committee (SMC) member of RPVV Raj Niwas Marg, which is also among the pilot schools, said they have heard about the school health clinics but there was no meeting on it with SMC members so far. “If a clinic like this is established, it will help students from economically weaker sections. These children face issues in accessing health facilities and the clinic will serve as a one-stop centre for all health-related information and services. Besides, families won’t have to think on where to take their children if they fall sick as they can easily approach the school first,” said Sharan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/health-clinics-to-come-up-in-15-delhi-govt-schools-from-oct-1-101631643696833.html

15-09-2021||Delhi||Day after Sabzi Mandi building collapse, shop owner held over ‘illegal’ repairs||A day after two brothers, aged seven and 12, were killed and a 72-year-old man was seriously injured in a four-storey building collapse in north Delhi’s Sabzi Mandi area, police on Tuesday said they arrested the 24-year-old owner of one of the shops on the building’s ground floor for allegedly carrying out illegal repair and renovation work that reportedly led to the collapse.Police said the shop owner had not sought permission from the municipal corporation for carrying out the repair and renovation work.“We have arrested Mohak Arora, who is the owner of the shop in which the renovation work was being carried out... A case under Indian Penal Code sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings) and 34 (common intention) was registered against him at the Sabzi Mandi police station in connection with the deaths caused by the building collapse,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.Many residents had on Monday attributed the building collapse to vibrations caused during the repairs.The search and rescue operation at the building collapse site continued till 10pm on Monday, as the locals had claimed that at least three labourers were trapped under the debris. However, except the bodies of the two children and the safe rescue of the 72-year-old man, Ramji Das Aneja, who ran another shop on the ground floor, no bodies or injured persons were found trapped under the debris.The bodies of brothers Prashant Gupta (7) and Saumya Gupta (12) were recovered from the debris by the rescue teams and local residents. They were passing by when more than half of the building’s structure collapsed, crushing them.“We have learnt that one Javed and two more labourers were working inside the shop. Prima facie, it appears that they all fled as the structure started shaking. We are looking for them,” said a senior investigator, who did not want to be named.The four-storey building, more than 60 years old but not declared in the “dangerous category” by the local civil agency, collapsed around 11.30am on Monday, while the renovation work was on at the ground floor shop.Three brothers — Ajay Aneja, Rajiv Aneja and Sanjay Aneja — lived on the three upper floors with their families. Barring one of their family members, 19-year-old DU student Aryan Aneja, none of their families were on any of the upper floors when the building collapsed. Police said Aryan survived because he had walked into the kitchen that was on the side of the building that remained intact.Based on initial investigation and Arora’s interrogation, the senior investigator said, the building was Anejas’ ancestral property.“The wives of Lovely and Bunty (two other Anejas who died earlier) owned the shop but had sold it to Mohak Arora’s family. The registry of the property was done in Arora’s name on September 2. Arora’s family wanted to establish him in a business for which they had planned to repair and renovate the shop,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiday-after-sabzi-mandi-building-collapse-shop-owner-held-over-illegal-repairs-101631642856831.html
15-09-2021||Pune||MoD sanctions 16,122 sqm of land for construction of Bopkhel-Khadki bridge||The defence ministry has given final sanction to the transfer of defence land measuring 16,122 square metre to the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) for construction of the approach route and bridge across the Mula river connecting Bopkhel village with Khadki bazaar. The bridge over the Mula river will connect Bopkhel and Khadki and help the residents of Bopkhel, Ramnagar and Ganeshnagar.The letter signed by the undersecretary, government of India, R K Yadav, addressed to the chief of army staff and director general of defence estates (DGDE), read, “I am directed to convey the sanction of the President of India for grant of work permission for the transfer of defence land measuring 16,122 square metre of the Khadki Cantonment Board to the PCMC for construction of the Bopkhel bridge and approach road connecting Bopkhel village through the Khadki cantonment. The way has been cleared for the construction of a bridge in Bopkhel on the site of the defence ministry.”Deputy mayor Hirabai Ghule said, “During the last four years, the people of Bopkhel had to make a big detour to reach Pimpri-Chinchwad or Pune. Therefore, through BJP MLA Laxman Jagtap, we approached the central government to build a bridge over the Mula river. The then defence minister Manohar Parrikar followed-up with the now finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. As a corporator, I have consistently pursued it through MLA Jagtap and got it approved by the army and ministry of defence.”The PCMC started actual construction of the bridge on the Mula river connecting Bopkhel and Khadki on January 4, 2019 and completed it quickly. However, work needed to continue on defence land for which a working permit from the defence ministry was required. MLA Jagtap followed up with the central government for this and requested defence minister Rajnath Singh for speedy permission.“The central government responded positively. The defence ministry gave final approval for 16,122 square metre land on September 9. This will lead to construction of the bridge on defence land,” said Ghule.Additional commissioner Vikas Dhakne said, “The final working permission has been obtained to start work on the Bopkhel bridge. A meeting will be held with the PCMC commissioner in this regard. Planning will be carried out on how to start the work. Work on the bridge will begin accordingly.”Ghule said that the civic body planned to complete the work and open the bridge to the people of Bopkhel in a few months. Both Jagtap and Ghule thanked the central government on behalf of the people of Bopkhel.On May 13, 2015, the CME authorities closed the road connecting Bopkhel with Dapodi after the Bombay high court dismissed a petition filed against closure of the road. Due to the road being closed, the residents of Bopkhel have to travel for at least half-an-hour more on alternate routes.The issue of closure of the Bopkhel road took a violent turn on May 21, 2015 when villagers pelted stones and bricks during an agitation and the police had to resort to lathi charge and the use of tear gas to control the mob. At least 22 police personnel and 15 villagers were injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mod-sanctions-16-122-sqm-of-land-for-construction-of-bopkhel-khadki-bridge-101631637817194.html

Bhagde had moved the consumer forum which in 2001 had ordered the builder give possession of the flats after receiving the balance payment, and to execute the registered sale deed. There was another option, to refund the paid amount with 9% interest. However, the complainants failed to get possession of the flats although they were ready to pay the outstanding amount.In 2016, the complainants had moved the consumer commission which again directed the builder to hand over the flats. The builder challenged this order in the Bombay High Court and his plea was rejected.Considering all the facts, the commission convicted the builder on Tuesday. The builder through his legal counsel, filed a reply stating that he should be given lesser punishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-30-years-builder-sentenced-to-1-yr-jail-by-consumer-forum-for-non-delivery-of-flats-101631635475729.html

The College of Engineering of Pune (CoEP) has been included in the list. Also included are the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-Mumbai), Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI-Mumbai) and Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur (VNIT).B Jadhav, joint secretary of the urban development department (UDD) of the state government, issued the order listing the names of more than 50 polytechnics and engineering colleges in the state and instructing them to conduct third-party audits of the development works carried out by local self-government bodies. Jadhav stated in the order that the state has taken the decision to conduct a technical audit of the development works after receiving complaints of substandard works.Dyneshwar Molak, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Normally, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) conducts a third-party audit of different development works carried out within the PMC limits. However, most of the works are major projects. We give work to the CoEP. Besides that, consultants also carry out third-party audit work. Now, the state government has issued an order to carry out a third-party technical audit of development works to maintain their quality.”Professor B G Birajdar, applied mechanical department, COEP, said, “The corporation assigns work for third-party technical audits of their development works. Now, the state has issued an order and appointed the CoEP to conduct an audit of development works.”“As per the government order, any work worth Rs20 lakh will be eligible for a third-party technical audit. We will submit a report concerning local self-government and after that, they will sanction the bill of work to the contractor. We will be entitled to carry out audit within Pune district. It includes the public works department (PWD), Pune district collector, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporations (PMC and PCMC), Pune zilla parishad etc.,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/coep-on-list-to-conduct-third-party-audit-of-local-self-govt-devp-works-101631635295714.html
15-09-2021||Pune||After locals oppose, MSRDC to change alignment of Pune ring road||Following opposition to the passage of the Pune ring road via tunnel through Maval tehsil’s Bhandara dongar which is considered sacred by the locals, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has initiated an assessment procedure for change in alignment of the eastern part of the road near the said hill. Officials said that the original plan for the road to pass through the hill has been dropped and assessment is slated to begin to shift the route from the base of the hill.The assessment of various factors related to the change in alignment such as its impact on the project budget, distance, land requirement and proximity of other national highways is scheduled to begin from Tuesday and will take at least a month to complete as per MSRDC officials.Sandeep Patil, sub-divisional engineer, MSRDC, said, “There are emotions attached to the Bhandara dongar. Now we have to do an assessment for this change in alignment. We will need to assess how much extra land would be required if the ring road is to be shifted from the base of the hill and how many houses would be affected. The new alignment will have to be planned keeping in mind that the Chakan-Shikarpur national highway is nearby. Consultants will conduct this study and its economical impact will also have to be assessed. It will take a month.”On Monday, a meeting was held in Mumbai with Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, top officials of MSRDC, and people’s representatives. According to sources, there was consensus among the attendees about the decision related to Bhandara dongar. Meanwhile, a demand has also been presented to avoid irrigated land from the alignment of the ring road. However, MSRDC officials said that it is impossible to plan the ring road’s alignment exclusively on non-irrigated land.On September 6, the state government approved ₹26,831.21 crore for the Pune ring road project, including construction and land acquisition costs. Out of ₹26,831.21 crore, ₹12,175.97 crore has been allocated for the western part of the ring road. Land survey of only three out of the 37 affected villages remains to be done for the western part. Collectively, ₹14,655.24 crore has been allocated for the eastern part. The Pune ring road is a proposed circular, outer road for the Pune Metropolitan Region, expected to solve the traffic woes of the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad cities. For the 173 km ring road, a total of 1,526.1153 hectare area is required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-locals-oppose-msrdc-to-change-alignment-of-ring-road-101631634995691.html
15-09-2021||Pune||In my opinion: Why BJP must redraw its pre-poll strategy in Pune||In poker, the long-standing rule of thumb is, don’t play the cards, play the person. The analogy between poker and the political situation in Pune is primarily because a high-stakes game will unfold in February 2022, the Pune municipal corporation, now the biggest by area in Maharashtra, goes to the polls. Between now and e-day, politics will turn into astute game play as parties in the fray for dominance in Pune’s civic body begin to parlay – take their political good fortune and raise the stakes with “all-in” calls - to win the right to have the power to decide Pune’s future, or as Pune’s activist denizens would phrase it, to win the right to be entrusted to do the best for Pune’s future. At this high-stakes table sit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Congress party and the Shiv Sena. There are the “inside-outers” – players in the know with perhaps just enough of political clout to upset the odds. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), for example. In early game play, watching from the sidelines and negotiating endless quotes about “plans to make Pune a smart city” and “ensure the pandemic is beaten” – every move now is either a bet, a call, or a fold, depending on the issue at hand, with only one focus – making it to the final table (election day) with an unbeatable chip stack (political capital). At the table today are the NCP’s Ajit Pawar, the BJP’s Chandrakant Patil (why not the BJP’s MP from Pune Girish Bapat is for another day), and the Congress. The Congress, like the party at the national level, has been questioned by political experts for “playing” without a “powerful front” to reckon with. The trickle-down effect is evident in Pune as well. Ramesh Bagwe then takes the seat for the Congress. The Shiv Sena at the moment is backing the NCP’s hand, though individually, a challenge may emerge as the stakes get higher and the game gets deeper. Like in poker, do not play the cards dealt. Play the opponent. The NCP is making all the huge bluffs – the kind that puts social media in a frenzy - repeatedly going all in, in what seems to be crazy play at the time, only to have the BJP back down, or fold (to keep the poker parlance in play). Amazingly, the chip count at the end of each game is stacking up nicely for the Pawars. The long bet – making a play very early in the game so as to impact the eventual outcome – was Ajit Pawar’s Game of Thrones (metaphor taken from a blockbuster series) move at the time of the state elections in 2019. Cards in play? BJP wins 105 seats, NCP wins 54, Congress wins 44 and the Shiv Sena, 56. The bluff. Ajit Pawar joins hands with the then BJP chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and is announced as his deputy, after an early morning swearing-in ceremony. The fold. BJP-Ajit Pawar government lasts 80 hours. Pawar goes back into the NCP and is named cabinet minister in the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) which forms the state government, along with the Congress. The takeaway from this particular “game” for the BJP must be Pawar’s quote, responding to a media query on his “strange” call (to say the least): “Whatever I did, I did it openly. I crossed over and came back. Now, I am firmly in the saddle here (MVA/NCP).” A year later, the NCP and BJP, which is the ruling party in the PMC currently, face off again… a high stakes game, now with the civic elections looming. Cards in play? The BJP-led PMC’s plan to lease out amenity spaces in the city to raise funds for the civic body, post the vast Covid expenditure and loss of income. The bluff. As the issue goes to the general body meeting for a final decision, much dust has been raised by the NCP in the build-up–primarily, the story-line that the BJP is “selling” the city to raise funds; the BJP counter, the money raised will save the city. Vandana Chavan, senior NCP leader and Rajya Sabha member from Pune, announces the NCP will NOT oppose the proposal, as earlier planned. Cue, shock and raised eye-brows, all emojis of course, of the general public. The fold. On the day of the GB with the BJP all set to push the proposal through, “winning” with an ambitious proposal, the NCP plays its hand – withdraws support. Caught flat, the BJP cancels the GB meet to postpone a decision on the proposal. The gallery view on both these plays suggests that the explanations: Ajit Pawar rebelled and then was won back; and the BJP promised to make changes to the proposal requested by Chavan and then did not, seems a little too convenient. In politics, if it’s too simple, it definitely is not. The idea that the NCP is in total chaos and has no strategy or communication, is perhaps the other “go-to” that the wily old Pawar, i.e. Pawar senior, AKA Sharad dada, wants to send to all players at the table. Regarding exposure to the happenings both on and off the table, it is believed that the BJP got played… badly. Because, for the gallery (voting public), at the end of the above two “games”, the NCP seems to have come out as winners – Ajit Pawar as deputy CM and leasing of amenity spaces on hold. From here on in, momentum, that famous word to capture the “air”, the “vibe” the “feeling”, is all about not losing any; at least for the NCP. For the BJP, keep an eye on the cards dealt, yes, by all means, but, remember, play the player. Note: Poker is a card game involving skill. The writer in no way supports, advocates or propagates its playing as, like the PMC elections, money is involved and the costs are dangerously high. .

And, the pandemic is on the agenda, along with climate change and the Indo-Pacific.India ceased export of Covid-19 vaccines earlier in the year after it faced internal criticism for not inoculating enough Indians in the wake of a massive surge in cases caused by the more virulent Delta variant.India is in a far better place with half of its eligible populating having received at least one shot of a vaccine.Axios reported that Biden administration officials have said they understand this is a sensitive issue and have thus decided to adopt a “soft approach” to Modi and it added, citing officials, the administration has “decided against trying to pressurise Modi by conditioning his participation on his willingness to release vaccines to Covax. He’ll be welcomed regardless of his decision”.The United States had itself banned the export of Covid-19 vaccines as it sought to marshal all available resources to vaccinate Americans and build a stockpile of vaccines for use domestically, by invoking special wartime powers of the president. This had created a shortfall of raw material for vaccines in India, as supplies were blocked from shipping.The United States lifted the curbs as part of a relief package it announced for India to help it deal with the crippling surge in cases fuelled by the Delta variant, along with oxygen concentrators, therapeutics such as remdesivir and personal protection equipment for healthcare workers.The Biden administration plans to push participants at the summit to contribute vaccines to the WHO-run Covax initiative, which is trying to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines around the world. Some countries have distributed vaccines through bilateral arrangement to earn and build diplomatic equity.Axios reported that the Biden administration plans to invite Russia, which has stayed away from Covax, to the summit, as well as China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-pressing-india-to-resume-export-of-covid-vaccines-report-101631727784818.html
15-09-2021||World||India criticises Pakistan, OIC at UN Human Rights Council||India on Wednesday criticised Pakistan for using the UN Human Rights Council to spread “false and malicious propaganda” against the country as part of efforts to divert the world community’s attention from rights violations committed by Islamabad. Exercising its right of reply in response to Pakistan’s statement at the 48th session of the council in Geneva, an Indian representative said: “It has become a habit for Pakistan to misuse the platforms provided by the council to propagate its false and malicious propaganda against my country.” The representative also referred to rights violations in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and said, “The council is aware of Pakistan’s attempts to divert the council’s attention from serious human rights violations being perpetrated by its government, including in the territories occupied by it.” Pakistan, the Indian side said, has “failed to protect the rights of its minorities, including Sikhs, Hindus, Christians and Ahmadiyas”, and thousands of women and girls from minorities have been “subjected to abductions, forced marriages and conversions in Pakistan and its occupied territories”. It further said Pakistan has been “engaged in systematic persecution, forced conversions, targeted killings, sectarian violence and faith-based discrimination against its ethnic and religious minorities”. Incidents of violence against minorities and attacks on their places of worship and private property have occurred with impunity. “A ‘climate of fear’ continues to drastically impact the daily lives of minorities,” the Indian representative said, adding dissenting voices from among civil society, human rights defenders and journalists were “muzzled daily” with the support of the government. “The impunity with which such abuses have been carried out exposes the hollowness of Pakistan’s commitment to human rights,” the representative said. Pakistan has also been “globally recognised as a country openly supporting, training, financing and arming terrorists, including UN proscribed terrorists, as a matter of state policy”, the Indian side said. The Indian side also rejected a reference made by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to Jammu and Kashmir and said the “OIC has no locus standi to comment on internal affairs of India”. The OIC, it added, has “helplessly allowed itself to be held hostage by Pakistan, which holds the chairmanship of their Geneva Chapter, to subserve its own agenda”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-criticises-pakistan-oic-at-un-human-rights-council-101631726219781.html

In an interview with The Independent, Qureshi expressed concern over the reports of the Afghan Taliban releasing TTP terrorists."If those guys come and start creating problems for us over here, it will affect innocent lives and we don't want that," he said.The TTP is said to be traditionally located in the eastern districts of Nangarhar Province, near the border with Pakistan.

'We' in Imran Khan's comment meant the United States and not Pakistan as Imran Khan said Afghanistan has a tradition of rejecting puppet government. "No puppet government in Afghanistan is supported by the people. It gets discredit among the people.Pakistan had intelligence inputs that the Taliban would not be able to take over all of Afghanistan and there will be bloodbaths after the US forces left. Now, the world should give more time to the Taliban to form a legitimate government and make good on their promises Imran Khan said. On being asked about women's rights under the Taliban rule, Imran Khan said it is a mistake to think that someone from outside will be able to give Afghan women rights. "Afghan women are string. Give them time. They will get their rights," Khan said.On Pakistan supporting the TalibanCountering the allegations which are not new for Pakistan and Imran Khan that Pakistan was supporting the Taliban, the prime minister said that his country can't fund war when it barely meets its own expenses.

15-09-2021||World||Dalai Lama alone will have final say on reincarnation: CTA chief Penpa Tsering||Against the backdrop of China’s repeated efforts to portray a role for itself in the selection of the next Dalai Lama, the Sikyong or head of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), Penpa Tsering, has said the Tibetan spiritual leader alone will have the final say on his reincarnation. In an interview, Tsering said the current impasse in the Tibetan Parliament provides a “lot of space for the Chinese government to create trouble” within the Tibetan community. Tsering also spoke about the CTA’s plans to integrate Tibetan settlements in India to make them administratively more manageable. Q. As the Sikyong or head of the Central Tibetan Administration, what are the three big issues you would identify as a primary concern for the Tibetan community? How would you tackle them? A. We are going through a huge social and demographic change because of which we’ll have to do quite a lot of restructuring in the years to come, particularly to do with the integration of settlements and integration of schools, because we are scattered in more than 45 different communities, compact and scattered in India. So in the long run, when more people move out of the settlements, then it becomes expedient on us to integrate the settlements into more compact, larger communities so that it becomes administratively more manageable for us. [And] at the same time, be able to preserve our language, culture, religion and way of life for what it was meant to be when we first came into exile in 1959 and the vision of his holiness, the Dalai Lama, and the successive Indian leadership that has given us so much support and help, that has reduced a lot of our existential problems. Those are the major challenges that we have to meet today. Q. You had your election quite a while ago and there’s a kind of impasse in the Tibetan Parliament. How are you planning to tackle that? A. It’s not really a refusal to take oath [by some members]. They’ve taken oath but not on the basis of the charter. Our democracy is quite a mix of presidential [and] parliamentary [systems] because the election of the Sikyong is more presidential in nature and the Parliament is more parliamentary in nature. So it’s a mix of two systems of democracy, where the delineation of the division of power between the three pillars of democracy is quite distinct and...one organ of democracy overreaching on the other, here in terms of the executive or the Kashag overreaching on the legislative and the judiciary is not mandated in the charter. Therefore, it’s not legally provided for the cabinet to interfere or intervene. But I did suggest that if all the 45 people who were elected...to the Parliament come to us and give us the mandate, then we promise to be fair. Other than that, there is no clarity in terms of how to resolve this, other than the role of the election commission. And the charter also doesn’t specify as to what happens if some members do not take oath of office as per the laws. So, it is up to the members to decide whether this impasse should continue for the larger interests of the cause and the people, or this should be elongated for a longer time. So, as I always say even in our personal lives, we face a lot of challenges and as Buddhists, we believe in impermanence. So, it’s a matter of time [and] it should be resolved. Q. I asked this question because there are some concerns that if this state of affairs continues, there could be problems going forward into the next financial year. You would have problems with your budget and governance. A. I firmly believe that it should be settled before that, but then it’s up to the members as I said before...The problem is there because there is a solution, the solution should come before the time limit that you have mentioned Q. Which is about March-April, I guess. A. Yeah, we follow the same financial year as India does. Q. I also asked this question because there are some who feel that this state of affairs continuing provides opportunities to others to interfere and let the problem go on for longer. A. Definitely. It gives a lot of space for the Chinese government to create trouble within the [Tibetan] community, and it also affects the image of the Tibetan movement as such. And also, the very fact that we have been practicing democracy over the last 50 years, that also gets effected. But whenever you have a problem, there are also opportunities. This creates more awareness within the public about the laws and the system and all that. So I believe now people are more aware of what is happening within the community and I think the elected leaders should be aware of where it’s heading to. And the fact that democracy also involves a lot of accountability and responsibility to the people and answerability also to the people. So that way, it helps the public to understand the system better and eventually, I hope this will have a longer impact on the public when they make the decision as to who they should elect as members of parliament. Q. We are in very interesting times as far as the India-China relationship is concerned, and that obviously has an impact on the Tibetan administration and the larger Tibetan committee. How far has the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) impacted your administration or the Tibetan community at large? A. There is a lot of interest within the community, from the government of India, from the US government and also the changing dynamics in Europe. So, the continuing impasse also affects the functioning in terms of our outreach to the international community, including India. But we have not backtracked on this. The administration is going ahead. We have been having a series of meetings with top officials and concerned leadership in different countries. Q. Does that include China? Have there been any new fresh contacts with them? A. Unofficially yes, there are some feelers, but we have to check the credibility of these channels of communications that are opening up. Q. The other thing that everybody has been debating is the way the Chinese have been aggressively saying they are going to decide the next Dalai Lama. It’s an issue that has come up repeatedly. How do you look at that aggressive Chinese posturing on this issue? A. That obviously involves politicisation of the whole reincarnation issue because if the Chinese government is really serious about the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama, then they should be giving more attention to the living 14th Dalai Lama than the future 15th Dalai Lama. And as a communist regime which does not believe in religion or life after death, this is purely a spiritual matter. When you talk about reincarnation, it’s the person who’s going to be reincarnated who decides where or how he or she should be born. So, in the case of his holiness, the Dalai Lama, he is a spiritual leader. We are talking about his reincarnation, so it’s completely up to his holiness to decide where he will be born, not the Chinese government. Q. Given the fact that the Dalai Lama is at an advanced age, has the CTA started preparations for this issue? A. In terms of the process of selection of a reincarnation, I personally believe that the Central Tibetan Administration should not have any role in that. This is a purely spiritual and a religious process. So it’s up to the religious leader, particularly his holiness the Dalai Lama, to decide, not the administration, but once his reincarnation is recognised, then the role of the CTA comes into being. Q. The other issue is the return to India of another Tibetan spiritual leader, the Karmapa. Recently, we saw senior officials from Sikkim giving indications that they would like him to come back. A. Definitely, devotees of Karmapa Rinpoche are very concerned and I’m sure Karmapa Rinpoche also would like to return. But at the same time, there has to be mutual understanding between the government of India and Karmapa Rinpoche himself. We are talking about how to smoothen things out and look at ways where there could be a mutual consensus on how he should return and how he will be treated in India. So, those concerns are being discussed and the Indian government is also very keen that he returns. Q. Has there been progress in this regard? A. It has only been three months since I took over. Whenever I get the opportunity to go to Europe next time, I think there will be confabulations on this matter, including a personal meeting with the Karmapa Rinpoche. I will be playing the role of messenger if it helps. Q. There has been some concern over the younger members of the Tibetan community moving out of India to the West, particularly the US. Is there a concern that maybe you’re losing some of the brightest from among the community? A. On any given issue, there are good sides, bad sides to it. So we can’t make a judgment on what is completely white or what is completely black, because there are advantages of people moving out, in the sense that they have more economic opportunities. And because of that, they’re able to support their families here or inside Tibet. So, in terms of economic benefits, those are there, and also political benefits in terms of Tibetans being resettled in 25-30 different countries and becoming nationals of those countries...and [understanding] the system. So, there are a lot of opportunities to optimise the potential that the younger generation of Tibetans, who reside in other countries, provide to lobby for Tibet in their respective nations. But on the other side, the Tibetans who are resettled there are not in compact communities, even if they are in one city. But fortunately, because of the leadership of his holiness, the Dalai Lama, we have Tibetan associations everywhere. So, irrespective of whether they are dispersed in different regions, they still come together for major events and political activities that concern the cause of Tibet. Here also in India, we have challenges as well as opportunities. We talked about integration, which will be long-term and a difficult task to convince Tibetans to integrate...but at the same time, we can work towards creating opportunities and windows for people to look at things from a different perspective and see how best it can be managed. Q. There was a significant uptick in the US administration’s outreach towards the Tibetan administration during the term of president Donald Trump. Do you see that continuing? A. Definitely, it’s all because of the benevolence of his holiness, the Dalai Lama, and the respect that the leadership and the people of America have towards him. So, that trend will continue because it’s not just the administration or the White House or the state department, but also within the Congress, which is bipartisan, bicameral in nature. Perhaps, Tibet is one of the very few issues where the two parties [Democrats and Republicans] can come together. I have had personal experience, having served there. So that will continue, definitely. Q. Have you had good cooperation with the Indian side in countering the Covid-19 pandemic, especially issues such as vaccination and medical treatment? A. Definitely, it’s mainly because of the support and help of the Indian government that we have been able to vaccinate a lot of people, comparable to many developed countries, because we have completed more than 92% of vaccination for the first shot and more than 50% of the second shot. The support from the government has been immense, but at the same time, irrespective of the differences – the issues of differences are few – the issues that we can come together [on] are many. And one of these issues is Covid. So, many monasteries, many institutions, non-governmental organisations and individuals contributed in a combined effort To make the, uh, uh, to handle the Covid situation in a manner that any society would have liked to see. I’m very proud that everybody was very involved in this and very appreciative of the cooperative effort with which they did the job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dalai-lama-alone-will-have-final-say-on-reincarnation-cta-chief-penpa-tsering-101631721779118.html

British Prime Boris Johnson removed Dominic Raab as foreign secretary after UK's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Elizabeth Truss, who has brokered a series of deals with the EU since its complete exit from the bloc, has been appointed as the new foreign secretary. She became the only second female foreign secretary in the UK's history.Priti Patel, another Indian-origin leader, retained her position as UK home secretary.Johnson has shown trust in Sunak's handling of Britain's economy amid multiple waves of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) which forced nationwide lockdowns. Sunak was highly rated both in surveys of Conservative Party members and in polls of the general public, which helped him secure his place in the Cabinet.On the other hand, Opposition parties had been demanding Raab's resignation for failing to make a crucial phone call to his then Afghan counterpart Hanif Atmar as the Taliban advanced on Kabul last month. Raab’s office was advised to call Atmar to request him to help evacuate local translators who had helped British officials and the military. But Raab, who was on holiday in Crete, never reportedly made the phone call.The major rejig comes amid a decline in Johnson's approval rating. In May, the Conservative leader's approval rating declined to 38% from 45%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-rishi-sunak-retains-role-as-uk-finance-minister-in-cabinet-rejig-101631718171456.html
15-09-2021||World||US says it had a last-ditch deal with Taliban, but Ashraf Ghani's escape derailed it||The United States had struck a last-minute deal with the Taliban according to which the Taliban were not supposed to enter Kabul and Ashraf Ghani was supposed to remain in his post until a settlement was reached in Qatar, but Ghani's last-minute decision to flee the country about which no one apparently had no inkling derailed everything and resulted in the fall of Kabul, Zalmay Khalilzad has told the Financial Times. Zalmay was the special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation at the state department and, as he claimed, he managed to secure a two-week grace period hours before the fall of Kabul.Ghani's escape led to a vacuum and the Afghan army was disbanded. "There were questions of law and order in Kabul after Ghani fled . . . The Talibs [then] . . . say: ‘Are you going to take responsibility for security of Kabul now? . . . And then you know what happened, we weren’t going to take responsibility,” Khalilzad said in the interview. He said on August 12, the US and the Taliban met and reached an accord on August 14 that the Taliban will not capture Kabul; they will wait outside Kabul.Ashraf Ghani was not going to be part of the future government as his resignation was a precondition set by the Taliban, but Ghani was supposed to be there till the negotiation goes on.While this narrative fits into what the US has been claiming that Kabul's fall was hastened by the crumbling of the government, Ashraf Ghani repeatedly claimed that he was forced to leave the country to avoid bloodshed. In his video messages, he reiterated that he did not escape the country; he was made to leave.Khalilzad, the 70-year-old Republican, who is blamed for the Doha peace agreement, was not removed from his post as special Afghanistan envoy even during Biden's time. Born in Afghanistan's Mazar-i-Sharif, Khalilzad is an ethnic Pashtun. His entry to the United States was as a high school exchange student.He said though what happened in Kabul and how the US troops had to withdraw from the country was not his or the US's responsibility, he mourned the failure to deliver a political settlement with the Taliban, which should have happened years earlier. "There will be a lot of soul searching," he said in the interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-says-ashraf-ghani-s-escape-derailed-last-ditch-deal-with-taliban-to-save-kabul-101631715499048.html

Moon was commenting on Seoul's defence capabilities after Seoul's first successful test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile."Enhancing our missile capability is exactly what's needed as deterrence against North Korea's provocation," Moon had said after the test.In a statement carried by North Korean state media, Kim Yo Jong said that Moon's remark was inappropriate, warning a “complete destruction” of ties with the South. The test came hours after the South Korean and Japanese militaries reported Pyongyang firing two ballistic missiles into the sea. The apparent display of military might by the two countries is expected to exacerbate tensions in the Korean Peninsula. Experts suggest that the arms race has accelerated under Moon's regime as he pushes for greater autonomy on foreign policy matters amid military developments in both North Korea and China. "South Korea would face many political and legal obstacles to develop nuclear weapons, both internal and external," Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a Korea expert at King's College London, told news agency Reuters. "So it will develop all other capabilities to deter North Korea and show who the strongest Korea is," he added.The negotiations to stop North Korea from nuclear tests and developing ballistic missiles have ended in a deadlock. While the US military said that the missile launches did not pose an immediate threat to US personnel or allies,  they underlined the destabilising impact of the North's weapons programme.Pyongyang has been violating UN Security Council resolutions despite facing global sanctions. A US state department spokesperson said that the missile launch posed a threat to Pyongyang's neighbours, but didn't mention South Korea's tests.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irked-by-moon-s-deterrence-remark-kim-jong-un-s-sister-warns-of-destruction-of-south-korean-ties-101631713864826.html
15-09-2021||World||UK PM reshuffles cabinet, education secretary Williamson first to indicate exit||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday readied a fresh cabinet "to build back better from the pandemic" in a reshuffle that cast foreign secretary Dominic Raab's future into doubt.Raab, who deputised as premier last April when Johnson was in intensive care with Covid-19, has faced sustained criticism for his handling of the Afghanistan crisis.The spotlight was also on education secretary Gavin Williamson, who like Raab was notably absent from the government front bench of the House of Commons at Johnson's weekly question and answer session.The gaffe-prone Williamson was the first minister to indicate he was out of a job, tweeting that it had been a "privilege" to serve in his role since 2019 when Johnson took office on a vow to "get Brexit done".Now that Britain has formally left the European Union after a years-long divorce, the Conservative government has been battling to tame one of the world's highest per capita death tolls from the pandemic.Johnson on Tuesday outlined a plan to restore restrictions if needed, to avert fresh crisis for the state-run National Health Service heading into what could be a difficult winter with hospitalisations rising again.After days of speculation, a Downing Street source confirmed the reshuffle was happening, saying Johnson would "put in place a strong and united team to build back better from the pandemic"."The PM will be appointing ministers this afternoon with a focus on uniting and levelling up the whole country," the source added.Vacationing as Kabul fellRaab was on holiday on a Greek island as the government scrambled to evacuate British nationals and Afghan staff as the Taliban advanced and seized power last month.Trade Secretary Liz Truss, who has brokered a series of deals since Britain's full exit from the EU in January, has been tipped to replace Raab.Williamson meanwhile has faced a barrage of complaints about his handling of school closures, examination arrangements and university admissions during the coronavirus emergency.Brexit point man Michael Gove has been suggested as a replacement for Home Secretary Priti Patel, another arch Brexiteer who has been under pressure due to a surge in migrant crossings from France, along with bullying claims.However, Patel sat alongside Johnson in the Commons on Wednesday, suggesting she may be safe.Finance minister Rishi Sunak was another flanking the prime minister, having emerged as a Conservative darling during the pandemic.But Justice Secretary Robert Buckland and Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick confirmed on Twitter that they were on the way out."On to the next adventure," Buckland said.As Johnson met with colleagues in his office inside the Commons, away from the public glare of 10 Downing Street, his official spokesman said the premier understood "the importance of having a diverse cabinet".But the spokesman would not guarantee that female representation in the ministerial team would be maintained at its current high level.Political strategist Dominic Cummings, the Brexit mastermind who fell out with Johnson last year, branded the shake-up the "Carrie reshuffle", suggesting that allies of the prime minister's wife will be rewarded.The Downing Street spokesman denied this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-reshuffles-cabinet-education-secretary-williamson-first-to-indicate-exit-101631714977662.html
15-09-2021||World||Hurricane Nicholas enters Louisiana, causes heavy rain across landscape||Hurricane Nicholas weakened to a tropical depression as it crawled from Texas into southern Louisiana on Wednesday, unleashing heavy rain across a landscape where Hurricane Ida destroyed thousands of rooftops now covered with flimsy tarps.Forecasters said Nicholas would slow to a stall over central Louisiana through Thursday, with plenty of water still to dump east of its center, drenching the Gulf Coast as far as the western Florida Panhandle. Southeast Louisiana faced the biggest flooding threat, and Governor John Bel Edwards warned people to take it seriously, even though Nicholas was no longer the hurricane that made landfall in Texas on Tuesday.“This is a very serious storm, particularly in those areas that were so heavily impacted by Hurricane Ida,” Edwards said.Forecasters warned people along the central Gulf Coast that up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rainfall are possible through Friday in places across a region still recovering from Category 4 hurricanes — Ida weeks ago and Laura last year.Galveston, Texas, recorded nearly 14 inches (35 centimeters) of rain from Nicholas, the 14th named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, while Houston reported more than 6 inches (15 centimeters). The New Orleans office of the National Weather Service said late Tuesday that as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain could fall in parts of Louisiana, with some areas seeing particularly intense periods of 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) of rainfall per hour.In the small Louisiana community of Pointe-aux-Chenes, Ida peeled open the tin roof of Terry and Patti Dardar’s home, leaving them without power and water for more than two weeks since. Nicholas made the damage that much worse, soaking the upstairs. But it also provided them with badly needed water, which their son Terren and grandchildren collected in jugs and poured into a huge plastic container through a strainer. From there, a pump powered by a generator brought the water inside.His mom, Patti, said the family didn’t have anywhere else to go after Ida, so members were doing their best during Nicholas.“We ain’t got no other place," she said. “This is our home."Governor Edwards noted that 95,000 electric customers were still without power more than two weeks after Ida hit. And he said the new storm could mean some who had regained power might lose it again. Homes already badly damaged by Ida were not yet repaired to the extent that they could withstand heavy rain, Edwards added.Energy companies working to restore power to remaining areas in the state said Wednesday that they were watching Nicholas closely but didn't expect it to affect their restoration times.A spokesman for Entergy Louisiana said Nicholas so far has not caused any delays to previously announced times to restore power. Crews cannot operate when lightning is within 10 miles (16 kilometers) and can’t put bucket trucks in the air at winds greater than 30 mph (50 kph), said Jerry Nappi. But once conditions improve they would quickly resume work.Joe Ticheli, manager and CEO of South Louisiana Electric Cooperative Association, said rain really doesn’t stop the linemen, who are outfitted with slicker suits and grit.“These are tough guys, and they relish all of this,” he said. The coop services about 21,000 customers across five parishes including parts of the hard-hit Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes. Ticheli said the coop has returned power to about 75% of its customers with the remaining 25% mostly in the hardest-hit parts of southern Terrebonne parish.In the weather-battered city of Lake Charles, in southwestern Louisiana, Mayor Nic Hunter said ahead of Nicholas the city prepositioned assets should they be needed, and city crews scoured the drainage system to keep it free from debris that might cause clogs and flooding.Lake Charles has been hammered. Hurricane Laura caused substantial structural damage across the city of nearly 80,000 residents. Weeks later Hurricane Delta ripped through the same area. Freezing temperatures in January burst pipes across the city, and then a May rainstorm swamped houses and businesses yet again.The mayor says he's naturally worried about how his people are coping.“With what people have gone through over the last 16 months here in Lake Charles, they are very, understandably, despondent, emotional. Any time we have even a hint of a weather event approaching, people get scared,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-nicholas-enters-louisiana-causes-heavy-rain-across-landscape-101631711869061.html
15-09-2021||World||Covid-19: China’s Fujian outbreak spreads||The Chinese education ministry on Wednesday said students and teachers should “stay put” during the upcoming holidays in China in the backdrop of the country’s first “school-centric” Covid-19 outbreak in Fujian province.The number of Covid-19 cases in the eastern coastal Fujian province rose to 152 on Wednesday, prompting authorities to shut down more schools, impose stricter travel restrictions and expand mass nucleic acid testing.Tourist places have been closed and large-scale gathering activities such as weddings have been cancelled in the province.From Wednesday, kindergartens in some regions of Fujian’s capital city Fuzhou suspended classes. “The investment zone with investors from the nearby Taiwan island conducted nucleic acid tests for over 10,000 teachers and students from 69 kindergartens,” the Global Times reported.Though all the cases until now have only been reported from Fujian - the cities of Putian, Quanzhou and Xiamen - the fresh outbreak has also prompted cities in other parts of the country to issue travel warnings ahead of major holidays comprising the mid-Autumn festival next week and the week-long National Day break in October.Cities like Guangzhou, Jilin and Maoming in other provinces and provinces like Heilongjiang and Shanxi have advised citizens against non-essential travel.Chinese state media has called the Fujian outbreak the first “school-centred” Covid-19 cluster in China - dozens of school-going children have tested positive, the youngest a four-year-old.In Putian, for example, the first city where cases were discovered, the current outbreak has spread to two kindergartens, three primary schools and one middle school.Taking a cue, Wang Dengfeng, an education ministry official, said on Wednesday that students and teachers were being encouraged to stay put during the upcoming holidays when millions of Chinese are expected to travel. “We encourage everyone to stay in the area for the holidays if there is no essential need to leave,” Wang Dengfeng said.The warning from Wang Dengfeng came despite education ministry data showing on Wednesday that China has fully vaccinated 91% of students aged 12-17 against the coronavirus.The two-dose vaccination rate of teachers and students over 18 years old has exceeded 95%, the ministry said.China has largely been able to contain the Covid-19 pandemic - first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 - but new outbreaks continue to occur in various parts of the country.A Delta variant outbreak in July and August spread to several provinces, raising concern about new and more contagious variants.As of Tuesday, China’s national health commission (NHC) says it has administered more than 2.15 billion doses of vaccines, fully vaccinating more than 900 million people.The efficacy of the domestically developed serums, however, has been called into question particularly in dealing with the Delta variant.As of September 14, mainland China had recorded 95,413 confirmed cases and the number of deaths remained at 4636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-china-s-fujian-outbreak-spreads-101631712058150.html

15-09-2021||World||Al Qaeda likely to be capable of attacking US from Afghanistan in a year: Report||Al Qaeda will take a year or two maximum to become capable of planning an attack on the United States from Afghanistan, a Bloomberg report quoting two senior US intelligence officials, has claimed. The group has already started activities in Afghanistan after the Taliban captured the country and if this is any indication, then the terrorist group will be on their feet by a year or two.This comes at a time al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was rumoured to be dead, was seen in a video released by the al Qaeda on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attack.The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, following the withdrawal of the US troops from the country is being seen as a catalyst to terrorist activities in the region, though the interim Cabinet of the Taliban government reiterated that they will not allow their land to be used for any terror activity. However, the Cabinet itself has terrorists with international sanctions.“The current assessment probably, conservatively, is one to two years for al-Qaeda to build some capability to at least threaten the homeland,” Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said. While completing the withdrawal of the troops, Pentagon maintained that it will have "over-the-horizon" capabilities to defend the country. In fact, following the blast at Kabul airport on August 26, the US carried out two strikes in Afghanistan.“We’re thinking about ways to gain access back into Afghanistan with all kinds of sources and accesses,” Berrier said.CIA deputy director David Cohen agreed with the timeline of one to two years and said that al Qaeda has already started its activities. US-based SITE Intelligence Group said in the latest hour-long video, al-Zawahiri was seen speaking on several issues, including the situation of Afghanistan, the withdrawal of the US troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/al-qaeda-likely-to-be-capable-of-attacking-us-from-afghanistan-in-a-year-report-101631706518590.html

Under Plan A, which was announced by health secretary Sajid Javid, ministers will encourage the unvaccinated people to take the vaccine dose, provide vaccines to children between 12-15 years and start a booster programme for millions, the BBC report said. The plan will also comprise continuing testing, tracing infections and self-isolating those who have Covid-19, it added.Under plan B, compulsory vaccine passports might be used for mass events, face masks might be legally mandated in some places, people will be urged to be more cautious and might also be advised to work from home, the above report also said. However, this plan will only be imposed if the NHS is under pressure.The UK has so far recorded 7,282,810 cases, 134,446 deaths and 5,847,593 recoveries due to the coronavirus disease. On Tuesday, the country saw another high of 26,628 new cases. Despite the daily tally remaining high, the government has regarded the current pandemic pressure on the NHS as “manageable”.England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty, said during Tuesday’s press conference that while Covid-19 cases had stabilised to some extent, the UK is approaching the most difficult part of the year, adding the number of infected patients is “drifting up” and variable across the country. “We are entering the winter with this reasonably high level and it wouldn’t take many doubling times to get into trouble,” Whitty further said.Meanwhile, a person, on the condition of anonymity, told Bloomberg that the government might bring back the legislation to enforce a regional or national lockdown in the UK as a last resort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukpm-boris-johnson-issues-3-warnings-if-covid-19-cases-spike-101631701628787.html

It was not immediately clear how many women players and their family members were allowed to enter the neighbouring Pakistan, the country accused of covertly providing support to Islamist fundamentalists.Pakistan’s information and broadcasting minister Fawad Chaudhary welcomed the members of the Afghan football team, saying the players entered the country via the Torkham border. He further stated that they had a valid Afghanistan’s passport and Pakistani visa, but didn’t elaborate what kind of visas were issued.“We welcome Afghanistan Women football team they arrived at Torkham Border from Afghanistan, The players were in possession of valid Afg Passport, pak visa,” tweeted Chaudhary, adding that the Afghans were Nouman Nadeem of Pakistan Football Federation.Pakistan’s English language daily, The Dawn, reported that the female footballers were issued emergency humanitarian visas after the Taliban’s return to power.Also Read | 'India's concern inappropriate': Taliban say nothing wrong in China helping AfghanistanThe Islamist hardliners don’t want women to play any sport, especially where they could potentially be exposed.

Flogging, stoning and executing the violators in public were the common modes of punishment.

15-09-2021||World||Filmmaker Sahraa Karimi’s plea: ‘Don’t recognise Taliban govt in Afghanistan’||The head of Afghanistan’s state-run cinema company has called on the international film community to push their respective governments to boycott recognising the Taliban administration in Kabul. Sahraa Karimi made the clarion call on the sidelines of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in Canada.A filmmaker and activist, Sahraa Karimi became the first woman to head Afghan Film back in 2019. “I believe we shouldn’t be silent. Politically, filmmakers should raise their voice and push decision-makers not to recognise the Taliban,” she said in a virtual conversation with Afghan-Canadian director Tarique Qayumi.She asked filmmakers around the world to join in an “act of resilience” and tweet out the hashtag #DoNotRecogniseTaliban. Sahraa Karimi, who escaped Kabul soon after it fell to the Taliban, had been given the scope to express her views on the Afghan crisis at the TIFF and the Venice Film Festival.The filmmaker said if the international community recognises the Taliban government, the future of those like her, especially women, “will be destroyed”.As chairperson of government-run Afghan Film, she hasn’t heard yet from the Taliban-run ministry of information and culture, except for an advisory that says women in Afghanistan should remain at home.Karimi was included into the TIFF’s programme just two days before the festival commenced on September 9. Sahraa Karimi had rushed to Kabul airport on August 15, but due to the chaos surrounding the airlift ops, it took her nearly 40 hours to get a flight out of Afghanistan. She travelled with her brother’s family, and was accompanied by two female assistants, as she first went to Istanbul before heading to Kiev later on.She is also a director, and her debut feature, Hava, Maryam, Ayesha, a women-centric project, was the first fully Afghan production in a long time. It was filmed entirely in Kabul in Afghanistan with a cast of Afghan actors. It received critical acclaim at the Venice Film Festival.Sahraa Karimi’s next film is unlikely to be filmed in her home country, now run by the Taliban group. She said it will be about the experience of fleeing Afghanistan as the Taliban assumed control, and it is tentatively titled: Flight from Kabul. “It’s very important to tell this story,” she said, adding that project may be filmed elsewhere unless a “miracle” occurs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/filmmaker-sahraa-karimi-s-plea-don-t-recognise-taliban-govt-in-afghanistan-101631693336202.html

The mission is known as Inspiration4.The spaceship's trajectory will take it to an altitude of 575 kilometers (357 miles), deeper into space than the International Space Station (ISS). After that, the capsule will descend back to Earth, landing off the coast of Florida with the help of giant parachutes.The trip is paid for by Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old high school dropout and founder of payments processing company Shift4 Payments. The other three crew members are 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux, a pediatric cancer survivor and physician assistant, 42-year-old Chris Sembroski, a former US Air Force employee and Sian Proctor, a 51-year-old geology professor.Here are the five key things to know about the mission:1. This spacecraft has already taken 10 astronauts to the ISS on three separate missions.2. The Dragon capsule, eight meters high and four meters wide, has been modified for this flight. A huge glass dome has been installed to offer passengers a 360-degree view of space.3. The Dragon capsule will orbit Earth for three days at an altitude higher than the ISS.4. The crew trained for just under six months, compared to years of preparation required for professional astronauts. Though the flight is expected to be fully automated, the team has been trained by SpaceX to take control in the event of an emergency.5. The crew members' sleep, heart rate, blood and cognitive functions will be analyzed during the mission in order to study how rookies react in space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacexs-all-civilian-crew-to-take-off-today-5-facts-about-inspiration4-mission-101631690884957.html

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reportedly appeared on a platform in Kim Il Sung square and waved at the crowd. However, there was no reports of him addressing the gathering, according to North Korean media outlet Rodong Sinmun.The country's media reported on Monday that the North Korean military test-fired a new "long-range cruise missile" on Saturday and Sunday, amid a long standoff with the United States over its nuclear programme.ALSO READ | 'Lift sanctions on liquor and suits’: North Korea’s precondition to restart talks with USNorth Korea remains under international sanctions for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, which Pyongyang says it needs to defend against any ‘invasion’ by the United States.The extremely secretive nation severed almost all of its ties with the outside world in 2020 to prevent an influx of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases.Even though there has been no reported major outbreak of Covid-19 in North Korea, and no indications that the pandemic struck the country, experts doubt the veracity of Pyongyang's claim the country has not seen a single case of the virus.ALSO READ | North Korea rejects nearly 3 million Chinese Covid-19 shots, gives humanitarian angleEarlier this year, North Korea reportedly turned down the proposal for Covid-19 vaccine aid through an United Nations-backed immunisation programme.

15-09-2021||World||Taliban leaders Baradar, Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani involved in major row: Report||Abdul Ghani Baradar, the deputy prime minister in the Taliban setup in Kabul, and Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani, a minister and senior leader of the Haqqani Network, were involved in a “major row” over the sharing of power, according to the BBC. The argument between the two leaders over the make-up of the Taliban’s interim cabinet occurred at the presidential palace in Kabul last week, BBC cited unnamed senior Taliban officials as saying. There have been reports of differences between various sections of the group’s leadership over the composition of the governing structure in Kabul almost since the Taliban marched into Kabul on August 15. The leaders from the Taliban’s political office were believed to be opposed to a larger role for the Haqqani Network, which is considered the main fighting arm of the Taliban and has close ties with Pakistan’s military establishment. There were also differences between leaders from Kandahar province, the Taliban’s traditional stronghold, and leaders from north and east Afghanistan. After Baradar disappeared from public view in recent days and rumours swirled that he had been shot and injured during a quarrel at the presidential palace in Kabul, the leader issued an audio message on Monday to say that he was alive and “away on trips”. BBC Pashto cited a Taliban source as saying that Baradar and Haqqani, the minister for refugees, had “exchanged strong words, as their followers brawled with each other nearby”. Another senior Taliban member based in Qatar and a person connected to those involved “confirmed that an argument had taken place late last week”. The BBC’s sources said the argument broke out because Baradar was “unhappy about the structure of their interim government”. The row also stemmed from “divisions over who in the Taliban should take credit for their victory in Afghanistan”. Baradar “reportedly believes the emphasis should be placed on diplomacy carried out by people like him, while members of the Haqqani group – which is run by one of the most senior Taliban figures – and their backers say it was achieved through fighting”, BBC reported. People familiar with developments told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity that there was considerable disquiet among the Taliban’s top leadership over several appointments unilaterally made by the Haqqani Network even before the interim cabinet in Kabul was formed. The Haqqani Network is also responsible for the security of Kabul. The Taliban have denied all reports of disagreements within their leadership. The Taliban officials told the BBC that Baradar had left Kabul and travelled to the southern city of Kandahar following the row. In his audio message, Baradar is heard saying he was “away on trips”. He added: “Wherever I am at the moment, we are all fine.” Despite the audio message being posted on several Taliban websites, social media users questioned why Baradar had not issued a video statement. The Taliban have released conflicting statements on what Baradar is currently doing. A spokesman said Baradar travelled to Kandahar to meet the Taliban’s supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada but later told BBC Pashto he was “tired and wanted some rest”. Baradar, who held several key positions in the Taliban’s earlier regime and was imprisoned in Pakistan during 2010-18, has played a crucial role in the Taliban’s negotiations with the US and other countries. He signed the controversial peace deal with the US in February 2020. Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani is the brother of Jalaluddin Haqqani, the founder of the Haqqani Network that has been blamed for some of the most violent attacks in Afghanistan, including the 2008 suicide car bombing at the gate of the Indian embassy in Kabul that killed nearly 60 people. The group has been designated a terror organisation by the US and the UN and its current head, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is the interior minister in new Taliban setup and carries a $5-million US bounty on his head. There has also been much speculation about the status of Akhundzada, who has not been seen in public since the group took over Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-leaders-baradar-khalil-ur-rahman-haqqani-involved-in-major-row-report-101631689616298.html
15-09-2021||World||North Korea fires 2 ballistic missiles into waters off eastern coast||North Korea fired two ballistic missiles into waters off its eastern coast Wednesday afternoon, two days after claiming to have tested a newly developed missile in a resumption of its weapons displays after a six-month lull.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missiles were launched from central North Korea on Wednesday afternoon. Japan’s coast guard says they landed outside Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone in the waters between Japan and the Korean Peninsula. Seoul said South Korean and US intelligence authorities are analyzing more details about the North Korean launches.South Korean and US intelligence authorities are analyzing more details about the North Korean launches, the joint chiefs' statement said, adding that South Korea has boosted its anti-North Korea surveillance posture.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the missiles landed outside of the Japanese Exclusive Economic Zone in the waters between northwestern Japan and the Korean Peninsula.“The firings threaten the peace and safety of Japan and the region and are absolutely outrageous,” Suga said. “The government of Japan is determined to further step up our vigilance and surveillance to be prepared for any contingencies,” he said.Japan’s coast guard said no ships or aircraft reported damage due to the North Korean launches.North Korea had said Monday it tested a newly developed cruise missile twice over the weekend. North Korea’s state media described the missile as a “strategic weapon of great significance,” implying they were developed with the intent to arm them with nuclear warheads. According to North Korean accounts, the missile flew about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles), a distance putting all of Japan and US military installations there within reach.Many experts say the weekend tests suggested North Korea is pushing to bolster its weapons arsenal amid a deadlock in nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington.Wednesday's launches came as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was in Seoul for meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and other senior officials to discuss the stalled nuclear diplomacy with the North.It's unusual for North Korea to make provocative launches when China, its last major ally and biggest aid provider, is engaged in a major diplomatic event.Moon’s office said Moon told Wang that he appreciates China’s role in the international diplomatic push to resolve the North Korean nuclear standoff and asked for Beijing’s continuing support of such efforts. Wang called for further development in bilateral relations between Beijing and Seoul, but it wasn't known if Wang specifically addressed the North Korea issue.Moon’s office said the government plans to hold an unscheduled national security council meeting later Wednesday.The nuclear diplomacy between the United States and North Korea has stalled since 2019 when the Americans rejected the North’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling an aging nuclear facility. Kim’s government has so far threatened to build high-tech weapons targeting the United States and rejected the Biden administration’s overtures for dialogue, demanding that Washington abandon its “hostile” policies first.The North’s resumption of testing activity is likely an attempt at pressuring the Biden administration over the diplomatic freeze after Kim failed to leverage his arsenal for economic benefits during the presidency of Donald Trump.North Korea ended a yearlong pause in ballistic tests in March by firing two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, continuing a tradition of testing new US administrations with weapons demonstrations aimed at measuring Washington’s response and wresting concessions.North Korea still maintains a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, a sign that it may not want to completely scuttle the nuclear negotiations with the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-fires-2-ballistic-missiles-into-waters-off-eastern-coast-101631684062698.html
15-09-2021||World||Chinese court dismisses high-profile #MeToo case||A Beijing court has dismissed a high-profile sexual harassment case levelled by a woman against a top television host, saying there’s insufficient evidence to support her claims.The allegations of groping and kissing levelled by Zhou Xiaoxuan, then an intern, against Zhu Jun, anchor with national broadcaster, CCTV, were at the centre of China’s MeToo movement in 2018.The incident had taken place in 2014, Zhou Xiaoxuan had said in her detailed allegations posted online.Zhu Jun had denied the allegations and counter-sued Zhou Xiaoxuan for defamation. The court’s dismissal of the case late on Tuesday night is likely to have an impact on the movement.“The Haidian People’s Court said in a judgment which only identified Zhou and Zhu by their surnames that the evidence submitted was “insufficient” to prove sexual harassment,” Reuters news agency said in a report on Wednesday.Zhou Xiaoxuan, according to Reuters, told a small group of supporters after the court’s decision that after three years of pushing her case she felt “exhausted” and “disappointed” on hearing the verdict. In her view, Zhou Xiaoxuan said, she had not been given a chance to give a proper account of what happened.Zhou Xiaoxuan said her team would appeal the verdict. “We will definitely appeal, because in this case we didn’t look at any of the core facts at all, that is all of the surveillance videos,” the statement said.In an online interview with HT in 2018, Zhou Xiaoxuan, then known by her moniker, Xianzi, had said that the #MeToo movement in India had been inspiring.She had said the anti-sexual harassment movement in India was a source of “great encouragement and inspiration” to her and others fighting the battle in China amid social stigma and restricted media coverage.“Although the target of my allegation is just a TV presenter, people (in China) associate him with authorities and think of him as someone who has a positive image,” Zhou Xiaoxuan had said.The anchor’s close association with the government had often made her nervous. “Inevitably, there were doubts and criticism. We were haunted by censorship, and people kept accusing me and others of not calling the police from the very beginning,” she had told HT.Last week, a court in the eastern Shandong province dismissed another high-profile sexual assault case brought by a female employee of technology giant Alibaba, who alleged she was raped by a manager after a dinner.The court ruled that “forcible indecency” committed by the accused was not a crime.In July, Chinese-Canadian pop star Kris Wu, who has acted in the 2017 Hollywood movie XXX: Return of Xander Cage, was arrested after several women came forward alleging rape and sexual coercion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-dismisses-high-profile-metoo-case-101631684275327.html
15-09-2021||World||Canada elections: 18.5% rise in advance voting||Ahead of federal elections on September 20, Canadians have started to vote, with a nearly 18.5% increase in advance voting figures over 2019, and almost 1 million mail-in ballots being requisitioned, a twenty-fold rise.As the period for advance voting, which was from Friday morning to Tuesday morning expired, Elections Canada estimated that 5.78 million voters have utilised that opportunity, an increase of 18.46% over that recorded in October 2019, when the last federal elections were held. The expanded options were introduced by Elections Canada due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and were particularly important as the fourth wave continues in the country.In a release, chief electoral officer Stéphane Perrault said, “I want to thank the electors who took advantage of advance polls for their patience and their help in making this a safe experience for everyone. I also want to thank the tens of thousands of election workers for making this possible.”The outlet Global News also reported that as the deadline ended on Tuesday, approximately 1.03 million Canadians registered for special mail-in ballots. That does not include over 50,000 Canadians abroad who are using that path to vote overseas.While Elections Canada had originally expected between two and five million voters to seek mail-in ballots, the actual figure is lower but several times the 50,000 mark from 2019.Turnout could be the critical component of the result of the snap elections called by incumbent Prime Minister and leader of the ruling Liberal Party Justin Trudeau on August 15. His party fell 13 seats short of the 170-majority mark in the House of Commons in 2019. This call was a gamble to convert that minority into a majority, but according to the latest polls, the margins between the Liberals and the principal opposition Conservative Party are so narrow that the result of the elections could be unpredictable. The tracker 338 Canada projected that the Liberals could get 146 seats, 11 fewer than in 2019 and the Conservatives 126, an addition of five. The Liberals have the slimmest of leads in overall vote share, at 32% against 31.7% for the Conservatives. The poll tracker from the outlet CBC News gives the ruling party just a 16% chance of getting a majority.The turnout was 67% in 2019, a fall of 1.3 per cent from 2015, when Trudeau garnered a majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-18-5-rise-in-advance-voting-101631683315334.html
15-09-2021||World||China tells Taliban it will not interfere in Afghanistan’s internal affairs||China has assured the Taliban government in Afghanistan that Beijing respects its sovereignty and territorial integrity and will not interfere in its internal affairs.In a meeting with acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Tuesday, Chinese ambassador to Afghanistan Wang Yu said Beijing hopes that a “broad and inclusive” political structure is being established in Afghanistan.The assurance from China comes on the same day Beijing said it will donate three million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Afghanistan in the first batch with more emergency supplies to follow.The vaccines will be part of the $31 million worth of food, winter weather supplies, vaccines, and medicine that Beijing pledged to provide Kabul earlier this month.In Kabul, Wang Yu told Amir Khan Muttaqi: “China respects the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan, will not interfere in Afghanistan’s internal affairs, and supports the Afghan people to independently choose a development path that suits their national conditions.”This was the second publicised high-level China-Afghanistan meet in Kabul after the Taliban swept to power last month.In late August, Abdul Salam Hanafi, the deputy head of the Taliban political met Ambassador Wang Yu in Kabul.During his Tuesday meeting with Amir Khan Muttaqi, Wang Yu thanked the Afghan side for its efforts to protect the safety of Chinese citizens, Chinese-funded enterprises, and the embassy in Afghanistan.Amir Khan Muttaqi, according to a report in Chinese official media, thanked China for its support and assistance, saying that China is Afghanistan’s friendly neighbour and its policy towards Afghanistan has always been fair and objective.With the help of China and the international community, Amir Khan Muttaqi said Afghanistan hopes to continuously improve its governance capabilities to better combat terrorism.He added that Afghanistan will never allow any forces to use the Afghan territory to do things that endanger the interests of China and other countriesIn Geneva, Chen Xu, head of the Chinese Mission to the UN, said China will donate, in the first batch, three million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Afghanistan, with more emergency supplies to follow.“China has decided to urgently provide food, materials for winter, Covid-19 vaccines, and medicines worth 200 million yuan ($31 million) to Afghanistan,” Chen Xu said.“China will continue to respect the Afghan people’s wish and needs, and do its best to support Afghanistan in its peaceful reconstruction and economic development,” Chen Xu told the High-level Ministerial Meeting on the Humanitarian Situation in Afghanistan.Chen Xu also said that China supports the UN in playing a bigger role in alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and helping Afghanistan achieve a smooth transition and embark on the path of peaceful development at an early date.“China welcomes UN’s flash appeal for humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan, supports UN to strengthen cooperation with other multilateral mechanisms related to the Afghanistan issue and form synergy by complementing each other,” he was quoted as saying by the official news agency, Xinhua.He told the meeting that under the current circumstances, the international community needs to step up assistance to Afghanistan.The United States and its allies were more obligated to provide economic, livelihood and humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, Chen Xu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tells-taliban-it-will-not-interfere-in-afghanistan-s-internal-affairs-101631682055438.html
15-09-2021||World||California Governor Newsom retains job, sweeps recall election||California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom handily beat back an effort to oust him from office in Tuesday's special election, overcoming a Republican campaign to unseat him over his liberal policies on immigration, Covid-19 and crime.Newsom, a first-term governor beset by challenges including the Covid-19 pandemic, extreme drought and severe wildfires, boosted turnout among Democrats with a flurry of late campaigning and easily overcame the move by Republicans to recall him.By late Tuesday, returns showed Newsom easily winning a majority of support from voters who said he should remain in office. With 46% of precincts reporting, Newsom was up by more than 30 points, with 67% support compared to 33% who wanted to recall him, state data showed.U.S. television networks projected Newsom had defeated the recall effort about 40 minutes after polls closed on Tuesday."I'm humbled and grateful to the millions and millions of Californians that exercised their fundamental right to vote," Newsom said in a victory speech Tuesday night in the state capital of Sacramento."Economic justice, social justice, racial justice, environmental justice, our values where California has made so much progress, all of those things were on the ballot this evening," Newsom said.The decisive win significantly bolsters Newsom's chances in next year's regularly scheduled gubernatorial elections, while weakening any likely Republican challengers, said Republican political strategist Mike Madrid.Key to Newsom's success was an all-out campaign to mobilize a Democratic base that had initially been sleepy, assuming that the governor would win because the state is so overwhelmingly Democratic.He made the campaign a referendum on former Republican U.S. President Donald Trump, linking Trump with his main challenger in the recall election, Larry Elder, a Republican talk show host who had made controversial statements about minorities and women.In the final days of the race, Newsom appeared alongside President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who formerly represented California as a U.S. senator and attorney general.Malia Cohen, an elected member of the California Board of Equalization who spent the last several days campaigning to raise turnout among African American voters, said the effort was key to the campaign's success."You can feel the energy," Cohen said Tuesday. "I see 'No on recall' on bumper stickers and buttons people are wearing. I didn't see that until Friday."With 34.3% of precincts reporting, Elder had garnered about 43% of the vote on the portion of the ballot asking who should replace Newsom if he were recalled, state data showed.Elder has vowed to remove requirements for COVID-19 vaccines and mask wearing. In the days leading up to the recall vote, he and Trump pushed the narrative that Democrats planned to steal the election.The removal of Newsom, who was elected in a landslide in 2018, would have set off alarms among Democrats, coming in one of the nation's most liberal states just over a year before the 2022 elections that will decide control of Congress.Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1 in the state, and polls consistently showed that a strong majority of voters opposed recalling Newsom.But Democrats worried that complacency among their voters could have tilted the election toward Republicans. Newsom's immigration and crime policies - along with the governor's handling of the pandemic - fueled the petition drive by conservatives to put the recall question on the ballot.In early voting and vote by mail, Democrats returned ballots at more than twice the rate of Republicans. This prompted fear among Republican leaders that their voters had taken to heart false claims of election fraud pushed by Trump and conservative media after Biden won the 2020 presidential election.In response, the California Republican Party promised to fight for election integrity and released videos showing party officials confidently mailing in ballots.Tying the recall effort to Trump and efforts in Texas, Georgia and other states to tighten abortion restrictions and impose new laws that Democrats believe curtail voting rights helped Democrats turn out their voters. "We could see changes like what's happening in Texas," said Katie Van Note, 27, a dance instructor who voted in Oceanside, just north of Carlsbad, and described her politics as left-leaning.The Secretary of State has until Oct. 22 to certify the results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-governor-newsom-retains-job-sweeps-recall-election-101631678363537.html
15-09-2021||World||Americans to pay more for organic eggs after trade spat with India over soy meal||Americans could soon be paying more for organic eggs, and it’s largely because of a trade spat the US is having with India. The US, which relies on the South Asian nation for more than 40% of its organic soy meal used to feed chickens, is investigating claims that India is unfairly dumping and subsidizing the product and harming American companies. The outcome is likely “significant tariffs,” according to Ryan Koory, director of economics for Mercaris, which tracks organic markets. That’s spooking merchandisers, who are hoarding soy meal as a response, which is contributing to tight supplies and a surge in prices.Consumers could see higher prices for organic eggs at a time when conventional eggs are also rising on increased retail demand. Soaring soy meal could also result in pricier organic meat and even dairy, adding to food inflation that’s become rampant across the globe since the pandemic began.John Brunnquell, head of Egg Innovations, one of the biggest US producers of free-range eggs, has managed to find meal for his more than one million birds, but still faces prices of $1,700 a ton, more than double a year ago.  Organic soybeans for feed in the US reached $29.92 a bushel Friday, up 47% from a year ago. Along with the trade tensions, pandemic-related shipping disruptions are contributing to the price spike.Brunnquell estimates that the average industry cost to produce a dozen organic eggs went up 15 cents to 20 cents based on higher feed prices alone. “We are seeing all of our costs go up, packaging, cartons, feed, freight labor,” Brunnquell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-to-pay-more-for-organic-eggs-after-trade-spat-with-india-over-soy-meal-101631680860167.html
15-09-2021||World||Think tank report calls for more attention on Sikh separatists in US||A leading American think tank is calling for authorities to pay more and urgent attention to US-based individuals and entities campaigning for Khalistan, saying they are backed by the same elements as those that have propped up people espousing the separatist cause of a free Kashmir, namely Pakistan.“The US government cannot afford to allow separatist movements from India, including those with ties to militant and terrorist groups, to grow unchecked among its otherwise law-abiding Sikh community,” the Hudson Institute, the think-tank, said in a report published on Tuesday, titled, “Pakistan’s Destabilization Playbook: Khalistani Activism in the US”. It’s been jointly authored by leading experts on South Asia Husain Haqqani, Christine Fair, Aparna Pande, Sam Westrop, Seth Oldmixon and Michael Rubin.“Its experience with Islamist extremist groups must serve as a template for dealing with Khalistan extremists, and so recruitment or fundraising for militancy or ‘martyrdom’ must not be allowed on US soil, even if the actual acts of violence are to take place far away, in India. US authorities must not let ostensibly peaceful pro-Khalistan activism become the precursor of a new wave of violence in India’s Punjab state.”The report calls for the US to investigate the “likelihood of unlawful foreign funding of the Khalistan movement” without further delay. And it warned against repeating the US handling of the case of the Kashmir American Council (KAC).In 2011, the FBI said KAC and its founder Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai had run a decades-long scheme to conceal the transfer of at least $3.5 million from the government of Pakistan - including the ISI - to fund his lobbying efforts in America related to Kashmir. He was jailed for conspiracy and tax-evasion.Fai has resumed his activities since his release, and has been seen multiple times at demonstrations and protests called by the Sikhs for Justice, which was banned by India in 2019; its founder-leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun was declared a terrorist by India in 2020.India has asked the United States to act against them as well but has felt frustrated by the lack of any response.There may be some reason for hope and optimism now. Lisa Monaco, the current deputy attorney general and No.2 in the department of justice (DoJ), had led a team that had prosecuted Fai in 2011 as assistant attorney general. She is closely familiar thus with Pakistan’s secret funding of groups such as KAC in the US.Like Fai and his outfit, which has since gone defunct and has been replaced by the World Kashmiri Awareness Forum, Pannun and his proscribed organisation are tied to Pakistan, the report has said citing publicly available material and published accounts in newspapers.In fact, the report noted, the SFJ leadership had made no attempt to conceal its links to Pakistan: the outfit opened a “permanent office of SFJ” in Lahore, Pakistan in 2018; in 2019, Pannun organised a truck rally in Houston against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Howdy Modi event, joining Pakistan-backed Kashmir separatists - “call by Pro Khalistan Sikhs & Organizations Supporting People of Kashmir”.Evidence of Pakistan’s backing to separatist Khalistani groups in the US goes back to 2006 when a New York court, the report recounts, convicted a Pakistan national of providing money and financial services to the Khalistan Commando Force, which was described by US authorities as “a terrorist organisation responsible for thousands of deaths in India since its founding in 1986”.The report suggests the US should designate all groups responsible for terrorist attacks in India; designate individuals determined to have been connected to terrorist outfits; use terror financing laws and regulation against US-based groups espousing Kashmir and Khalistan separatism, and investigate them for violating US laws on foreign funding; and use legal tools to monitor suspected Kashmiri and Khalistan terrorism sympathisers and advocates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/think-tank-report-calls-for-more-attention-on-sikh-separatists-in-us-101631680974994.html
15-09-2021||World||From fake news to fan culture: China lays out what’s allowed on a ‘Marxist civilized' Internet||China is laying down the law on what behavior is -- and isn’t -- allowed on a “civilized,” Marxist internet, in a sweeping set of guidelines for governing what is already one of the world’s most-heavily policed digital spheres.The upcoming regulations, many based on previous draft guidelines, span greater protection for minors against online bullying to combating fake news and verifying online accounts. The over-arching idea is to ensure online content abides by “the guiding status of Marxism in the ideological cyberspace sphere,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing an online summary posted by the State Council.The new guidelines potentially provide a framework to further tighten the government’s grip on internet giants from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to ByteDance Ltd. and the vast amounts of content and data they generate. They coincide with a broad campaign to influence online norms, from suppressing what Beijing calls “fan culture” to forcing giants to open up their closed ecosystems by linking to rival services.It’s unclear when the final regulations will be published. In its summary, the State Council said more regulation was needed to improve ethics and behavior. To that end, a nationwide platform will be established to curb online rumors and fake information, while amplifying propaganda about the Communist Party’s achievements, Xinhua said.“The country plans to better regulate the production, publication and distribution of online content, classify the management of online accounts and build a national mechanism to stop and prevent disinformation,” the news agency reported. “Campaigns will be launched to fight online crimes, and efforts will be made to protect personal information and data security.”Beijing’s renewed scrutiny of online content comes after a months-long effort to rein in the growing influence of its internet titans and press them to share the enormous wealth they’ve amassed during a decade-long tech boom. Xi Jinping is pushing a philosophy of “common prosperity” that, beyond tightening supervision of once free-wheeling tech giants, also includes prodding the nation’s youth toward more productive pursuits and eradicating content the Party considers counter to that ambition.Other points in the summary included:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-fake-news-to-fan-culture-china-lays-out-what-s-allowed-on-a-marxist-civilized-internet-101631679322382.html

Now, a report in New York Post has claimed that most of the Taliban fighters have not received money in months.Also Read: Indian ambassador thanks Qatar for supporting Afghan evacuation effortsMost of the countries have refused to recognise the Taliban regime, which officially calls the country Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. And so, cash is barely trickling in.After the Taliban takeover, foreign assistance was frozen and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank halted loans. The United States also stopped $9.4 billion in reserves to the country's central bank. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) also asked its 39 member nations to block Taliban assets.In such a scenario, Afghanistan's econpmy has been crumbling and prices soaring. The United Nations cautioned this week that 97 per cent of Afghanistan's population could soon go below the poverty line - a worrying level from the pre-Taliban takeover figure of 72 per cent.The New York Post reports that a significant number of Taliban fighters outside major cities are surviving on very little food and sleep in trucks or whatever suitable shelter they can find. The publication also claimed that local community members give food and other supplies to Taliban members.Also Read: ‘Don’t have capacity to handle new refugee influx', says TurkeyThe Taliban have already imposed a $200 withdrawal limit on citizens who travel for miles to visit a city and then wait for hours in queues to get cash. Many banks have been closed since the Taliban takeover, and those that are open have limited cash withdrawals.Meanwhile, the UN said on Tuesday that four million Afghans are facing "a food emergency" and the majority live in rural areas where $36 million is urgently needed for the coming months to ensure the planting of winter wheat, feed for livestock, and cash assistance for vulnerable families, the elderly and disabled.Rein Paulsen, director of the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Office of Emergencies and Resilience, told reporters that this emergency is characterised by "extreme gaps in food consumption, very high levels of acute malnutrition and excess mortality".At a UN meeting in Geneva on Monday, the international community pledged to provide over $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan. Taliban government's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi thanked the global community for the help and said they want good bilateral relations with the world's countries, including the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-on-brink-of-collapse-taliban-fighters-surviving-on-donation-report-101631674655395.html
15-09-2021||World||‘Tax the rich’: Democrats try to popularise the idea, but plan may fall short||A proposal making its way through Congress and even adorning the dress of one of its most prominent lawmakers, "tax the rich" has become a rallying cry for Democrats as they seek to remake the United States' social safety net. It received a prominent airing on Monday when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic House representative who often decries the country's economic inequalities, wore a gown bearing the slogan written in scarlet capital letters to New York's splashy Met Gala.“The time is now for childcare, healthcare, and climate action for all. Tax the Rich,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Instagram along with a photo of the white off-the-shoulder dress she said she had borrowed.The lawmaker is expected to support a plan backed by President Joe Biden to spend $3.5 trillion over 10 years that would pay for expanding a host of social services by upping taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations.But experts argue that while some rich people may see their taxes go up, the very wealthiest will experience less impact than advertised because the bill fails to levy taxes on the increase in value of assets such as real estate and stocks."It depends on how you define rich. The bill certainly raises taxes on very high earners and does so in many different ways," Corey Husak, senior government relations manager at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, told AFP."The bill taxes multimillionaires and people who are merely rich, much more than it's going to affect people who are outrageously rich."Some of the proposed tax changes represent "a real though a modest increase in the progressivity of the US tax code rate," said Samuel Hammond, director of poverty and welfare policy at the Niskanen Center.But by wearing her motto-bearing dress to an event where tickets cost $35,00 and tables are up to $300,000, New York-area representative Ocasio-Cortez "did the rich a great service, not unlike when an Oscar winner uses their award speech to chastise Hollywood."It allows a wealthy audience to feel progressive without any real costs," Hammond said.Narrow pathBranded "Build Back Better," Biden's plan is intended to "transform" American society by instituting universal pre-kindergarten, reducing child care costs, improving health care access, boosting investments in public housing, legalizing millions of migrant workers, and expanding measures to fight climate change.Republicans say they won't support it, and Democrats intend to pass it with their votes alone -- a difficult task is given that they control both the House and Senate only by razor-thin margins.Aiming to raise nearly $3 trillion in new revenue, a plan circulated by the Democratic leadership of the tax-drafting House Ways and Means Committee would see tax rates for America's top-tier earners rise from 37 percent to 39.6 percent.The rate for the most profitable businesses would jump from 21 percent to 26.5 percent.However, centrist Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who has called for negotiations on the plan to be slowed down and won't support a bill as large as proposed, prefers a lower 25 percent tax rate.And the plan may not raise as much revenue as Democrats believe: Congress's nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation released an estimate saying it would bring in around $2.1 trillion over 10 years.'Sweat of their brow'Husak said provisions in the bill, like a three percent surtax on people making more than $5 million a year, would indeed increase taxes on the rich.But the plan doesn't levy taxes on increases in the value of assets owned by the wealthiest Americans, nor does it close a loophole that allows their heirs not to pay tax on the capital gains when they inherit them."When you're talking about billionaires, they're not making wealth by the sweat of their brow, so to speak. They're getting it because they have large capital assets that increase in value," Husak said.The Senate must also back the plan, and after stock markets surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, the head of the Finance Committee has objected to the fact that billionaires won't pay taxes on their investment gains."I feel very strongly that, yearly, billionaires who did extraordinarily well in the pandemic should make tax payments," Senator Ron Wyden said Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tax-the-rich-democrats-try-to-popularise-the-idea-but-plan-may-fall-short-101631671199645.html
15-09-2021||World||Will Covid-19 ‘end’ in the next 6-8 months? Here's what experts say||For those hoping for an imminent end to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has the world in a chokehold, there is some bad news. Epidemiologists say that we ought to brace for more of what we've already been through – renewed outbreaks, more waves of the infectious disease, cancelled classes in educational institutes, and hospitals overwhelmed with the burden of treatment on the verge of a medical breakdown – all over again. Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center of Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, warned there could “easily” be another surge in the coronavirus disease in fall and winter, as continued surges hit vulnerable populations across the globe.Also Read | China scrambles to control ‘school-centred’ Covid outbreak in Fujian province“I see these continued surges occurring throughout the world," the Bloomberg news agency quoted Osterholm as saying. “Then it will drop, potentially somewhat precipitously. And then I think we very easily could see another surge in the fall and winter [of this year].”Almost all experts agree at this point that the end to Covid-19 is not in sight anytime soon, at least not for the next six to eight months. Before the pandemic comes to end, every single person in the world will be infected by the virus at least once, with an unlucky few having to deal with it more times than that. The race between the waves of transmission that lead to new variants of the coronavirus and the battle to get the globe inoculated against it won’t be over until the coronavirus has touched all of us.The key challenge in the race against Covid-19 was once to come up with an effective vaccine against the disease; but as the world learned to deal with the virus, the challenge has now expectedly shifted to a new marker – inoculating the global population, and ensuring the protection stays for a sustainable period of time. Even though immunisation rates rise with each day, billions of people around the world are yet to be vaccinated, and there will always be people who are vulnerable to the virus: Newborn babies, people who can’t or won’t get inoculated, and those who get vaccinated but suffer breakthrough infections as their protection levels ebb.Another key danger is the possibility that the virus mutates into a vaccine-resistant variant, although it is not the only risk ahead. In light of such a scenario, scientists say that eliminating the coronavirus anytime soon may just be short of a pipe-dream, and we ought to brace for more outbreaks in classrooms, on public transport, and in workplaces over the coming months, which will be rough.“I can just tell you, this is a coronavirus forest fire that will not stop until it finds all the human wood that it can burn,” said Osterholm, sounding a grim alarm.Watch | Covid-19 in children: Are active cases rising? Know antibodies countKanta Subbarao, director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, said, “With the pandemic, we have this enormous force of infection; that has counterbalanced the ability of the virus to proof-read.”As a result, Covid-19 could be like the flu, requiring regular vaccine top-ups to remain effective as the coronavirus evolves.A few researchers also say SARS-CoV-2 is poised to become completely resistant to the first generation of vaccines. A study from Japan, which has yet to be published or peer-reviewed, suggests that potentially dangerous mutations in the delta variant are already being picked up in a global database used to track such developments. Reports of current strains breaking through vaccinations or triggering higher fatality rates have not held up to rigorous scrutiny thus far.Although opinions vary, the current scientific consensus says that the coronavirus pandemic will end, if at all, at different times in different places. A key element determining this timing will, obviously, be vaccination. Although the world is unlikely to completely eradicate the virus, experts agree that the current outbreak will be tamed once most people – perhaps 90-95% of the global population – have a degree of immunity due to vaccination or previous infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-covid-19-end-in-the-next-6-8-months-here-s-what-experts-say-101631664663817.html
15-09-2021||World||Gavin Newsom's fate at stake as Californians vote in recall election||With Gov. Gavin Newsom’s fate at stake, Californians on Tuesday cast the last of the ballots that will decide whether he continues to lead them or if the nation’s most populous state veers in a more conservative direction amid anger over his actions during the Covid-19 pandemic.Newsom, a Democrat who is leading in polls, is only the fourth governor in US history and the second in California to face a recall. He was elected in a landslide less than three years ago.“I’m feeling good, as long as we can get out that vote," Newsom said after greeting volunteers in San Francisco hours before the polls closed.A recall election has a less predictable dynamic than a regular election, he said.“They designed this to catch us while we’re sleeping," Newsom said. "But I think you’ve seen in the early voting Democrats have been coming out strong, and I’m just humbled by that.”The leading Republican candidate is conservative talk show host Larry Elder, who is seeking to become California’s first Black governor.Newsom got a final push late Monday from President Joe Biden, who warned that the contest could shape the country’s direction on the pandemic, reproductive rights and the battle to slow climate change. The results also are likely to influence the 2022 midterm elections, when control of Congress will be in play again. The party that controls the White House historically loses seats in midterms.Biden said the issues that defined the 2020 presidential race have been resurrected in California, with potentially disastrous results if Newsom is removed. Speaking to hundreds of cheering supporters during a twilight rally in the coastal city of Long Beach, south of Los Angeles, Biden referred to Elder as a “clone” of Trump.“The eyes of the nation are on California,” he warned. The recall vote is “going to reverberate around the nation and ... around the world.”Elder staged his capstone rally in nearby Orange County, where he urged supporters to reach out to friends and neighbors to vote. The GOP will need a heroic Election Day turnout to catch Democrats, who have been turning in mail ballots in larger numbers. Nearly 8.6 million of California’s 22 million voters already have cast mail-in ballots.“Make sure you have your friends vote, vote, vote, and try and get 10 more friends to vote. And hit every call, make every call, knock on every door. We’re going to win this thing if we turn out the vote,” Elder said from a hotel ballroom in Costa Mesa.US House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, called the election an opportunity to change course in a state where Democrats hold a nearly 2-to-1 advantage among registered voters. He cited homelessness, rising crime and the wildfire-driven closure of national parks, which he said was due to “forest mismanagement.”“And you want to reward that?” McCarthy said Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox and Friends.In 2003, Californians removed Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and replaced him with Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. The “Terminator" actor won re-election in 2006, the last time a GOP candidate won statewide office in California.This recall was fueled largely by anger over Newsom’s actions during the pandemic, which included imposing the nation’s first statewide shutdown order. Critics said he was heavy handed, shuttering businesses and keeping children out of classrooms for longer than necessary. Newsom said his actions saved lives.“I am angry. It should be a freedom of choice. What is this? A dictatorship?" asked Janet Webb, a 69-year-old Lafayette resident who voted for Elder.She said squabbles over Newsom's handling of the pandemic have split her family and friends and may prompt her to move out of state.“I can’t live here like this if they’re going to force everyone to get a vaccine," Webb said.California voters have just two questions on Tuesday’s ballot: Should Newsom stay in office? And if not, who should replace him? There are 46 replacement candidates to choose from.If a majority of voters approve Newsom’s removal, the candidate who gets the most votes on the second question becomes governor. If voters keep Newsom, the results on the second question are irrelevant.Briana Mendoza, 30, said the last thing California needs is more turmoil. She voted to keep Newsom.“We’re in the middle of a pandemic. Why would we recall the governor who has been really trying to curb the spread of the virus?” the San Diego social worker said.Mendoza does not believe Newsom brought the recall upon himself by attending a birthday party at an upscale Napa Valley restaurant last fall in violation of his own administration’s coronavirus rules. Instead, she thinks the effort to unseat him is a backlash by a small minority of Republicans in a firmly Democratic state.“We don’t want Elder in office,” she said. "This is ridiculous. We just got Trump out. We don’t want a Trump puppet.”Beyond Elder, other prominent Republicans in the race include former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley, former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner and businessman John Cox. The best-known Democrat is Kevin Paffrath, a financial adviser with a large YouTube following.How California votes could determine how aggressively Democrats campaign on Covid-19 restrictions that many Republicans have decried as unnecessary and overly burdensome.Newsom’s ouster would be a stunning rebuke in California, where the Democratic Party controls every statewide office and dominates the Legislature and the congressional delegation.His advisers expressed increasing confidence that the governor would survive the effort to drive him out more than a year before the end of his first term. The campaign had 25,000 volunteers on the streets over the weekend and has sent 31 million text messages to voters.Republicans have criticized him relentlessly for high taxes and housing prices that are out of reach for many in the working class.In recent days, Elder suggested the results of the recall election could be skewed by unspecified “shenanigans,” echoing Trump’s baseless claims of voting fraud in his 2020 race with Biden.There has been no confirmed evidence of widespread fraud. Elder's campaign website has linked to a “Stop CA Fraud" site where people can sign a petition demanding a special legislative session to investigate the “twisted results,” well before any results were announced.Newsom said he would accept the election results and urged Elder and others to do the same. “As an American, I’m ashamed. I’m disgusted by it. Stop. Grow up. These people literally are vandalizing our democracy and trust in our institutions," he said.Asked to provide evidence of any suspicious voting activity, Elder spokeswoman Ying Ma said the campaign wants “every proper vote to be counted” and “whatever shenanigans there are will not stand in the way of him becoming the next governor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gavin-newsom-s-fate-at-stake-as-californians-vote-in-recall-election-101631666589659.html
15-09-2021||World||US army head secretly called China over fears Trump could spark war: Report||The top US general secretly called his Chinese counterpart twice over concerns then-President Donald Trump could spark a war with China as his potential election loss loomed and in its aftermath, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday.US General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called General Li Zuocheng of the People’s Liberation Army on Oct. 30, 2020 - four days before the election - and again on Jan. 8, two days after Trump supporters led a deadly riot at the US Capitol, the newspaper reported.In the calls, Milley sought to assure Li the United States was stable and not going to attack and, if there were to be an attack, he would alert his counterpart ahead of time, the report said.The report was based on "Peril," a new book by journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, which they said relied on interviews with 200 sources and is due to be released next week.Trump, in a statement, cast doubt in the story, calling it "fabricated." He said if the story was true Milley should be tried for treason. "For the record, I never even thought of attacking China," Trump said.Milley's office declined to comment.Republican Senator Marco Rubio called on President Joe Biden, a Democrat, to immediately fire Milley."I do not need to tell of you the dangers posed by senior military officers leaking classified information on US military operations, but I will underscore that such subversion undermines the President’s ability to negotiate and leverage one of this nation’s instruments of national power in his interactions with foreign nations," Rubio said in a letter to Biden.Asked about the Washington Post report, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment and referred questions to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Department.Trump, a Republican, named Milley to the top military post in 2018 but began criticizing him, as well as other appointees and former staffers, after losing the presidential election to Biden in November 2020.The Washington Post reported that Milley was motivated to contact Beijing the second time in part due to a Jan. 8 call with US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had asked the general what safeguards were in place to prevent an "unstable president" from launching a nuclear strike."He's crazy. You know he's crazy," Pelosi told Milley, the newspaper reported, citing a transcript of the call.According to the cited call transcript, the general replied, "I agree with you on everything."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-army-head-secretly-called-china-over-fears-trump-could-spark-war-report-101631662069114.html
15-09-2021||World||Hurricane Ida: Missing Louisiana man may have been eaten by alligator||A 504-pound alligator believed to have killed a 71-year-old Louisiana man in Hurricane Ida floodwaters has been captured with what appears to be human remains in its stomach, the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office said.The 12-foot alligator's capture ends a two-week search by local and state agencies for Timothy Satterlee Sr, who had last been seen on Aug. 30 checking the storm damage outside his home in Slidell, about 35 miles (55 km) northeast of New Orleans.The attack occurred the day after Ida, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to strike the US Gulf Coast, slammed Louisiana, causing devastating flooding in some areas outside a new levee and floodgate system protecting the city.An alligator "weighing a startling 504 pounds" was caught on Monday in a trap set by two Louisiana Department of Wildlife licensed nuisance hunters, according to a statement Monday from St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office."Once the alligator was searched, it was discovered to have what appears to be human remains inside its stomach," the sheriff's office said. "Investigators will work with the St. Tammany Parish Coroner's Office to verify those remains belong to Timothy Satterlee."Wildlife agents were scouring the area in air boats on Saturday when a drone they had deployed spotted a "rather large" alligator not far from the Satterlee's home, said Capt. Lance Vitter, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office.They set traps, which proved successful on Monday. The agents then euthanized and cut open the alligator "and that's when they discovered the body parts," Vitter said. "It was the upper parts of a human body."The Satterlee's home is not far from an area frequented by tourists who visit for the "swamp tours" promising sightings of alligators and other wildlife, Vitter said. Alligators do not usually attack humans unless the food they have stashed has been displaced, as can occur during major storms, he said.Satterlee's wife saw a large alligator attack her husband after he had gone outside their raised home to check on the contents of their ground-level shed. The alligator had him in a "death roll" and had ripped off one of his arms, Vitter said, recounting the wife's statement to authorities. The wife, 68, intervened and the alligator disappeared into the water.Bleeding badly and starting to black out, the husband told her to get in their small boat and seek help, Vitter said. Vitter added that it would have been difficult for the wife to get her husband into the boat without his help and without it tipping over. She left him on their stairs.The wife found help about one mile away and returned only to find her husband was no longer on the stairs, Vitter said. "She just never thought in her wildest nightmares that she would get back and he'd be gone."Satterlee was a staple of his community in Slidell, volunteering at the local school and cooking for storm victims in the past, Vitter said, adding that he hoped finding the alligator will bring some closure for his wife."Now that we have located the alligator at least she can get a death certificate," Vitter said.According to the Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute, male alligators can grow as heavy as 1,000 lbs (454 kg).

By February 2016, they had accepted the jobs and were using their contacts in the US to obtain restricted intelligence on behalf of their new employer. Later that year, Baier persuaded another  company to sell him a cyberweapon known as zero-click malware, which allows hackers to remotely infiltrate individual devices without their owners’ engagement, according to the US. The $750,000 deal was executed that year, and the technology was weaponized as a tool called Karma, detailed in a 2019 report by Reuters, which reported the charges earlier Tuesday.In a parallel document filed to the court, the defendants admitted to the Justice Department’s claims as part of an agreement to defer their prosecution. The agreement requires that all three quit their jobs in the UAE, cut off any affiliation with that government within 60 days and provide a report of their dealings to the FBI within 90 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-intelligence-agents-admit-giving-defense-secrets-to-uae-101631661113575.html

But a source who was among those briefed on the 90-minute Biden-Xi call confirmed the report was accurate."Xi apparently intimated that the tone and atmosphere of the relationship needed to be improved first," the source said.China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond when asked to comment.The Financial Times quoted one of its sources as saying Biden had floated the summit as one of several possibilities for follow-on engagement with Xi, and he had not expected an immediate response.It cited one US official as saying that while Xi did not engage with the idea of a summit, the White House believed that was partly due to concerns about COVID-19.The G20 summit in Italy in October has been talked about as a possible venue for a face-to-face meeting, but Xi has not left China since the outbreak of the pandemic early last year.The call between Biden and Xi was their first in seven months and they discussed the need to ensure that competition between the world's two largest economies does not veer into conflict.A US official briefing before the conversation called it a test of whether direct top-level engagement could end what had become a stalemate in ties, which are at the worst level in decades.The White House said afterward it was intended to keep channels of communication open, but it has announced no plans for follow-on engagements.Chinese state media said Xi had told Biden that U.S. policy on China imposed "serious difficulties" on relations, but added that both sides agreed to maintain frequent contact and ask working-level teams to step up communications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-failed-to-secure-summit-with-xi-jinping-in-call-last-week-report-101631660854559.html

The Taliban, designated as the terrorist group by the US, captured the presidential palace on August 15.On September 7, the Taliban unveiled their cabinet as the group formally announced their government after taking over Afghanistan in a lightning offensive last month. The "acting" government will be led by Mullah Mohammad Hassan, the little-known head of the Taliban’s leadership council, spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid announced in a press conference in Kabul. Abdul Ghani Baradar, the face of the Islamist group, was named as his deputy.The appointments also included Khairullah Khairkhwa who will be serving as the information minister of the country, Mullah Yaqoob as the defence minister and Amir Mutaqqi as the foreign minister.There was no evidence of non-Taliban in the line-up, which has been a big demand of the international community. The group also made no mention of women as part of any governance structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-deny-reports-of-recovering-6-5-million-18-gold-bricks-at-former-afghan-vp-s-home-101631612128733.html
15-09-2021||World||Antony Blinken says ties with Pakistan under review over Afghanistan||The United States is reviewing its relationship with Pakistan, which is a Major Non-Nato Ally (MNNA), in view of its role in Afghanistan over the last 20 years and more, which, secretary of state Antony Blinken told lawmakers at a hearing on Monday, amounted to “hedging its bets”.Antony Blinken also delivered a very clear message to Pakistan telling it to “line up” with the broad majority of nations to force the Taliban regime to uphold the basic rights of Afghan people, including women and children; allow humanitarian assistance and form a representative government.Watch: Was Taliban govt's Deputy PM killed by Pak-backed Haqqanis? Mullah Baradar audio emerges amid rumours TESTY EXCHANGESAntony Blinken testified on Monday on the pullout of American troops from Afghanistan at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The nearly five-hour session was marked by testy exchanges with Republican lawmakers and occasional rap-on-the-knuckles from Democrats.He goes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday.House lawmakers grilled the secretary of state on a range of issues relating to the withdrawal - the timeline, being surprised by the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government, the unplanned and chaotic evacuation and, leaving without ensuring every American citizen Afghan ally had been evacuated.DUPLICITOUS PAKISTANTwo Democratic lawmakers - Bill Keating and Joaquin Castro - brought up Pakistan. Calling Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan “duplicitous”, Keating asked if the administration was reviewing the relationship with Pakistan, its status as one of only 17 countries that the United States has designated MNNAs.The other MNNAs are Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Kuwait, Morocco, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Tunisia (Taiwan gets the same treatment without the official designation).Pakistan was added to the list in 2004 for its role in the war in Afghanistan and the hunt for the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks.Pakistan’s role is coming under increased scrutiny and criticism. Andy Biggs, a Republican member of the House of Representative and a staunch ally of former president Donald Trump, had introduced a bill in the House in January calling for ending Pakistan’s status as an MNNA.“Given its long term support for the Taliban, is it time for the United States to reassess its relationship with Pakistan and reassess its status as a major non-Nato ally,” asked Representative Castro, who was following up a line of questioning on Pakistan opened by fellow Democrat Keating.Secretary of state Antony Blinken replied: “For the reasons you’ve cited as well as others, this is one of the things that we’re going to be looking in the days and weeks ahead: the role that Pakistan has played over the last 20 years but also the role that we would want to see it play in the coming years, and what it will take for it to do that.”A US secretary of State could not have been more openly scathing of Pakistan’s role at this time when Islamabad has reclaimed its pre-eminent position in Afghanistan’s present and future, and its continued influence over its creation, the Taliban. The US also needs Pakistan’s cooperation for the safe passage of its citizens, partners out of Afghanistan.Representative Keating brought up Pakistan first at the hearing. He was troubled by the relationship with Pakistan. Recalling its role in the creation and labelling of the Taliban, he went on to nail Pakistan’s deeply entrenched interest by citing Prime Minister Imran Khan’s quote that Afghanistan had broken “the shackles of slavery” when the Taliban took back power.“We used to always hear diplomatically that we have a complicated relationship with … Pakistan,” Keating said. “I would say it’s often duplicitous.”Antony Blinken said he agreed with the congressman’s assessment of the role played by Pakistan over the past 20 years and even before.It’s been one, he said, that has “involved hedging its bets constantly about the future of Afghanistan; it’s one that’s involved harbouring members of the Taliban, including the Haqqanis; it’s one that’s also involved, at different points, cooperation with us on counterterrorism”.Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan has also been shaped by its concerns about India in that country, the secretary of state added. He did not elaborate.INDIA’S DEVELOPMENT ROLEIndia has completed more than 500 development projects in Afghanistan in the last 20 years, with footprints in all of its 34 provinces, at an estimated $3 billion. India has also been a preferred destination for Afghan people for higher studies - former president Hamid Karzai studied in India - and medical treatment. Bollywood productions are more popular there than any other places, and the best and most talented Afghan cricketers play in the top professional league in India.Pakistan, on the other hand, is viewed by most Afghans as a sponsor and mentor of a regressive regime that denies them rights and privileges enjoyed by most Pakistanis in Pakistan.GOING FORWARD“We have to look at as an insistence that every country, to include Pakistan, make good on the expectations that the international community has of what is required of a Taliban-led government,” Antony Blinken said as the hearing, speaking to the relationship with Pakistan going forward.India, the United States and other countries have said the Taliban regime can expect to get international recognition and legitimacy and financial assistance only if they can verifiably guarantee basic rights for its citizens, including women, children and minorities.“Pakistan needs to line up with a broad majority of the international community in working towards those ends and upholding those, those expectations,” Antony Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-says-ties-with-pakistan-under-review-over-afghanistan-101631595634130.html

And the pandemic is on the agenda, along with climate change and the Indo-Pacific.India ceased export of Covid-19 vaccines earlier in the year after it faced internal criticism for not inoculating enough Indians locally in the wake of a massive surge in cases caused by the more virulent Delta variant.India is in a far better place with half of its eligible populating having received at least one shot of a vaccine.Axis reported that Biden administration officials have said they understand this is a sensitive issue and ave thus decided to adopt a “soft approach” to Modi and it added, citing officials, the administration has “decided against trying to strong-arm Modi by conditioning his participation on his willingness to release vaccines to COVAX. He’ll be welcomed regardless of his decision.”The United States had itself forbade the export of Covid-19 vaccines as it sought to marshal all available resources for to vaccinate Americans and build a stockpile of vaccines for use domestically, by invoking special wartime powers of the president. This had created a shortfall of raw material for vaccines in India, as supplies were blocked from shipping.The United States lifted the curbs as part of a relief package it announced for India to help it deal with the crippling surge in cases fueled by the Delta variant, along with oxygen converters, therapeutics such as remdesivir and personal protection equipment for healthcare workers.The Biden administration plans to push participants at the summit to contribute vaccines to the WHO-run COVAX initiative, which is trying to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines around the world. Some countries have distributed vaccines through bilateral arrangement to earn and build diplomatic equity.Axios reported that the Biden administration plans to invite Russia, which has stayed away from COVAxX, to the summit, as well as China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-presses-india-to-resume-covid-19-vaccine-export-report-101631729224371.html

15-09-2021||India||Kochi needs robust action plan to meet climate threat: Experts||The port city of Kochi is vulnerable to extreme climate conditions and a robust action plan which blends disaster management strategy, nature-based solutions and proper awareness for the local community will be needed to meet this, experts said at a virtual conference ‘Connect Karo’ organised by the World Resources’ Institute (WRI). “About 31% of the city’s population is exposed to temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius and about 26% of the population live within flood plains,” they pointed out in a session on resilience planning against climate disasters in cities. The panellists said Kerala can take the lead in localised action plans on climate proofing and it can be a model for others. The draft guidance document of the city disaster management plan also highlighted the need for many carbon-neutral local bodies in the state. Part of a five-day conference, the session also discussed ways and means to make the city inclusive and resilient, have access to water, sanitation, hygiene, healthy spaces and peaceful co-existence. The Hindustan Times is the media partner of the conference being organised by the WRI. Inaugurating the event, Kochi Mayor A Anil Kumar said the city is feeling the pinch of climate change for quite some time now as water level had gone up in the backwaters and sea erosion is quite rampant in many areas. He said the corporation has taken many measures to reduce carbon emission by introducing water metro service, e-auto, reducing use of plastic and proper waste management. Some of the panellists include Shabna Seemamu, Project Associate, WRI India, KJ Sohan, state convener of INTACH and Anita Mohandas, Associate Environmental Engineer, Cochin Smart Mission Limited. “Putting people at the centre and making them part of the solution is the main thought behind our initiative. A set of minimal but smart interventions with immense capabilities to impact the quality of life of Kochi and its residents is our aim,” said Shabna Seemamu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kochi-needs-robust-action-plan-to-meet-climate-threat-experts-101631727540523.html

Till date, we have vaccinated 11.88 lakh people. We have, in fact, covered 102 per cent vaccination of the first dose,” Sawant said at a press conference on Wednesday.On Friday last, the chief minister declared that the state had achieved 100 per cent coverage for the first dose, prompting a congratulatory message tweeted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who attributed the feat to the “collective spirit and the prowess of our doctors as well as innovators”.The opposition, however, was not convinced and rushed to punch holes into the claim, underlining that more than 1,000 people were still getting their first dose every day.Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat called the claim “one more lie”, saying the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has also claimed in the past that the state was “open defecation free” and that every household is connected with tap water.On Wednesday, Sawant brushed aside the criticism.“There are many who refuse to take the vaccine. There are others who are yet to complete 90 days from having tested positive, but on the other hand, there are migrant labourers, foreigners, etc. who have taken the vaccine here,” the chief minister said. He added that “if we wait until everyone has taken the vaccine, then we will never reach 100%.”Sawant added that on September 18, PM Narendra Modi will interact with Goa health officials, beneficiaries, health department workers, cabinet ministers, panchayat and members of the public to congratulate them on 100 per cent completion of the first dose of vaccination.The chief minister also announced that the state will launch a fresh version of Tika Utsav 3.2 on September 16 to encourage people to take their second dose of the vaccine. Goa aims to achieve 100% vaccination with the second dose by October 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-pramod-sawant-doubles-down-on-100-vaccination-claim-after-oppn-barbs-101631727373651.html
15-09-2021||India||Over 80% of eligible population in Kerala given 1st Covid vaccine dose: CM||More than 80% of Kerala’s vaccine-eligible population have been administered with the first dose, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday, adding 32% of the eligible population has received both doses.Addressing a press conference, Vijayan said his government is striving to ensure that all people above the age of 18 are given the first vaccine dose by the end of September and both doses in another two to three months.Over 31.8 million doses have been administered in Kerala so far. In order to achieve the target of giving the first dose to all beneficiaries above 18 years by September, the state government in the first week of this month flagged a shortage of doses and urged the Centre to provide more for smooth continuation of the inoculation drive.Speaking on the pandemic situation in Kerala, chief minister Vijayan also said during the press conference that there is an uptick in the number of Covid-19 patients who were getting hospitalised later after being infected and this situation is not heartening. He pointed out that a large percentage of the people who died due to the viral disease in Kerala did not take the vaccine. Vijayan urged those above 60 years to get themselves fully vaccinated as a significant number of people in this age group have not taken the jab yet.Pointing out that people, despite being vaccinated, were testing positive for Covid-19, the chief minister said that such people might not be severely affected, they could pass on the virus to the unvaccinated. Hence, he urged the vaccinated people of the state to follow the Covid-appropriate behaviour including maintaining social distancing and wearing masks.After recording a little over 15,000 cases for the past two days, Kerala’s daily Covid tally went up again on Wednesday, as 17,681 people were detected Covid-19 positive, taking the caseload to 4,424,046, according to the state health department’s bulletin. The toll also increased on Wednesday as 208 patients succumbed to the viral disease, while 25,588 patients were discharged. The active cases in the state continued to remain below the 200,000-mark.Even though the daily tally in Kerala has not peaked since the first week of September, when over 30,000 infections were being recorded in a single day, the situation still remains critical as the state is contributing the maximum towards the fresh infections being recorded across the country.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-80-of-eligible-population-in-kerala-given-1st-covid-vaccine-dose-cm-101631726920496.html
15-09-2021||India||India may start issuing tourist visas only to vaccinated travellers after 1.5 years of suspension||With the daily cases of Covid nosediving and the vaccination gathering pace, the Centre is considering to resume issuing tourist visas soon, but only to vaccinated individuals., news agency ANI reported. The Centre stopped issuing tourist visas in March 2020, when the nationwide lockdown was announced. As the situation improved, the government made some relaxations in the visa rules but it never resumed issuing tourist visas. Now the proposal is being considered as it will also open an avenue to boost the economy.A senior MHA official confirmed to ANI that things have been formalised and a meeting has been called in the home ministry that will be chaired by the home secretary on Thursday to discuss plans to resume tourist visas. In October 2020, the home ministry permitted all OCI and PIO cardholders to visit India for any purpose except on a tourist visa.The official said that it will be done in a phased manner and as per the feasibility, it will be open to all those who are vaccinated. With this, the Centre may come up with a list of international vaccines which will be approved in India. Before the suspension of tourist visas, around 7-8 lakh tourists used to come to India every month. Several countries have resumed issuing tourist visas, though negative RT-PCR tests remain the criteria for international travel as the proposal of a vaccine passport did not receive any unanimous support from the countries. The issue of vaccine restrictions stipulated by some European Union countries posed a challenge to Indian travellers which was taken up by the highest level of the external affairs ministry and India raised the issue in diplomatic channels making it clear that if countries do not recognise vaccines being administered in India, India too will impose similar restrictions on people coming from other countries. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-may-start-issuing-tourist-visas-only-to-vaccinated-travellers-after-1-5-years-of-suspension-101631721238236.html

15-09-2021||India||Assam announces SOPs for Durga Puja; organizers, priests must be vaccinated||Assam on Wednesday announced a fresh set of guidelines for the upcoming festival season allowing organizing of ‘pujas’ by following safety and social distancing protocols. “The fresh set of guidelines is for the coming Durga Puja, Lakshmi Puja, Kali Puja and Diwali festivals. The steps are being taken to ensure that the people are able to observe the festivals while controlling the Covid-19 spread at the same time,” said health minister Keshab Mahanta in Guwahati while announcing the rules. Puja committees would have to take permission from offices of deputy commissioners of all districts—all committee members and those involved in organising the festivals will have to be vaccinated with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine before seeking permission to organize events. “We would prefer committee members to be fully vaccinated. People who have taken one dose of either Covishield or Covaxin, but have not taken the second dose within the stipulated time break won’t be considered as vaccinated,” Mahanta said. Puja ‘mandaps’ would have to be in open spaces with adequate space for social distancing, must have separate entry and exit points for public, anyone found having symptoms of Covid-19 would have to be immediately reported to health authorities for proper follow up. Committees would have to keep sanitizers and face masks at entry points and organizers, priests and others involved would have to get tested for Covid-19 a day ahead of Durga Puja and again after the festival is over. Committee members will have to ensure social distancing is followed at all places. “We appeal to all committees to ensure that the idols of the gods and goddesses are not very large so that many people aren’t needed for their immersion. Cultural programs at puja venues won’t be allowed and only a select few shops and outlets will be allowed to operate near the venues,” said Mahanta. He added that in order to control the spread of Covid-19 we are focused on the testing, tracing and treating method as well as mass vaccinations of all eligible people. A mass vaccination drive is being organised in Guwahati on September 17 to bring all eligible people under vaccine cover. “Durga Puja will start from October 12. Our goal is to administer at least one dose of vaccine to all eligible persons in the state by October 10. We are making all efforts to ensure that in all districts,” said Mahanta. Assam has been recording around 500 fresh Covid-19 cases and 5-10 deaths daily for the past two weeks. The test positivity rate has remained below 1% for most days during this duration. There are around 4,000 active cases in the state at present. Till Wednesday evening, Assam had administered over 20.7 million Covid-19 vaccine doses (16.8 million first doses and 3.9 million second doses).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-announces-sops-for-durga-puja-organizers-priests-must-be-vaccinated-101631717878723.html

It later recovered half-way to close at 13, 531 points.But Lehman and Merrill Lynch’s India connection goes much beyond stock swings. Both companies have been rapidly expanding operations here, besides hiring aggressively in India to shore up talent for such key bases as New York and London.Lehman currently employs about 2,500 people in India, most of whom run the risk of losing their jobs. Merrill has about 600 people here. “We have not been told anything as yet, but everyone thinks it’s a matter of weeks before we are asked to pack up,” said a Mumbai based Lehman executive, who oversees back-office support for the company’s operations in Sydney and Tokyo.Lehman’s decision to file for bankruptcy came after talks for either possible merger with British bank Barclays or a bailout from the US Federal Reserve failed during the weekend.

Inaugurating the new Sansad TV that will replace the existing Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV, PM Modi said, “We always say that ‘content is king’ but in my experience content is connect. When you have better content, more people will get connected.” “This applies to Parliament as well. Our Parliament is not just about politics but also policies. When we discuss issues or policies, there’s so much to learn. If there is better behaviour and better debate, common people can connect to proceedings of the Parliament. And if more people get connected, public representatives will get inspiration for better performance,” the Prime Minister said. Backing the new integrated platform, Modi said, it will act as a new voice of parliamentary democracy. “In these fast changing times, the role of media and TV channels are also changing quickly. Our parliamentary channels also required transformation. In its new avatar, Sansad TV will be on social media, apps and on the OTT platform. It will reach more people.” Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla noted that the launch of the new Parliament channel coincides with the anniversary of Doordarshan. “Sansad TV will help the country to watch the entire democratic system from Parliament to panchayat. This will show the positive and inspiring work of our elected reps and make young people aware of our parliamentary work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/much-to-learn-from-discussions-in-parliament-pm-modi-at-launch-of-sansad-tv-101631713858365.html
15-09-2021||India||Kerala govt hiding Covid death toll, case should be filed against CM: Cong MP||Benny Behanan, a Congress MP, hit out at the Kerala government on Wednesday over the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic by alleging that the latter is hiding the death toll due to the viral disease and demanded that a case should be filed against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, according to news agency ANI.Being one of the worst-affected states from the pandemic across India, Kerala has till now recorded 22,987 deaths. On Wednesday, 208 more patients succumbed to Covid-19.Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Behanan alleged that the death toll announced by chief minister Vijayan is “absolutely wrong”, adding that “In every hospital, there is a census. The reports have to be countersigned by the hospital Superintendent and the CMO.”Citing the example of Kottayam district to explain his point about the Kerala government hiding deaths, the Congress MP said he visited the Kottayam medical college where he received information that in 177 days, the deaths due to Covid-19 in the institute were 1,326. However, the government list showed the total deaths in the Kottayam district stood at 926, Behanan said.He also pointed out that all hospitals are required to submit a report to a medical body in Thiruvananthapuram but there are no medical experts in this body. “The list is being scrutinised by the medical body as it is working in the favour of the government,” Behanan further said.The Covid-19 situation in Kerala has been seeing an improvement for the past few days. Since Monday, the state’s daily tally has been a little over the 15,000-mark, which is much lower from the first week of September when over 30,000 people were getting infected daily.However, the daily cases went up again on Wednesday when 17,681 people were detected Covid-19 positive while 208 patients died and 25,588 recovered from the viral disease. With this, the caseload has climbed to 4,424,046 including 22,987 deaths, 4,209,746 recoveries and 190,750 active cases. Of Wednesday’s case count, Thiruvananthapuram added highest with 2,143 fresh cases followed by Kottayam (1,702), Kozhikode (1,680), Ernakulam (1,645) among others.Even though the situation is not as severe as it was in the first week of September, Kerala continues to contribute the maximum towards the fresh infections across India. On Tuesday, a professor of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told news agency ANI that Kerala had passed its peak and a decline in cases should start in the next two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-hiding-covid-death-toll-case-should-be-filed-against-cm-cong-mp-101631712569991.html

Among them, 15,559 refugees and asylum seekers are from Afghanistan."From August 1 until September 11, 736 Afghans were recorded by UNHCR for new registration," the UN body said in a fact sheet.Among those who have approached the UNHCR are Afghan individuals who have newly arrived in 2021, those seeking reopening of previously closed asylum cases, students, businessmen, or people on medical or other types of visa who are unable to go back due to the current situation in Afghanistan.The UNHCR further said that it is scaling up its capacity to meet the increasing requests for registration and assistance of Afghans in India."UNHCR is increasing its humanitarian response programme for vulnerable new arrivals from Afghanistan. Basic assistance such as food, cash-based assistance and core relief items are being provided to the most vulnerable new arrivals from Afghanistan and those already in India," the UN body said.The UNHCR said it has also set up an Afghanistan emergency cell and a dedicated help page for Afghans with comprehensive information on registration and assistance available."Additional 24/7 helplines were established to answer queries around the clock and direct engagement with Afghan communities scaled up. Over 130 calls are received per day, mainly enquiring about assistance and registration," it said.The UNHCR said it is appealing to partners, UN agencies, and the wider donor community to respond to the increased needs for solutions and assistance to Afghans in India.The immediate needs include continued food assistance for 6,000 individuals, sanitary items for 3,000 women and girls, cash-assistance for 500 most vulnerable people, and winterisation support for 1,000 most vulnerable people, it added.The Taliban swept across Afghanistan this month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities, including Kabul, against the backdrop of the withdrawal of US forces from the country.India also evacuated people on military transport aircraft of the IAF under the government's 'Operation Devi Shakti'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-refugee-agency-reveals-how-many-afghans-recorded-for-registration-in-india-since-aug-1-101631707375863.html
15-09-2021||India||Indo-US cooperation will boost economic dynamism amid Covid-19 challenges: Rajnath||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday highlighted the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic that has disrupted businesses globally and said that Indo-US cooperation would go a long way in boosting “economic dynamism.” “Covid-19 pandemic has brought newer challenges in terms of disruption of supply chains, downturn in industrial activities, negative growth in travel and tourism industry and there is no doubt Indo-US cooperation will go a long way to restore normalcy and further boost economic dynamism,” Singh said. He was speaking at the Indo-US Economic Summit organised by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce. Singh said various measures taken by the government had helped put economic activities back on track, and the first quarter of the year recorded a 20% growth compared to a 24% contraction last year. He said the recovery was a sign of India’s “sound economic fundamentals.” The minister said the country was preparing for “dynamic growth” not just in the financial year 2022 but through the entire decade. “Over the last 100 months, the government has brought many major structural and procedural reforms which have prepared India to make a quantum jump in terms of growth in this decade,” Singh said, enumerating the steps taken by the government to boost the Make in India initiative, enhance ease of doing business and to make the country an investor-friendly destination. Red tape has given way to red carpet, the minister said, inviting the US industry to participate in the government’s vision of “Make in India and make for the world.” On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India was shedding its image of being a major importer of military hardware and carving an identity for itself as a defence exporter. Modi said the world had taken note of the strides made by the country in defence manufacturing with locally produced equipment ranging from modern grenades, assault rifles and drones to fighter jets and warships. “We have formulated progressive and investor friendly tax policies. We have said goodbye to retrospective taxation and corrected the mistake of previous governments,” the defence minister said. Talking about labour reforms, he said dozens of laws had been compressed into four sets of codes. Singh said the government’s decision to notify two lists of 209 defence items that cannot be imported (ban to be implemented progressively from 2021 to 2025) would boost business opportunities. “It may appear that this list will reduce business opportunities for the world. But I want to make it clear, that this list is actually an invitation to increase business collaboration,” the minister said. The items that cannot be imported include AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) systems, light combat aircraft, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, long-range land attack cruise missiles, basic trainer aircraft, different types of helicopters and artillery guns. Singh said foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can set up manufacturing facilities on their own or forge partnerships with Indian companies through joint ventures or technology agreements to capitalise on the Make in India opportunity. “There is a lot of scope for the American and Indian defence industries for co-production and co-development. Indian industry can also supply components to the American industry,” he said. The Indo-US bilateral relationship had made good progress during the last five to seven years, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indous-cooperation-will-boost-economic-dynamism-amid-covid-19-challenges-rajnath-101631711758313.html

Modi launches channel jointly with Venkaiah Nadu, Om Birla||The much awaited Sansad TV, that replaced the Lok Sabha TV and Rajya Sabha TV, went live on Wednesday evening after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla launched the integrated platform.Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the Sansad TV, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the launch of the channel on the International Democracy Day makes it more relevant.“In a fast-changing world, the role of television and the media is rapidly evolving. The 21st Century is witnessing a revolution through news and broadcast. At a time like this, it is natural for the channel associated with Indian parliament to undergo transformation,” Modi said while delivering a keynote speech at the launch of the Sansad TV.हमारी संसद में जब सत्र होता है, अलग अलग विषयों पर बहस होती है तो युवाओं के लिए कितना कुछ जानने सीखने के लिए होता है।हमारे माननीय सदस्यों को भी जब पता होता है कि देश हमें देख रहा है तो उन्हें भी संसद के भीतर बेहतर आचरण की, बेहतर बहस की प्रेरणा मिलती है: PM @narendramodiObserving that “content is connect”, the Prime Minister stressed, “If you have quality content then the people get naturally connected to you. This is as true for the media as it is for our parliamentarty system, because the parliament nt only deals with politics but also with policies."Speaking at the launch, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu said that timely flow of authentic information about the functioning of legislatures and elected representatives enhances accountability and transparency in the functioning of public institutions. “This is what RSTV and LSTV have been providing till now and the Sansad TV will be offering henceforth," Naidu said.Parliament and legislatures have a key role to play. We need to have meaningful debates echoing people’s aspirations. The loud disruptive noise should not drown the voice of people. #SansadTV pic.twitter.com/ob6IXJEvs5Naidu used the opportunity to comment that separating ‘truth’ from ‘falsehood’ has become a real challenge, at a time when ‘speed’ and the ‘compulsion' to be the first with breaking news occasionally overides all other considerations.“The media should function as a means of empowerment for development through informed actions by the citizens,” Naidu said.The programmes on Sansad TV will primarily be in four categories — functioning of Parliament and democratic institutions, governance and implementation of schemes and policies, history and culture of India and issues, interests and concerns of contemporary nature.The Prime Minister announced that Sansad TV will be available on social media and OTT platforms as well as a mobile application.The Sansad TV has planned a series of programmes under ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’, a government initiative to celebrate 75th year of India's Independence.The integrated platform was conceptualised nearly two years ago after a panel led by Prasar Bharati CEO Surya Prakash submitted a report approving a common platform for two channels.Hindustan Times first reported the launch on August 4.Former textiles secretary Ravi Kapoor has been appointed as the CEO of the new entity on contract for a period of one year, an internal order of the Lok Sabha secretariat said. During the recess, the channels will run current affairs programmes in English and Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sansad-tv-goes-live-modi-launches-channel-jointly-with-venkaiah-nadu-om-birla-101631709838272.html
15-09-2021||India||I-T survey on premises linked to actor Sonu Sood in Mumbai, Lucknow||Income tax department officials surveyed at least six properties in Mumbai and Lucknow, all linked to Bollywood actor Sonu Sood on Wednesday, a PTI report said. The visit of the I-T officials, which was not termed as raid, was in connection with an alleged tax evasion probe, the report said. It was not immediately known whether the I-T officials visited Sonu Sood's residence as well. Reports said a real estate deal is also under the scanner of the income tax department.The I-T survey comes soon after the actor became the brand ambassador of the Delhi government's mentorship programme after receiving national and humanitarian acclaim for helping people during the pandemic. Starting with providing busses for the migrant workers in 2020, the Bollywood actor ensured oxygen supply during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. The 48-year-old was hailed as a real-life hearo and was conferred with a special humanitarian action award by the United National Development Programme.AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha termed this I-T action as a witchhunt and said Sonu Sood's only crime is to stand by people who were orphaned by the government. "This is nothing but a witch hunt by an insecure government against a giant philanthropist considered a 'messiah' by millions. His only crime is that he worked for the welfare of the downtrodden when they were orphaned by the state," Raghav Chadha tweeted.AAP MLA Atishi issued a video statement slamming the survey and said this is a clear message by the BJP that they will victimise anyone who does any good work in the country. The ‘survey’ of actor-and-philanthropist @SonuSood by the IT Dept is a clear message by BJP that they will victimise anyone who does good work for the country? Was it a crime for @SonuSood to help migrants during the lockdown? Was it a crime for him to help those in difficulty? pic.twitter.com/oA47wes9VvIn 2012, the I-T department conducted raids on the premises of several Bollywood personalities which included Sonu Sood, At that time, there were some allegations against his Mumbai property that he had bought in ₹30 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-survey-on-premises-linked-to-actor-sonu-sood-in-mumbai-lucknow-101631707279004.html
15-09-2021||India||In Goa, crimes against foreigners show sharp decline, says NCRB data||Goa has seen a sharp fall in crimes against foreigners between 2018 and 2020 in line with a larger national trend, but remains a significant contributor to the country’s statistics of crimes against foreigners, data from the Crime in India Report 2020, published by the National Crime Records Bureau has revealed. Across the calendar year 2020, Goa witnessed 11 crimes against foreigners which is a steep fall from the 34 that was recorded back in 2018 and is also around half the number when compared to the 21 cases that were recorded across 2019. The fall in cases is in keeping with a larger national trend which has seen crimes against foreigners fall from 517 in 2018 to 191 in 2021 largely on account of fewer people travelling as tourists across the globe due to Covid-19, which was declared a global pandemic in early 2020. Despite its small size, Goa is among the top five states when it comes to crimes against foreigners after Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka and ahead of several states like Kerala, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh which also witness a lot of foreign arrivals. The countrywide statistics indicate that theft is the most common form of crime against foreigners followed by rape which comes in at a distant second followed by human trafficking, molestation, assault and attempted murder in that order. Prior to the pandemic, Goa received around 0.8 million foreign tourists each year according to Goa government estimates mainly from countries like Russia, Ukraine, other CIS countries as well as from mainland Europe. However, since the pandemic hit--- the Union government cancelled all existing tourist visas and has not granted fresh tourist visas resulting in a complete halt on new arrivals for the past one and a half years. The state has earlier made headline for several high profile crimes against foreigners, including the murders of British teenager Scarlett Keeling who was raped and left to die on the Anjuna beach in early 2008 and the rape and murder of Irish youngster Danielle McLaughlin in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-goa-crimes-against-foreigners-show-sharp-decline-says-ncrb-data-101631707497621.html

Further, the consortium also said Delta variant and its sub-lineages remained the main variant of concern (VOC) in India and globally.In its latest bulletin, the INSACOG said, “Neither Mu, nor C.1.2 are seen in India so far. Delta and Delta sub-lineages continue to be the main VOC in India. AY.4 is the most frequently seen sub-lineage in recent sequences from India, as well as globally."Also read | Apart from Delta, which other coronavirus variants are on the radar?Noting that the Delta variant and Delta sub-lineages continue to be the main VOC globally, the bulletin also showed that AY.4 was the main global sub-lineage. The INSACOG also said that no further rise in cases pertaining to the C.1.2 variant has been noted and it seemed to have plateaued at around 2% in South Africa, where it was originally detected. Regarding the Mu variant, the INSACOG said that it remained “mostly confined” to South America.In its previous weekly bulletins too, the INSACOG has made similar observations regarding the Delta variant and its sub-lineages. On August 23, the consortium had said, “Delta variant is the major VOC in India at this time. AY.12, a reassigned sub-lineage of Delta is being seen in many states, but the numbers need closer examination.”The World Health Organization (WHO) added the B.1.621 variant, including B.1.621.1 variant, to the list of variants of interest (VOI) on August 30 and labelled it as “Mu.” Also, the C.1.2 has been listed along with variants that have been currently designated alerts for further monitoring by the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-remains-main-variant-of-concern-in-india-mu-c-1-2-variants-not-found-yet-insacog-101631706489268.html
15-09-2021||India||Most cases of rapes of minor and crime against children recorded in MP: NCRB||Madhya Pradesh continued to report most cases of rape of minors with 3,259 incidents followed by 2,785 in Maharashtra and 2,630 in Uttar Pradesh, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report for 2020, released on Wednesday. Not only cases of rape of minors, according to NCRB report, MP also recorded 17,008 incidents of crime against children- the highest in the country during the period. At 17, the most number of foeticide was also reported from MP and the state also registered the most number of rapes of tribal women with 339 cases followed by Chhattisgarh (195) and Maharashtra (129). It is hardly any solace that the 2020 figures were just 1% lower than 2019. However, the number of rapes of adults in the state has decreased. With 2,339 such cases, MP was behind Rajasthan -5310 and UP-2,769. According to police, most of the rapes and other crimes against children were committed by relatives and known people. “The children are most unsafe at their homes. As per NCRB data, 3,189 minor children were raped by known persons. It is not a problem of law and order but a social problem,” said a senior officer of the police department, who didn’t wish to be named. On crime against women, additional director general of police (ADGP), Pragya Richa Shrivastava said, “We are holding different campaigns to recover missing girls. Most of the missing minor girls were taken to other places by men on the pretext of marriage, and we have to register a rape case against the men after their rescue. The number is high because of 100% reporting of cases.” However, women and child rights activists feel that a lower conviction rate is one of the major reasons behind the high crime rate against children in the state. “Despite making strict laws including capital punishment for raping a minor under 12 years of age, the number of cases is not coming down significantly. One of the major reasons is delay in justice and a lower conviction rate. Only in high profile cases, police files a charge-sheet in record time, in many other cases, it gets delayed for months. Similarly, in the absence of enough special courts for Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso), the pendency of cases is high. Till January 2021, more than 300 cases were pending in courts. The state government should also pay attention to the conviction rate,” said Sarika Sinha, convener of Action Aid, MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-cases-of-rapes-of-minor-and-crime-against-children-recorded-in-mp-ncrb-data-101631706658980.html
15-09-2021||India||Monsoon conditions active, likely to cause rain over NW India for next 2 days||Monsoon has picked up this month with the formation of the season’s first depression on Sunday. The system brought widespread rains to central India and the west coast bringing down monsoon deficiency from 9% at the end of August to only 5% on September 15. Monsoon rains are nearing the normal category which is 104% to 96% of the long period average.The long period average considered for the period of 1961 to 2010 is 88cm. Rainfall between 96% -104% of long period average is considered ‘normal’; between 90% – 96% is considered ‘below normal’ and 104 -110% is considered ‘above normal’ by IMD. Widespread and intense rainfall activity is likely over many parts of the country including northwest India at least for a week. Monsoon is normally expected to withdraw from northwest India September 17 onwards. “Monsoon has been very active in September. The well marked low pressure area over north Madhya Pradesh is moving towards northwest India. The monsoon trough is also expected to move northwards. The combination of these factors will bring widespread rain and thundershowers to Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh etc. Meanwhile, another cyclonic circulation is likely to develop over Bay of Bengal on Friday which is also likely to bring rain to east and central India. We don’t see any indication of monsoon withdrawal at least for a week,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather.Also Read | Excess rainfall in September result of climate change in Odisha, say experts“The synoptic conditions are very good for rain this month. Three low pressure systems have developed out of which one was a deep depression which has now weakened to a well marked low pressure area over central parts of north MP. This system will bring widespread rains to northwest India. Some models are indicating an other cyclonic circulation developing over Bay of Bengal. These features have led to a reduction in monsoon deficit bringing it close to normal category,” explained K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.A well marked low pressure area is lying over central parts of north Madhya Pradesh and neighbourhood. It is likely to move west-northwestwards during the next two days and weaken thereafter. A cyclonic circulation is lying over south Gujarat region and neighbourhood. The monsoon trough is lying south of its normal position. It is very likely to remain south of its normal position during next 3 days. A cyclonic circulation is likely to develop over north Bay of Bengal on Friday. It is likely to move west-northwestwards towards Odisha- West Bengal coast during subsequent three days.Due to movement of the well marked low pressure areas and the cyclonic circulation over south Gujarat, widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rain is likely over Gujarat, West Madhya Pradesh, East Uttar Pradesh and East Rajasthan till Friday; over East Madhya Pradesh, Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand rain is likely to reduce from Friday.Isolated extremely rain (over 20cm) is also likely over East Uttar Pradesh on Thursday. Scattered to widespread rainfall is very likely over all of northwest India (excluding Jammu, Kashmir & Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh) on Thursday and Friday. Isolated heavy rainfall is likely over Uttarakhand, West Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and West Rajasthan till Saturday.Very heavy rain is also very likely over Uttarakhand and west Uttar Pradesh on Thursday.

15-09-2021||India||L-G’s powers under new Act unconstitutional: AAP govt to SC||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has told the Supreme Court that the Amendment Act introduced by Centre to give overriding powers to the Centre’s nominee – Lieutenant Governor over Delhi legislature and executive is unconstitutional as it has in effect “disenfranchised” the people of Delhi by taking away power from their elected representatives, striking at the root of representative democracy and violating the law-making power of Delhi assembly recognised under the Constitution and decisions of the Supreme Court.The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021 and the Transaction of Business of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Rules, 1993 came into effect from March 28, 2021 by which four crucial provisions of the Act stood amended.By the new law, the term ‘government’ as referred to in any law passed by Delhi assembly was amended to mean “Lieutenant Governor” (by adding a new clause (3) to Section 21 of the GNCTD Act) and opinion of L-G was made mandatory for executing any decision of the minister or council of ministers on certain matters under any law in force (by adding a proviso to Section 44(2) of the Act). A host of other amendments were also introduced in the Rules.Also Read | DDCA appoints retd judge Indu Malhotra as new Ombudsman cum Ethics OfficerThe petition was filed on August 9 and was mentioned by the Delhi government represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Monday before the Chief Justice of India (CJI) for an urgent listing. The CJI agreed to list the matter without specifying a date. The copy of the petition was made available only on Wednesday.Terming the amendments unconstitutional, the Delhi government petition filed through advocate Shadan Farasat said, “The impugned provisions as amended by the amendment Act have in effect disenfranchised the people of Delhi, and violated their political rights under the Constitution in as much as the amendment Act takes away the power from their elected representatives and gives it to an unelected official, being the LG.”The petition stated that the GNCTD Act “diminishes the constitutionally guaranteed powers and functions of the elected legislative assembly and council of ministers of the NCT of Delhi” and overturns the constitutionally stipulated balance between the Delhi government and the Union government.The provisions of the 2021 Act, the petition said, “are an attempt to treat the L-G as the default administering authority over the NCT of Delhi” by authorising him to withhold consent from bills that, in his judgment, may be “incidentally” outside the scope of legislative assembly’s legislative powers and by empowering him interfere in the day-to-day administration of the NCT.By the said provisions, the Act “impermissibly encroaches on the scope of the Delhi Legislative Assembly’s “core legislative functions” by interfering with the Assembly’s power to frame its own rules of business or to hold the executive to account, the petition added. The new law even prohibited the assembly from making any rule to enable itself or its Committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the Capital and conduct any inquiry in relation to administrative decisions.The accompanying amendments to the 1993 Transaction of Business Rules have further dented the independence and working of the Assembly, according to the petition. Article 239AA of the Constitution recognises Delhi as the National Capital Territory having L-G and an Assembly allowed to legislate on all other matters other than three excluded subjects – land, law and order and police, where Centre alone can legislate.“Introduction of a deeming provision in Rule 49 of 1993 Rules now allows for any and every matter to be referred by the LG to the Central Government,” the petition said, adding that the amendments have vested direct executive authority in the secretaries of the Delhi government, allowing them to perform without reference to and even in derogation of the orders of the concerned ministers or council of ministers.The petition also held the current amendments to violate the 2018 decision of the Supreme Court in Government of NCT of Delhi v Union of India which interpreted Article 239AA and said, “The exercise of establishing a democratic and representative form of Government for NCT of Delhi… would turn futile if the Government of Delhi that enjoys the confidence of the people of Delhi is not able to usher in policies and laws over which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has power to legislate for NCT of Delhi.”The decision stressed on harmonious working between the L-G and Delhi government and held that the power of L-G to recommend an issue to the President cannot be to such an extent to obstruct the stream of governance.The petition said that the basis of this judgment still remains as Article 239AA has not been amended. It required the Court to clarify that even under the new amendments L-G should act only on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers insofar as he exercises any power as “Government” pursuant to a law passed by the Legislative Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lgs-powers-under-new-act-unconstitutional-aap-govt-to-sc-101631705877391.html

15-09-2021||India||Despite ban, weird practice of Nokku Koolie is bringing bad name to Kerala||A consultant with a Mumbai-based private logistics company Rajeswari S Pillai, who was transporting a heavy equipment cargo to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Research Centre (VSSC), took 10 days to cover 70 kms from Kollam and Thumba, on the outskirts of the Kerala’s capital Thiruvananthapuram. Almost every day she walked six to 10 km with the consignment-laden truck with 80 wheels that moved at a snail’s pace. It became such a spectacle that people waited for the arrival of the truck along the national highway and police and district authorities were at their best to ensure a smooth passage to the giant truck. But a dramatic twist was awaiting her at the finishing point, where a group of people lied on the road asking for ‘nokku koolie’ for unloading the heavy cargo. Nokku Koolie is the money charged by trade union workers for the work either done by machine or others as their right. She pleaded that only heavy cranes can unload the cargo but they said they had no problem with it as long as they were given gawking charges. Initially, the demand was for ₹10 lakh but later it came down to ₹5 lakh. But she stood her ground. After three hours, the blockade was finally lifted after the chief minister’s office intervened and some of the protestors were arrested. Later, 50 people were booked. “I am against paying people who are not doing any work. I don’t want to explain the incident anymore. But I wish it is the last such Nokku Kooli incident in my beautiful state,” she said. The incident invited enough bad publicity and last week the high court cited this while hearing another case related to Nokku Kooli and asked the government to explain new measures taken to end the menace once and for all. “This practice was banned years ago but it is still continuing. It is inviting a bad name to the state. We are getting regular complaints. The government should take strict actions against those who demand it,” the HC said last week and sought a detailed report from the state police chief in two weeks. Nokku Koolie was banned in 2018 by the left government but it is still prevalent in many parts of the state. Interestingly in 2002 a law- Kerala Loading and Unloading (Regulation of wages and restriction of unlawful practices) was framed to restrict the unholy practice but it continued. In 2017, the high court had pulled up the state government, forcing it to ban the practice in 2018, but the menace is far from over. There were many judgments against the organised crime of fleecing but often police and the government authorities turn a blind eye to it which literally pushed the state into a graveyard of industries. When people complain against them, police act against workers but many remain mute fearing retaliation by militant trade union workers. Fed up, the government is planning to give more teeth to the law banning Nokku Kooli. “The government is mulling to include stringent provisions including non-bailable provisions to deal with the menace,” said a senior official who did not want to be named. Though almost all trade unions admit that such worn out practices invite bad name they discreetly support such elements. Last week K N Nair, who was building a house on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram, brought marbles and other building material from north India, and workers sought ₹25,000 to unload it. When he refused, he was threatened and he finally called the police. Though police settled the issue, he was advised by some local leaders that antagonising head-load workers will invite their wrath, forcing him to pay ₹8000 to them for work done by others. “I was scared that they would destroy unloaded material in the night,” he said. Around 300,000 head-load workers are registered under the workers welfare board representing various trade unions and their resting places on roadsides are a common sight in the state, besides these registered workers, many others operate to fleece money. They survey industrial areas and residential colonies frequently to spot vehicles carrying goods. Usually they charge exorbitantly for doing the work or demand payment for merely watching while goods are unloaded by cranes or by in-house workers. Statistics with the labour department shows only 11 major cases were filed since the ban came into force in 2018 but industrialists and others said it was only the tip of the iceberg and many complaints were getting withdrawn forcefully. They said the illegal practice enjoyed political patronage and militant workers got away easily. Though there were units of the Kerala Head Load Workers Welfare Board and labour offices in every district to deal with such issues, many dreaded to approach them fearing retaliation, said builders and industrialists. “Gawking charges is an unhealthy practice and it invites bad publicity. If workers are facing any problem it should be addressed. There should be a proper mechanism to enforce labour rules at the grassroots,” a spokesman of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Kerala chapter, said on condition of anonymity. “Leaders’ words and deeds never match in the state. They secretly support such elements and disown them in public. These leaders are responsible for making the state a graveyard of industries,” said Kitex group MD Sabu Verghese. His group recently shifted its base to Telangana, alleging a witch hunt in Kerala. Many trade union leaders said they were against the practice but claimed that a concerted campaign was on to portray workers in bad light and dent the state’s image citing isolated incidents. “We are against it. We have taken strong action against erring ones. But some vested interests portray isolated incidents to paint a grim picture,” said CITU (Centre of Indian Trade Union) state president Anathalavattom Anandan. Anandan said the equipment-laden truck at Thumba was blocked by local people led by a parish priest demanding jobs for natives and the blame was conveniently put on workers of the area. The priest was not available for his comments. But local people said head-load workers were there and they provoked local people to join the stir and when it turned into a big issue, they backtracked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-ban-weird-practice-of-nokku-koolie-is-bringing-bad-name-to-kerala-101631704318618.html
15-09-2021||India||'Don't need lesson from failed states like Pakistan': India reacts at UNHRC meet||In a scathing response to Pakistan and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) over their statement, India on Wednesday slammed Islamabad for what it called habitually misuing the platform provided by the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to “propagate its false and malicious propaganda” against New Delhi.Calling itself a "robustly functional" and a “vibrant” democracy, India said it “does not need lessons from a failed state like Pakistan which is the epicentre of terrorism and worst abuser of human rights.” India exercised its “right to reply” at the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva to also comment that the the UNHRC is "aware of Pakistan's attempts to divert the Council's attention from serious human rights violations being propagated by its government, including in the territories occupied by it.”Taking at a dig at OIC, of which Pakistan is a part of, India said its has no locus standi to comment on internal affairs of New Delhi.“We once regret and reject reference made by the OIC to the Union territory of Jammu & Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. The OIC has no locus standi to comment on internal affairs of India,” the Indian envoy to the UN said at the session.The OIC had in August asked India to revoke steps to scrap the abrogation of the special status of Jammu & Kashmir, and called them “unilateral” and aimed at altering the “internationally recognised disputed status of the territory as stipulated in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions”.The OIC’s general secretariat at that time called on the world community to increase its efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue in line with UN Security Council resolutions.“OIC has helplessly allowed itself to be held hostage by Pakistan, which holds Chairmanship of their Geneva Chapter, to subserve its own Agenda. It’s for members of OIC to decide if it's in their interest to allow Pakistan to do so,” India said at Wednesday's session.India's reaction comes in response to UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Monday criticising India's use of stringent laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act across the country as well as restrictions on public assembly and frequent communication blackouts in Jammu & Kashmir.Even as she acknowledged India's efforts to counter terrorism and promote development in Jammu & Kashmir, Bachelet said that “such restrictive measures can result in human rights violations and foster further tensions and discontent."India, on multiple occasions, in the past strongly rejected the UN human rights chief's criticisms relating to Jammu and Kashmir as interference in the country’s internal matters based on inadequate understanding of the ground situation.Training its guns on Pakistan further, India criticised Pakistan for failing to protect the rights of its minorities, including Sikhs, Hindus, Christians and Ahmadiyas. “Pakistan has been engaged in systematic presecution, forced conversions, targeted killings, sectarian violence and faith-based discrimination against its ethnic and religious minorities," India said, adding, “A ‘climate of fear’ continues to drastically impact the lives of minorities.”India said Pakistan is a country that has been globally recognised as a country openly supporting, training, financing and arming terrorists including UN proscribed terrorists, as a matter of state policy. “The relevant multilateral institutions have been raising serious concerns on its failure to stop terror financing and lack of effective actions against terror entities,” India said at the UNHRC session.In the 47th session of the UNHRC, too, India fired salvos at its western neighbour by saying Pakistan should be held accountable for aiding and abetting terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-need-lesson-from-failed-states-like-pakistan-india-reacts-at-unhrc-meet-101631702312109.html

It was not a rare occurrence in the northeastern state which is witnessing over 1,000 new cases daily for the past few days. On Wednesday morning, 1,185 new cases were detected. The state with a population of 1.1 million (2011 census) has recorded over 74,000 cases till date with more than 64,000 recoveries. While 246 persons have died due to Covid, Mizoram have more than 13,500 active cases at present. “It’s true the numbers are high, but that has happened because we are very meticulous in contact tracing. While in some states, people who came in contact with an infected person are not traced and tested, we do that routinely in Mizoram,” R Lalramnghaka, special secretary (health) said. Also Read | Fresh influx of Myanmar nationals into Mizoram amid clashesSince September 1, Mizoram has recorded 14,949 new cases at the rate of nearly 1,000 cases daily. The test positivity rate hovered between 9% and 21% during the same period. On Tuesday, the positivity rate was 16.39%--it dropped to 12.65% on Wednesday morning. “Community spread of the disease in Mizoram has happened and the high number of cases is testing the state’s health infrastructure. While most positive cases with mild symptoms are in home isolation, those with severe complications and co-morbidities have been admitted in hospitals,” Lalramnghaka said. Meanwhile, Mizoram crossed 1 million vaccination doses on Wednesday afternoon. Till 3pm on Wednesday, the state had administered 1,009,134 doses (680,974 first doses and 328,160 second dose). “Our vaccination figures are impressive, but that hasn’t helped much in reducing new cases. We also had a long period of strict lockdown, which has been relaxed partially now with some restrictions. Instead of re-imposing lockdown, we need to convince public to adopt safety measures,” said Lalramnghaka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surge-in-covid-cases-because-of-contact-tracing-testing-mizoram-govt-101631703057193.html

15-09-2021||India||Cabinet approves 4-year moratorium for telecom companies||In a much-awaited relief, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a relief package for the country's cash-strapped telecom sector, along with several structural reforms to strengthen the sector. All those who will avail of the moratorium will have to pay some interest, minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced. The moratorium will start from October 1, the Cabinet said.“The reforms are deep and broad. They are structural. These reforms will bring in change today, tomorrow and in the future. I do not like to put a number on the package as it is revenue-neutral for the government,” the minister said. The moratorium will not impact the government's revenue, the minister said.The package comes six weeks after Kumar Mangalam Birla resigned from teh chairman post of Vodafone Idea Limited on August 4. Vodafone, which was created from the merger of British telecom giant Vodafone's India unit and Birla's Idea Cellular Ltd, has to pay about ₹50,399.63 crore in statutory dues dating back over past many years.The relief package includes a moratorium on payments for airwaves and is aimed at helping Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea. Shares in wireless carriers Bharti Airtel rose 5.4% and Vodafone Idea went up 2.9% after the news surfaced.The relief package for the ailing sector, which has the option for the telecom firms to convert interest on spectrum dues of the four-year moratorium period into government equity, was long due.Last year, the Supreme Court passed a ruling asking Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to clear the government dues which hit the sector hard. Banks led by theState Bank of India have called on the government to give Vodafone Idea more time to clear its tax dues.Apart from the moratorium, the Cabinet cleared some major decisions regarding spectrum allocation and FDI. Spectrum sharing has been made free while the auction will take place in the last quarter of the financial year.Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal recently pitched for a hike in tariffs and a cut in government levies to save the industry. Mittal had said while 35 per cent of the industry's revenue goes to the government in taxes and levies, telcos are loaded with an extraordinary debt of AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue) dues and spectrum payments.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-approves-moratorium-for-telecom-companies-report-101631695317930.html

RDIF entered a partnership with Dr Reddy’s Labs to market first 250 million doses of the Russian vaccine and also conduct trials in India required for grant of regulatory approvals.Also Read | India’s vaccine drive remarkable: Melinda Gates“In light of the recommendations of the SEC dated 30.06.21, the firm presented updated safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of phase III clinical trial of SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine (Sputnik Light)— single dose vaccine conducted in Russia along with the proposal to conduct phase III clinical trial. The committee noted that the firm has now presented the safety and immunogenicity along with the longevity of the antibodies which gives a measure of persistence of antibodies in the participants,” read minutes of the meeting that HT has accessed. “After detailed deliberations, the committee recommended for grant of permission for conduct of phase 3 immune-bridging clinical trial in Indian population subject to the condition that the primary endpoint should be assessed at day 42, 90 and 180, and interim analysis can be conducted at day 42...”Sputnik V is one of the six Covid-19 vaccines that have been granted emergency use approval by India’s drugs regulator.It is a two-dose shot (but two unidentical doses unlike other two-dose vaccines) that is 91.6% effective in preventing serious illness as was found in phase 3 clinical trials.Starting initially in Hyderabad on May 14 this year, Dr Reddy’s did a soft launch on pilot basis in select cities to check logistical arrangements including cold chain facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-reddy-s-labs-gets-approval-for-phase-3-trials-of-sputnik-light-in-india-101631690455827.html

15-09-2021||India||Assam records highest rate of crime against women for 4th year||Assam recorded the highest rate of crime against women in the country for the fourth consecutive year, reveal National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) figures for 2020.Released on Tuesday, Crime in India 2020 report shows that the rate of crime against women in Assam was 154.3, way higher than the national rate of 56.5. Odisha came second with 112.9 and Delhi came third with 106.4. The rate is calculated as the number of crimes recorded per 100,000 population. In 2017, the rate of crime against women in Assam was 143.3, it was 166 for 2018 and in 2019 the figure was 177. So Uttar Pradesh, which registered the most cases of crime against women at 49,385 against Assam’s 26,532, still recorded a crime rate of only 45.1. Assam’s number of crime cases against women was 30,025 in 2019 and 27,687 in 2018.In 2020, Assam recorded 26 instances of rape-cum-murder/gang rape—the third highest figure in the country after Uttar Pradesh (31) and Madhya Pradesh (27). It recorded 1,658 cases of rape last year. There were 4,642 cases of assault with intention of outraging modesty.

While Uttar Pradesh topped in the crime rate for dowry deaths at 2.1, there has been an increase in such cases in Assam as well. The state recorded 150 dowry deaths in 2020 and four cases of acid attack on women. “The figures are worrying. We never recorded such a high number of dowry deaths earlier. The rate of crime against women in Assam could be very high as sometimes women tend to file false cases of cruelty against their husbands and in-laws. It could also be that more women are reporting crimes than those in other states,” said Chikimiki Talukdar, chairperson, Assam State Commission for Women. Of the total cases of crime against women registered in Assam last year, 11,408 were of cruelty by husband or his relatives. The state also recorded 1,496 cases under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act of which 1,049 were of rape, 322 of sexual assault and 120 of sexual harassment. “Last year, the rate of crime against women in Assam could have been higher due to the Covid-19 lockdown. People were stuck in their homes for days and they could have attacked their spouses or other women,” said Polly Vauquline, head of department of women’s studies in Gauhati University.

The civil aviation ministry had earlier clarified that it will not extend the deadline for stake sale.News agency ANI reported that Tata Group and SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh are expected to make its financial bid for the airline.It quoted a government official to say that there is "optimism" that a bidder will be found. A similar exercise in 2018 to offload 76 per cent stake by the government was unsuccessful after no bidder was finalised.This time, the Centre is planning to sell 100 per cent stake in the airline and its low-cost subsidiary Air India Express, along with a 50 per cent stake in ground handling company Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited (AISATS).Other properties, including the Air India building in Mumbai and Airlines House in Delhi, will also be part of the deal.Minister of state for civil aviation Vijay Kumar Singh told Parliament in July that there will be a 10 per cent reduction in reserve prices of 16 of the airline’s properties as previous attempts of auctioning them failed to attract bidders.In March, Hardeep Singh Puri, the then civil aviation minister, said Air India had accumulated a debt of ₹60,000 crores and that it would be completely disinvested. He added the choice was between disinvesting the airline or closing it down.At present, Air India has control over 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports as well as 900 slots abroad.The privatisation was to be completed by late May or June, but the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic led to the delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/final-bid-for-air-india-disinvestment-today-tata-group-spicejet-in-race-101631687006080.html

15-09-2021||India||Pakistan monkey off their backs, India-US ties are poised for a new beginning||When Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets US President Joe Biden at White House later this month, both the countries will have shed the monkey called Pakistan off their backs as American direct engagement with Af-Pak region has ended since erstwhile Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in the winter of 1979.In the past four decades, the India-US bilateral relationship was bedeviled with American engagement in Afghanistan and the equation remained largely hyphenated till US Navy Seals gunned down Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden near Pakistan Army cantonment in Abbottabad in May 2011.In the interregnum, the American plan for India was largely dictated by their commitments in Af-Pak region as Washington needed Rawalpindi to first fight off the Soviet Union during the Cold war days and then the Al Qaeda and the Taliban post 9/11 attack. The India-US bilateral relationship was looked at by Washington planners through this prism and hence tactical adjustments were made in favour of Rawalpindi GHQ.Even after the brutal attacks by Pakistani terrorist groups on Indian Parliament in December 2001 and on the Indian Army camp at Kaluchak in Jammu and Kashmir in May 2002, the message from US President, NSA, Secretary of State and Deputy Secretary of State to then NDA government was not to wage war against Pakistan as US personnel were stationed in that country for war against terror in Afghanistan. While US hunkered down on then Pakistani dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf to ban the terrorist groups attacking India, New Delhi was told to go easy on Pakistan even though 10 children were brutally murdered at Kaluchak.Visiting India nearly a month after Kaluchak massacre, then US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told his Indian counterpart George Fernandes that US relationship with Pakistan was temporary, but they were looking at India as a long-term strategic ally.It was due to American commitment in Afghanistan, Pakistan was giving a free gate pass by successive US administrations on nuclear and missile proliferation, terrorism against India and was even rewarded with a major non-NATO status in 2003 without the courtesy of informing India. While powerful US ecosystem in media and think-tanks put pressure on India on Kashmir without asking for equal accountability from terror promoting Islamabad. North Korea was sanctioned for nuclear proliferation but not Pakistan or for that matter China despite detailed evidence available in AQ Khan files with the CIA. The US ecosystem conjured up images of nuclear war to deter India even as Pakistan directly attacked India or used its proxy terror groups. Pakistan got away cheaply in 1999 Kargil War even though rogue Pakistan Army under Musharraf had invaded India from Batalik to Mushkoh Valley in pursuance of their pipe dream to annex Kashmir.The Pakistani misdemeanors in the past four decades were not only over-looked by the international community but also rewarded with US pumping in latest military hardware and financial aid including using the national security waiver post 9/11. Islamabad got billions of dollars in aid from US and European Union in the name of war against terror despite everyone in White House knew that Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders were feted by Rawalpindi. Even the F-16 fighters given to Pakistan for use in war against terror in Afghanistan were used against India on February 27, 2019 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi struck at a terror camp in Balakot for Pulwana terror strike by Pakistan based terror groups. The American efforts were supplemented by the English who still carry imperial legacy on their shoulders and believe that Taliban are just country boys.All this changed when crown prince of terror Sirajuddin Haqqani with the help of Pakistani ISI ground and technical support in terms of Chinese drone footage and purchased satellite imagery militarily occupied Kabul on August 15, 2021.Today, the US engagement with Af-Pak region is over or will be limited to over the horizon counter-terrorist operation. Pakistan is a client state of China, which in turn is in strategic competition with US and to a lessor degree with India. Rag-tag Islamic militia Taliban is in power in Kabul, and it does not recognize the Durand Line with a burning ambition to turn the world into Islamic Caliphate. The India-US relationship for the first time is unfettered of the Pakistan factor, which has always dragged the bilateral relations down, and time for regional structural adjustments are over for US. The fight against terror has again gone regional with US and its allies departing from Kabul.It is under these circumstances and in the presence of two other strategic allies, Japan, and Australia, that India and US have an opportunity to make a new beginning of the bilateral ties where the two natural allies can mutually grow and prosper across the board. There is an opportunity for the two countries to act as a democratic bulwark against belligerent Communist China for securing the Indo-Pacific as also stabilizing the region through new supply chains and commitment to Climate Change objectives. The ISI chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, who triumphantly rode into Kabul on September 4, may have his smile wiped off at the end of this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-monkey-of-their-backs-india-us-ties-are-poised-for-a-new-beginning-101631680477495.html

The comments come as the southern state logged 15,876 fresh cases of the infection, nearly half of what it was recording during the peak of Covid-19 wave."By looking at the data of the virus spread in last 2-3 months, Kerala has passed its peak and in the next 2 weeks, a decline in cases should start. Just like North-East, Kerala should also start witness drop in Covid cases by the start of October as per the epidemiological picture," said AIIMS Professor Dr Sanjay Rai.He added, "Earlier sero survey in Kerala suggested that most population was susceptible but latest sero survey shows that 46 per cent had antibodies due to vaccine or by infection. The measures taken by the state only slows down the spread."After reporting over 30,000 Covid-19 cases in a day during the first week of September, the number has come down considerably. On Tuesday, it reported 15,876 cases, which took the state's overall caseload to 44,06,365.The number of active cases in the state dropped to below two lakh mark - 1,98,865 to be exact - with 25,654 people recovering from Covid-19 between Monday and Tuesday and the total recoveries rising to 41,84,158, according to Kerala's health department.The positivity rate stood at 15.12 per cent after 1,05,005 samples were tested in a 24-hour span, the department said.Among the 14 districts, Thrissur recorded the highest with 1,936 fresh cases followed by Ernakulam (1,893), Thiruvananthapuram (1,627), Palakkad (1,591), Malappuram (1,523), Kollam (1,373), Alappuzha (1,118), Kozhikode (1,117), Kannur (1,099) and Kottayam (1,043).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-has-passed-its-covid-19-peak-says-aiims-professor-101631679687681.html
15-09-2021||India||Khori Gaon rehabilitation cannot wait till April 2022, says Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Tuesday told the Haryana government that alternative housing for eligible beneficiaries ousted from forest land at Khori Gaon in Faridabad cannot wait till April 2022. The court directed that they be temporarily housed within a week from the receipt of their application under the rehabilitation scheme introduced by the state government. It also stated that repair works, while ensuring the safety of residents, can be carried out simultaneously.“We were under the impression that the structures are ready, and they need minor repairs. And now you are asking for time to hand over possession till April 2022,” observed the bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF), told the court that once the verification is completed by October end, the state shall provide ₹2,000 solatia or compensation to each eligible family to rent an accommodation for six months till the flats are ready by April 2022.The Faridabad municipality had earmarked flats under the economically weaker section (EWS) category at Dabua Colony and Bapu Colony situated in Faridabad. Presently, the municipality informed the court, the houses are “not habitable” as tenders were floated for its maintenance and ensuring supply of electricity and water, and setting up of drainage facilities is expected to take nearly five months.About 6,600 dwelling units in Khori village were razed by Faridabad municipality over the last few months as the illegal colony was encroaching 150 acres of Aravalli forest land. Many of the evicted residents, housed in temporary shelters, complained about the absence of a rehabilitation scheme, following which, the state approved a rehabilitation scheme on August 25, incorporating the suggestions of affected residents, and presented it to the court in an affidavit filed last Saturday.The rehabilitation scheme allowed persons affected by the demolition drive in Khori to apply for alternate housing by October 15. The state said that their documents, such as electricity bills, voter IDs and Parivar Pehchan Patra, will be scrutinised to establish their eligibility, following which a draw of lots will be conducted and final allotment of flats will be made by April 2022.The bench said that the proposed scheme did not consider the court’s suggestion for temporary allocation of flats pending final scrutiny and draw of lots. It also made its discontent felt on action taken against illegal farmhouses on forest land and the decision to remove the municipal commissioner on August 2, amid the case hearing, without showing the courtesy to inform the court.The judges asked senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj to address the court as he had represented the municipality on the last occasion and did not approve of the decision to change counsels.Bhardwaj agreed with the court’s suggestion of temporary allocation of flats and simultaneous repair and maintenance work.The bench in its order said, “The corporation, upon receipt of applications and documents being submitted by applicants for, prima facie, establishing eligibility, shall grant provisional allotment letter that will indicate temporary possession subject to final verification and draw of lots of all participants.”Before taking provisional possession, an undertaking shall be furnished by the applicant to hand over the possession within two weeks in the event they are found ineligible under the scheme upon scrutiny, the court said. It clarified that once the temporary accommodation is taken by the eligible family, the rent/solatium of ₹2,000 payable by the state government shall stop.The court allowed the repair work of the EWS flats to be simultaneously carried out with the condition, “While carrying out repairs or maintenance, all care and caution must be observed regarding safety of occupants of the premises under repair.”Senior advocates Sanjay Parikh and Colin Gonsalves raised objections on the rehabilitation scheme which the court agreed to consider on Monday. Parikh said that the e-portal for submission of applications was not working. The bench directed that the corporation was free to consider extending the cut-off date for receiving applications. So far, over 2,400 applications have been received under the rehabilitation scheme.The removal of Khori Gaon was part of the court’s efforts to implement its order of February 19, 2020, requiring Aravalli forest land to be cleared of encroachments. On April 5, 2021, the court reiterated that Khori Gaon occupants have to be removed. On June 7, the court fixed a six-week deadline to remove the 6,600 structures in the Khori Gaon colony. The court gave a free hand to MCF to act without exception against all unauthorised structures on forest land.The MCF has since then registered a criminal case on June 23 against unknown persons who illegally sold land parcels belonging to 150 acres of forest land to Khori Gaon residents using illegal and unfair means. The MCF also identified 140 illegal structures, including farmhouses, and demolished 10 of these.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khori-gaon-rehabilitation-cannot-wait-till-april-2022-says-supreme-court-101631678814951.html

Submitting its affidavit on Tuesday night in a clutch of cases that have cited massive vacancies across several tribunals, the Centre has maintained that it has acted upon all the names forwarded to it by the search cum selection committees (SCSCs), which are headed by the Chief Justice of India or a Supreme Court judge nominated by the CJI. There are more than 200 posts lying vacant across 15 tribunals in the country. The hearing is scheduled at 10.30am today when the top court will take up the batch of petitions filed separately by state bar council of Madhya Pradesh, advocate Amit Sahni, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh and Delhi Bar Association. Also Read | Life term for convict means rigorous imprisonment, says Supreme CourtThe affidavit, reviewed by HT, disclosed that out of 84 appointments, 39 have been in the current month when the top court lashed out at the government for sitting over recommendations made more than a year ago. Four members in the national consumer commission were appointed in May while all other appointments took place in 2020. On September 6, a bench led by CJI NV Ramana, had observed that the Union government has no respect for the judgments of the top court and is now “emasculating tribunals” by not filling up vacancies in them. The government cleared 38 names for different tribunals after this hearing before the bench which also included justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao. Of these, 18 members were appointed to the national company law tribunal (NCLT); 1 member to telecom disputes and settlement appellate tribunal; 13 members to income tax appellate tribunal (ITAT) and 6 members to armed forces tribunal. “No recommendation made by any of the SCSCs now remain pending with the central government,” asserted the affidavit, which has also revealed that some of the names cleared by the committees have not been approved by the government. In its affidavit, the government has also emphasised that the SCSCs will have to now follow the new law on administration of tribunals and the candidates would have to be shortlisted as per the rules to be framed under the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021. It added that the rules have been prepared by the government and will be notified shortly after which the process of making fresh appointments to the tribunals could go on. On September 6, the apex court had adversely commented upon the 2021 law. The bench observed it is “very upset” by the government and censured the Centre for re-enacting the very same provisions for the administration of tribunals that were struck down by the court in July. “The government is bent upon not honouring the orders of this court... Virtually the same Act is re-enacted. We cannot have this situation. Legislature can take away the basis of a judgment but you cannot overrule a judgment by re-enacting the very same provisions,” it told solicitor general Tushar Mehta who appeared for the Centre. The bench further said that the court will have to consider staying the new law since it is a “replica” of the old law, which was held to be unconstitutional. The court was hearing a clutch of separate petitions on vacancies across the tribunals and a challenge to the Tribunal Reforms Bill, which was passed by both the houses in the Monsoon session of the Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/made-84-tribunal-appointments-since-2020-no-name-pending-with-us-govt-tells-sc-101631676236160.html

The former army man, who retired as the deputy chief of the Indian Army, was chosen for his new post by President of India Ram Nath Kovind after the office of the Uttarakhand governor fell vacant when Baby Rani Maurya tendered her resignation. In light of this development, the President accepted Lt Gen Gurmit Singh's resignation and appointed him as the new governor of the state, according to an official communique issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan last Thursday.Also Read | Uttarakhand governor Baby Rani Maurya resignsAccording to reports citing officials familiar with the matter, the governor-designate of Uttarakhand is likely to have reached the state a day prior to his oath-taking. Lt Gen Gurmit Singh, a highly-decorated army man who superannuated in February 2016, held several prestigious posts during his nearly four decades of service, including that of the deputy chief of Army Staff, adjutant general, and corps commander of the strategic XV Corps that overlooks the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir.Singh also handled the China operational and military-strategic issues as the additional director-general of military operations; a responsibility for which he even had to visit China seven times and attend important military-diplomatic meetings related to border operations and LoC strategy.Gurmit Singh is a graduate of the Defence Services Staff Course and National Defence College.

Though China and Russia abstained, the resolution gained widespread support from the other 13 members of the UN’s highest decision-making body.Addressing a virtual symposium of principals and teachers of leading schools of the country on the unfolding situation in Afghanistan, Shringla said: “UNSCR 2593 unequivocally demands that Afghan territory not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist acts, and specifically refers to terrorist individuals proscribed by the UN Security Council, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad.”Besides, he added, the resolution “sets expectations on safe passage and secure departure of Afghans and all foreign nationals from Afghanistan”, and recognises the “need to uphold human rights, including of women and minorities, and to encourage all parties for an inclusive, negotiated political settlement”.There is also “re-affirmation for responding to the desire of Afghans to sustain and build on Afghanistan’s gains over the last 20 years”, he said.Highlighting the need for the world community’s response to be in line with the resolution, Shringla said: “Our collective approach has been articulated by UNSCR 2593. It is only by remaining true to the principles professed therein that we can make a meaningful contribution to Afghanistan at this time.”India, he said, expects the international community to “remain both responsive and united at a time of crisis”.Shringla further said India’s long-standing investment in the people of Afghanistan had earned the country “tremendous goodwill and cemented the civilisational bond” between the two sides. “Our friendship with the Afghan people will continue to guide our approach in the future,” he said.The Indian side has adopted a wait-and-watch policy regarding the situation in Afghanistan and the government has given no indication so far regarding any form of recognition for the interim setup created by the Taliban following the group’s takeover of the country on August 15. The Indian side also remains deeply suspicious of the Taliban’s long-standing links with terror groups such as al-Qaeda, LeT and JeM.Shringla said India’s destiny is “inextricably linked with its neighbours”, and the neighbourhood remains the country’s “primary diplomatic arena” as reflected by the “Neighbourhood First” policy. India has been “naturally concerned” about developments in Afghanistan and their external repercussions, he added.Following the Taliban takeover, India’s immediate focus was the evacuation of its nationals. “Most Indian nationals were able to leave Kabul in August. A number of Afghans, including minorities, who were desirous of travelling to India, also managed to do so,” Shringla said.“But these processes could not be completed due to the security situation at the [Kabul] airport. Resumption of flights from Kabul airport is, therefore, a priority. We are closely monitoring the unfolding situation,” he said.Shringla also referred to India’s development partnership with Afghanistan, which included more than 500 projects spread across the country’s 34 provinces, capacity-building and training. India has built schools, colleges and universities across Afghanistan and more than 65,000 Afghans have studied in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-resolution-2593-should-shape-world-s-response-to-afghanistan-foreign-secretary-harsh-vardhan-shringla-101631647543142.html
15-09-2021||India||Centre inks 5 deals for digital agri push||New Delhi: The ministry of agriculture signed agreements with five firms on Tuesday to push a project to harness big data from the farm sector for a digitised platform known as “Agri Stack”, a move officials said would help bring new technologies and private investment in the country’s primary sector.A ministry’s statement said Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar oversaw the signing of agreements with five companies: CISCO, Ninjacart, Jio Platforms Limited, ITC Limited and NCDEX e-Markets Limited (NeML).“Modernisation of the agriculture sector will continue by infusing new technologies so that farmers can increase their income,” the statement said.HT had first reported in May 2018 that a plan was afoot to harness big data in farm sector. In March 2021, HT further reported the Centre was in the process of creating a “digital agri-stack”, a hi-tech national farmers’ database that would give the government and agribusinesses unprecedented insights into the rural economy, quoting people with knowledge of the matter.Tuesday’s agreements would pave the way for pilot projects which will allow farmers to “take informed decisions on what crop to grow, what variety of seed to use and what best practices (sic) to adopt to maximise the yield”, the statement said.The government aims to increasingly open the country’s antiquated agriculture sector. It has said these changes would draw private investments and modernise supply chains as well as farm markets. Three laws passed last year to liberalise the farm trade have set off protests by growers. A section of influential farm unions says the move will leave cultivators at the mercy of big corporations.“Without our permission and consent, government cannot reveal our private data to private companies. We have already officially stated this,” said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, a key farm union leader at the heart of the protests.India’s agriculture sector is mostly sustained by subsidies on seeds, fuel, irrigation, fertilisers and power, rather than growth-enhancing investment, whether public or private.The so-called agri stack platform will push “projects that use artificial intelligence, block chain technologies” to modernise the country’s impoverished agriculture sector, which supports half of the population. An Indian farmer earned ₹27 per day on average from cultivation activities in 2018-19, lower than wages provided by the country’s make-work rural job guarantee scheme, an official survey released recently showed.The agri-stack, which will be a digital repository, will aid precise targeting of subsidies, services and policies, an official said. Under the programme, each farmer of the country would be assigned an FID, or a farmers’ ID, linked to land records to uniquely identify them. India has 140 million operational farm-land holdings. HT had reported this first in a report in March this year.The database will connect seemingly simple data points: the number of occupational farmers who avail of subsidies, how much land they own, what they grow and which agro-climatic zones they fall in. These data points will be triangulated by software-driven intelligence that will throw up a far more illuminating picture of the rural and agricultural economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-signs-deals-with-firms-to-harness-big-data-for-farm-tech-solutions-unions-oppose-101631647237035.html

As many as 27 wings of the defence ministry including a navy station INS India, the Armed Forces Clinic and medical wing of the armed forces have been operating from these hutments for several decades.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on September 16 (Thursday) inaugurate the new defence ministry office complex at Africa Avenue, paving the way for the relocation to begin, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named.“The shifting of offices from the hutments will free 50 acres of land for Central Vista development. The defence ministry will vacate 9.2 lakh square feet of space in these hutments and take up 9.6 lakh square feet in two new multi-storeyed complexes that are spread over a total area of 13 acres,” said a second official.The complex at Africa Avenue is scattered across four blocks and offers a space of 5.08 lakh square feet while the KG Marg set up has three blocks and an office area of 4.52 lakh square feet.The new office complexes have been constructed at a cost of ₹775 crore provided by the defence ministry, with the work carried out by the ministry of housing and urban affairs as part of the Central Vista project, the second official said. The two complexes together have parking space for 1,500 cars.Instead of being spread out in various hutments and old buildings (A,B,E,G,H,J,L& M Block, Plot No 30 and Plot No.108 and Jodhpur House), co-location of these buildings will ensure greater efficiency and working, he said.The new buildings will also provide modern amenities, connectivity and welfare facilities like canteens and banks. The construction of the new complexes did not involve uprooting of trees, he added.According to the Central Vista plan approved by the Centre, the North and South Block office complexes will be turned into national museums, the Indira Gandhi National Centre will be relocated, and the National Archives will be remodelled. The Prime Minister’s residence will be shifted behind the existing South Block complex while the residence of the Vice President is proposed to be relocated behind North Block.HT on June 30 reported the vice president’s enclave and the new Parliament House will be the first buildings to be completed, and work on shifting the national museum to the North and South Block will commence last, in the elaborate plan for the Central Vista revamp that requires moving people and offices over the course of the next six years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-revamp-7-000-defence-ministry-officials-to-move-to-new-offices-101631646936366.html

In both cases, the convicts were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life for killing their wives.Without getting into the facts of the two appeals, a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai examined if a convict undergoing a sentence of life imprisonment has to undergo rigorous imprisonment or simple imprisonment.The term, “rigorous imprisonment”, is found in Section 53 of the Indian Penal Code which categorizes the nature of punishment for convicts. The provision defines rigorous imprisonment as “imprisonment with hard labour”. The court decided to examine this point since Section 53 IPC categorizes life imprisonment separately from rigorous imprisonment.The two-judge bench noted that in Naib Singh vs State of Punjab (1983), the Supreme Court answered this question by stating that “sentence of imprisonment for life has to be equated to rigorous imprisonment for life.” As the issue was squarely covered by the 1983 decision, the bench said, “The law laid down by this court in Naib Singh’s case was followed subsequently in three judgments…. In view of the authoritative pronouncements of this court on the issues that arise for consideration in these special leave petitions, there is no need to re-examine the limited point for which notice was issued.”The Assam government informed the court that one of the convicts, Mohammad Altaf Ali had undergone only nine years of imprisonment from the date of the incident in October 2006. Last year, he was granted an annual leave of 30 days following which he absconded and surrendered two months later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/life-term-for-convict-means-rigorous-imprisonment-says-supreme-court-101631646696975.html
15-09-2021||India||DMK announces 2 candidates for Rajya Sabha, Cong’s hopes dashed||The ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Tuesday announced its candidates for both seats from Tamil Nadu in the Rajya Sabha by-election, effectively scrapping any chance for partner Congress to bag a seat.Dr Kanimozhi NVN Somu, the medical wing secretary and a practising gynaecologist and the party’s East district’s secretary KRN Rajeshkumar Namakkal will contest in the Rajya Sabha bypolls to be held on October 4, said a statement from Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK chief MK Stalin.The Congress, a coalition partner of the DMK, was lobbying for one seat to accommodate one of its key leaders. According to two Congress insiders, party’s data analytics department chief Praveen Chakravarthy and former Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad’s names were doing the rounds for a possible Rajya Sabha seat from Tamil Nadu.While Azad, one of the senior most leaders of the party, needs to be accommodated, a group of young leaders had been supporting Chakravarthy for a Rajya Sabha berth. While Azad had told HT that his chance can come only when the Upper House berths of Jammu and Kashmir come up for vote again. Chakravarthy claimed no one ever offered him a Rajya Sabha ticket.A Congress leader added that the party’s chance might come next year from Tamil Nadu as more Rajya Sabha seats will fall vacant.The two vacancies arose following the resignation of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leaders KP Munusamy and R Vaithilingam, both of whom got elected as MLAs in the assembly elections held in April in Tamil Nadu. The results were declared on May 2 and the duo resigned on May 7 even though Munusamy’s term ends only in 2026 and Vaithilingam’s in 2022.The DMK-led alliance, also comprising Congress and Left parties, in the state has 159 MLAs in the 234-member legislative assembly. The ruling party is likely to win the two seats, which will increase its strength in the Upper House to 10 out of the total 18 seats the state elects and make the party the fourth largest in the Rajya Sabha.Earlier this month, DMK’s MM Abdullah was elected unopposed to a seat in the Rajya Sabha that fell vacant after the demise of AIADMK’s Mohammedjan earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-announces-2-candidates-for-rajya-sabha-cong-s-hopes-dashed-101631646218361.html

He added that the deputy commissioner of Mysuru and the tehsildar concerned have been given notices, asking them to explain why they acted without taking all the people into confidence.Vijayapura BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal demanded action against the officials who ordered the demolition of the temple. According to him, when the ruling BJP MLAs raised the matter in the BJP legislature party meeting, Bommai gave an assurance that such incidents will not take place.“The Supreme Court has given a specific direction, which needs to be examined. Until then if any officer crosses the line, then our government will take stringent action against him,” the MLA quoted the CM as having said at the meeting.Former chief minister Siddaramaiah had come down heavily on the government over the matter on Saturday. He alleged that the demolition was done without consulting the people in the region and the action “hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-demolish-illegal-temples-in-haste-will-issue-instructions-karnataka-cm-bommai-101631645864201.html

15-09-2021||India||Sixth victim of Shivamogga mine blast identified after 7 months||More than seven months after six people were killed in a dynamite blast at a railway crusher site in Karnataka’s Hunasodu village in Shivamogga district, police have confirmed the identity of the sixth victim. After a series of tests at the Forensic Sciences Labs (FSL), police identified the sixth victim as 32-year-old Shashi who was an autorickshaw driver. On January 22, a truck filled with gelatin sticks exploded at a gravel and boulder crushing facility, resulting in mild tremors in and around Shivamogga. In the investigation that followed, police were able to identify five victims of the blast -- Pawan Kumar (29), Javeed (28), Chelimanu Raju (24), Praveen (36), and Manjunath (35).The body of the sixth victim could not be identified since it was completely mutilated in the blast. According to police, there was suspicion that the body belonged to Shahi, since he was missing since the incident. “We collected DNA samples from the family members of Shashi. These were analysed at the FSL, and it confirmed last week that it was the body of Shashi,” said a Shivamogga police official. Close to a month after this blast, six men were killed in a dynamite blast in Karnataka’s Chikkabalapur district on 23 February, when they were allegedly trying to dispose of illegal explosives. Following the blast, after studying satellite images sourced from the National Remote Sensing Centre, the Department of Mines and Geology (DMG) and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) had identified 532 illegal quarries in Chikkaballapur district in 2019. The findings were mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report as well, in which DMG was asked to take action against these illegal quarries. According to the report, at least 11.12 crore metric tonnes of specified and unspecified minerals were illegally extracted, causing a loss of ₹223.25 crore to the state. Officials of DMG said there could be more than 2,000 illegal quarries across Karnataka. “There are around 450 licences issued for decorative stone quarries and 300 stone quarries. But there are many more quarries, we estimate it to be around 2,000,” said an official on the condition of anonymity. Following the similar blast in Shivamogga, former chief minister Yediyurappa’s home constituency, on January 22, police had begun a state-wide crackdown on illegal explosives. This crackdown was intensified following the blast in Chikkabalapur. A total of 20 cases involving illegal explosives were registered since February this year, including 14 by the Internal Security Division (ISD). Activists, however, claim that six months after these incidents, the crackdown on illegal mining in the state has come down. An activist based in Chikkabalapur said that the number of raids has come down. “Operations of the illegal mines which had stopped has restarted again in the district. The grey market in the district is active as well. We have told police about these we hope the action against illegal mines will die down,” said the activist on the condition of anonymity. Senior police officers refuted the claim saying that the action against illegal mines in the state continues. A senior officer in charge of a range said that in Mandya district licenses of 11 illegal mines for not procuring environmental clearance from the authorities concerned. “If anyone has any specific information about illegal mining we will take action,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sixth-victim-of-shivamogga-mine-blast-identified-after-7-months-101631645796951.html
15-09-2021||India||Forest department hunts for tiger that killed 19-year-old in Mysuru||The hunt for a tiger in the Nagarhole National Park range has been intensified near Mysuru after it killed a 19-year-old youngster from a tribal community, Karnataka forest department officials said on Tuesday. At least 50 personnel have been trying to track the movements of the tiger, aged 3-4 years, which killed the youngster from the Jenu Kuruba community, a forest dweller tribe, on September 8 in Hunsur in Mysuru district, about 125 kms from Bengaluru, the officials said. “We are just trying to collect the signs and data from the ground and three are no signs on the tiger which was involved in the conflict. We are getting signs and data about other tigers,” D Mahesh Kumar, deputy conservator of forests and director, Karnataka forest department, told Hindustan Times. The official said the department has set up 70 camera traps but the movement of the tiger is yet to be captured. Mahesh Kumar said, “The department is also using thermal drones to capture the movement of this tiger. It has so far has been able to take pictures of other animals but not of the particular one that is responsible for the death of the teenager.” The death of the youngster comes at a time when there has been an increase in human-animal conflicts in Karnataka and other states, which, according to experts, happen as animals are pushed out of their territory or due to encroachments for farming and other purposes. There have been 320 human deaths in tiger attacks in reserves between 2014 and 2020 across all states, according to a response by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and National Tiger Conservation Authority on September 3 to an RTI application filed by Kerala-based activist, RK Govindan Nampoothiry. Between 2014 and 2020, a total of ₹1,505.53 lakh was paid as compensation across all states where such attacks were reported, according to the response to Nampoothiry. This includes ₹998.20 lakh compensation in Maharashtra, ₹169 lakh in Uttar Pradesh, ₹128.53 lakh in Madhya Pradesh and ₹50 lakh in Karnataka. There have been at least 434 cases of tigers attacking cattle and humans in Karnataka in 2020-21, registering a 37% increase in such encounters from 316 in 2019-20, according to data from the state forest department, Hindustan Times reported in March. This includes at least nine deaths of humans in these two years and around 10-12 cases of injuries while a majority of them are of cattle being attacked or killed, according to the department. A tiger was found dead in Karnataka’s coffee-growing district of Kodagu after it had killed four humans, critically injuring at least one person and was responsible for the deaths of at least 25 cattle this March. On February 21, the forest department had captured a tigress lurking in the locality and the one on the prowl currently is believed to be a male. In a 2018 report from the Centre, titled ‘Status of tigers, co-predators & prey in India’, it was shown that only 1,923 of these big cats live within the reserves while around 35% of them are outside the protected forests. With an estimated 524 tigers in last official count, Karnataka is home to the second largest population of the big cats spread over forest ranges like Bandipur, Nagarhole, Biligiri Ranganatha Swamy Temple (BRT) and Bhadra, among other reserves.A growing number of wild animals, such as tigers, leopards and elephants, stray into areas of human settlements, agricultural lands and plantations in search of food outside the forests.Forest department data shows that there have been 17,561 human-animal conflicts in Karnataka in 2020-21 as against 16,314 in 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forest-department-hunts-for-tiger-that-killed-19-year-old-in-mysuru-101631645738213.html
15-09-2021||India||Karnataka government moves to take powers from poll body||The Basvaraj Bommai-led Karnataka government on Tuesday moved to appoint a commission for the exercise of delimitation of wards and other segments or rural panchayats that undercuts the state election commission. The Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Bill, that was tabled during the ongoing monsoon session on Tuesday, seeks to transfer the powers of setting up a delimitation commission to the government from the state election commission. The tabling of the bill comes at a time when all three political parties are gearing up to face the zila and taluka panchayat polls, expected to be held later this year. The polls will help political parties gauge the mood of the grassroots ahead of the 2023 assembly elections. And, according to people aware of the matter, the bill is suspected as a play by the government to advance the polls. The government also tabled the prisoners’ Identification (Karnataka Amendment) bill which makes provisions for authorities to collect blood, DNA, voice and retina samples of prisoners to monitor repeat offenders. The first installment of supplementary estimates aggregating to ₹10.625 crore for the current fiscal, including ₹2,858 crore for the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj department and ₹1,700 crore for food and civil supplies were also tabled. The Bommai-led government, meanwhile, faced a tough day during the session with the Opposition and some of its own legislators seeking responses on various civic, irrigation and other development works that have been promised, but are yet to be implemented. Bommai acknowledged that there were delays in installing LED streetlights in Bengaluru, which has created “dark spots”. The project to replace street lights with LED was approved in 2019 and the works were entrusted to BSPL, a consortium of Shapoorji Pallonji, SMC Infrastructure and Samudra Electronics Systems, under a public-private partnership, PTI reported. “This issue came up when I reviewed projects relating to Bengaluru after taking over as the Chief Minister. I had clearly said during the review that there is a delay in starting the work, it has to start immediately. They (company) have said the project will be completed in five phases, and it is decided that by December 31, three lakh LED bulbs have to be installed,” he said.The contract states that 485,000 street lights in the city’s municipal area are to be replaced over five phases and in around 30 months. Even Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators backed senior Congress leader Ramalinga Reddy, who said that no MLA in the city has received grants for street lights in three years. “I have asked officials to take up all five phases at once immediately... I will also instruct BBMP to do repairs and maintenance of existing streetlights,” CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-government-moves-to-take-powers-from-poll-body-101631645736980.html
15-09-2021||India||Karnataka high court rejects PIL on Mangaluru airport privatisation||The Karnataka high court on Tuesday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) filed against the privatisation of the Mangaluru International Airport. Adani Group took over the state-run airport, operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), on October 31 last year and started commercial operations there. The PIL filed by the Airports Authority Employees Union had sought quashing of a 2019 cabinet decision approving the leasing of three airports, including the one at Mangaluru, terming the move as “illegal, arbitrary and beyond the scope of the Airport Authority Act, 1994.” A division bench of acting chief justice Satish Chandra Sharma and justice Sachin Shankar Magadum said that since the Mangaluru airport was lease out based on a government of India policy, there was no scope for the HC’s intervention. A copy of the bench’s order is awaited. In 2018, the Union government had announced an in-principle approval for leasing out six airports in India —Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram, and Mangaluru -- through public-private partnership (PPP). Adani Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Ltd, was the highest bidder, the Union government announced later. Senior Advocate Ashok Haranahalli, appearing for the petitioners, referred to Section 12 of the Airports Authority of India Act and argued that there was no revenue sharing with the government and that the entire fixation of the lease is based on per passenger fee. He added that though it is called a PPP project, there is no revenue generated for the formulation of a public-private partnership. “The airport is given to a third party, which is not in consonance with the policy of public-private partnership model. This is not a partnership but just giving away,” Haranahalli submitted. Additional solicitor general MB Nargund, appearing for the Union government, said that a branch of the same petitioner union had filed a plea before the Kerala high court, which was rejected. The present petition is thus not maintainable, he contended. Meanwhile, the tag ‘Adani airports’ was removed from the name boards of the Mangaluru International Airport on Saturday following protests. After the takeover of operations, the logo of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) was replaced with the Adani Group’s logo. Changes were also made on Google Map where it was listed as ‘Mangaluru International Airport by Adani Airports’. A reply received under Right to Information (RTI) Act also revealed that there was no provision to change the airport name as per the agreement for operations and maintenance of the airport. Based on this RTI reply, activists served a legal notice in March this year to the AAI and the MIA director, questioning the ‘Adani’ tag attached to the name boards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-high-court-rejects-pil-on-mangaluru-airport-privatisation-101631645678322.html
15-09-2021||India||Web tool launched to ensure safer commute for students||The World Resources Institute (WRI) India, an organisation that is into environmental and sustainability research, and Underwriters Laboratories on Tuesday launched the ‘Safer Access to Schools’ (SATS), a web-based Geographic Information System to help policymakers make informed decisions on measures to ensure safer commutes for school-going children. The tool, WRI said, would help civic authorities, town planners and law enforcement officials by providing integrated data to bring in more measures for a safer school environment for children. “When it comes to safety around schools, there is a crucial gap in data-based understanding and interventions. Data is crucial to develop an evidence-based understanding of road safety concerns along each of the schools and can bring together various government stakeholders, NGOs, researchers, and private towards a collaborative action,” Sree Kumar Kumaraswamy, Head, Integrated Transport, WRI India, said in a statement on Tuesday.The tool was launched at the ‘Enabling Safer Streets for Bengaluru’ session at WRI India’s ‘Connect Karo 2021’ event. The launch of a tool, such as SATS, comes at a time when the poor quality of roads and footpaths in India’s IT capital is crumbling due to government apathy. Most of Bengaluru’s roads are in a pitiable condition as they are periodically dug up in the name of development, ‘smart city’ and a host of other image building attempts which have failed to improve the on-road conditions for its over 12 million residents and 9.4 million vehicles. An analysis by WRI indicates that pedestrians account for 37% of all road traffic fatalities between 2017-2020. “Almost 50% of pedestrian deaths occur on the city’s major arterial road network and 64% near the intersections. Data reveals that 20% of these pedestrian deaths also occur near metro stations and major bus stands,” according to WRI. Quoting National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2019, WRI said road traffic crashes account for 40% of all preventable deaths among children (0-18). “18.5 lakh children study in 6,200 schools in the city and 58% of these students walk to school, exposing them to crash risks. Studies suggest that most cases of fatal crashes with children are child pedestrians, followed by child cyclists,” WRI said. Successive governments in Karnataka continue to prioritise Bengaluru, which is its biggest income earner. The city also accounts for the highest expenditure with one of the poorest civic infrastructure in the country and bad roads leading to more avoidable deaths and slowing down traffic. “Bengaluru is a rapidly growing city with increasing mobility needs. We are working towards promoting walking and cycling in the city. We are also undertaking junction improvements and blackspot mitigation projects. The number of deaths on the city’s roads is not a welcome sign and we would want to work with organisations to make our streets safer, especially for children,” Gaurav Gupta, Chief Commissioner of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) said in a statement. Gupta, during the event, conceded that there were gaps in civic infrastructure and that the administration is promoting Non Motorised Transport (NMT) among other measures to bring down the pressure on the roads and other transport infrastructure.With live wires, open manholes, transformers and other obstacles, Bengaluru has little room for its pedestrians. The BBMP said that it has developed around 150 kms of footpaths with another 58 kms under the smart city project. “We have to continuously strive to design for non-motorised transport users. DULT is working on an ‘Active Mobility Act’, which gives pedestrians and cyclists the right to complete and connected networks. It puts the onus on local bodies to provide good infrastructure and has provisions for ‘Mobility Wardens’ from the public, who can give suggestions for infrastructural improvements. We need coordination and design policies in place, which will be followed by all stakeholders,” V Manjula Commissioner, Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/web-tool-launched-to-ensure-safer-commute-for-students-101631645677163.html

However, on Monday, the new infections fell to 1,580.Meanwhile, recoveries marginally dipped when compared to the new cases with 1,537 people getting discharged in the last 24 hours, aggregating to 2,585,244, leaving 16,549 active infections, a medical bulletin said.A total of 152,296 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, pushing the cumulative number of specimens examined to 44,527,080 till date.As many as five districts comprised majority of new infections with the State capital leading with 212 cases, followed by Coimbatore (201), Erode (128), Thanjavur (119) and Chengalpet (116). Ramanathapuram recorded the least number of new infections with two.Twenty six districts reported new cases in double digits, while there were no fresh deaths in 23 districts.Of the 27 fatalities, 20 succumbed in government healthcare facilities while seven died in private facilities. Four of the deceased were without comorbidity or pre-existing illness which include a 37-year old man from Vellore. The individual who tested Covid-19 positive on September 11, died next day (September 12) at the Vellore Medical College Hospital, due to Covid-19 pneumonia, the bulletin said.Earlier in the day, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin inaugurated the Whole Genome Sequencing facility that has been set up at a cost of ₹4 crore at the campus of the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services (DMS) here.The inauguration of the new facility on Tuesday, follows the announcement made by the government in the assembly last month.In a press release, the government said such a facility was not set up by any other government in the country and it would help identify the variants of Covid-19 virus sooner as against the earlier ‘time consuming’ exercise.Under the existing practice, the release said, the test samples of a patient was sent to the Whole Genome facilities to Karnataka and Telangana and were consuming time to declare the results.With the setting up of a similar facility in Tamil Nadu, it would be possible to identify the variants of Covid-19 much sooner, at the beginning stage itself and preventive measures can be taken to avoid the virus spread, the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-logs-1-600-covid-cases-27-fatalities-101631644958111.html

15-09-2021||India||Covid norms: Kerala high court seeks data on marriages held at Guruvayoor||The Kerala high court on Tuesday asked the Guruvayoor Devaswom managing committee how many marriages were conducted there in the last one month and what were the arrangements permitted for each of them.The query, one among several, was posed by the court to the temple’s committee during hearing of a petition initiated by the court on its own, based on news reports of the decorations for the wedding of industrialist Ravi Pillai’s son.The other queries posed to the committee by a bench of Justices Anil K Narendran and K Babu were -- why private security personnel were deployed for the wedding and whether devotees were prevented from entering the temple on the wedding days.The bench sought a detailed affidavit from the Guruvayoor Devaswom managing committee on the queries raised by the court before the next date of hearing on October 5.The court also impleaded the Devaswom secretary, Kerala government, Thrissur ASP, the temple managing committee’s Administrator, industrialist Ravi Pillai as well as the Collector and sectoral Magistrate of the area and issued notices to them, seeking their response in the matter.The court said that while people have a right to arrange marriages at the temple, it has to be restricted to the infrastructure available there.The Administrator of the Guruvayoor Devaswom, meanwhile, had filed an affidavit before the court, stating that the news reports, based on which the petition was initiated, were not fully correct and contained misleading facts.The affidavit said that Pillai was granted permission only to perform ‘pushpalankaram’ (flower decorations). However, the event management team hired by him had carried out some additional decoration work.It also said that when the temple officials noticed the additional work, it was ordered to be dismantled and the same was done by the event management company’s workers.It further said that no violation of Covid-19 norms was permitted during the wedding and urged the bench to drop the suo motu proceedings.The affidavit was filed in response to the court’s September 7 order, asking the administrator of the Guruvayoor Devaswom managing committee to explain why the ‘nadappanthal’ in front of the temple was decorated with huge cutouts and tree branches for the September 9 wedding of the industrialist’s son, as was reported in the media.A ‘nadapanthal’ is a structure set up in front of the temple for conducting various functions like weddings.The administrator was asked to file an affidavit explaining the facts and circumstances in which the ‘nadappanthal’ was decorated with the huge cutouts and branches of trees.The committee, on that date of hearing, had told the court that over 100 marriages were being conducted in the nadappanthal in front of Guruvayoor Temple in strict conformity with Covid-19 protocol, with each marriage party being permitted to have only 12 people, excluding the bride and bridegroom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-norms-kerala-high-court-seeks-data-on-marriages-held-at-guruvayoor-101631644897023.html

15-09-2021||India||Kerala: Suspended Congress leader Kumar quits party, joins CPI(M)||Suspended senior Congress leader K P Anil Kumar resigned on Tuesday and joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist), blaming the present Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) officer-bearers for their ‘authoritarian behaviour’. Kumar was suspended for airing his opinion against the district Congress presidents’ list released on August 28. Announcing his decision in Thiruvananthapuram, Kumar, a former KPCC general secretary, raised allegations against KPCC president K Sudhakaran.“We have a KPCC president who threatened to join the Sangh Parivar outfits on several occasions. I never intimidated the party like this. Disciplinary action should apply to all,” Kumar said. Politburo member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan handed the membership to Kumar at the party headquarters in AKG Centre. Reacting to Kumar’s decision, Sudhakaran said the Congress party already expelled him, and the CPI (M) was reduced to a ‘waste bin’, collecting disgruntled leaders from other parties. Earlier, another Congress leader P S Prashant expelled from the party, who later joined the Pinarayi Vijayan-led party. “The CPI(M) is rolling out red carpet for those rejected by other parties. It shows the party is bankrupt,” said Sudhakaran. But CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said more Congress leaders will leave the party in coming days. “The Congress-led UDF is facing a severe depletion. The party should inquire serious charges raised against the party president,” he said in Ernakulam. Dissension simmered in the state Congress unit after the elevation of the new leadership and came out in the open after the district Congress presidents’ list was released last month. Anil Kumar and another senior leader K Sivadasan Nair had criticised the state leadership in a news channel discussion, and both got suspended later. The KPCC said Nair’s explanation was satisfactory, but Kumar challenged the leadership in his reply to the show-cause notice. After the new list came out, even former chief minister Oommen Chandy and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala also expressed their displeasure publicly, but no action was taken against them, he said. “I have a 42-year-old relation with the party. Hailing from a freedom fighter’s family, I attended party programmes at the tender age of eight. I faced many sacrifices for the party but no point in continuing in the party,” he said. Later Sudhakaran denied all allegations raised against him. saying it was natural for an expelled leader to make such wild charges. “The party will be strengthened by leaving such leaders,” the KPCC president said. Opposition leader V D Satheesan also decried his statement. In the faction-ridden state unit, a fresh round began with the appointment of Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president (PCC) K Sudhakaran, a tough leader from Communist heartland, Kannur, and Opposition leader VD Satheesan, a grassroots leader. The move sidelined two powerful blocs, led by former Chandy and Chennithala, who dominated the state unit for more than a decade and a half. The announcement of new DCC presidents added to the internal conflict but more fireworks are expected with the impending list of KPCC office-bearers, as the new president is set to prune the jumbo committee. The party has 150-odd secretaries and many other office-bearers currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralasuspended-congress-leader-kumar-quits-party-joins-cpim-101631644838078.html
15-09-2021||India||Andhra-Telangana spar on power bill arrears||After sparring over sharing of Krishna river waters, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are now locked in a battle over electricity dues between the two states pending since the bifurcation of the combined state in June 2014.Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation (APGenco) on Monday moved the Telangana high court stating that the two Discoms of Telangana – Southern Power Distribution Company Ltd (SPDCL) and Northern Power Distribution Company Ltd (NPDCL) -- owed dues to the extent of ₹3,441.78 crore, along with interest of ₹2,841.90 crore, as on August 31, 2021.A division bench of the high court comprising acting chief justice M S Ramachandra Rao and justice T Vinod Kumar, which admitted the petition of APGenco, issued notices to the Telangana principal secretary (energy), SPDCL, NPDCL, and Telangana power co-ordination committee, asking them to file counters. The case was adjourned to October 28 for further hearing.Before the bifurcation of combined Andhra Pradesh, the two Discoms – SPDCL and NPDCL – located in Telangana region were drawing power from thermal power plants located in Andhra region, as per power purchase agreements (PPAs). Since the state was united, there were no payment issues.“After the bifurcation, the power plants located in Andhra and Telangana regions were allocated to the respective states. However, the two Telangana Discoms continued to draw power from the thermal power plants located in Andhra as per the PPAs and as such, they were supposed to pay the power purchase charges, but had been avoiding the same,” APGenco chairman and managing director B Sreedhar told Hindustan Times.After negotiations between the two states, he said, the two Telangana Discoms had paid bills to some extent till June 2017, but after that, they had stopped paying the dues altogether. “Everything is on paper – the power purchased by Telangana Discoms and the power purchase bills raised by APGenco. So, they cannot go back on payment of power bill arrears,” Sreedhar said.In April 2019, APGenco approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking recovery of dues from Telangana, but withdrew the petition subsequently on technical grounds and now approached the Telangana high court.State advocate general Subrahmanyam Sriram told the high court that the defaulting on clearing power bill arrears to the extent of over ₹6,283 crore by Telangana had severely affected the credit rating of the Andhra Pradesh electricity department, as it was not able to pay loans taken from the Power Finance Corporation and Rural Electrification Corporation, besides clearing dues to the fuel suppliers.When contacted, chairman of Telangana power generation corporation (TS Genco) and Telangana power transmission corporation (TS Transco) D Prabhakar Rao said TSGenco was also due to get power bill arrears from Andhra Discoms, which continued to buy power from Telangana power plants after the bifurcation.“After adjusting the dues from Andhra Discoms to TS Genco, the outstanding payables to APGenco by Telangana is around ₹4,887 crore including interest, and not ₹6,283 crore. It is an inter-state issue and can be settled through negotiations, instead of going to the court,” he said.Rao pointed out that Telangana had several other receivables from Andhra Pradesh, such as debt servicing for the loans taken on Anantapur and Kurnool districts, interest payments on bonds and deposits, and share in inter-corporate deposits, among others.“Taking all these receivables into account, Andhra Pradesh has to pay ₹4,457 crore to Telangana, after deducting the dues to be paid to it by Telangana Discoms,” the Telangana official said.Reacting on Rao’s claims, APGenco MD said it was not proper for Telangana to link its claims to the dues to be paid to APGenco. “We are only asking our power bill arrears due from Telangana Discoms. If Telangana has other dues from Andhra, it can as well approach the court,” Sreedhar said.TSGenco MD said all records would be placed before the court so that it would decide who was right and who was at fault.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhratelangana-spar-on-power-bill-arrears-101631644778815.html
15-09-2021||India||I don’t want to fit into the Dravidian political mould, says TN BJP president Annamalai||Recently-appointed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Tamil Nadu unit president K Annamalai is expected to overthrow current rulers Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in a state where the electorate has not warmed up to the national party. In an interview with Divya Chandrababu, Annamalai explains the party’s stance on NEET, suggesting that the BJP is not in the business of running medical colleges. He also clarifies that there is no factionalism over the recent scandal over a sexually explicit video released by a party member forcing BJP’s general secretary to resign from his post. Annamalai is confident that the BJP will rule Tamil Nadu in a few years, and as a former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, he doesn’t want to fit into a mould as a Dravidian politician. Edited Excerpts:BJP is the only party that has opposed the NEET Bill on Monday. Does this further alienate BJP from Tamil Nadu’s electorate?It is not people who think that they don’t want NEET, it is the DMK that doesn’t want NEET. It is their election agenda, and they have done it. NEET turnout is more than 94%--110k people participated (from Tamil Nadu on Sunday). People want NEET. 2020 was a good year for Tamil Nadu in its NEET performance. Last year, 57% of students passed the exam. Politically, they (the DMK) are playing to the gallery, trying to create emotional issues. It is all vested interests and emotional politics at play. BJP is very clear that NEET is pro-poor, pro-social justice, pro-Tamils. All this points to the fact that NEET is good for Tamil Nadu. They have got signatures from some 80,000 people in the A K Rajan committee’s report. The report is not yet public. The question is: who signed it? Anybody can sign it because they have a lot of party members. Even for BJP, to get signatures of one million people, who are pro-NEET, is not a big thing. In the Mekedatu dam issue, the BJP is on the side of Tamil Nadu, along with other parties, though your party is in power in Karnataka as well as in the Centre. How would you explain taking a different position? It’s a straightforward explanation. We have taken a position that is in the interest of Tamil Nadu and the nation. We believe NEET is good for Tamil Nadu because a poor student can get into a medical college without paying a capitation fee. BJP is not in the business of running medical colleges like what DMK is doing- DMK leaders have medical colleges. Why are you bringing Centre into Mekedatu? It is between two states. The Centre is a neutral arbiter. They will do what is right, as per law. So we have taken a position that favours Tamil farmers. In both (issues), our stand is consistent, logical and clear. As BJP chief now what is your assessment of why the party hasn’t been able to make a mark in Tamil Nadu? Tamil Nadu is very different. We have to understand that the BJP has been a party here since 1982. Dravidian parties have pre-existed since 1949. Secondly, Congress was in power for a long time in New Delhi and Tamil Nadu until 1967. As you can see, the party is growing well in the last seven years. BJP is growing very fast in Tamil Nadu because the Central BJP is paying special attention. We are happy with where we are. We are confident that in the coming years will be the BJP years. We stand for an ideology that is pro-Tamil, that is against corruption, and that is pro-development. People are coming to our party in large numbers, so it’s a matter of time before BJP will be the ruling party in Tamil Nadu. But BJP is often criticised as being anti-Tamil and an upper-caste pro-Hindi party. BJP supporters have said that it’s a media narrative.Many of the media here is controlled by political parties. They have affiliations to one party or another. That’s okay. That is how many states are. The local challenge is always there. But we are focused on a grassroots approach, taking the party to people’s doorsteps. To have direct contact with the Tamil voters and reaching out to the Central government beneficiaries. Once we can get the critical mass (voters), then I don’t think the negative propaganda will matter. If we do that, we should be okay. Even now, the negative propaganda will never work because vested interests are doing this. BJP leaders have said that the larger aim is to come on their own in 2026 to the state. Will you continue your alliance with the AIADMK for the ensuing local body polls?The party is determined by ambition. The alliance decision is always taken by the central Parliamentary board. As of now, our alliance has no problem, and we are cooperating right – in the Assembly and outside. As for who will contest and where the decision regarding this will be taken by the collective the central Parliamentary board. The recent controversy of the sexually explicit video has made experts question if it brought existing factions with the BJP to the fore.When an allegation comes against an individual, it is BJP’s culture is that they (the accused) stay away from party activities. That’s what has happened. The BJP is a very unified and determined party. There is no groupism in the party, unlike the G23 in the Congress and the Tamil Nadu Congress. You would have seen P Chidambaram’s meeting (on September 12 in Sivaganga district where a spat broke out between a Congress functionary and Chidambaram). The BJP is not like that. When allegations like this are thrown at us, we will look into it 100%, and the party will take action if there is any mistake. But till then, let’s wait for the enquiry committee to come out with its report.What is the status of the internal committee’s probe on the matter? The committee is investigating the root of the issue and they will get back. There is a personal observation that political analysts make is that you are running the BJP like a tough cop and not like a politician. I don’t want to be like a typical Tamil politician. I’m clear. If you fit me into a Dravidian politician mould, I’ll be happy that I don’t fit into that mould. I have a unique way of doing things. The BJP has a unique way of doing it. I don’t do any of these dealings (like DMK). BJP is a clean party. We want to back youngsters, see individuals grow and we want to show leadership at the grassroots level. As a political party, you don’t operate on black and white. You mostly operate in a grey area. I don’t want to fit into the typical Dravidian political mould. I stay away from that. So I’ll be happy if people pass that as genuine criticism. I’ll take that as an appreciation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-don-t-want-to-fit-into-the-dravidian-political-mould-says-tn-bjp-president-annamalai-101631644778167.html

The court further directed that the petitioner shall co-operate in inquiry and in case the petitioner does not co-operate, disciplinary authority may proceed to conclude the inquiry ex parte.While fixing the hearing for November 11, the court also asked the state authorities to file a reply in four weeks.Dr Kafeel, by means of present writ petition, assailed the suspension order dated July 31, 2019, on the ground that the order had been passed on July 31, 2019, and more than two years had gone by and the inquiry had not been concluded.It was further contended that since the petitioner was already a suspended employee, therefore, there was no purpose of passing a second suspension order.However, the state government’s counsel submitted that inquiry report against the petitioner had been submitted on August 27, 2021, copy of which was sent to the petitioner on August 28, 2021, asking the petitioner to submit objection against the report.“Considering the submissions advanced by the parties, matter requires consideration,” the court said.The court passed this order on September 9, which came into public domain on September 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-hc-stays-second-suspension-order-against-kafeel-khan-101631644238987.html
15-09-2021||India||India rejects UNHRC chief stand on Kashmir||India on Tuesday rejected the UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet’s criticism of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, saying her “unwarranted remarks” do not reflect the ground reality. In her opening statement at the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday, Bachelet had criticised restrictions on public assembly and frequent communication blackouts in Jammu and Kashmir. Responding to the statement, secretary (West) Reenat Sandhu of the external affairs ministry said India’s approach to global promotion and protection of human rights is based on “our own experience as a pluralistic and inclusive society and vibrant democracy”. She added, “We believe that promotion and protection of human rights are best pursued through dialogue, consultation and cooperation among states and through provision of technical assistance and capacity building.” Pointing to the references to India in Bachelet’s statement, Sandhu expressed India’s “disappointment over her unwarranted remarks on the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which do not reflect the ground reality”. “Any shortcomings in upholding human rights must be addressed in a transparent and impartial manner, anchored in respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs of states,” Sandhu said. India’s Constitution enshrines basic human rights as fundamental rights, and the Parliament, independent judiciary, media and civil society ensure full enjoyment of human rights by the people, she said. As part of a development agenda, the Indian government has undertaken targeted policy measures to empower the most vulnerable segments of society and had followed this approach despite challenges posed by the Covid-19 to save lives and livelihoods, she added. Sandhu also referred to the situation in Afghanistan and said it continues to be of grave concern. The UN Security Council resolution 2593 should guide the world community’s approach to Afghanistan as it reaffirms the importance of upholding human rights, including those of women, children and minorities, allowing safe passage for those wanting to leave the country and ensuring unhindered access for humanitarian aid. “The international community must stand with the people of Afghanistan in their desire to live in peace and dignity,” she said. Sandhu also said India is seeking re-election to the UN Human Rights Council for 2022-24, and looks forward to the continued support of member states for its candidature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-unhrc-chief-stand-on-kashmir-101631643943856.html
15-09-2021||India||Apple releases security update on Pegasus hack||Cyber surveillance company NSO Group has used new methods to deploy its military grade spyware Pegasus by leveraging previously unknown flaws in Apple’s software, prompting the company to issue a security update to millions of its customers late on Monday.The new version of the spyware was found by Canadian cyber security researchers at Citizen Labs, who discovered Pegasus implanted in the phone of a Saudi activist. The software flaw, like the others NSO is reported to have often leveraged, was particularly worrying since it allowed for the spyware to be inserted silently without needing to fool the victim into opening suspicious links or files.Apple confirmed a “sophisticated” attack had taken place exploiting the flaw, although it did not name NSO Group or Pegasus. “Attacks like the ones described are highly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals. While that means they are not a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users, we continue to work tirelessly to defend all our customers, and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data,” said Ivan Krstić, head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture, in a statement issued by the company.“We’d like to commend Citizen Lab for successfully completing the very difficult work of obtaining a sample of this exploit so we could develop this fix quickly,” the statement also said. NSO Group has maintained that it serves only to vetted government clients for law enforcement against criminals and terrorists. “But here we are... again: their exploits got discovered by us because they were used against an activist,” said John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at Citizen Labs, in a tweet on Tuesday.In a statement to Reuters, NSO did not confirm or deny that it was behind the technique, saying only that it would “continue to provide intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world with life-saving technologies to fight terror and crime.”Companies such as Apple are locked in a cat-and-mouse chase with companies such as NSO Group to fix flaws in their software before they are exploited for cyber surveillance and by cyber criminals. In 2019, Facebook sued NSO Group for a similar abuse of its systems when Pegasus was delivered to victims’ phones – including over a dozen in India – using flaws in WhatsApp. Since then, Microsoft, Google, Cisco, and VMWare have supported Facebook’s lawsuit against NSO Group.India’s Supreme Court too is expected to decide this week if and how it wants the Union government to answer questions on whether the spyware was used against Indian citizens, including current and former ministers, opposition leaders, judges, journalists and activists. The government has said it is not in a position to share these details because of national security implications.Apple and security researchers urged everyone using an iPhone, Apple Watch or a Mac to immediately install the latest software update. Citizen Lab, which named the latest method of hacking phones FORCEDENTRY, discovered it while analysing the phone of a Saudi activist in March. The hack was carried out by using code flaws in how Apple devices render images and PDFs, it said.In a blog post detailing the discovery, the researchers said they linked the new attack to NSO Group because of a forensic artifact that matched findings when Pegasus was found on the devices of past victims. Citizen Labs said it informed and shared the forensic evidence with Apple on September 7, making it one of the quickest responses to such a major security flaw – reinforcing its criticality.“Our latest discovery of yet another Apple zero day employed as part of NSO Group’s arsenal further illustrates that companies like NSO Group are facilitating “despotism-as-a-service” for unaccountable government security agencies. Regulation of this growing, highly profitable, and harmful marketplace is desperately needed,” Citizen Labs said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apple-releases-security-update-on-pegasus-hack-101631643756908.html
15-09-2021||India||Modi in Aligarh: World noticing India’s efforts to become defence exporter||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said India is shedding its image of being a major importer of military hardware and carving an identity for itself as a defence exporter, at a time the government has taken several measures to boost self-reliance in the key sector as well as tap the potential of defence markets globally. The PM said the world had taken note of the strides made by the country in defence manufacturing with locally produced equipment ranging from modern grenades, assault rifles and drones to fighter jets and warships. The PM made the comments during a ceremony to lay the foundation stone of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University at Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh. Aligarh, once famous for its locks and lock-making skills (a facr acknolwedged by the PM during his speech), is one of the six nodes of the UP’s government’s ambitious defence industrial corridor project aimed at boosting indigenous defence production and the Make in India initiative. The other five nodes in the state are Agra, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Kanpur and Lucknow. In the Aligarh Node, land has so far been allotted to 19 firms who will together invest ₹1,245 crore. The Centre has also set up a defence corridor in Tamil Nadu. India is wooing foreign partners to invest in the defence corridors for co-development and co-production of equipment. The PM said the hundreds of crores of rupees being invested in the Aligarh node will create thousands of jobs. He said the new industries coming up to support the manufacture of small arms, armaments, drones and aerospace-related products would give a new identity to Aligarh and its nearby areas. The defence industrial corridors will go a long way in creating much-needed manufacturing hubs in the country that will further help India’s transition from a weapons importer to exporter, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “These corridors, along with other steps taken to boost self-reliance, will not only provide fillip to the Make in India initiative but also create an ecosystem that will allow us to strengthen our position as an exporter globally,” Chopra said. The PM’s comments come at a time when the domestic defence sector is poised for big leaps in several areas including fighter jets, helicopters, airborne early warning systems, missiles, drones and other weaponry. State-run plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has set a March 2022 deadline to carry out the first flight of the LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jet. The defence ministry awarded a ₹48,000-crore contract to HAL for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF) in February. The first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the air force by March 2024, with the rest slated to join its combat fleet by 2029. Earlier this month, the PM-headed Cabinet Committee of Security (CCS) cleared two big Make in India projects worth ₹33,000 crore. It cleared the much-delayed purchase of 56 C-295 medium transport aircraft to replace the IAF’s ageing fleet of Avro-748 planes. The C-295 project is estimated to be worth ₹22,000 crore. It also cleared a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) proposal to develop new airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft for the IAF using Airbus jets bought from Air India. This project is estimated to be worth around ₹11,000 crore. Last week, the IAF inducted a medium range surface-to-air-missile (MRSAM) system capable of knocking out aerial threats such as enemy fighter jets, missiles, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles at a range of 70 km. India and Israel have jointly developed the MRSAM or the Barak 8 air defence system. Last month, the Indian Army accepted the delivery of the first batch of multi-mode hand grenades manufactured by a private sector firm. The defence ministry signed a contract with Nagpur-based private firm Economic Explosives Ltd (EEL) last October for supplying 1 million hand grenades to the army. These will replace a World War-II vintage hand grenade design being used by the army. The government has taken several measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector over the last two years. These include raising foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence manufacturing, creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware and notifying two lists of 209 defence items that cannot be imported (ban to be implemented progressively from 2021 to 2025). The items that cannot be imported include AEW&C systems, light combat aircraft, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, long-range land attack cruise missiles, basic trainer aircraft, specified types of helicopters and artillery guns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-in-aligarh-world-noticing-india-s-efforts-to-become-defence-exporter-101631643517102.html
15-09-2021||India||India’s vaccine drive remarkable: Melinda Gates||In an emailed interview to Rhythma Kaul, Gates Foundation co-chair Melinda French Gates explains how the health care delivery system is going to change post Covid-19 pandemic, and how India has remarkably managed to scale up vaccinations against the virus. Edited excerpts:1) How do you think the whole health care system will change post Covid-19?The Covid-19 pandemic has affected everyone. But it did not affect everyone equally. Historically, marginalized countries and communities were hit the hardest, and they continue to bear a disproportionate burden of the suffering, both in their lives and in their economies. What’s also clear is that the countries that had invested in their health systems over decades were better prepared to manage the pandemic.In the years to come, in addition to strengthening health systems, I’m optimistic the world will heed this lesson and make the long-term investments we need in research and development and manufacturing, especially when it comes to vaccines, and focus on interventions that best serve the most vulnerable. These investments are critical not just to address the next pandemic, but to get the world back on track to meet the Global Goals. And these investments must be made closer to the people who most stand to benefit, which helps us ensure that life-saving interventions and technologies are distributed equitably.2) In the Indian context, what should be the key focus areas of the government to manage such a public health crisis?The pandemic proves that preparing for crises starts years before they happen. India’s Covid-19 management and the country-wide immunization drive have demonstrated why long-term investments in health systems are crucial. In particular, India’s thriving R&D and vaccine manufacturing and delivery ecosystem have enabled the country to rapidly scale up Covid-19 immunization to deliver more than 750 million doses. That’s remarkable.It is also important for governments to put systems in place that can more quickly help the most vulnerable people to minimise the impact of such a crisis. India is taking some encouraging steps to do just that, such as implementing its Digital Health Mission to boost the efficiency and transparency in the country’s health care services. And the Indian government’s direct benefit transfer program, which has provided financial support to 200 million women during the pandemic, has helped those who have been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. Putting women at the centre of the economic recovery is something that all governments must continue to focus on and at the Gates Foundation, we remain committed to providing strong support to this. We’ve committed $2.1 billion globally over the next five years to promote women’s economic empowerment, to strengthen women and girls’ health and family planning, and to support women’s leadership.It is clear that we have to make sure that the most vulnerable groups and communities are protected whenever such crises occur. Strengthening social safety nets, improving service delivery to vulnerable communities, including women, and ensuring access to affordable quality health care will continue to be critical areas to focus on.3) How do you see this pandemic affecting global efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?It will take years to understand the full extent of the pandemic’s impact on the SDGs. As this year’s Goalkeepers report demonstrates, we have already witnessed considerable setbacks but we’ve also been able to avoid some of the worst-case scenarios on several key indicators — thanks to people around the world stepping up. Consider the global goal for routine vaccine coverage. A year ago, we predicted a drop of 14 percentage points in global vaccine coverage, which would have amounted to 25 years of progress lost. New analysis from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation shows the drop, while still unacceptable, was only half that.We have a lot of ground to cover on some important indicators, especially on gender equality, and we need to ensure continued efforts and commitment even on the issues where we avoided catastrophe. This is not simply a fight for one country. Regaining the lost ground on the SDGs needs to be a priority global effort.4) What’s your opinion on the inequity that we have seen in use of Covid-19 vaccines globally, wherein developed countries have vaccinated a major chunk of their population and are already looking at booster shots, and low-income countries are still waiting for doses?Despite some historic successes and unprecedented collaborations, we still have a long way to go to ensure everyone has equal access to vaccines. Outbreaks and new variants around the world show the consequences of this vaccine inequity and the significant and tragic costs of inaction. We have a moral imperative to remove all barriers and use every lever available to rapidly improve access to Covid-19 vaccines for everybody, everywhere. We’ve been focused on this mission over the last year, and we will keep it up. Until more people worldwide get the vaccine, we won’t be able to put the pandemic behind us.We’ve also seen that Covid-19 vaccine access is directly correlated with locations with vaccine R&D and manufacturing capability. Africa, for example, has 17 percent of the world’s population, but less than 1 percent of the world’s vaccine manufacturing capabilities. That’s why we support efforts to invest in and build a sustainable regional vaccine development and manufacturing ecosystem — to ensure vaccines can be available everywhere.The path forward is challenging. But it’s not impossible. We all can and must do more to accelerate the distribution of Covid-19 vaccine doses. Any country or company sitting on the sidelines should step in to do its part.5) What has been the silver lining looking at the past one-and-half year?It’s hard to think about silver linings amid so much devastation but the Covid-19 pandemic has also shown our collective resolve, resilience, determination and capacity to fight these challenges with innovation and collaboration. In the toughest of circumstances, countless individuals, organisations and countries went above and beyond to innovate, adapt and build resilient systems and to look out for one another. In India, we witnessed the unprecedented efforts of government, private institutions and millions of ordinary individuals coming together to help those in need. The Gates Foundation was proud to partner with the government and Indian non-profits to expand testing, surveillance, vaccine discovery and evaluating new and repurposed drugs.We also witnessed remarkable efforts from small collectives in India. Self-help groups played a crucial role in management of Covid-19 in their communities. For example, when Covid-19 arrived in Bihar — home to more than 100 million people — local self-help groups established trust with their neighbors by delivering meals and home-based health care to those who fell ill, then served as sources of information and support to encourage the community to get vaccinated. In Uttar Pradesh, apart from playing a similar role of community support that peer groups did in Bihar, self-help groups have also been engaged by the government to facilitate the state’s ‘Take Home Ration’ program and to support the most vulnerable. There are so many examples like these, and they all demonstrate that some of the most effective interventions happen at a hyperlocal level, headed by leaders who have worked long and hard to earn the trust of their communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-vaccine-drive-remarkable-melinda-gates-101631643354949.html
15-09-2021||India||UP polls: With ‘Ram Rajya’ in focus, AAP holds Tiranga Yatra in Ayodhya||With elections in Uttar Pradesh less than six months away, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh on Tuesday held a massive “Tiranga yatra” in Ayodhya, giving a call to establish a Ram Rajya and equating it with true nationalism and communal harmony.The yatra, which began at Gulab Bari, culminated at a public meeting in Gandhi Park after passing through important junctions such as Reed Ganj, Gudri Bazar, Niyawan and Rikabganj. It saw the participation of nearly 10,000 people, including AAP workers from several parts of the state, with almost all carrying Tricolours and raising slogans like “Vande Mataram”.“Fake nationalists are stunned by the chants of Vande Mataram by the energetic youths of Uttar Pradesh. The youths have come to know that real nationalism means good education, good health system, employment opportunities and a safe society where there is no fear of criminals,” Sisodia told news agency PTI. “The whole life of Lord Rama gives the message of brotherhood, forgetting the distinction of caste and creed, he teaches to embrace everyone,” he added, seeking to express his party’s resolve to establish a Ram Rajya in the state. Prior to the Yatra, both Sisodia and Singh, the AAP’s in-charge for Uttar Pradesh affairs, paid their obeisance and offered prayers at the Ram Janmabhoomi temple and the Hanuman Garhi Temple besides meeting several seers there. Seated in an open mini-truck, the two leaders then led the yatra. Political parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party have used Ayodhya to kick start their campaigns as momentum builds for the 2022 polls. The Supreme Court’s 2019 verdict paving the way for the construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site has brought the Ayodhya issue back to the centre stage ahead of the crucial polls.“With the grace of lord Ram and the blessings of saints, the AAP under the leadership of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is becoming a new definition of politics of honesty and development,” Sisodia told the crowd.Besides this, Sisodia also vowed to double the income of the state farmers, and ensure education for every child and health services for all if the party was voted to power. “It was a well-managed yatra. A large number of AAP workers had assembled for the event,” Shailesh Maurya, a local, said. The party has declared its intention to contest all seats in the upcoming elections. It has already held “Tiranga Yatras” in Lucknow, Agra and Noida and plans to take out more in the coming days. “AAP was vehemently opposing the construction of the Ram Mandir. In fact, Sisodia wanted a university instead of the temple. Now, in Ayodhya, they are talking about Lord Ram. Such two-faced people have been exposed. They have no political base in Uttar Pradesh,” BJP MLA from Ayodhya Sadar assembly constituency Ved Prakash Gupta said.

15-09-2021||India||Saudi foreign minister to visit India for talks on Afghanistan, Taliban||Saudi Arabia’’s foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud is expected to visit India this weekend to discuss the unfolding situation in Afghanistan even as Qatar has taken the lead in diplomatically engaging Kabul and legitimising the Taliban. India’s close allies in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are worried about the security ramifications of the emergence of a medieval theocratic Afghanistan state and the ties of the global jihadist network with the Taliban regime. The two countries are also perturbed by the active role played by Qatar, Turkey and Pakistan in engaging with Kabul’s Sunni Islamist regime, with Islamabad quick off the blocks in sending its first commercial flight to Kabul. Qatar is handling the technical side of airport operations in Kabul, while the Taliban is still considering handing over perimeter security of the airport to the Turkish military.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the Afghanistan situation with UAE crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on September 3 over telephone, external affairs minister S Jaishankar hosted Anwar Gargash, Diplomatic Advisor to the UAE President, on August 30 and exchanged notes on the Kabul crisis.It is in this context that the Saudi foreign minister is scheduled to arrive in India on September 19. Prince Faisal is expected to hold meetings with EAM Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and call on Prime Minister Modi. Jaishankar departs for New York for the UNGA and the QUAD summit the next day.Even though Qatar has been the lead player in the rise of Taliban in Afghanistan with Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani and Special Envoy Mutlaq bin Majed Al Qahtani visiting Kabul last Sunday, the global community is a long way from legitimizing the ultra-conservative regime in Kabul. It is evident to the international community that the present Taliban regime has full military and political support of Pakistani ISI with its chief playing the kingmaker in government formation in Kabul.The international community is also worried that 17 out of the 33 ministers of the new Afghan cabinet are designated as global terrorists by the UN and sanctioned against.Interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani actually has a bounty of $5 million on his head from the US State Department. The head of Haqqani Network, the most lethal of terrorist groups operating in Afghanistan, is also the country’s new head of intelligence.While countries such as China, Pakistan, Turkey and Qatar are engaging the Taliban, the international community is measuring the Sunni Islamists with UNSC resolution 2593 before taking a call on legitimising the male-dominated regime, which has indicated that it has no space for women and minorities. This time , Afghanistan apart from Indo-Pacific and coronavirus will resonate at the UNGA next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saudi-foreign-minister-to-visit-india-for-talks-on-afghanistan-taliban-101631643279272.html
15-09-2021||India||Special CBI court convicts Ranchi firm, 4 employees in Lalgarh coal scam||A special court on Tuesday convicted five persons in connection with an alleged coal scam case related to Lalgarh (North) coal block allocated in 2003, saying they acted in a synchronised manner and conspired to cheat both the ministries of coal and steel to get the allocation in favour of their Ranchi-based company.The court convicted Binay Prakash, then Managing Director of Domco Private Limited, Ranchi, Vasant Diwakar Manjrekar and Paramananda Mondal, both then Directors of Domco Private Limited, Sanjay Khandewal, a chartered accountant in Kolkata and the company Domco Pvt. Ltd. in the coal scam case. The court will decide on the quantum of punishment on September 15.Special Judge Arun Bhardwaj said, “They have acted in tandem to achieve their objective of securing allocation of Lalgarh (North) Coal Block in favour of A-1 (Ms Domco) by cheating Ministry of Steel (MoS), screening committee and MoC. Each one of them played his role. Lead role has been played by A-2 (Binay Prakash) being the Managing Director of the company who was corresponding with MoS and MoC making false submissions regarding availability of land with the company and financial preparedness to set up the plant,” the court said in its order.”According to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the case was registered on the basis of a preliminary enquiry initiated by the central agency on the directions received from the Chief Vigilance Commission related to coal blocks allocated during the period from 1993 to 2005.During enquiry, it was revealed that the Lalgarh (North) Coal block was identified in favour of the company by the 19th Screening Committee and accordingly, the company was intimated by Ministry of Coal (MoC) through a letter dated November 24, 2003. The charge sheet was filed on December 22, 2015 against the accused.CBI had alleged that Prakash, promoter director of Domco, entered into conspiracy with unidentified persons and submitted false information to authorities while applying for the block. It is alleged that Prakash made gains to the tune of ₹7 crore by selling shares of the company on premium, after the allocation of the coal block.On Tuesday, the court said it is apparent that Prakash, Manjrekar and Mondol being the Managing Director, Director and Director (Technical) respectively had a clear motive of making profits by securing allocation of Lalgarh (North) Coal Block in favour of A-1 company.“The synchronized manner in which A-1 (Ms Domco), A-2 (Prakash), A-3 (Manjrekar), A-4 (Mondol) and A-6 (Khandelwal) acted shows that they had definitely conspired with each other to cheat MoS, MoC and the Screening Committee by inducing them to believe about availability of land with the company and financial preparedness so that they are able to secure allocation of Lalgarh (North) Coal Block in favour of A-1 company,” the court said.“A-4 (Mondol), another Director of the company too conspired and certified false balance sheets. A-3, (Manjrekar) Director (Technical) too contributed in deceiving 19th Screening Committee believe that the applicant company owns 150 acres of land. This would not have been possible but for a conspiracy amongst A1, A-2, A-3 and A-4. A-6 has helped these accused persons by auditing false balance sheets though he was not even the Auditor of the company,” the court added in a 140-page judgment.The court said even though conspiracies are hatched in complete darkness and direct evidence is seldom available, it can be proved like any other offence on the basis of circumstantial evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-cbi-court-convicts-ranchi-company-4-employees-in-lalgarh-coal-corruption-case-101631643276815.html
15-09-2021||India||PM Modi hails ‘double-engine’ govt in UP, reaches out to farmers||Prime Minister Narendra Modi all but launched his Bharatiya Janata Party’s campaign for next year’s Uttar Pradesh elections with a ringing endorsement of the state’s current Yogi Adityanath-led government even as he reached out to small farmers and Jats, both critical to the electoral prospects of any party in the state. The PM was speaking at the event to lay the foundation stone of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University in Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh. In his 40-minute-long speech, Modi spoke of the contribution of Singh, a freedom fighter, social worker, and educationist and pointed out how Aligarh was on its way to becoming a hub of defence equipment manufacturing. He criticised the previous governments in UP for their poor management of the state, highlighted his government’s farm-friendly policies, and emphasised how UP was benefitting from a “double-engine sarkar,” referring to the BJP governments at the centre and in the state. The Prime Minister’s visit to Aligarh is widely seen as the launch of the BJP (the incumbent in the state) campaign for the upcoming assembly elections in the country’s most populous state. “As we celebrate Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav, honest efforts are being made to make the young generation aware of contributions of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh and others in our independence struggle,” said Modi, lauding Singh, a prominent Jat royal, as a visionary who donated his paternal property for the cause of education. Singh gave land for the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). There have previously been demands for AMU to be named after him.The Prime Minister also used the occasion to reach out to farmers. He spoke of former Prime Minister, the late Chaudhary Charan Singh, a Jat and farm leader from the state, “Various initiatives like increasing MSP, expansion of Kisan Credit Card, improvement in insurance scheme, provision of ₹3,000 pension are steps aimed at empowering small farmers. More than ₹1,40,000 crore has been paid to sugarcane farmers of the state,” he said. Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous state is headed for polls next year. Development, law and order, farm-related issues, health (including Covid), and employment are seen as major election issues, although caste and identity will also continue to play an important role in how people vote.Farmers in the state are among those protesting against three farm laws that the Modi government passed last year, and the PM’s emphasis on farmers and farming in his speech is seen as an effort to limit the political damage from this. Ahead of the previous assembly elections in the state, parts of West Uttar Pradesh witnessed communal riots that divided the farmer vote between Jats and Muslims. The farm protests have united the two communities, though. Some analysts see the recognition of leaders such as Singh by the BJP as part of an attempt to woo Jat voters.  “The India of the 21st century is correcting the mistakes of India of the 20th century. Our regime is making honest efforts to communicate the contributions by the greats like Maharaja Suheldev, Sir Chotu Ram and Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh to the younger generation,” said Modi. Showering praise on the Yogi Adityanath-led government in UP, the PM said: “Uttar Pradesh is emerging as a favourite place for investors from country and the world. The state is becoming a great example of double-engine government providing double benefit to the masses with BJP, both in the state and at the centre.”The “double-engine” has been a consistent political pitch for the BJP and Modi in almost all assembly elections since 2014. “Investments come when a conducive environment is provided. UP, once considered a hurdle in the country’s growth, has now begun leading the race to growth and this is a matter of pride” emphasized Modi. Talking about the defence corridor, the prime minister stated that India was on its way to transformation from a big importer of defence equipment to become an exporter of defence goods. He also drew an analogy between the famous locks of Aligarh and the defence corridor, saying that Aligarh, which once made locks that protected people’s homes is now contributing towards protection of country’s borders as well. PM Modi announced ₹9000 crore for the development of BrahMos missile at the defence corridor’s Lucknow node. Taking a swipe at the opposition Samajwadi Party, the PM said people cannot forget all the scams that took place in UP, when the party was in power from 2012 to 2017. “Uttar Pradesh was run by gangsters and mafias before 2017, but now things have changed under chief minister Yogi Adityanath and such elements are behind bars,” said the PM highlighting that 80 million people had been inoculated in Uttar Pradesh free of cost and the state holds the record for maximum vaccinations in a day.AKHILESH RESPONSE Rahat Abrar, a political analyst and retired HoD, Urdu, at AMU, said the Prime Minister’s speech is the beginning of the BJP’s campaign in the poll-bound state. “The PM’s speech initiated the campaign for the party in the all-important western Uttar Pradesh, which is believed to be most affected by farmers’ agitation against three farm laws. The western UP belt is dominated by Jats and there couldn’t have been a better way to address Jat voters than by praising Raja Mahendra Pratap singh – a prominent Jat leader,” said Abrar. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who also spoke at the event, praised the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying he has led the country in its fight against Covid-19 by giving two ‘swadeshi’ vaccines and vaccinating 750 million people (so far) in the country. “While the world struggled in its fight against Covid-19, the prime minister led the nation and created an example to be followed by others,” said Adityanath who also praised the Union government’s New Education Policy. “Now, all parties are in election mode. The BJP fought the last UP elections with Modi as the party’s face. Now, it seems the party is going to deploy the ‘double-engine’ idea with Modi-Yogi as a combination. The combination certainly looks formidable against the fragmented opposition,” said Prof SK Dwivedi, a political expert and the former HoD, political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmmodi-hails-double-engine-govt-in-up-reaches-out-to-farmers-101631643217856.html
15-09-2021||India||Covid violations led to rise in total cases filed in 2020||For a year with over two months in a hard lockdown for the country, 2020 logged a sharp increase in the number of criminal cases registered, according to the National Crime Records Bureau’s Crime in India report released on Tuesday.
15-09-2021||India||50°C temperature becoming more frequent: Report||The number of extremely hot days in a year – when the temperature soars past the 50 degrees Celsius mark – has doubled across the world since the 1980s, according to an analysis by BBC which underlined the harsh realities of the global climate crisis.The study says the number of days on which the mercury goes past 50°C has been consistently going up in every subsequent decade since 1980.Between 1980 and 2009, temperatures went past the 50°C mark 14 days per year on average. But between 2010 and 2019, that number shot up to 26 days, the BBC analysis has found.That apart, the temperature mark of 45°C has also witnessed a sharp jump during the same time period, being recorded an extra two weeks per year on average. The 50°C mark is commonplace in the West Asia region, especially during the long summers. But climate scientists sat up and took note when nearly-50°C temperatures began to be recorded in more temperate parts of the world, such as in Canada and Italy, this summer. Italy witnessed a record high of 48.8°C and Canada saw the mercury shoot up to a high of 49.6°C. Climate experts fear that the dreaded 50°C mark could soon be recorded in more parts of the world unless fossil fuel emissions are kept on a tight leash.If more and more temperate parts of the planet see temperatures booming past the 50°C mark, the entire human race would end up facing unprecedented challenges. “We need to act quickly. The faster we cut our [fossil fuel] emissions, the better off we’ll all be,” says Dr Sihan Li, a climate researcher at School of Geography and Environment at University of Oxford, according to the BBC study. “With continued emissions and lack of action, not only will these extreme heat events become more severe and more frequent, but emergency response and recovery will become more challenging.” The same analysis also quotes Dr Friederike Otto, associate director of Environmental Change Institute at University of Oxford. “The increase [in temperatures] can be 100% attributed to the burning of fossil fuels,” says Dr Otto, echoing the concerns of Dr Li. Climate scientists fear that the unbridled burning of fossil fuels has invariably been resulting in the whole world warming up faster than before, which in turn would make extreme temperatures more likely in the near future. Experts fear, as the analysis points out, that extreme temperatures can be dangerous for both flora and fauna, with human civilisation facing unavoidable challenges, such as problems with infrastructure and power systems. The BBC analysis is likely to come up when the world’s key stakeholders in the fight against the climate crisis converge for a major UN summit in Glasgow in November, known as COP26. The gathering could see governments around the world given emission-cut targets in a bid to reign in rising temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50c-temperature-becoming-more-frequent-report-101631643156151.html
15-09-2021||India||Won’t review order on SC/ST quota: Top court||The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that Union and state governments’ policies on reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/STs) will have to meet all the conditions laid down in two previous Constitution bench judgments.The two judgments mandate the Centre and the states to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of SC/STs at different levels of public employment, assess the impact of reservation on overall administrative efficiency, and exclude the “creamy layer” before providing for reservation in promotions. Until the top court’s 2018 verdict, the concept of creamy layer applied only to other backwards classes (OBCs). State governments complain that this policy is complicated and hard to implement, and creates backlog.A bench, headed by justice L Nageswara Rao, was hearing a clutch of petitions arising out of judgments from 11 different high courts, which delivered their rulings on various pertinent reservation policies in the last 10 years. Some of the states from where these judgments arose are Maharashtra, Bihar, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab.As soon as the matter commenced before the bench, which also included justices Sanjiv Khanna and BR Gavai, the court clarified that it would not entertain any request for reconsidering the previous judgments in M Nagaraj (2006) and Jarnail Singh (2018) cases, which prescribed conditions for policies on reservation in promotion.“We make it clear that we are not going to reopen Nagaraj or Jarnail Singh (cases). We have a limited scope in these matters after our judgments. We are going to only examine if the high court judgments have followed the principles laid down by us in these two judgments,” said the bench.On his part, attorney general KK Venugopal, representing the central government, questioned the Nagaraj judgment, contending that the condition regarding collection of quantifiable data to show inadequacy of representation of SC/ST is “vague”.Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing in some of the cases on behalf of reserved category candidates, complained that the two judgments do not define what is meant by adequate representation or efficient functioning, which, she claimed, have been creating a lot of confusion in providing for reservation in promotion. Jaising pleaded that some guidelines could be given by the bench to clarify the previous judgments.But the bench turned down this request. “We are not going to lay down any guidelines on how Nagaraj or Jarnail Singh [cases] are to be followed. We have already said in [the] Jarnail Singh [case] that it is for the states to figure out how the principles of Nagaraj [case] will have to be followed in the context of adequacy of representation and overall efficiency,” it retorted.Senior advocate PS Patwalia, appearing for governments of Bihar and Maharashtra, also tried to raise some issues about the judgments in Nagaraj and Jarnail Singh cases and rued that the almost 60% promotional posts in Bihar are lying vacant due to certain confusion.Representing general category candidates, senior lawyers Rajeev Dhavan, Meenakshi Arora, Gopal Sankaranarayan and advocate Kumar Parimal, strongly objected to submissions for revisiting the previous judgments.“We are making it clear to all the counsel that we will not reopen Nagaraj or Jarnail Singh. Counsel should argue accordingly,” remarked the bench.At this point, Venugopal tried to revive the Centre’s request for permitting it to make ad hoc promotions to fill over 130,000 vacant posts in public employment across the country. The law officer said that these promotions will be made purely on the basis of seniority and without creating any rights in favour of these employees who could be sent back to the lower post if the court were to decide against promotion of such candidates in its final order. He pointed out that the status quo order by the court, passed in April 2019, was making governance and functioning of several departments very difficult.But the bench, which earlier in July 2020 and January 2021, declined to grant such permission , turned down the request yet again. “You have already tried for such an order before and we did not allow it. Please wait for some more time,” it told Venugopal.The court also refused a plea by the AG to recall the contempt notice issued to Secretary, Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), for allegedly breaching its status quo order on promotion of Central government employees. While Venugopal said that the DoPT secretary had cleared some temporary ad hoc promotion on the basis of a legal opinion given by him, the court said that a final view will be taken only when the clutch of cases is taken up after two weeks.The bench asked the counsel for the Union and state governments to identify the issues peculiar to them and submit written submissions on such issues in the next two weeks, following which the matter will be finally heard from October 5.Why states complainIn the M Nagaraj and Jarnail Singh cases, the Supreme Court held that if the state decides to allow reservation in promotions, it would have to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of a class in public employment in addition to maintain overall administrative efficiency.It has also made the creamy layer test applicable to reservation in promotions of SC/ST — in the case of OBCs, at the entry level, creamy layer is defined as people with an annual family income of over ₹8 lakh.There is no reservation in promotion for OBCs.States find these yardsticks too difficult to achieve, and have complained about standards to collect quantifiable data to show inadequacy of representation.They also want a clarification whether the inadequacy of representation has to be understood in relation to the cadre or a department or the state as a whole. The additional conditions to exclude creamy layer and assess administrative efficiency at the time of giving promotion have also created problems for the states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-review-order-on-sc-st-quota-top-court-101631643099093.html
15-09-2021||India||Congress panel zeroes in on issues for protests against Modi govt||A Congress panel led by former MP chief minister Digvijaya Singh, in its first meeting on Tuesday, has identified several issues for both long-term and short-term protest movements against Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre, said two members, requesting anonymity.The nine- member panel constituted by party president Sonia Gandhi on September 2 has its task cut out to identify and prepare issues for protests. In the first meeting on Tuesday, Singh and other members discussed many issues and identified price rise, Pegasus spyware, recent developments related to procurement of Rafael jets , the management of the Covid-19 pandemic and job loss as key issues, said one of the members, who attended the meeting, on condition of anonymity.Some other issues including strengthening the party’s Dalit outreach and the need for an agitation for releasing caste data census. “It has been decided that the panel will prepare a report on all such important issues and send it to the Congress president for her approval,” said one of the panel members, requesting anonymity. Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also present in the meeting. Other panel members include BK Hariprasad, Ripun Bora, Manish Chatrathat, Udit Raj, Ragini Nayak, Uttam Kumar Reddy and Zuber Khan.The panel also decided that a close coordination with other sections of the party is important to ensure that the protest plans don’t clash with the Congress’ celebrations of the 75th year of Indian Independence, said the person mentioned above. In August, the party decided to organise year-long celebrations across India to mark the 75 years of the country’s Independence. The Congress and other Opposition parties have already announced ten days-long protests this month over Pegasus, farm laws and otthe issues. Singh’s panel will make long-term protest plans against the Centre.The panel also discussed how to improve the party’s usage of social media and the need to reach out to the Congress workers at the booth level, said the panel member mentioned above. The committee also identified farm laws, Covid 19 compensation, misuse of sedition laws as possible issues.A note of tentative subjects, prepared by former MP Udit Raj (is he also a member of the panel?), also reads: “Rahul Gandhi is to be made the president of the Congress party as it is most important in view to counter the cult of (PM Narendra) Modi.” Notably, the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), the students’ wing of Congress, in its two-day National Executive ‘Sankalp’ on Sunday proposed to appoint Rahul Gandhi as the party chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-panel-zeroes-in-on-issues-for-protests-against-modi-govt-101631642502403.html
15-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Sept 15, 1970— ‘Maggie’ court achieves grand slam — a rare feat in tennis history||Mrs Margaret Court became the toast of the tennis world here yesterday as she became the second woman after “Little Mo” to achieve the coveted grand slam by adding the U.S. title to her Australian, French and Wimbledon crowns. Tall, athletic Perth housewife Maggie made history with a facile 6-2, 2-6, 6-1 win over Rosemary Casals (U.S.) in the final. Maureen Connolly was the first woman star to bring off the mighty sweep of four major titles in one season in 1953. It was such a feat that evaded such immortals as Suzanne Lenglen, Helen Wills, Helen Jacobs and Althea Gibson. Mrs Court has now won nine Australian titles, three French, three Wimbledon and four U.S. crowns plus numerous others. The U.S. men’s title went to Ken Rosewall who overcame fellow Tony Roche 2-6, 6-4, 7-6, 6-3 in the final. A record crowd of 14,502 saw the exciting Rosewall-Roche centre court duel reach its climax in the third set which, after an exchange of breaks, went into a sudden-death tie break. It obviously was the turning point of the match. The sudden death is a new scoring system introduced this year on a trial basis to effect at terminal point in tennis. When the score reaches, 6-6, the competitors play best five of-nine points, alternating services. Roche had the first two services. Rosewall won the first point on a perfectly-played lazy lob Roche next netted a high backhand volley. Rosewall led 2-0 and he had two services coming up. Rosewall, now serving, put out a volley but on the next point he zipped a forehand volley like a gun-shot past Roche’s racket. He led 3-1. The serve shifted to Roche, Rosewall scored on a forehand return for 4-1. Roche served and smashed for 4-2. On the next point, after a long and excitive rally, Roche overhit a backhand and the set went to Rosewall. It was all downhill after that for Roche. Roche was broken again in the second game of the fourth set. Rosewall, sensing victory, never relaxed, returning balls with fantastic sharpness and accuracy, and proceed to serve out the set and the match. The women’s final played before a sell-out crowd of more than 14,000 at the West Side Tennis Club produced patchy, erratic tennis. In the final analysis, Mrs Court was simply too strong and too good. Rosemary obviously was shaken by the increased ferocity of the Australian’s attack. Her service became more tentative, she double-faulted four times and her ground shots lost the grip they had in the second set. A perfectly-executed backhand lob gave the rangy Australian a second service break in the sixth game and little ‘Rosie’ had spent her ammunition. Mrs Court methodically served out the set and the match. The first set produced lack-luster tennis with neither competitor playing to her full potential. Rosemary excited the gallery by winning her first service at love and hanging on for 2-2 through the first four games. But Mrs Court took charge and won the last four games of the set in a row. The first prize was $7,500 ( ₹56.250). Miss Casals received $3750 (RS 28,125). For a few tense moments, it appeared that Mrs Court might not make it. In the second set, Mrs Court lost her composure and timing completely. She dropped three straight services in the third, fifth and seventh games-making errors on the simplest of shots. In the seventh game, she double-faulted, hit a forehand over the back line and dumped two volleys into the net. Broken at love, she seemed despondent and merely went through the motions as Rosemary served out the set, clinching it with a looping forehand down the line. During that surge, the 21-year-old American won nine straight points. But it was a different Mrs Court who answered the call for the final set. She hammered out the first game on service, broke Rosemary in the second and held again for a 3-0 lead. Rosewall, a semi-finalist here as far back as 1953, became the second oldest player to win the title. Only Bill Tilden, who won it for the last time in 1929 at the age of 36, was older. In the mixed doubles final, Mrs Court teamed with Marty Riessen (U.S.) to defeat Judy Dalton (Australia) and Frew McMillan (South Africa) 6-4, 6-4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-sept-15-1970-maggie-court-achieves-grand-slam-a-rare-feat-in-tennis-history-101631642017341.html
15-09-2021||India||PM Narendra Modi set to launch Sansad TV today in Delhi||Sansad TV, which replaces the existing TV channels, Lok Sabha TV and Rajya Sabha TV, will be inaugurated on Wednesday in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The integrated platform was conceptualized nearly two years ago after a panel led by Prasar Bharati CEO Surya Prakash submitted a report approving a common platform for two channels.Hindustan Times first reported the launch on August 4. Sansad TV will have two channels to ensure live streaming of both Houses when Parliament is in session. A Rajya Sabha official who asked not to be named said: “The preparations for the channels are over and these are ready for launch. The authorities are waiting for a time from the PM to launch the new channels.”Officials said the Rajya Sabha TV establishment—it runs from a rented property adjacent to the Talkatora stadium—will be merged with LSTV’s infrastructure to create the new entity.Former textiles secretary Ravi Kapoor has been appointed as the CEO of the new entity on contract for a period of one year, an internal order of the Lok Sabha secretariat said. During the recess, the channels will run current affairs programmes in English and Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmnarendra-modi-set-to-launch-sansad-tv-today-in-delhi-101631641662447.html
15-09-2021||India||Hindi not competing with any local language: Amit Shah||“If PM can speak Hindi internationally, what are we embarrassed about?,” asked home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday, as he pitched for the wider use of the language in the country on the occasion of Hindi Diwas.“Gone are the days when speaking in Hindi was a matter of embarrassment... If PM can speak Hindi internationally, what are we embarrassed about?... The government is committed towards parallel development of Hindi and all Indian languages,” he said, in a virtual address to an event organised at Vigyan Bhawan by the Department of Languages in the ministry.Hindi Diwas is celebrated on September 14 to mark the day the Constituent Assembly adopted the language as an official language.Asserting that ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ (self-reliant India) meant being ‘atmanirbhar’ in terms of language, the Union minister said: “Being atmanirbhar is not just about the production of goods within the country. We have to be atmanirbhar even with languages and only then our imagination of Aatmanirbhar India will be fulfilled. If we don’t become atmanirbhar  in terms of our language, self-reliance would not mean anything.”He added that all Indian languages complement each other. “Different opinions come. But I want to clarify that Hindi is not competing with any other Indian language. It is actually a sakhi (friend) of all Indian languages and it will prosper only with co-existence.”Shah further suggested that just like September 14 is an occasion to reassess and review efforts to promote Hindi every year, a similar and simultaneous exercise should be undertaken to promote all local languages too. “No foreign language can connect you with this country’s core thoughts. If you abandon your language you will be cut off from your roots. Such people will never prosper,” he said.Referring to the New Education Policy (NEP) envisaged by Modi, Shah asserted the provisions for promotion of regional and Hindi languages. He said the technical education syllabus is translated into five Indian languages -- Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Bangla -- and it would be rolled out in 14 colleges across eight states.Amit Shah’s speech this year is in continuation with his 2019 speech, when he advocated for ‘One Nation, One Language’ and stressed that only Hindi is a “unifying language”.The remarks had sparked a furore and invited sharp reactions from opposition political parties, particularly in south India. Denouncing Shah’s comments, Stalin had then called it a sign of “Hindi imposition”.On Tuesday, coming in support of the voices against Hindi Diwas celebration, JD(S) leader and former Karnataka chief minister H D Kumaraswamy said in a Twitter post: “Kannada is first in Karnataka. Hindi Diwas celebration is unnecessary. Let’s not disturb the peace in multilingual India by imposing Hindi.”Several other organisations like Karnataka Janaadhikaara Paksha observed it as ‘Black Day’.(WITH PTI INPUTS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindi-not-competing-with-any-local-language-amit-shah-101631641416648.html
15-09-2021||India||Urgent to raise climate ambitions further: John Kerry||US special envoy on climate change John Kerry said on Tuesday he has urged the Union government to think about announcing a 450GW renewable energy goal by 2030 as part of India’s nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement at the UN climate change negotiations (COP 26) in Glasgow in November, stressing that modelling studies indicate the goal could put India’s NDC on track to keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.India and the US launched the Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation Dialogue (CAFMD) on Monday -- a partnership to attract investment and technology in clean energy projects. The dialogue is one of the tracks to finance projects for to mitigate the climate crisis under the India-US climate and clean energy agenda 2030.“Finance and technology will be critical for India. On the climate action tracks we want to work very closely, do whatever we can to accelerate the achievement of 450GW of renewable energy. Why? Because it’s a big number. It’s an ambitious goal, and India as a developing nation can make a major effort to keep world temperature increase at 1.5 degrees Celsius. I personally urge that the government think about announcing that as part of its nationally determined contribution because to do so is really to help other countries realise that nations are stepping up in a significant way to deal with the crisis,” he said in a press briefing on Tuesday.Kerry said that during his meetings with Indian government officials on Monday, including Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav and power minister RK Singh, they did not spend much time talking on net zero emission target by 2050. “We did talk about it. What we focused on is now, which is 450 GW. The modelling shows that when India achieves that, India is on track to hold on 1.5 degrees,” he said.India hasn’t assured him on enhancing its NDC yet.According to Climate Action Tracker, an independent agency tracking climate action, India’s NDC is 2 degrees C compliant, but there is potential for the nation to become a world leader with enhanced 1.5 degrees compatible targets, and just a swift transition away from coal to accelerate the switch to renewable energy. The tracker is still analysing US’s NDC by incorporating recent announcements the Biden administration has made.“No one said no, but no one said yes either. It’s the PM’s prerogative. Internal deliberations need to take place in India. We have nine years to implement decisions to keep catastrophic climate change at bay according to the latest science. I have told India it is urgent. We have to get this done. They said they will take a look at that and will evaluate it…I anticipate increases in effort,” Kerry said.A senior environment ministry official, who asked not to be named, said: “He (Kerry) has urged us to raise ambition in our NDC. We have said that is the PM’s call. We cannot commit to anything immediately. The 450 GW is PM’s goal for the nation.”On being asked if the 1.5 degree goal was still alive considering that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said last month that it was extremely difficult if not impossible to limit global warming to that mark, Kerry said it was still doable if all countries got on board.“Let’s be honest. It’s very difficult. It is doable and the track we have put us on does that. In the US, President Biden has said that we are going to reduce our emissions by 50% to 52% over the next 10 years. Is that an arbitrary number? That’s what science and scientists have told us that we need to do. The IPCC report says minimum of 45% reduction in emissions. We are reaching for more and trying to push the curve. Europe is at 55%; UK at over 70%; Japan is at 50%; Canada over 45%. That’s 50% of global GDP right there, and if we get India to come on board then all of a sudden we are growing that capacity towards 1.5 degrees C. It’s a heavy lift but doable. It’s not doable if we don’t reduce enough in the next 10 years, which will decide if net zero is achievable by 2050,” he said.Kerry also acknowledged that there were some differences on climate goals with China.“We had respectful exchanges (in his meetings last month) and negotiations, and made some progress. But we did not agree yet on some components of the larger choices of how we address the climate crisis as we go into COP 26. But we agreed to meet again. Since I was in China, President Biden and President Xi Jinping had a number of conversations. I am hopeful that we can make some progress.”On Monday, Kerry said six largest banks in America have all publicly committed that over the next 10 years, they will invest a minimum of $4.16 trillion in global transition to clean energy. On Tuesday, he clarified that the money is “not concessionary”.“It is money that will be invested in the transition and this sector. It’s a very important commitment. We can help find some concessionary de-risking money through various efforts like blended finance, in some cases direct finance from countries but if you blend that together you get support. One of the things we will work on is green hydrogen. The banks are already investing in some projects but this wasn’t upping the game and so six banks have stepped up.”Experts said US would have to be at the centre of any meaningful effort to combat the climate crisis.“Such partnerships are crucial to get the upfront capital India needs to scale up low carbon investments and to drive down the costs of decarbonisation technologies. To avoid the worst climate change scenarios cautioned in IPCC’s latest report, the US needs to rapidly cut GHG emissions at home and to provide sufficient climate finance to developing countries,” said Ulka Kelkar, director-climate program, World Resources Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/urgent-to-raise-climate-ambitions-further-john-kerry-101631641118416.html
15-09-2021||India||Farmers are angry for valid reasons, but there are no easy solutions||There are unmistakable signs the protests which started last year against three farm laws enacted last year, are regaining momentum, perhaps in sync with the forthcoming state election cycle, which includes the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.The heat generated by the protests has also created disquiet within the ranks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). RSS’s farmers’ wing, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) held protests outside the office of all district collectors on September 8, seeking action on a memorandum it submitted to the Prime Minister on August 11. The BKS statement announcing the protests was unequivocal in recognising agrarian distress. It attributed the disquiet among farmers to the absence of remunerative prices for their produce that took into account the cost of production.Here are three charts which explain the current distress in agriculture and why there are no easy solutions.Positive growth might not have helped farm incomes in 2020-21India’s GDP suffered an unprecedented contraction of 7.3% in 2020-21, largely a result of Covid-19, the 68-day long lockdown, which was imposed on March 25, 2020, and other restrictions on movement and activities that lasted almost the entire year. Among the major sectors of the economy, agriculture was the only one that escaped a contraction, a result of that fact that farm sector activity was not interrupted by the lockdown.However, there is good reason to believe that farm incomes went down during the lockdown, and perhaps subsequently as well. This is likely to have happened because of a reverse migration of non-farm workers to agriculture. The rise in number of workers is likely to have pulled down the value added or income per worker in agriculture. This was shown in an HT analysis of 2019-20 Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data published on July 27, 2021.Relative prices have turned against farmersEvery business related to agriculture, from those providing inputs to others involved in marketing produce have “flourished”, the statement adds, but farmers are becoming “poorer by the day.” This underlines the crisis of worsening terms of trade (ratio of farm and non-farm prices) in agriculture. The ministry of agriculture releases disaggregated terms of trade data for agriculture, but these estimates are not available after 2018-19. Statistics which are available show a worsening of terms of trade between 2016-17 (99.07) and 2018-19 (96.43).Things are expected to have turned worse on this count, as non-food inflation has surged ahead of food inflation in the recent past. The increase has been particularly steep in prices of key agricultural inputs such as diesel. For inputs such as fertilisers, even though official indices do not show a sharp rise in prices, supply shortages in various parts of the country have resulted in black marketing. That Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) are not remunerative enough this time, has also been flagged by the BKS. “The cost of all the inputs increased many fold but MSP lagged behind”, the BKS statement adds.MSP, in its present form is not a solution to farmers’ problemsUsing C2 cost of cultivation – this includes the imputed rent of owned land and therefore the long-term cost of farming – as a benchmark for MSPs and providing guaranteed MSPs to every farmer are two key demands of the ongoing farmers’ agitation. While the first is a question of increasing the fiscal burden of procurement operations, the latter involves a larger question.Produce procured through MSPs must also be disposed of eventually. Currently, rice and wheat are the main crops procured at MSP. They are also the main items distributed through the Public Distribution System (PDS). Procured stock, which is not distributed under the PDS is accumulated. India’s food stocks -- 109.4 million tons of rice and wheat in June -- are at an all-time high, way above prescribed buffer norms of 41.1 million tons as on July 1 every year, according to the FCI’s operational and strategic asset requirements. This glut exists despite the PDS offtake being higher than normal at the moment, with the government providing an extra 5 kg of cereals per month to 800 million people under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna. This scheme will eventually be withdrawn, adding to the problem of excess stocks. Unless there is a new way to dispose procured food grains, the excess supply and overflowing stocks will continue to persist.Income support schemes such as PM-KISAN offer very little supportPolicies such as MSP based procurement are described as price support measures in agricultural policy discussions. They are not the only game in town as far as agricultural subsidies are concerned. A lot of commentators in India have been arguing that India should shift to what are described as income support measures, which, it is argued will have two advantages. Income support, unlike price support measure is compliant with the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Also, benefits from MSP procurements are skewed towards larger farmers and that too, in a handful of states. India made a shift towards providing income support to agriculture, when the present government announced the PM-KISAN scheme before the 2019 general elections. The scheme offers ₹6000 per year to every farmer in its current form. While something is better than nothing, the PM-KISAN support is too small to have any significant impact on the well-being of farmers. An HT analysis published on February 6, 2019, found that the PM-KISAN money was just 6% of a small farmer’s annual income. This number is likely to have come down further given the fact that PM-KISAN transfers have not increased. Increasing transfers to a meaningful level will entail a significantly higher fiscal burden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-are-angry-for-valid-reasons-but-there-are-no-easy-solutions-101631636556437.html
15-09-2021||India||Badaun twin tragedy: Sanitation, dignity in tussle with poverty, customs||Badaun She wakes up at around 4.30am, before any other member of the household. She picks up a mug, adjusts the knots of her sari around her waist, and makes her way to the fields behind her house. Once she’s back, she starts her day – cooking for the six people in her family, sweeping the mud floors of her small house, cleaning the front courtyard, and laying out the charpoys for the men to sit. Her morning ritual has remained unchanged through the decades, through a punishing pandemic, numerous village chiefs, elections and floods that force villagers to flee every few years in Uttar Pradesh’s Badaun district. She does not like going to the fields, but sums up her predicament in one word: “majboori” (helplessness). Only one event in the past decade has given her pause: the tragic deaths of her 14-year-old daughter and 16-year-old cousin, who were found hanging from a mango tree in the local orchard seven years ago. The two girls went out to the fields the previous night, never to be seen again. She was the last person to hear the girls, saying they had a stomach ache. Even at the time, she hadn’t given it a second thought. It was simply a way of life. The family alleges that the girls were raped and murdered, but the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) terms the incident as one of death by suicide. The incident -- famous in the headlines as the Badaun horror which brought law and order in rural Uttar Pradesh into sharp focus at the time -- is still being debated in the Allahabad high court.Now almost 50, the woman says she feels uneasy going out after sundown. “Our girls were taken in these fields, so I feel scared sometimes to go alone,” she said. But the hesitation is short-lived. Even fear has no option but to bow before the lack of a viable alternative, and the thought of a crushing load of housework. “Sometimes I take one of the boys along to stand guard outside. But life has to go on, what to do.” The deaths of the teenage girls in May 2014 was immortalised by the family standing vigil, refusing to bring the girls down from the tree until senior officials committed to an impartial probe – visuals that were beamed live into millions of homes and emblemised a toxic concoction of problems: Lack of rural sanitation for women, the pressure on maintaining family honour, the erosion of trust between the victims’ families and the administration, and the decisive influence of local politics in the countryside on every aspect of life – including crime solving. “We were seen and weak, and weak people couldn’t fight the system and the dabangs (dominant groups) it sheltered,” said the victim’s father. Seven years on, many of those thorns continue to prick the village, especially its women. Lay of the landThe village is on the edge of Badaun district, an hour’s drive on a cratered road from the district headquarters. Fields of bajra ring the village of around 800 households that stands at a junction: the Ganga on one side, and borders of Shahjahanpur and Farrukhabad on the other. Around 300 of those households belong to the Shakya community – classified under other backward classes – and the rest are Thakurs, Brahmins, Dalits, and Yadavs. The victims were also Shakyas. A single motorable road runs through the village, past its orchards, samosa stalls and the one store that sells refrigerated drinks.Many young men and women drop out after Class 8, because the government school only teaches up to that level and the three private schools charge much higher fees. The nearest college is roughly 12km away, in the hamlet of Ushait, and medical emergencies force people to rent a four-wheeler to the Badaun district hospital.Families are either trapped in a low-return cycle of agriculture, dependent on the monsoon and government doles, or send out their men to Badaun, Ghaziabad and Noida for manual labour. The women stay at home, until they’re married off – often with hefty dowry. The mother remembers how her daughter played around on the courtyard, the dreams she had, and often rues the mistake she made in not following her out to the field that night. “Sometimes I’m making roti in the afternoon and their laughter floods my mind, and I can’t move anymore.” The men have made stricter rules for the women after the incident. Earlier, when the two victims were alive – they shared a phone between them, and also had access to their father’s. But since investigators revealed to the father that around 400 calls were made between the girls and the main accused, Pappu Yadav, women of the household have been banned from carrying mobile phones. They’re allowed to go out in the village, but any further journey often warrants a male chaperon, and all visits to the local fair have stopped. “Their security is more important. We cannot let anything happen to them,” said the victim’s uncle. Shortly after the Badaun case gained national prominence, around 120 toilets were built in the village – three of them for the three Shakya brothers -- the parents of the two teenage victims and their younger brother. Yet, problems persisted. The Indian-style toilet has no water connection, like many others in the village, so water had to be carried to it either with a pipe or bucket. There is slush and open drains outside the house – the streets haven’t been paved despite the beeline of top politicians to the house since 2014 – ensured knee-high waterlogging and rendered the toilet unusable until it was rebuilt on a higher platform. Worse, a household of 16 – 10 from one brother and six from the other – only have a couple of toilets at their disposal. This forces the victim’s father and uncle to go to the fields. “We use the toilet when we can, but when there are so many people, how long can you wait?” asked the father. Probe and discontentAround 9.30pm on May 27, the girls went missing, only to be found around 5am, hanging from the tree. The family suspected the Yadav family, especially their youngest son, Pappu, of having raped and murdered their girls. They accused the local police of trying to shield them – two of the constables shared the same caste as the suspects and did nothing in the crucial hours after the disappearance – and the standoff only resolved once senior officials arrived on the spot. A postmortem report done two days later concluded that they were raped and strangled, igniting nationwide protests against the then Samajwadi Party government, which counted the Yadavs as its biggest vote base. The CBI took over the case in June 2014, and in November that year concluded that the postmortem exam was conducted in violation of standard medical protocols, and that the girls had died by suicide. Investigators said the older girl was in a relationship with Pappu, and was afraid after she’d been spotted by a relative. The family rejected the report, and in December, so did a local court in Badaun. The judge summoned Pappu, the accused went to the Allahabad high court, and so did the victim’s family. And hence, seven years after one of India’s most notorious crimes roiled the country, the case is nowhere near closure. “They got away because they were Yadavs, they ran the government at the time, and the police listened to them. We got exhausted screaming the truth and still, we weren’t heard,” said the victim’s father. He believes that no local officer could give them justice because village power structures would translate to familial connection to the Yadavs – who are far more dominant socially despite also being OBCs. He blamed CBI of falling in the same trap as the state police. CBI, for its part, blamed the family of inconsistent and contradictory statements, and the local police and medical teams of poor investigation. The Yadav family refused to speak to the press. Three brothers of the family -- Avdesh, Urvesh and the youngest, Pappu -- along with their father, Veerpal, were among the accused. They told the investigators that Pappu’s two elder brothers were nowhere near the girls that night, and that the 400-odd calls between the girls and the main accused indicated a relationship. Sanitation and social attitudesExperts say whichever theory may be correct, the sensational twists and turns served as an indictment of the social structures that led to the crime and the criminal justice system that failed to prosecute it swiftly. “The issues it brought up: of women’s sanitation, the burden on women of carrying the family honour, the lack of transparent policing remain unresolved. Women are still vulnerable socially and economically, and the pressure of running families as unemployment rises is taking a toll,” said Padma Singh of the Stree Mukti Sangathan,a non-governmental organisation that filed the first public interest litigation in the case. The case was also the first big test of the bolstered rape laws that were modified after the 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder – and the lack of closure hints that changing social mindset is just as important as legal statutes. Social attitudes is also an important factor, or hurdle, in eradicating open defecation, citing health concerns and family pride. Since 2014, the government has pushed to improve rural sanitation and built thousands of toilets in Badaun district. District magistrate Deepa Ranjan said all eligible people were provided toilets and monitoring is done using village committees of elders. Yet, coverage remains patchy. “This is also a problem of mindset, on the part of the bureaucrats and society. Questions of gender equality and rights of women are not given any importance. Until that happens, this problem of sanitation will niggle,” said Bezwada Wilson, founder of the Safai Karmachari Andolan, a body working for sanitation workers and against manual scavenging. Changes, but not for better The grisly deaths catapulted the humble village to international notoriety and struck fear in the hearts of local residents, who were afraid to relieve themselves in the fields. Yet, time and necessity forces them to go back, even if reluctantly. All five people in village resident Saraswati Devi’s family are forced to go out, but they have no field of their own. “So when we go to other people’s field, they abuse us. I feel bad but what choice do I have,” she said. The Shakya families say they’re less scared of the Yadavs, partially because they are no longer in power (the SP lost the 2017 assembly elections), and therefore have less political heft to throw around. “Earlier, they could even steal cattle from our cowshed or abuse in the open, and police wouldn’t take our reports. Now, at least they hear us,” said Sarvesh Kumar, a local resident. But one definite fallout has been a constriction in the liberty of women –- a reality Sapna Boudh confronts every day. An activist, Boudh shares a boundary with the victim’s family and is their immediate neighbour. Over the past few years, she’s tried to help local women in distress but run into a wall on every occasion. “People are just not ready to let women out. If a woman has some urgent work, she needs to wait for a male member to accompany her. And all this is due to the case,” she said.Boudh says the problem of sanitation is more acute among the poorer, lower-caste part of the village, where houses give way to huts and women have nothing other than a buffalo to subsist on. Sometimes, daily earnings can be as low as ₹50.“People abuse me when I ask them to let girls be free, strong. They are scared but also want to control our lives. The case may not have been solved but it has snatched away our freedom.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/badaun-tragedy-poverty-imbalance-sanitation-the-horrors-remain-101631632536737.html
15-09-2021||India||UNSC resolution 2593 should shape world’s response to Afghanistan, says India||India on Tuesday said the world community’s approach to Afghanistan should be in line with UN Security Council resolution 2593, which demands Afghan soil shouldn’t be used in any way for terrorism and seeks an inclusive and negotiated settlement to the crisis in the war-torn country.Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said the resolution, adopted during India’s presidency of the Security Council last month, specifically refers to terror groups designated by the UN such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and the need for the safe departure of all those who want to leave Afghanistan.The resolution 2593 was adopted at the last of three UN Security Council meetings held under the Indian presidency to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. Though China and Russia abstained, the resolution gained widespread support from the other 13 members of the UN’s highest decision-making body.Addressing a virtual symposium of principals and teachers of leading schools of the country on the unfolding situation in Afghanistan, Shringla said: “UNSCR 2593 unequivocally demands that Afghan territory not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist acts, and specifically refers to terrorist individuals proscribed by the UN Security Council, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad.”Besides, he added, the resolution “sets expectations on safe passage and secure departure of Afghans and all foreign nationals from Afghanistan”, and recognises the “need to uphold human rights, including of women and minorities, and to encourage all parties for an inclusive, negotiated political settlement”.There is also “re-affirmation for responding to the desire of Afghans to sustain and build on Afghanistan’s gains over the last 20 years”, he said.Highlighting the need for the world community’s response to be in line with the resolution, Shringla said: “Our collective approach has been articulated by UNSCR 2593. It is only by remaining true to the principles professed therein that we can make a meaningful contribution to Afghanistan at this time.”India, he said, expects the international community to “remain both responsive and united at a time of crisis”.Shringla further said India’s long-standing investment in the people of Afghanistan had earned the country “tremendous goodwill and cemented the civilisational bond” between the two sides. “Our friendship with the Afghan people will continue to guide our approach in the future,” he said.The Indian side has adopted a wait-and-watch policy regarding the situation in Afghanistan and the government has given no indication so far regarding any form of recognition for the interim setup created by the Taliban following the group’s takeover of the country on August 15. The Indian side also remains deeply suspicious of the Taliban’s long-standing links with terror groups such as al-Qaeda, LeT and JeM.Shringla said India’s destiny is “inextricably linked with its neighbours”, and the neighbourhood remains the country’s “primary diplomatic arena” as reflected by the “Neighbourhood First” policy. India has been “naturally concerned” about developments in Afghanistan and their external repercussions, he added.Following the Taliban takeover, India’s immediate focus was the evacuation of its nationals. “Most Indian nationals were able to leave Kabul in August. A number of Afghans, including minorities, who were desirous of travelling to India, also managed to do so,” Shringla said.“But these processes could not be completed due to the security situation at the [Kabul] airport. Resumption of flights from Kabul airport is, therefore, a priority. We are closely monitoring the unfolding situation,” he said.Shringla also referred to India’s development partnership with Afghanistan, which included more than 500 projects spread across the country’s 34 provinces, capacity-building and training. India has built schools, colleges and universities across Afghanistan and more than 65,000 Afghans have studied in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unsc-resolution-2593-should-shape-world-s-response-to-afghanistan-says-india-101631630677971.html
15-09-2021||India||BJP objects to Mamata’s nomination from Bhabanipur; cites cases in Assam||Kolkata: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday registered a complaint with the Election Commission, alleging that West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had not disclosed the pending criminal cases against her in her nomination papers for the upcoming Bhabanipur bypoll.In his complaint with the constituency’s returning officer, Sajal Ghosh, chief election agent of party candidate Priyanka Tibrewal, said the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief had not mentioned at least five criminal proceedings pending against her in Assam. “I beg to object to the nomination/declaration filed by Mamata Banerjee… on the ground that the candidate has failed to disclose particulars of the pending criminal proceedings against her,” Ghosh said in his letter. The letter said that the five cases against the Bengal chief minister were pending at Geeta Nagar, Pan Bazaar, Jagiroad, North Lakhimpur and Udharbond police stations of Assam. Officials from the poll body refused to comment on the matter, saying the complaint was yet to reach them.Hitting out at the BJP, a TMC leader on condition of anonymity said: “The BJP doesn’t have any shame. They had raised the same allegations earlier too. The EC didn’t find anything. The BJP knows that it is going to lose and hence, raising some baseless allegations to malign Banerjee. Only those cases are mentioned in the affidavit in which the person has been charge-sheeted.” The TMC leader was referring to a similar complaint with the poll panel filed by Banerjee’s former protege and now BJP leader, Suvendu Adhikari, during the April assembly elections. In a letter to the returning officer of Nandigram, the TMC turncoat alleged that the chief minister did not declare the cases by Assam Police and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in her nomination papers. A senior CBI official, however, had said that the accused in the case was a different woman and not the TMC chief. The poll panel had allowed Banerjee to contest the elections. The by-election for the Bhabanipur assembly seat is scheduled to be held on September 30. Banerjee, a resident of Bhabanipur, had won the seat twice in 2011 and 2016 but shifted to Nandigram, where the anti-farmland acquisition movement against the Left Front government had transformed her into a major political force in the volatile state, to dare Adhikari, on his home turf. Though the TMC chief powered the party to a resounding win for a third consecutive term in office, she lost the Nandigram seat to the BJP leader with a narrow margin. Banerjee has to win the bypoll to become a member of the assembly in order to continue in the chair. She had taken oath on May 5 and must get elected within six months as per protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-objects-to-mamata-s-nomination-from-bhabanipur-cites-cases-in-assam-101631616695659.html
15-09-2021||India||Another TN student dies by suicide allegedly fearing failure in NEET||A day after a 19-year-old man killed himself before the scheduled National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), an 18-year-old woman aspirant died by suicide over fears of not clearing the national entrance exam, police said.The incident took place on Monday, when the Tamil Nadu government passed a bill exempting the state from the exam.According to the police, the student was found dead in her home in Ariyalur district on Monday evening. Her parents claimed that she was upset as the exam appeared to be difficult.“Her family said she found the exam paper tough though she was a bright student. We are investigating the cause of her death,” a police official in Ariyalur said on condition of anonymity.Daughter of an advocate, the woman studied in a private school in Namakkal district and had secured 562 out of 600 marks in her Class 12 board examinations. A case of unnatural death under section 174 of the Indian Penal Code was registered, police said.The NEET 2021 for admission in undergraduate medical courses was conducted across 202 cities on Sunday, after the Supreme Court recently rejected a plea by a group of students to postpone the exam. The top court said that it did not want to interfere with the process and it will be “very unfair” to reschedule the test.In a statement condoling the 18-year-old’s death, chief minister MK Stalin said,.“I assure you there will be no compromise in our legal struggle to scrap NEET. We have to stop our dear students from taking their own lives and I’m saying this not just as a chief minister but also as their brother.”On Monday, all political parties, except the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), supported the bill, Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Act 2021, through voice vote to scrap the exam and admit students to undergraduate programmes in medicine on the basis of their performance in their Class 12 examinations — a move the state government said was in the interest of “social justice”.The bill, which does not have any bearing on this year’s admissions, will need the approval of the President, who denied the same to a similar law passed by the state’s previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government in 2017.In Tamil Nadu, the argument against NEET has been that it disadvantages students from rural and poor backgrounds (who cannot afford coaching), and those studying in boards other than the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).At least a dozen aspirants have died by suicide ever since the exam was introduced in the state in 2017.Accusing the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) of “playing politics” over the issue, former chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami on Tuesday said the state government must “stop watching students die by suicide out of fear”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-tn-student-dies-by-suicide-allegedly-fearing-failure-in-neet-101631609674949.html

Farmers have been protesting at Singhu Border and Tikri Border of Delhi-Haryana, Ghazipur border of Delhi-Uttar Pradesh, and have camped there since November 25 last year, seeking repealing of the three new farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrcissues-notice-to-centre-4-states-over-farmers-protest-101631609074900.html

15-09-2021||Today's||26/11: What Mumbai Diaries gets right, and what it gets wrong||(Note: This article may have some spoilers)When the new web series, Mumbai Diaries 26/11 dropped last week, it wasn’t the first attempt to portray the horrific events surrounding the 2008 attacks on India’s financial capital, when 10 Lashkar terrorists came in from the sea and unleashed an attack that left 172 dead and changed India’s security outlook and apparatus forever. There have been several documentaries and films on the attack that saw hostage situations last for over 60 hours at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Trident Oberoi Hotel in Mumbai. In fact, the then Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh got into serious trouble for taking along film director Ram Gopal Verma on his first tour of the devastated hotels, soon after it was cleared of terrorists, doing a macabre reconnaissance of the attack sites even before the blood of the terrorists’ victims had been swept clean. The new eight-part series streaming on Amazon, released just before the world marked 20 years since 9/11, however reminds us that we are still some distance away from accurately recreating real events for screen. While the filmmakers have given the usual disclaimers of the series “being inspired”, instead of being faithful recreation, it is important to remind ourselves where Mumbai Diaries stays true to real events and where it departs.The portrayal of Mumbai PoliceThere are many images that are etched in our collective memory of the night of November 26, 2008, when news about the attack first emerged with the shootout at Cafe Leopold and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Also Watch | Elite NSG commandos hold mock drills to deal with hostage-like situationsOne such heartbreaking image is of the then anti-terror squad chief Hemant Karkare putting on his bullet-proof jacket, very shortly before he was gunned down by the terrorists. Those moments, where everyone from the beat constable to the top bosses of India’s security establishment were left stunned and scrambling to figure out a way to stop the terrorists as they went across Mumbai on a shooting spree, have been aptly covered. My favourite image, which the show captured with a light touch, was one of National Security Guard (NSG) commandos arriving at the siege spot in a BEST bus. When we see the Mumbai police force struggling with their 303 rifles as compared to the machine guns used by terrorists, it is a reminder not just of the immense bravery that our frontline security personnel personify but also the trying circumstances they work under. What is, however, a pure work of fiction, and only for dramatic effect, is the depiction of the slain officer’s wife going to the hospital to slap the doctor who treated the terrorist. In her book, one of the slain officers Ashok Kamte’s wife, Vinita, writes about Karkare’s pleas for reinforcement that went unheeded and how it took too long to take the bleeding officers to hospital. The handler Throughout the eight episodes, we see a middle-aged family man tracking the Mumbai siege on several devices and interacting with the attackers in real time, giving them updates on where the police entourage was approaching, when the NSG commandos reached Mumbai after finally being cleared by the crisis management group in Delhi. When Indian investigators intercepted the conversations of the terrorists during the siege, they heard them speaking in Hindi to the terrorists. According to the charge sheet filed in the case, the handlers were operating from a base in Karachi where they were recruited by Lashkar’s Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi. The TV show accurately shows how the handler motivates the terrorists with promise of eternal salvation and other rewards of this assignment.The role of the mediaSpeaking of the role of the handler, the main conduit in the terrorists’ operations was the media, even if it was inadvertently so. In the TV series, this is portrayed in the character of the TV reporter Mansi Hirani, played by Shreya Dhanwanthary, who also played journalist Sucheta Dalal in a series on the Harshad Mehta scam. Just as Hirani is unscrupulous in her means to get breaking news about the terror attacks, the coverage was not one of Indian TV media’s shining moments. Also Read | US seeks to extradite 26/11 accused to IndiaMany channels stayed live on the NSG landing on Nariman House, which the charge sheet documents as having helped warn the terrorists of the incoming raid. There are many other instances of the coverage directly helping the terrorists, which is now known from the exchange between the handlers and the attackers’ intercepts and saved for posterity in court and police documents. For instance, the attackers found out, through the media, where some hotel guests were hiding, information which proved to be fatal for some. Since then, many newsrooms have put in SOPs to never carry live footage of such operations and security agencies are also sensitised to tackle such possibilities but that wisdom came at too high a price.The role of the hotel staffFor weeks and months after the attacks, newspapers and TV channels were full of tales of heroism displayed by ordinary citizens such as Taj’s general manager Karambir Kang. Kang lost his wife and both his children who were at the residential suite of the hotel, but those who survived narrated tales of how the hotel staff made sandwiches, or just took care of simple needs so that they could distract them from the horror that had struck the hotel. That aspect has been heroically covered by the series in the character Ananya Ghosh played by Tina Desai. An account in the Harvard Business Review recounted how the hotel staff never abandoned the telephone operators’ posts, warned hotel guests to lock their doors and evacuated and shepherded guests to safety, instead of just saving themselves. The show is a homage to the numerous hotel staffers in both hotels who went out of their way to stay calm and save lives, something they would never have been trained to do.The exaggerated depiction During the terror strike, multiple locations, including Cama Hospital in Mumbai, were hit. However, the series takes the reality of what happened and turns it into an over-the-top drama. The storyline has nurses and attendants also being killed, when, in reality, it was two guards and policemen posted outside who were gunned down by the two terrorists Abu Ismail and Ajmal Kasab, the latter being the only terrorist who was held alive by the authorities. Perhaps, this had something to do with the fact that the series was made during the pandemic and the filmmakers felt the need to pay tribute to health workers. However, this aspect of the show is the only one that feels exaggerated and over-the-top filmy. It is true that the hospital, which is mainly a maternity one, shut its ward doors so that the two terrorists who came in could only inflict limited damage. If anything, Cama Hospital’s story is one about the staff who were able to evade a major tragedy by showing presence of mind — they shut off their lights, shut all their doors and gates and asked everyone to just keep it down.The truth is that a story such as 26/11 didn’t really need any dramatic embellishments. Even today, a plain retelling of what happened during those 60 hours is sufficient to capture the horror that all of India experienced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/2611-what-mumbai-diaries-gets-right-and-what-it-gets-wrong-101631683075541.html

15-09-2021||Editorials||India’s farmers need a ‘new deal’||The average farmer in India earns ₹27 per day from cultivation, according to statistics from the latest Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) which covers the period from July 2018 to June 2019. An analysis of these numbers, in this newspaper, found that unskilled manual work on Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) work sites would pay more than farming. This is exactly why wage labour has replaced cultivation incomes as the biggest source of earnings even for agricultural households. If farming does not generate adequate incomes, India’s farmers cannot be blamed for not making investments in augmenting production and sustainability techniques. India is still a laggard vis-à-vis other important producers in yields for most crops. The climate crisis will pose a growing danger to the sustainability of farming practices.
15-09-2021||Editorials||A lifeline for the telecom sector||One way of looking at the Union Cabinet’s decisions on the telecommunications sector announced on Wednesday is to say that these should have been taken long ago. The more pertinent way of looking at them would be that they have come just in time to offer relief to a beleaguered sector. The redefinition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), prospectively, not retrospectively, the enhancement of the life of spectrum by 10 years, the removal of a financial constraint to spectrum sharing, and, more importantly, a four-year moratorium on all spectrum and AGR dues come as a lifeline to the sector. It should ensure that the sector does not become a duopoly and encourage companies to invest in customer service and new technology. Sure, companies have to pay an interest on the dues during the moratorium, but they have the option of doing this through equity (an option some of them will actively consider). And the government has retained the option of converting remaining dues at the end of the moratorium period too, to equity. Vodafone Idea is the biggest beneficiary of the new announcements; it owes the government around ₹50,000 crore . Bharti Airtel owes the government around ₹26,000 crore.
