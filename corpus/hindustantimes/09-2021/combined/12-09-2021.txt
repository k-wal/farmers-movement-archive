Nikhil Mathur, the general secretary of Kanishka Residency residents’ welfare association (RWA) said that the problem has become more acute over the past two months. “The main problem is that the sewer line in Kanishka Residency was laid approximately 25 years ago, with only a six-inch diameter for the entire colony. This line carries the sewage of over 400 flats, which have over 2,000 residents. Temporary relief measures have been taken but as of today (Sunday), all manholes are overflowing with water flowing on to roads,” said Mathur. “Residents are getting sewer mixed water in drinking water pipelines and there are several families falling sick because of this contaminated water that gets distributed in the drinking water pipeline,” he said. PDT Acharya, a former secretary general of the Lok Sabha, who is a resident of the society, said, “Time and again, we have been complaining to the authorities for a solution, but nothing has been done. For the past three weeks, I am suffering from stomach problems because I used the tap water, by mistake, for rinsing my mouth. This problem has a simple solution of changing the sewer line and there are high-level technologies available to do it easily, but no action has been taken.” Residents said that last month, a delegation met Kishanpal Gurjar, the union minister of state for power and heavy industries in this regard, following which action was taken by a superintending engineer of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF), but the problems started recurring last week. Yashpal Yadav, the commissioner of MCF, said, “Due to rain over the past few days, the situation must have aggravated. The officials are already looking into the matter and we will find a permanent solution to the problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-ashoka-enclave-3-residents-allege-contaminated-water-supply-in-taps-raise-health-concerns-and-seek-fix-101631471367535.html
12-09-2021||Gurugram||RWA applications for resident advisory council called by GMDA||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) last week issued a public notice inviting residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) across the city to submit their applications for nomination to the resident advisory council (RAC).At least three RWA presidents will be shortlisted for the RAC, comprising one each from Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) sectors, areas developed by real estate developers and areas under the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG).Officials said that the GMDA’s chief executive officer (CEO) will draw lots from the list of eligible nominees.“RWAs are well versed with the developments and issues of the city on-ground. One of the main roles of the advisory committee, thus, will be to come up with innovations that can help improve or address Gurugram’s issues, keeping the public in mind. Such suggestions by the RAC can be put forward before the official concerned and can be taken into account by the GMDA for implementation,” Sunil Kumar Chahal, joint CEO of the administration division, GMDA, who is overlooking the matter, said.Chahal said that a RAC needs to have a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 15 members, and that the council will convene quarterly to discuss matters pertaining to the city. The public notice for the same was issued last Thursday.It is the second time a RAC is being formed in the city, after the two-year tenure of the previous council members ended this year. The council will also include officials from GMDA, MCG, district administration, HSVP, gram panchayat, and representatives from industries, labour, industry, civil society, and real estate associations.According to Section 13 of the GMDA Act, 2017, it is mandatory to form a RAC, which will be responsible for overseeing and monitoring the implementation of GMDA’s annual plan for infrastructure, environment, and mobility. For instance, the GMDA’s draft comprehensive mobility plan (CMP) for the city was sent to RAC for approval before it was published.However, the council formed in 2019 could not have much impact as the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in March 2020 and all major projects were temporarily suspended.For being eligible to apply for the post of a council member, the RWA should be registered under the Haryana Registration and Regulation of Societies Act, 2012, should have a website displaying the rules and by-laws of the society, list all members along with each of their addresses, and show audited annual accounts of the society for the 2019-20 financial year. The RWA should also have at least 50 members, who are residents of the society, and office-bearers must not have a criminal record. The last date for submitting applications is September 15 and RWAs can submit applications by hand, email or post. The application should list the name of the association, name of the presidents, name of the sector/society, number of RWA members, RWA website, and the society’s registration number under the Haryana Registration and Regulation of Societies Act, 2012.The applicant will also have to list the category (HSVP sector, MCG area or developer area) under which the society is located.Dhruv Bansal, official spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council (GCC), an umbrella body of RWAs in the city, said, “The importance of committees such as RAC is that it takes into account the views of residents as represented by RWA presidents. GMDA, MCG, HSVP, and district administration officials tend to look at the larger scope of projects. It is also important to have views about residents at a micro level, as it can address their challenges and queries.”“Such committees are important for the city. The GMDA however, needs to create awareness regarding the application process as few RWAs are aware of it,” said Pawan Tharwani, the president of Carlton Estate Condominium Association (CECA), and a member of RWAs United, an umbrella body of 70 RWAs in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rwa-applications-for-resident-advisory-council-called-by-gmda-101631471365401.html
12-09-2021||Gurugram||Work on cloverleaf connecting Dwarka Expressway, Southern Peripheral Road to start||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will commence work on a portion of the cloverleaf interchange on the Dwarka Expressway near Kherki Daula, to connect it with the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) on the other side of the National Highway 48 (NH-48), from next week after receiving a land parcel last week, officials said on Sunday. NHAI officials said that the work on the cloverleaf is expected to be completed by August 2022. Nirman Jambulkar, project director, NHAI, said that work on building structures of a road across the NH-48 will start next week. “The work on structures to take the road across the national highway will commence next week. The work on the entire cloverleaf will be completed by August 2022. This structure will enable traffic movement between SPR and Dwarka Expressway without any interruption from the existing traffic on the highway,” Jambulkar said. According to NHAI officials, the cloverleaf will have interchanges at two levels, in which left turns will be handled by slip roads. A cloverleaf helps traffic on two highways cross one another simultaneously, without any interruption from any side. The cloverleaf on Dwarka Expressway will connect SPR, which starts at Ghata and passes through Vatika Chowk to reach the NH-48 near Kherki Daula. It will be connected with the Central Peripheral Road, which is a part of the Dwarka Expressway. The 29-km long Dwarka Expressway will connect Kherki Daula with Dwarka in Delhi. It passes through several newly developing sectors in the city. It is being constructed in four phases with work on phases three and four, which are in Gurugram, at an advanced stage. The project is expected to be completed by December 2022. Meanwhile, Jambulkar, who also has the charge of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, said that the work on a crucial underpass at the Ambience Mall is almost complete and they are planning to open it by the end of this month. “The record rainfall received by Delhi this year has caused problems, as it is taking more time to put the finishing touches,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/work-on-cloverleaf-connecting-dwarka-expressway-southern-peripheral-road-to-start-101631471364385.html
12-09-2021||Gurugram||Not Aravallis any more? Gair mumkin pahar in Faridabad left out of conservation zone in DTCP report||Only areas categorised as gair mumkin pahar (uncultivable wasteland) in revenue records of Gurugram district have been marked as Aravalli forests in Haryana, according to a ground-truthing exercise of natural conservation zones conducted by the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP), which renders null the protection for such land in Faridabad.A document was prepared by the DTCP on ground-truthing of natural conservation zones (NCZs) in Haryana subregion of the National Capital Region (NCR), according to the orders issued by the principal secretary of town and country planning of Haryana in a meeting held in August. All Aravalli land must be strictly notified as per the Aravalli notification of 1992 issued by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC), stated the minutes of the meeting of a state-level committee, held under the chairmanship of principal secretary, town and country planning.An excerpt from the minutes of the meeting, accessed by HT, states, “Definition of Aravalli may not be extended to other Haryana subregion areas which are not defined in the Aravalli notification dated 07.05.1992 unless the same is done by MoEF&CC through a similar notification. So only specified areas in old district Gurgaon existing on 07.05.1992 may be part of ‘confirmed NCZ’ by virtue of being ‘Aravalli’ and such areas of other districts may be excluded from the NCZ category that is from confirmed and yet to be decided.”The ground-truthing document states that all district level subcommittees (DLSCs) were asked to finalise areas of “confirmed NCZ” with specific reference to Faridabad, Mewat and Rewari districts. But identification of Aravalli was highlighted as a major issue by the DLSCs, as it was noted from revenue records that “there is no term namely Aravalli, rather there is only mention of gair mumkin pahar.” As per the minutes of the meeting, it was also directed that the union environment ministry can add other districts under the Aravalli notification, but “it cannot be considered otherwise as Aravalli by National Capital Region Planning Board or the constituent states.”Confirming the move, an official of the forest department, who took part in the meeting of the state-level committee said, “This primarily means that gair mumkin pahar in Faridabad district, considered as Aravallis at present, will lose the tag now. We are not sure whether this land will be diverted for real estate, but it would not be considered as Aravalli.” Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, who had also attended the meeting said that as per the 1992 Aravalli notification of MoEF&CC, gair mumkin pahar in Gurugram district will be considered as Aravallis.“The 1992 notification of MoEF&CC mentions that gair mumkin pahar of old Gurugram district and Alwar in Rajasthan are to be considered as Aravallis, so that will be done. If any other area from neighbouring districts was part of Gurugram district (in 1992), then that will also be covered,” said Garg. The official said that neighbouring district of Nuh (earlier Mewat) was part of Gurugram when the MoEF&CC notification was issued. Chetan Agarwal, an independent forest analyst said, “Aravallis are crucial to the ecological security of Faridabad for groundwater security, and it is also an important wildlife habitat that is adjacent to Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. The Supreme Court has given several orders to protect Faridabad Aravallis; it remains to be seen how their implementation will be affected. But this move will deeply impact the ecology of the region with the key part of only green belt of NCR being lost, leading to further deterioration of environment. Now, the 10% of the Mangar Bani sacred forest that falls in Gurgaon will remain in the Aravallis, but the 90% that is in Faridabad district in Mangar village will not be in the Aravallis anymore and will lose the protection of the natural conservation zone.”RP Balwan, a former forest conservator of Gurugram, said, “Aravali Afforestation project funded by European Union was implemented from 1990 to 1999 by government of Haryana in Aravali hills spread over then Faridabad, Gurgaon, Rewari, Mahendergarh, Bhiwani districts; with working plans and district gazetteers describing the Aravali hills extension. Geological Survey of India, Central Ground Water Board, GWC, Haryana Mining Department all mentioned Aravali extension in Haryana. Are all these records wrong?”In December 2016, the NCR Planning Board (NCRPB) in a meeting decided that “specified areas” (land categories of gair mumkin pahar or gair mumkin rada or gair mumkin behed or banjar beed or rundh) as given in the MoEF&CC’s notification dated 07.05.1992 are to be included while identifying /delineating Aravalli in NCR. In the meeting, it was also decided that as there is no specific definition available for Aravallis and that the “specified areas” as per the MoEF&CC notification “will be adopted for delineating Aravallis in the entire NCR.”Officials of the forest department and the Faridabad deputy commissioner also did not respond to requests for comment. KM Pandurang, the director of the DTCP, also did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/not-aravallis-any-more-gair-mumkin-pahar-in-faridabad-left-out-of-conservation-zone-in-dtcp-report-101631471363262.html

A CCTV camera on Vasai station showed the woman standing on the edge of platform six at around 11am.“When a Dahanu-Borivli local approached the station, she walked on the tracks and stood before the train. Seeing her, the motorman, S Vasant Rao, applied the emergency brakes. As the train slowed down, head constable Eknath Naik, who was patrolling on platform, rushed to the tracks and pulled the woman to safety,” said senior inspector Sachin Ingawale of Vasai GRP.Naik then took her to the GRP base. “When she was okay to talk, she told us that she stays alone in Nallasopara, while her only son lives with his uncle in Parel as it is closer to his workplace. Her husband had died in 2019 due to an illness. Thus, she was depressed and lonely and had decided to end her life,” said Ingawale.GRP officers admitted the woman to Maratha Life Foundation Old Age Home at Bhatane, Virar, and have called her son to Vasai for questioning, said Ingawale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/alert-motorman-vasai-cop-save-woman-s-life-near-mumbai-101631471247335.html

12-09-2021||Noida||Noida: Bangladeshi national held for woman’s murder||A 43-year-old illegal Bangladeshi immigrant was arrested by the Noida police on Sunday in connection with the murder of a 36-year-old woman in Sarfabad village last month.The suspect was identified as Babul Mia, a daily wage earner who had allegedly crossed over into India nearly 15 years ago, said police.Police on August 6 had recovered the decomposed body of the woman, Fatima, from her rented accommodation in Sarfabad. The victim, a native of West Bengal, had moved from Sorkha to Sarfabad recently, police said, adding that the autopsy of the body had confirmed strangulation.Based on a complaint of the landlord, a case of murder was registered at Sector 49 police station. The victim’s eldest son, who lives in Gurugram, had claimed the body while her two other children live with her ex-husband, police said.According to police officials, Babul had helped the woman get the accommodation in Sarfabad and had been absconding since her death.“The suspect was nabbed from near Sector 52. Following the murder, he first fled to West Bengal and later to Rajasthan before coming back here. It seems that he and the woman were in a relationship, but she was trying to end things,” said Vinod Kumar Singh, station house officer, Sector 49 police station.According to police, the two had an argument on August 5 following which Babul, in a fit of rage, strangled the woman with her dupatta before fleeing the spot.The officials said that Babul is an undocumented Bangladeshi national who has been in the country for over 15 years. He was living in Noida’s Barola, Gejha, and Sarfabad for the past several years, they said.Police recovered an Indian passport, two Aadhaar cards with the same number and one debit card from the suspect. Babul has a family in Bangladesh, another in West Bengal, police said, adding that he tried to escape to Bangladesh after the murder but could not due to Covid-19 regulations.

12-09-2021||Noida||Noida: Garbage van does not turn up daily, allege Sector 51 residents||Noida: Despite an ongoing door-to-door garbage collection mechanism in Noida, residents of Sector 51 have been marred with discrepancies in sanitation works and the garbage is not being collected daily.The resident welfare association (RWA) of Sector 51, with over 1,000 families, said that the issue has been persistent for the past two months and some residents have even been dumping garbage at the roadside and near park areas.Officials of the Noida authority, which collects and manages the urban waste, however, said it collects the waste daily. “It has been three to four days that the last garbage was collected from houses. The truck picks up garbage from only a few houses as it gets full. I receive complaints every day, especially from D and E blocks. Some families now even dump the garbage on the road. We have been talking to the authority officials for the past few weeks and urging them to allot a different garbage collection vehicle,” said Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary, RWA, Sector 51.“It was Friday (September 10) when the garbage was last picked up from my place. It was a proper door-to-door collection mechanism a few months ago, Now, sometimes they come, sometimes they don’t. We often have to chase the van... The garbage keeps piling up,” said Rajesh Kher, a resident of Sector 51.Another resident, Rohit Gupta, said, “There are no bins or dump yards in our sector. So, we cannot dump the garbage anywhere. The issue has been persistent for the past two months. Many residents have started to dump the garbage on the roadside or inside the nearby park. We request the authority to please help us, either regularise the door-to-door waste collection or put a dustbin in our sector for the purpose.”Officials, however, say the garbage collection is up to the mark and it could be a timing issue. “The overall collection of garbage is between 750 and 800 tonnes a day in the city. We had also spoken to the RWA concerned, and handed over a new roster. There could be some timing issue. There are times when the vehicles get stuck at the main dumping depot,” said Vijay Rawal, project engineer, Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-garbage-van-does-not-turn-up-daily-allege-sector-51-residents-101631470945342.html
12-09-2021||Noida||Noida resident bodies meet state BJP vice-president, demand better facilities||Noida: Office bearers of various resident bodies met Uttar Pradesh BJP vice-president AK Sharma on Sunday and raised concerns about development works, and demanded better public representation in the city.According to the officials of different umbrella organisations and forums, they are often “under represented, and there are lags in communication with the development authorities” in the absence of municipal bodies in the district. The RWAs also demanded better amenities and “protection from real estate frauds”.“We, as a resident association, have demanded proper representation in the city and empowerment. For now, there is a lag in communication between resident bodies and development authorities, and even for nominal work like getting a road fixed in our sector or for development of a park we need to pursue the Noida authority. Since there are no municipalities in the district or panchayats in the villages in Noida, there is lack of public representation in the city which is crucial for the developmental works,” said NP Singh, president, District Development Residents Welfare Association (DDRWA), an umbrella organisation of all the RWAs of Gautam Budh Nagar.Singh also said that while the district has nearly 16 lakh registered voters, and the total number of residents is much higher, with Noida being home to a large number of floating migrant population, there is a need to empower the residents directly.“In absence of gram pradhans in villages and councillors in development bodies in Noida, there is a need to empower the RWAs,” he added.Rajiva Singh, president, Noida federation of apartment owners associations (NOFAA), one of the largest federations representing high-rise housing complexes, said that while the administration or the authority calls the RWAs for meetings, the same is not being regularised.“A few years ago, there was a citizen forum where the chief of the district’s police staff, CEO of Noida authority, and the district magistrate used to hold talks with the RWAs or resident bodies every month. That doesn’t happen anymore. We shared all civic issues, including environmental issues, with Mr Sharma and had demented further audience where we can talk in detail.”On a three-day visit to western Uttar Pradesh, AK Sharma, who is a voter from the Dadri constituency of Gautam Budh Nagar, said that Noida is his second home.On Sunday, he assured help from the state and central governments to the people. “Issues faced by the people are my problems. That’s the main reason behind today’s meeting, with the residents and their representatives... Noida is an industrial township that has progressed in leaps and bounds, and people from NCR and also across the country prefer living in this city the most. Our party, and government is committed to resolve all the problems faced by the residents here,” said Sharma.Sharma also suggested the RWAs be ready to welcome foreigners with open arms and hospitality if they want Noida to be the biggest investor hub in Uttar Pradesh, and eventually in India. He also said that Noida is a smart “Plug-n-Play” city where the infrastructure has been developed in a way that entrepreneurs and residents feel comfortable there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-resident-bodies-meet-state-bjp-vice-president-demand-better-facilities-101631470944741.html
12-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad civic body asks commercial establishments to obtain trade licence by September||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation has asked about 40 trades -- from nursing homes to hotels and liquor shops -- to obtain a trade licence from the civic body by September 30, 2021. Officials said that the provision for obtaining licences was already there under the Uttar Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, but not fully implemented in the city under the corporation jurisdiction area. The move is aimed at preventing illegal commercial activities, the officials said, adding that the erring establishments will have to deposit delay charges and penalty and may face legal action in case they continue without licences. “The issue cropped up in a recent meeting with the members of auto-rickshaw unions. They complained that some people who have formed a nexus were charging parking fee from them when they operate from municipal roads. Then we decided to implement the licence system whose provisions and rates are already in place,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. “The provision of licence is also applicable for different categories of auto-rickshaws and once they obtain licence, they will not be required to pay parking fees to any unauthorised people,” Tanwar said. According to the officials, the annual rates for the licences vary for different categories of commercial activities. For general hotels, lodges and guest houses, the licence fee is ₹1,000, while for three-star and five-star hotels, the fee is ₹9,000 and ₹12,000, respectively. Similarly, the licence fee for different categories of nursing homes and private clinics ranges between ₹2,000 and ₹5,000, while it is ₹4,000 for dental clinics and ₹1,000 for pathology centres. The officials said that the licence fee of ₹6,000 to ₹12,000 is applicable for different categories of liquor shops, while ₹360 to ₹720 for auto-rickshaws. “Now, no commercial operation will be allowed without a licence. The licence fees are different from the regular tax structure and mean that such activities can be carried out under the corporation jurisdiction area,” Tanwar said. Sanjeev Kumar Sinha, corporation’s chief tax assessment officer is entrusted with responsibility of licensing officer. “The licences can be obtained from our five zonal offices. To ascertain exact number of operators, we have also sought information from different departments like transport, excise, and food and drug departments, among others. After September, we will conduct inspections and penalty will be levied on erring establishments,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-body-asks-commercial-establishments-to-obtain-trade-licence-by-september-101631470944097.html
12-09-2021||Other||Are frequent adjournments killing the spirit of consumer law?||Prakash Krishna Rao was 64 when he first approached the consumer court for resolution of his complaint. He is 70 now, and there is still no finality to his case.His original complaint took two years, instead of the promised three months at the district consumer disputes redressal commission in Mangaluru, Karnataka.. Eventually he won the case, but the joy was short-lived. The manufacturer went in appeal before the state consumer disputes redressal commission in Bengaluru, and here the case dragged on for four years. Thanks to constant adjournments, he says he had to travel from his home in Mangaluru to Bengaluru 20 times during this period. This is despite the fact that he is a senior citizen who is entitled to quicker settlement of his dispute.Repeated adjournments sought by lawyers and sanctioned by those adjudicating over the complaints, have in the last three decades destroyed the very concept of consumer courts envisaged by the law makers and defeated the very raison d’etre of these courts, created as an alternative to the long and complicated process of justice before the civil courts. Since several studies sponsored by the union ministry of consumer affairs and conducted by the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) had shown ‘repeated adjournments’ as one of the main causes of delay, the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 that replaced the 1986 law should have strictly prohibited adjournments or provided for it only in the rarest of rare cases and limited to just one , with a highly deterrent financial penalty (not just costs) to be borne by the party asking for it.But unfortunately, like the 1986 Act, the 2019 law too pussyfoots on the subject. So it merely says: “….no adjournment shall ordinarily be granted , unless sufficient cause is shown and the reasons for grant of adjournment have been recorded in writing by such commission”. Obviously, the line between what is ordinary and what is extraordinary has got totally blurred. And the word “no” has completely been ignored. So ‘adjournments shall ordinarily be granted’ has become the practice. In its latest analysis of the working of the consumer courts published last year, the IIPA blames adjournments as the biggest contributor to delays in the process of consumer justice. In as many as 71.8 per cent of the cases, adjournments, often given for frivolous reasons, unnecessarily prolonged the time taken for adjudication , says IIPA. While in 18.4 percent of the cases the adjournments were less than three, in 25.6 percent of the cases, they were more than seven!The advocates are not only responsible for frequent postponement of the hearings, but also for bringing with them, all the trappings of the civil courts. As per the IIPA evaluation, in 61.6 per cent of the cases, involvement of the advocates contributed to delays. Unnecessary technical procedures too led to slow-down in 26.5 per cent of cases, while lack of quorum or vacancies in the posts of adjudicating members contributed to disruptions in the process of justice in 34.9 per cent of the complaints. Poor product testing facilities also led to discontinuity in the proceedings in 34.3 per cent of the cases. It is no wonder that between 2016-2019, only 24.3 percent of complaints were disposed of within the mandated 90 days!The CP Act of 2019 requires several amendments to improve the performance of consumer courts. To start with, the government should bring in two urgent amendments. While one is to stop the biggest impediment to speedy justice, adjournments; the other is to ensure that all complaints where the value of goods or services is below ₹2 lakh, are heard without lawyers. There should be strictly no adjournments nor appeals in these cases and they must be decided within the mandated 90 days, so that to begin with, consumer justice becomes a reality at least in respect of complaints of low value.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/are-frequent-adjournments-killing-the-spirit-of-consumer-law-101631470882602.html
12-09-2021||Other||Cong to contest UP poll under Priyanka: Khursheed||Former union minister Salman Khursheed said here on Sunday that the Congress would contest the 2022 state assembly elections under the leadership of Priyanka Gandhi and would not go for alliance with any political party. The party manifesto would reflect issues faced by the common man in the state, he said. Khursheed and Congress national spokesperson Supriya Shrenate were here to interact with the public. They went to several localities to know about people’s problems so that a suitable election manifesto could be drafted. Talking to media persons, Khursheed said Priyanka Gandhi was the face of the party in Uttar Pradesh. “Neither has Priyanka Gandhi commented on who would be the chief ministerial candidate, nor are we authorized to say so. For us, the face of Priyanka Gandhi is enough. It is under her direction that we are travelling to all corners of Uttar Pradesh for drafting a public connect election manifesto,” said Khursheed, who made it clear that the party would not go for an alliance. When asked about young faces like Jitin Prasada going away from the Congress, he said that if one or two people left, this did not mean that young leaders were leaving the party. He denied that the Congress was weak at the organizational level in Uttar Pradesh. “If a party wins the election, then the organization appears big, otherwise small. We are going for election with ‘soul’ of the Congress and winning or losing is not a criterion. We want the citizens of UP to be happy and if that happens, we are successful,” said Khursheed. On being asked if Muslims and Dalits had gone away from the Congress, Khursheed said if that was the case, efforts were being made to bring them back into the Congress fold. Supriya Shrenate said they had travelled to Bahraich, Meerut, Kanpur, Ayodhya, Jhansi and Gorakhpur divisions, to interact with the locals and to know their problems. “Priyanka Gandhi ruled out preparing a manifesto while sitting with experts in Lucknow and asked us to travel and get feedback from the public so that a manifesto could be drafted to which the people would relate. Public complaints were similar in various parts of the state and included inflation, stray animals, unemployment, mismanagement of Covid, farmer and labour exploitation and women security etc,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cong-to-contest-up-poll-under-priyanka-khursheed-101631470343384.html

A panel was also constituted to look into the matter and decide if extension can be given to the previous council till the elections are held, but no official announcement was made by the varsity after that.PU’s dean student welfare (DSW) SK Tomar said he could not comment on the matter and that varsity authorities would have to decide. However, he said that the grievances of students were being resolved whenever they approached the varsity authorities.Varsity should start planning: student leadersAman of Punjab Students Union (PSU-Lalkaar) said, “Elections are held everywhere, so polls should be held for our student council as well. The varsity has started phased reopening, so students will also start demanding elections. Authorities should start planning to conduct them.”Madhav Sharma of Students Organisation of India (SOI) said, “Elections should be held because the thousands of students enrolled in PU need representation. Authorities cannot address the issues of individual students.”“Like the elections of the senate are being held, varsity should immediately start planning to conduct student elections as well. With phased reopening, every aspect of campus life should be restored,” said Sandeep, president of Students For Society (SFS).After PU senate polls, Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) has also initiated the process to conduct elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-no-clarity-on-this-year-s-student-elections-yet-101631469983260.html

The ED questioned the young Lok Sabha MP and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew for almost nine hours in Delhi on September 6. He was summoned for the second time on September 8 but Banerjee did not visit the ED office and informed the agency that he was unable to travel from Kolkata at such short notice. On September 6, Banerjee threw a challenge at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying using probe agencies against TMC leaders will not help the saffron camp gain any political ground in Bengal. “TMC will never bow before you (BJP). Do whatever you can. If the ED has any evidence against me, make it public. If anybody can prove that I have accepted even ten paisa from anyone I will voluntarily walk to the gallows and hang myself,” Banerjee had said before reaching the ED office. He reiterated himself while leaving Delhi. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) started the probe in the coal smuggling case and the ED initiated a parallel investigation. The CBI registered the case in November last year. It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of West Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines. Reacting to the third summons from ED, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said, “Abhishek Banerjee is being harassed because he is expanding the party beyond Bengal. Why is no action being taken against BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari who was caught on camera accepting money in the Narada sting operation that both CBI and the ED are probing?”The ED was recently permitted by a special court in Kolkata to summon two ministers, Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, TMC legislator Madan Mitra and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee in the Narada case. They were all arrested by the CBI on May 17 and released on bail after days of judicial custody. Before summoning Banerjee, the ED wanted to question his wife, Rujira Banerjee, in the first week of September. She however did not go to the ED’s office in Delhi citing the risk a mother of two infants might face while travelling during the Covid pandemic. She wrote a mail to the agency saying it would be convenient for her if ED officers came to her Kolkata residence. Rujira Banerjee was questioned by the CBI in February. The CBI team visited Abhishek Banerjee’s residence. In March, the CBI also questioned Rujira’s sister Maneka Gambhir and the latter’s husband Ankush Arora and father-in-law, Pawan Arora.Among the prime suspects is former TMC youth front general secretary and businessman Vinay Mishra who renounced his Indian citizenship in December and became a citizen of Vanuatu, a small island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/abhishek-banerjee-summoned-again-by-ed-for-questioning-in-coal-smuggling-case-101631467584818.html

12-09-2021||Chandigarh||'SAD wouldn't have to observe 'black day' if Harsimrat Kaur Badal had rejected farm ordinances': AAP||Had Harsimrat Kaur Badal not “signed” the Centre’s farm ordinances, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) would not have needed to observe September 17 as “black day”, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said on Sunday. AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan made the remarks taking a dig at SAD's announcement on Saturday that they would observe September 17 as “Black Day” on the completion of a year of the promulgation of the ordinances. SAD had also said its workers would take out a protest march from Gurdwara Rakabganj to Parliament to seek the repeal of the three farm laws. “If Harsimrat Kaur Badal had not signed the ordinances as Union minister, the black day would have never dawned on farmers,” said Sandhwan. Sandhwan, however, appealed to all pro-farmer organisations and political parties to observe September 17 as a “black day” at the national level to support farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws. He alleged that the Narendra Modi government has turned out to be become the “most dictatorial government in the history of India, violating the rights of the farmers, labourers, employees and students of the country”. The AAP MLA also said the agitation against the “black laws” from the land of Punjab has not only empowered farmers in India but also created awareness among the farmers and labourers of the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe and Africa, for the protection of their rights. “When the Akali Dal Badal has unwittingly declared September 17 as a black day with reference to anti-agriculture black laws, they should also repent for signing the farm ordinances and campaigning for the agricultural laws for three months,” he said. The AAP leader further said in fact, the Akali Dal was “one of the pioneers of black agriculture laws” and had been “a big supporter and propagandist” of these laws. He said in Punjab, the Akali Dal was not allowed to enter the villages and cities by the public. Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal had resigned as Union minister while the Akali Dal had quit the National Democratic Alliance over the farm laws last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-wouldn-t-have-to-observe-black-day-if-harsimrat-kaur-badal-had-rejected-farm-ordinances-aap-101631466170414.html

A team of National Commission for Women (NCW) met the family members of the woman who was brutalised with an iron rod in the wee hours of Friday.Slamming the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, leader of opposition in the legislative council Pravin Darekar said the patience of women has run out due to such “repeated” offences, which occur due to “carelessness of the government”.The five-member team also visited the spot where the crime took place. The woman died on Saturday during treatment at a city hospital. The NCW on Saturday took suo moto cognisance of the crime and said they would start a probe into the incident.The BJP leader said such incidents have occurred in several parts of the state and demanded that the MVA government should take steps to curb them. Darekar said women in the city are scared for their safety and demanded an action plan from the state government to stop such crimes. Sheetal Gambhir Desai, Mumbai head of the BJP women’s wing, spearheaded a protest in Powai on Sunday afternoon. RPI workers also held a protest in the city.“The patience of Mumbaiites has ran out now.

We want an action plan for such crimes to not happen in the future. Rape incidents have happened in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune, Amravati, Ahmednagar, Palghar and Vasai where women were brutalised. Now the Sakinaka incident is chilling; it is as gruesome as Nirbhaya,” Darekar said.On Saturday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray termed the Sakinaka rape incident a “blot on humanity”.

The tally of active cases again increased to 50,400. However, there is no sign of a rise in Covid-19 cases.State also saw 46 deaths, taking the toll to 138,142. Pune and Ahmednagar reported the highest toll with nine deaths each. Around 2,972 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours.The state has been reporting between 4,000 and 5,000 cases in the past 12 days, except four days when daily cases dropped to fewer than 4,000. On Saturday, it reported 3,075 cases, the lowest since February 9. In the past 12 days, it has reported 48,067 cases, which is less than 69,344 cases reported in the corresponding period last month.Amid the threat of a potential third wave, the state government is not considering re-imposing any fresh curbs anywhere in the state as of now, as there is still no rise in daily figures. At the same time, it is also taking decisions on lifting restrictions in a gradual manner, according to the state authorities.According to health experts, the impact of the festivals will be seen only after a period of two weeks and a third wave may hit the state by December or January. The state health minister Rajesh Tope said that the decision on reopening religious places will be taken only after the Diwali festival.“As the head of the state disaster management authority, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will take the decision on reopening religious places. Ganesh Chaturthi is going on and Dussehra and Diwali festivals are ahead. Even if the daily cases are reduced, the decision on religious places will be taken if the situation will be under control after Dussehra and Diwali festivals,” Tope told reporters in Jalna on Sunday.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force said the state is on red alert because of the festive season as it is still clocking around 3,000-4,000 cases a day and active cases are more than 50,000. “Just after Onam, there was a peak in Kerala, similarly we will come to know the true impact of Ganesh festivals after two weeks. Our test positivity rate has dramatically come down but we have to be very cautious and keep testing because our test positivity rate has to be around 1% or lower than that and Covid deaths need to be zero,” Dr Joshi said.Earlier, the Central government directed the state government to take precautions during upcoming festivals.“We still are looking at the thinning of the tale of the second wave and it appears that the third wave, if at all comes, will come by December or January. We are still on red alert because we want people to behave responsibly and there should be double masking and at least 80% of our population needs to be vaccinated with two doses,” added Dr Joshi.In Maharashtra, there are six districts of concern — Pune, Thane, Sangli, Satara, Solapur, Kolhapur and Mumbai.On Sunday, Pune reported 707 cases (including district and city) Satara, 390, Mumbai 357, Sangli 264, Solapur 223, Thane 102 and Kolhapur 89 cases.With 357 cases, Mumbai’s case tally stands at 735,055.

12-09-2021||Chandigarh||Covid fallout: With banks issuing takeover notices, HP hoteliers in dire straits||The tourism industry has been reeling due to the curbs imposed to arrest the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. In another setback, many hotels in Himachal have been served takeover notices due to non-payment of loans. Hoteliers have been severely hit due to restrictions on interstate movement. Many hotels in and around Shimla had to temporarily close due to dearth of working capital, others could only list a few rooms. Tourism has been the primary mainstay for people in the hill-state, generating both direct and indirect employment. Lack of financial aid from the state government and the Covid-induced slowdown has left stakeholders in dire straits. “Hoteliers are fuming as far from extending a helping hand, the government has asked them to pay water and garbage bills and property tax,” says Mohinder Seth, president, Himachal Pradesh State Tourism Stakeholder Association.Other states such as Gujarat, Odisha, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Punjab have given relief to hotel businesses by waving off taxes, or demand charges on electricity and other concessions for a year.Hoteliers say the business is no longer viable in Himachal Pradesh. They say the Capital city was the worst affected as it is the only tourist destination in the state where the cost of water, property tax and garbage is highest, while the rent is the lowest due to the presence of a large number of hotels in and around Shimla. The interest subvention scheme has only benefitted a few hotels, while small units continue to struggle. Some tourism units did benefit from the emergency credit line scheme, but tourism units who had availed loans after February were not benefitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-fallout-with-banks-issuing-takeover-notices-hp-hoteliers-in-dire-straits-101631466562809.html

Now after three regular rounds, the special admission rounds will start,” said Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education, Pune, in-charge of the admission process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fyjc-admissions-round-3-73-990-seats-still-vacant-101631465602291.html

The PMC is presently preparing a DP of the 11 fringe villages that merged in 2017 but the state has handed over the DP of 23 newly-merged villages to the PMRDA as planning authority.Nitin Mane, chief executive officer (CEO) of the MHADA Pune board, said, “We have sent a letter to the PMC as well as PMRDA to reserve land for an affordable housing scheme in the Pune region. The final decision will be taken by both authorities. We need 100 hectare of land in these merged villages. PMC and PMRDA have started preparation of the DP of fringe villages. So, we have suggested that land be reserved for MHADA.”“Now, we have affordable housing schemes across 176 hectare land in the PMC and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. There is no open land available in the existing PMC and PCMC areas. We don’t have a ‘land bank’ to develop new schemes in these areas. So, we have requested PMC and PMRDA to reserve land,” he said.Rajendra Raut, chief superintendent engineer and head of the DP cell of PMC, said, “MHADA is a government body and it can raise demand. We will make a decision as per the available land.”A senior official of the PMC said, “PMC has already started schemes under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) to provide affordable housing to the economically weaker sections (EWS) and lower income groups (LIG). We have set a target to provide more than 1 lakh affordable houses in the PMC limit. We already have a shortage of land for the PMAY schemes. Therefore, I don’t think we should have to give land to any other government authority for the same purpose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mhada-demands-100-hectares-in-merged-villages-for-affordable-housing-101631465422233.html

Earlier cases on misdemeanours at the hospital include the handing over of the wrong deceased person to relatives.According to authorities, so far five incidents - four related to handling corpses and one related to decapitation of a corpse - have been reported at the Sassoon Hospital in the recent past.In 2019, two bodies were misplaced. The confusion came to light when one of the relatives came to claim the corpse and was informed that the corpse had already been cremated. In another incident in 2008, a corpse in Sassoon mortuary was decapitated by three persons and later dumped in a canal in Hadapsar. On August 20 last year confusion prevailed a the Noorani graveyard after a family discovered that the body whose last rites they were preparing for was not related to them. The Sassoon hospital authorities had handed the wrong body to the family.The incident of an infant being stolen from Sassoon General Hospital onFriday last week is the only such incident of infant abduction which has taken place at the government hospital in the past five years, as per hospital records.Dr Vinayak Kale, dean, Sassoon hospital, said, “We have strong security measures in place to ensure that no untoward incident takes place on our premises.” Dr Shrihari Halnor, Sassoon’s Resident Medical Officer (RMO) said, “The last incident took place five years ago, since then, tight security is in place. CCTV surveillance and security guards are stationed at all the wards. Even the current incident is related to an OPD patient and not a patient admitted in the woman’s ward. She had come for some test and in the ensuing melee, the incident took place. However, we have further upgraded our vigil aimed at making the campus safe for all.”The Bund Garden police on Friday arrested Vandana Jethe (24), a Kharadi resident, for allegedly stealing a three-month-old girl from the hospital. According to the FIR , the 22-year-old mother of the infant had come to the hospital for treatment and was at ward number 74, when a woman dressed as a nurse told her that a family member had come to meet her. The accused offered to look after her baby till she returned. The mother handed the baby to the woman and went out of the ward. On her return, she failed to locate the nurse and her baby and then informed the security personnel at the hospital. The hospital authorities informed the police after which a Bund Garden police team reached the spot and launched a search for the baby. The investigators found clues about the accused woman from CCTV footage, which showed a woman wearing the uniform of a nurse leaving the hospital premises with the baby. A police probe revealed that the accused could not conceive a baby and resorted to abduction.Health activist Feroz Mulla, who staged a protest outside Sassoon Hospital said, “Sassoon authorities need a rap from the higher ups as there is callousness which led to the incident. A probe must be ordered and disciplinary action must be taken by the medical board.” Goof ups at Sassoon hospitalAugust 2008 A corpse in the Sassoon mortuary was decapitated by three persons and dumped in a canal in Hadapsar.May 2019 Two corpses are misplaced.

Out of the total 17.10km road length, the PMC needs to acquire land for more than 2km so while the original deadline has been extended once till December 2021, it will have to be extended again in view of the current situation.V G Kulkarni, chief superintendent engineer of the road department, said, “The corporation required land for more than 2km road stretch. The PMC is trying to complete work on phases 1 and 3. In phase 1, we need land for the 350m road stretch between Rajaram bridge and Mhatre Bridge. We require around 9519.60 square metre land for a 2km stretch in phase 3 to complete the project. The corporation will have to raise around Rs300 crore to acquire the land. Therefore, the commissioner has decided to check the option of credit bonds.”As there is a shortage of funds required to acquire land for the Kharadi-Shivane road and widen the Katraj-Kondhwa road, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar has decided to explore credit bonds as an option for acquiring land. Officials however are not sure if this will help in acquiring land. At present, the corporation claims to have completed nearly 61% of the work on the Kharadi-Shivane riverside road but it is in parts and will not serve the purpose of easing traffic congestion along the city’s biggest roads.A senior official of the PMC said, “The project is already stuck as there are a couple of buildings existing in phase 3. Along the Aga Khan bridge to Mundhwa bridge stretch, there is a 700m patch where there are three four-storied buildings, all of them authorised. The purpose of the road is almost ruined.”In 2007, the PMC planned to construct the road in two phases – the first phase being the Shivane to Mhatre bridge stretch which is a distance of 5.95km, and the second phase from Sangamwadi to Kharadi which is a distance of 11.8km. Thereafter, the project was divided into three phases to include the Mhatre bridge to Sangam bridge stretch of 5.50km. However, it was dropped later as it fell along the blue line of the Mutha river.The Kharadi-Shivane riverside road is part of the development plan (DP) of the city and work actually started in May 2013. The project cost was Rs363 crore, with the corporation having paid Rs228 crore to the contractor till date. However the project cost has escalated by Rs41.50 crore because of land acquisition, with the corporation using the deferred payment option (five annual installments of 20% each). While the project was originally scheduled to be completed in three years, it continues to be incomplete even eight years down the line. The 17.10km-long fully-concrete elevated road runs along the banks of the Mula and Mutha rivers and is 24 to 30m wide. Earmarked as a ‘riverside’ road in the 1987 development plan, the road will serve as a vital link between the Mumbai-Bangalore and Pune-Ahmednagar highways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kharadishivane-riverside-road-project-stuck-due-to-land-acquisition-101631465002248.html
12-09-2021||Mumbai||OBC Muslims’ body launches campaign for caste census in Maharashtra||As the demand for a caste-based census intensifies, an organisation of backward Muslims has launched a state-wide campaign to press for it. The All India Muslim OBC Organisation (AIMOBC) is looking at expanding this campaign across the country and wants a scientific headcount of all castes, including those among Muslims, for enhanced affirmative action benefits.The body has sought that in case the percentage of other backward classes (OBCs) in the country exceeds the estimate of 52%, then the quota for the section be increased from the present 27%.Around 90% Muslims fall in OBC, Scheduled Tribe (ST) or Scheduled Caste (SC) categories, with upper-caste Ashraf Muslims such as Syeds forming a small number. Muslim OBC activists note that like Hindus, caste runs co-terminus among Muslims with a bulk of them engaged in traditional, caste-based occupations like Bagwans and Rayeens (gardeners), Ansaris and Momins (weavers), Hajams (barbers) and Darjis (tailors).“We launched our campaign after the Supreme Court (SC) struck down Maharashtra’s quota for OBCs in local self-government body elections due to lack of empirical data about their backwardness,” said Shabbir Ahmed Ansari, president of AIMOBC.He added, “Since August, we are submitting memorandums to district collectors and tehsildars and have launched an outreach and awareness programme, especially targetted at the youth to convince them about how established OBC leaders are selfish and have done little for the community.” Ansari noted that it is the youth who stand to benefit the most due to affirmative action measures like reservation in jobs and education.Ansari, who has been associated with veteran OBC leaders like Karpoori Thakur and Chaudhary Brahm Prakash, said no mainstream Muslim politician was speaking up for backward Muslims but is instead seeking separate religion-based quotas for the community, which is unconstitutional and impractical. A religion-based quota would also work in the favour of upper-caste Muslims who were well-heeled.He said they would organise a meeting of OBC leaders from across the country in New Delhi next month to intensify the demand for a nationwide caste-based census.Ansari explained that a scientific headcount of OBC Muslims would help roll out targeted welfare measures for them. “In the absence of rational estimations about their numbers, OBC Muslims have suffered neglect… Around 90% of Muslims in Maharashtra, and almost all Muslims in rural areas are backwards, with upper-castes forming a miniscule section. Upper-caste Muslims have better access to education and resources and have hijacked the share of benefits meant for their backward brethren. Like upper-caste Hindus, these upper-caste Muslims have restricted upward mobility for others,” he said.“Today, there is no separate budgetary provision for OBCs like that of SCs and STs, who get the benefit of outlays based on their population… We are demanding that a nationwide census be conducted now. Since the Centre has refused to enumerate castes (except SCs and STs) in the 2021 nationwide census, it also means that the next such headcount can happen only in 2031,” he added.BOX:Muslims form an estimated 12% of Maharashtra’s population and a majority of them belong to categories like OBC.The actual number of OBCs is unclear, with varying estimates.While OBCs are estimated to be the largest social bloc at around 52% of the population, both Hindus and non-Hindus, according to the BP Mandal commission, which extrapolated data from the 1931 caste census — the last such caste-based headcount conducted in colonial India.However, the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) has estimated this at a lower 41% in 2004-2005. The Periodic Labour Force Survey 2019-20 puts it at 43.8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/obcmuslims-body-launches-campaign-for-caste-census-in-maharashtra-101631464883211.html

In the letter, Sidhu, who led a three-member state Congress team at the meeting convened by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) two days ago, said the farmer unions sought the cancellation of unjust and unfair FIRs registered against them due to incidents of violence during the agitation in the state. “The Congress has supported the farmers in every endeavour since the beginning of the agitation. Our government has facilitated the protesting farmers by providing maximum support to their protests,” he wrote, advising the state government to set up a mechanism to cancel all unfair cases after considering each case on compassionate grounds. Sidhu said that farmers saw the demand for fards (land records) to demarcate details of land ownership before procurement as ordered by the central government as unjust. The Congress leader said he also personally believed it to be unfair and against a large number of farmers who were sowing crops by taking land on lease. There was no clear land ownership as for decades, the partition of land had not happened in many parts of the state and also many land owners were now living abroad, he added. He said this was an attack on the resilient system of procurement through arhtiyas and to push the farmers away from APMC mandis towards private markets where no such records were being demanded, urging the government to fight against it. Lauds state Congress’s work for agri sector Praising the work already done by Punjab Congress for agriculture and its commitment to do much more, Sidhu said that Punjab had allocated 10.9% of its budget expenditure for agriculture in 2021-22, which was much higher than average allocation of 6.3% by other states. He also made mention of power subsidy, farm loan waivers and the efficiency of government procurement. “We must do more, standing firmer on our resolution passed in Vidhan Sabha in October 2020 and not let the three black laws be implemented in our state at any cost,” he said. He also reiterated his earlier demands for procurement of pulses and oilseeds through state corporations at minimum support prices (MSPs) and investment in diversification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-presses-capt-amarinder-for-cancellation-of-firs-against-farmers-in-fresh-letter-101631464525525.html

Buoyed by this, many farmers opted to farm flowers. Add good climatic conditions and a majority of these farmers witnessed a bumper production which in turn led to heavy slashing of prices.Arun Veer, Pune Flower Traders’ Union president, APMC market yard, said, “Last year, farmers received very good rates for marigold and shevanti. But the trend this year has been the opposite. Rates have fallen so sharply that farmers have been unable to earn even their carriage expenses.”Last year due to Covid, the market was not completely open helping farmers fetch very high rates. This year, flower stock has come in from across the district which was not the case last year.“If one farmer grows marigold, others will follow. This is a major problem as farmers tend to produce the same flower. This year, there was a 20% rise in production of marigold and shevanti,” Veer said.Stable rates for polyhouses Meanwhile, prices of poly house flowers such as rose and gerbera have remained stable.“Gerbera flowers are mostly used in decoration and every year, their rate rises but with most of the mandaps opting for sober decoration, these flowers are not in high demand,” Veer said.On Sunday, there was a good demand for flowers in wholesale as well as retail markets.“We feared that marigold would go to waste but today, the complete stock of marigold in the Rs15 per kilogramme category was sold out,” Veer added.High rates in retailThe downfall in rates has given good profit to retailers, with each area in the city selling flowers at different rates.“More profit is earned by makeshift flower shops as they put up stalls only during the festive season while those who have permanent flower shops don’t earn more profit,” added Veer.In Kothrud, marigold flowers were sold at Rs70 per kilogram on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.“Flower prices remain high for 10 days during Lord Ganesh’s arrival followed by Gauri pujan – for flower sellers, this is the best time to earn a profit and a majority of them have fixed rates,” said Ketan Gund, Shivtirth nagar, Kothrud.Vikas Gore, owner of Pushpak Florals, said, “If any customer demands more than 2kg flowers, we give them a discount otherwise the rates remain the same for all.”Madhukant Garad Administrator & Secretary, APMC Gultekadi Market Yard Pune, said, “Higher cultivation of flowers and larger supply resulted in slashing of rates. Rates are expected to become stable in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-wholesalers-suffers-as-flower-rates-heavily-slashed-101631464463794.html

The action came after two cases of child sexual assault by autorickshaw drivers were exposed last week. “Last week I came to Pune from Indore via train and wanted to take an auto from the railway station to Yerawada. I was told ₹150 is the charge, by the driver. When I questioned such a high fare, other drivers gathered and began defending the charge. This is a regular scene with drivers at the Pune railway station overcharging passengers,” said Hirendra Tripathi, a commuter.During the action, the traffic police fined 740 auto rickshaw drivers, while the RTO officials acted against 177. “The action must continue until rickshaw drivers stop flouting rules and accept the fares determined by the RTO,” said Anant Saharabuddhe, a resident of Bibwewadi. Another passenger, Kavita Pathak said, “I often take an auto from Swargate to Katraj, after I finish work, as there is a heavy rush for public buses. The auto drivers at Swargate’s ST stand are arrogant. We are even afraid to talk to them at times. They also park their autos in such a way that it blocks the entry of ST bsues to the stand. Strict action needs to be taken.” A demand is being raised by passengers to start a prepaid autorickshaw stand at the Pune railway station. One of the rape incidents involved rickshaw drivers kidnapping a minor from the railway station.Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said, “We have already started the process to start a prepaid auto stand from the railway station and necessary permissions and NOCs will be given. Also, action is regularly taken against drivers who are found violating traffic rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punes-rickshaw-drivers-in-firing-line-as-list-of-commuter-complaints-gets-bigger-101631464222240.html

Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Zilla Parishad, said, “This is a magisterial order. Front-line workers (FLW) have been asked to ensure that they get the certificate of vaccination as proof that they have been fully vaccinated. Public servants or government officials could be potential super-spreaders and so vaccination has been made mandatory for them.” The order is applicable to the all government officials including police personnel, cantonment board officials, members of co-operative societies and those hired on contract basis during the Covid-19 crises; all who have got vaccinated with both the doses must get their verification done. The verification process has to be completed by September 30, 2021 and a copy of the same should be submitted to the collector’s office or Zilla Parishad’s office along with the signature of the nodal officer.The central government issued directives to the state to begin vaccination for front-line workers from February 1 2021. Earlier, the PMC introduced similar strict measures to ensure its employees get vaccinated, including withholding incentives and making vaccination mandatory.

12-09-2021||Patna||AIIMS-Patna fixes seniority, fills top positions after 2 years||Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has finalised professors’ seniority and appointed deans and associate deans of examination, research and academics, from its faculty members, said doctors familiar with the development. The AIIMS took two years to fill these positions after the regulations were notified on October 18, 2019 and published in the gazette of India. Most other AIIMS in India have already filled these positions. Dr Hemali Heidi Sinha, professor, department of obstetrics and gynaecology, has been appointed as the dean (examination), as per the institute’s order dated September 7. Dr Prem Kumar, professor, department of radiodiagnosis, has been appointed the dean (research). Dr Sadhna Sharma, professor, department of biochemistry, has taken over as the associate dean (examination); Dr Bindey Kumar, professor, department of paediatric surgery, as associate dean (academics); and Dr Punam Prasad Bhadani, professor, department of pathology/laboratory medicine, as associate dean (research). Prior to these appointments, Dr Umesh Bhadani, professor of anaesthesiology, was the only dean (academics), a position he occupies from October 19, 2020. The Institute Body of the AIIMS has already approved his appointment. The institute also elevated Dr Sharma, Dr Bhadani, Dr Sinha, Dr Prem Kumar and Dr Bindey Kumar to the higher administrative grade pay scale ( ₹1,82,200 — ₹2,24,100) of the Central government’s seventh pay commission with effect from September 4. These are the first few appointments among faculty members done as per the seniority list of professors, fixed by the institute, on the basis of their date of joining the institute and in line with the norms of the National Medical Commission. A few hand-picked faculty members, however, continue as sub-dean of undergraduate and postgraduate student affairs; resident doctors; and faculty affairs. These positions, occupied by Dr Ayan Banerjee, Dr Amit Patil, Dr Alok Ranjan and Dr Veena Singh, have not been filled as per seniority, said doctors quoted above. Deciding seniority of faculty members has been a bone of contention at AIIMS-Patna since its inception in 2012. The first seniority list of professors was withdrawn within 20 days of its issue on September 6, 2013. Dr AK Mahapatra, the then director of AIIMS-Bhubaneswar who was also the acting director here had approved the list when AIIMS-Patna director Dr GK Singh had gone on leave. On return, the latter withdrew the order, citing it was issued without the approval of the competent authority. Officiating dean Dr Neeraj Agarwal had issued a provisional seniority list of professors on August 8, 2017. Subsequently, on July 20, 2018, dean-in-charge, Dr Prem Kumar, issued a seniority list of faculties based on their date of joining. The list was finally superseded by one issued by AIIMS-Patna director Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh on August 17. Faculty seniority was thrown to the wind when Dr PP Gupta was appointed the institute’s first regular dean (academics) from November 24, 2016 to July 31, 2019, four years after the inception of the institute in 2012. Mark obtained in the faculty selection interview in 2012 was then made the deciding criteria in Dr Gupta’s appointment as dean, said AIIMS sources. For the initial four years, Dr PN Singh, Dr Sadhna Sharma and Dr Ramji Singh had shouldered the dean’s responsibilities as faculty in-charge, on ad hoc internal arrangement, prior to the appointment of Dr Gupta as the dean. Dr Neeraj Agarwal, who was senior to Dr Gupta, had to stake claim to the dean’s post after the latter’s superannuation before he donned the mantle between August 20, 2019 and October 19, 2020. AIIM-Patna director Dr Singh defended the institute. “Appointments of deans and associate deans were delayed because we could not hold the institute’s governing body meeting due to Covid-19. When it finally met in February, the governing body authorised the institute’s president to take a decision. Then there was a second wave of the pandemic. We got our institute president’s approval when he was here recently,” said Dr Singh. As for the oft-changing seniority list, he said, “There are certain norms which have to be followed before issuing a seniority list. A provisional list is first published, and objections are invited within 15 days, after which the final list is prepared. The one I have issued now has been done following all norms, after due diligence.” On not maintaining seniority in case of sub-deans, he said those were nominations to the post on ad hoc basis and not regular appointments. “The doctors working as sub-deans have been nominated to help the establishment carry out work in a smooth and efficient manner. Some people, irrespective of their seniority, are given responsibility based on their dynamism and zeal to go the extra mile. Dr Amit Patil (head, department of forensic medicine and toxicology), for one, has done tremendous work in framing the rules and regulations that govern an academic course. Let the people who have joined their new posts settle down and we can take a call about the sub-deans later,” said Dr Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/aiimspatna-fixes-seniority-fills-top-positions-after-2-years-101631464162786.html
12-09-2021||Patna||Bihar floods: Ministers to visit flood-hit districts, reassess damage||The state government has decided to reassess the scale of devastation due to this year’s flood and make a fresh claim for the compensation to the Centre soon, said a senior officer familiar with the issue. The drive to assess the flood-related damages in various sectors would begin with the minister-level review of their districts concerned from Tuesday. Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad will chair the meeting of senior officials of Munger and Patna on September 14 & 15 respectively to evaluate the losses the state and its people suffered due to the current spells of floods. On the day when the disaster management department (DMD), which is nodal department for crisis management, submitted a memorandum of ₹3,764 crore to the Central team and sought the financial help to tide over the calamity last week, chief minister Nitish Kumar had said it was a provisional report and final assessment would be done after the flood situation improved. Panchayati raj department minister Samrat Chaudhary, who will be holding review meeting of Darbhanga as minister in-charge of the district on September 15, said all ministers would be doing the similar exercise to present a realistic claim for the damages. Likewise, other ministers would be visiting their assigned districts between September 14-16 and meet the officials concerned. A senior official of the DMD said they plan to submit the fresh report to the Central government in the next couple of weeks. The volume of losses due to the floods is in likelihood will go up, he said. So far, the current spell of floods, which begun late May this year, has affected more than 15 lakh people of 359 panchayats of 73 blocks in 13 districts.

People queued for darshan on a footpath outside the temple, with heavy police bandobast in place to ensure no chaos.“I came from Daund to Pune city to take the darshan of the Dagdusheth Ganpati. After seeing the crowd outside the temple, I was bit afraid of getting Covid-19. Still I went ahead to take the darshan,” said Kiran Pisal, a devotee. Because of the crowds, vehicles coming from Shaniwarwada were diverted towards Junna Bazaar road leading to traffic jams in the evening peak hours. Vijay Chaudhary, assistant commissioner of police (traffic) said, “We are continuously monitoring the crowd and vehicles from the Dagdusheth Ganpati temple. Because it is Sunday, there was a heavy crowd to take darshan. We appeal to people to take darshan online and avoid crowding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sunday-crowds-outside-dagdusheth-ganpati-temple-send-covid-norms-for-a-toss-101631463563307.html
12-09-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata woman, minor son murdered; cousins held||Six days after a 47-year-old homemaker and her minor son were stabbed to death inside their home in the southern outskirts of Kolkata, the detective department of the city police on Sunday arrested two cousin brothers of the woman, police said. Sushmita Mondal was killed inside her apartment at Parnashree in the Behala area of Kolkata on the afternoon of September 6 because she refused to lend money to the main accused and her aunt’s son Sanjay Das, 44, said Murlidhar Sharma, joint commissioner of police (crime). Das was accompanied by his brother Sandip, 32, said Sharma. Sanjay Das was picked up by the police on Saturday and interrogated all night. “We arrested him around 2 pm after he confessed to the killings. Sandip was held around 4 pm from India Exchange Place in central Kolkata,” said Sharma. Both the accused live at Maheshtala in South 24 Parganas district. While Sanjay Das is associated with a cable television business, his brother is a driver. Mondal’s throat was slit and she was stabbed multiple times as well in her bedroom. Her son, Tamajit, 13, was attending virtual classes from the adjoining room. The boy was stabbed when he came to the bedroom and saw his mother being murdered, Sharma added. “Since Mondal was fond of jewellery from a very young age, Sanjay Das thought she must be having a lot of ornaments at home. He admitted during interrogation that he needed money for the marriage of his son from his first wife. He had a lot of debt and called up Mondal a few months ago to ask for ₹5,000. She said she did not have any money. The family of the deceased was more affluent than that of Das,” said Sharma. The crime initially baffled the police because the woman never opened the main door for strangers. Since she used to check every visitor through the eye hole, the police were sure that the killers were known to the family. The crime took place after 12.30 pm on September 6. The neighbours got suspicious when Tamajit’s private tutor, who came after 5 pm, found nobody responding when he rang the bell and even tried to call Mondal on her mobile phone. The woman’s husband, Tapan Mondal, a loan recovery agent with a private bank, was questioned several times as his phone was found to have been switched off for around two hours when the crime took place. He was let off as the police could not find any evidence against him. Even the woman’s parents said they did not suspect their son-in-law. To evade suspicion, the accused men visited Tapan Mondal and expressed their condolence, said a police officer associated with the probe.The postmortem examination reports suggested that the stab wounds were not inflicted by a professional killer, said a police officer. The knife could not be recovered at the scene of the crime or in the vicinity of the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-woman-minor-son-murdered-cousins-held-101631463503815.html
12-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC survey finds all fully vaccinated patients recovered after Covid infection||An analysis of the 158 fully vaccinated citizens by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in south Mumbai revealed that 60% or 95 citizens were infected with Covid-19, 90 days after getting their second dose. However, only five vaccinated citizens had to be hospitalised due to complications and most importantly all of them had recovered. BMC found zero causality in its analysis conducted for August month.It was conducted by the D ward to understand the ground situation. The ward covers areas like Malabar Hill, Grant Road, Chowpatty, Altamount Road, Peddar Road and Tardeo.According to the analysis, a total of 460 cases of Covid-19 were reported in the ‘D’ ward last month. Of them, 158 citizens had taken both doses. The data revealed that 95 citizens or 60% cases where individuals had taken their vaccine more than 90 days ago. It further added that all citizens recovered and none had to go through major complications except five who required hospitalization. However, they had also recovered.Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner of the BMC’s D ward said, “I conducted the analysis only to gauge the situation in my ward. Overall, the analysis has revealed that vaccination helps and also in my ward there has been a trend of self-testing. Many citizens after relaxations, are travelling and are later getting self-tested. This in a way helps early tracing, treating and also limits the spread.”In the city, as of Saturday, a total of 10,479,458 vaccine doses have been administered and 3,068,742 or three million citizens have been fully vaccinated. The highest number of vaccinated citizens with at least one dose are in the 18 to 45 years of the age group which has 4,886,197 administered at least one dose.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of state Covid-19 task force said, “The analysis is clear that vaccination helps, hence, I would once again appeal to citizens to get vaccinated. However, we need to understand that all vaccines are currently given emergency use approval, and in the coming months we will get improvised versions of vaccines to fight Covid-19. In fact, they are already in the making as we talk.”Dr Madhav Sathe, former microbiology professor at Nair Hospital said, “None of the vaccines is 100% effective, take any vaccine. But whether person who has taken both doses, will suffer from infection or not will depend on many factors such as the person’s professional risk, if person has Co-morbid conditions, person’s age and if person is taking any drugs that suppress immunity.”Dr Sathe added, “However, it is clear that none got infected with severe Covid-19 and very few required hospitalisations and there was zero mortality. This was possible only due to vaccination. Also, another major factor is following Covid-19 protocols post-vaccination.”Meanwhile, on Sunday the city reported 357 cases followed by seven deaths. This took the case tally to 735,055 and toll to 16,022. The city’s recovery rate is 96% with 711,341 recoveries and the mortality rate is 2.17%. There are 5,244 active cases in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-survey-finds-all-fully-vaccinated-patients-recovered-after-covid-infection-101631462962882.html
12-09-2021||Mumbai||Biology, chemistry in NEET moderate to easy, say students in Mumbai||Nearly 16 lakh students from around the country appeared for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) for undergraduate medical and dental courses on Sunday. Most students found the biology and chemistry sections moderate to easy, while many complained of the difficulty level in the physics section.Once again, Maharashtra made up for the highest number of applicants, with 2.2 lakh registered candidates from the state. While the majority of students found the exam process smooth sailing, few students from the city had much to complain about and have approached the National Testing Agency (NTA) about these errors.“At our centre, the authorities never checked our admit cards, which means the NTA now has no confirmation that we appeared for the exam altogether. We’ve asked the NTA to look into this matter,” said a student. In another case, a handful of students in one classroom at another centre in the city were shocked when the optical marking recognition (OMR) sheet was separated from the answer booklet by the invigilator.“The NTA rules mention that the OMR sheet has to be attached with the answer booklet, how did the invigilator not know this? Without the answer booklet the answer sheet might get discredited from assessment,” said Ruiee Kapoor, parent and activist. Many parents too have approached the NTA and are hoping for clarity from them soon.This is the first time since its inception that the exam pattern for NEET-UG has been changed.Until 2020, the NEET-UG paper pattern consisted of 180 objective type questions from physics, chemistry and biology (botany and zoology) to be answered on a specially designed sheet using a ballpoint pen only. Each correct answer gives students four marks, and each wrong answer deducts one mark. According to NTA, the new paper pattern will now comprise two sections under each subject.Section A will consist of 35 questions that students have to attempt compulsorily, and section B will consist of 15 questions from which the candidate can choose to attempt any 10 questions. “Since students have to choose and attempt only 10 out of the 15 questions, the utilisation of time will remain the same, thus clarifying that the total time given for the exam remains the same this year as well,” clarified the NTA response.Some students also complained about the optional questions in the chemistry section, not from the NCERT syllabus. “Overall, this year’s paper is tougher than the previous year, which is going to make scoring difficult for students. The overall cutoffs will drop this time,” said Vinay Kumar, managing director and chief executive officer, Rao Academy, a city-based coaching institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/biology-chemistry-in-neet-moderate-to-easy-say-students-in-mumbai-101631462722925.html

The railway tracks at the station are at a lower level than ground which leads to accumulation of water during heavy rainfall along with high tide.The work on the connection of RCC pipes with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) pipelines is going on. Once connected, the storm water will be passed through this newly laid RCC pipe, thus preventing waterlogging, officials said.The work was started after conducting a survey to identify where to fix the level of pipe, construction of receiving pit, aligning and setting up of micro-tunnelling boring machine and casting and testing 1,000-mm diameter RCC pipes.“Micro-tunnelling is a proven technology which widely adopted and recently tried, tested and executed at Sandhurst Road railway station area. The railway portion of micro-tunnelling work at Masjid Bunder station has been completed in a very short period,” said Anil Kumar Lahoti, general manager, CR.“A similar kind of micro-tunnelling work has been successfully completed at Sandhurst road station and between Dadar and Parel in monsoon this year in collaboration with civic authorities,” said a senior CR official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cr-finishes-work-to-prevent-waterlogging-at-masjid-bunder-in-mumbai-101631462362968.html
12-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC allows PMC Bank to intervene in Rakesh Wadhawan’s bail plea||The Bombay high court (HC) recently permitted the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank to intervene and oppose the bail application of Rakesh Wadhawan, Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) promoter who is accused of allegedly defrauding the bank in a multi-crore money laundering case. Wadhawan has filed the plea on medical grounds. The court also directed Arthur Road jail authorities to furnish medical papers and opinions of expert doctors on Wadhawan’s health condition after it was informed that the accused was referred for cardiac and other treatment at KEM Hospital as the same was not possible at the prison hospital. The single-judge bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while hearing the bail application of Wadhawan through senior advocate Aabad Ponda, was informed that the chief medical officer of Arthur Road jail had submitted a medical report of Wadhawan. The report stated that on September 1 Wadhawan was referred to KEM Hospital for cardiac and other multi-organ medical treatment and that he would be required to be admitted to the hospital again.The court observed that the report was not accompanied with necessary medical papers and opinions expressed by doctors when Wadhawan was examined. Following this, additional public prosecutor Prajakta Shinde sought time to bring on record all relevant medical papers, which the court allowed.Wadhawan, who is named as an accused by the economic offences wing (EOW) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) for his alleged role in the PMC Bank fraud, had earlier sought temporary bail in view of Covid-19, but the same was rejected by the special court. The court had observed that the allegations against Wadhawan were serious and he had caused losses worth crores to the bank, hence temporary bail could not be granted. Thereafter, the counsel for PMC Bank, the complainant in the fraud case, through advocate Aamir Malik sought permission to intervene and oppose Wadhawan’s bail application.“Considering that the intervention is sought by the complainant, an opportunity of hearing is accorded. The intervenor is at liberty to advance the submissions during the hearing of the bail applications. Interim applications stand allowed,” noted justice Dangre and posted further hearing to September 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-allows-pmc-bank-to-intervene-in-rakesh-wadhawan-s-bail-plea-101631460322531.html

SAD Kisan Wing president Sikander Singh Maluka said it was shocking that instead of strengthening the cooperative structure, the state government was working to weaken it. “The decision of the state government to reduce DAP fertiliser share to farmers through societies from 80% to 50% is a clear indication that the Congress government is implementing the agenda of the BJP, even as the cooperative societies are the backbone of the farming community,” Maluka said, adding, “The short supply is related to the reduction in the ₹8,000 per tonne subsidy denied to manufacturers.” He added that due to the reduction in manufacturing of fertilisers from 5.5 lakh tonne to 1.25 lakh tonne, lower supply is available in the market. He said marginal farmers were the most affected as they were not in a capacity to procure fertilisers from the market. “The decision of the state government is nothing, but implementation of the BJP’s agenda to create an atmosphere to hand over agriculture sector to corporates and other private players,” Maluka claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-govt-centre-conspiring-to-abolish-cooperative-societies-sad-101631459482490.html

However, the outbreak of White Fecal Disease (WFD) in his 3-acre pond of shrimp dashed his hopes. From estimates of ₹40 lakh turnover, Jagmohan finally ended up short of even recovering his investment of ₹16 lakh. With shrimps showing symptoms of retarded growth rate due to WFD, a condition caused by a parasite, he had to harvest his pond in August, much before the scheduled harvesting period of September-October.“I saw an opportunity in shrimp farming in 2019 and prepared my saline and water-logging prone land, for aquaculture. Encouraged by my past experiences, this time I expanded shrimp culture to 3 acre. The shrimp, however, contracted WFD, suffered indigestion and started losing weight drastically, not suited for the market at all,” he said.Farmers in Muktsar, Bathinda, Fazilka and Mansa districts are reporting similar experiences this year. In affected shrimp farms, WFS is evident with whitish fecal strings floating on to the pond surface.Experts at Ludhiana-based Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) attribute the widespread infestation to poor seed quality and gaps is safety protocol. They say the infection may spread from one farm to another through birds, unsanitised equipment or persons accessing ponds. Farmers say they had purchased shrimp seeds through middlemen and have sought the Punjab government’s intervention in providing reliable seeds to overcome losses.Dr Meera D Ansal, dean, department of the Aquaculture College of Fisheries at GADVASU, said, “WFD is a common problem, but it is for the first time that farmers here have this problem on such a large scale. Shrimp is highly remunerative, but it is also high-risk crop. Farmers must follow protocol that Coastal Aquaculture Authority, a national agency, had prepared.” Progressive farmers like Lakhwinder Singh from Muktsar’s Ratta Khera village said farmers reared profit in 2020, but this year his crop in 8-acre farm has been almost fully destroyed. Punjab’ southern districts have almost 1.5 lakh hectare affected with high salinity levels and experts say this unproductive land can be converted into economically viable farms through aquaculture.US and China are main importers of Indian shrimp and firms from coastal states of south India buy the crop at the farm-gate in Punjab. An experienced aquaculturist Harminder Singh from Mansa said, “Bio-safety is key to a good shrimp harvest. Farmers must ensure that entire pond area is protected against birds or stray animals and only sanitised persons enter their farm. These should work in a cooperative mode to source shrimp seeds directly from certified hatcheries in Andhra Pradesh and other places and get it tested at the GADVASU laboratory.”GADVASU’s fisheries resource management expert Prabhjeet Singh said shrimp was prone to infections and farmers should avoid overcrowding in ponds, and harvest it in a 120-day cycle. In 2017, Punjab laid emphasis on shrimp farming with the result coming in 2019, with a production of 800 tonne; last year, production dipped to 600 tonne due to lower availability of seeds, with Covid-19 restrictions in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/disease-hits-shrimp-in-malwa-dashing-farmers-hopes-of-3rd-good-season-in-a-row-101631458703537.html

Building a portfolio with a long-term approach and adopting the same approach while reviewing it is necessary. While recent times may have turned your attention to having an emergency fund or enough money in your savings accounts to meet treatment expenses, investing with the intent to secure your long-term financial future should be the aim. Market movements may take a toll on certain investment options that had seemed lucrative otherwise. Long-term investment options include equity-type investments like stocks and real estate. Understand the market dynamics involved in the working of any and every fiscal instrument. For example, debt instruments provide security but do not beat inflation. Choosing to invest in equities through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) ensures regular investment in the market. This will also save you from the hassle of timing the market before entering and exiting it. Hedge risks The extent to which your choice of investments will behave in the long run depends on the quantum of risk associated with them and whether they have been shielded against sudden market movements or unforeseen events like the recent epidemic. A unique way of hedging risks can be through insurance. Similarly, investments must also be insured by securing an emergency fund to meet contingencies. To ensure complete financial security, you must take care to diversify your investments. A well-diversified portfolio contains stocks, mutual fund investments, fixed-income instruments, sovereign gold bonds and a bit of real estate. Financial goals Investments are made keeping financial goals in mind. Depending on your risk appetite and desired earnings in the long run, you can put your money into equities and debt instruments. Besides, you must consider factors including market volatility, changing interest rates and sporadic monetary guidelines by the government while investing your money. For example, a few years back, Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) were preferred despite a part of the premium being dedicated to life cover owing to its tax exemption option. However, change of rules allowed exemptions from tax only for ULIPs with yearly premium up to ₹2.5 lakh per annum. This prompted many to shift their investments to mutual funds subject to the same tax slabs. However, in the latter, the entire money was invested in equity or debt without the burden of the added insurance cover. Tax implications Investments, insurance and tax-saving measures are distinct from each other. While reviewing your investment portfolio, check if you have availed of the tax-saving opportunities too such as paying for tax-saving fixed deposit receipts, public provident funds, equity-linked savings schemes, etc. Start checking at the portfolio level and then move on to individual investments to check which earn good returns. While saving on taxes is important, the focus must always be on investments that earn high returns and not choosing those that promise tax benefits but give low returns. While reviewing possible returns, compute the potential tax burden too to calculate the post-tax returns. Change asset class There is nothing fixed about assets. If circumstances indicate the possible need for enough cash in the future, choose investments that can be easily liquidated. Opt for simple money market instruments like accumulating money in savings accounts or parking some amount in fixed or recurring deposits. You can put some money in extremely short-term investment options too.

12-09-2021||Dehradun||Congress MLA joins BJP ahead of assembly polls, says impressed by PM Modi||With months left for the next state assembly elections to be held in Uttarakhand next year, Opposition Congress MLA from Purola constituency of Uttarkashi district, Rajkumar, joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in its headquarters in Delhi on Sunday. His joining has come days after independent MLA from Dhanaulti in Tehri Garhwal district Pritam Singh Panwar joined BJP a few days ago in Delhi. Rajkumar, who was earlier an MLA with the BJP from 2007-2012 from Sahaspur constituency of Dehradun district, fought independently from Purola in the 2012 elections and lost. He then joined Congress in the 2017 elections and won from Purola. On Sunday, he joined the BJP in presence of Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, party state president Madan Kaushik and party Rajya Sabha member Anil Baluni. He was welcomed in the party folds by Pradhan by handing him the party membership token before the media. Pradhan while welcoming him to the party, called him a mass leader in Uttarakhand. “A mass leader in the Himalayan state, Rajkumar has support in Dehradun as well as the rural areas of hills. His joining will ensure the party’s win in the upcoming state assembly elections in Uttarakhand,” said Pradhan. Terming him an influential leader in the Scheduled Caste (SC) community, party state head Kaushik said, “Rajkumar is a senior leader who had served the people of Uttarakhand for two terms as an MLA including the present one.” “He has significant influence in the SC community and has always been active on issues related to them. He is so concerned for the community that, despite being an MLA in the Opposition, he has supported our government on steps taken for the welfare of the community in the House. The party will definitely benefit with his inclusion,” said Kaushik, adding “We hope he will strengthen the party by working within the framework.” CM Dhami, while hailing Rajkumar’s contribution as a leader said, “He has always raised the voice of the oppressed and poor. He has been working for the poor across the state.” “A few days ago, Panwar joined the BJP and now Rajkumar. It is due to the charismatic leadership of PM Narendra Modi. Rajkumar’s inclusion will help BJP work for the ignored section of the society in a much better way,” said Dhami. Rajkumar, while addressing the media during the joining event, said he joined the BJP because he was “greatly influenced by PM Modi.” “I was influenced by the kind of development works are being done by the BJP government under PM Modi, especially the Char Dham all-weather road which has changed the face of Uttarakhand. Also, it is also providing free ration to crores of poor across the country amid the Covid-19 pandemic which left a great impact on me about the public welfare works being done by BJP in the country. These all made me join the party,” he said. On the occasion, he also attacked his previous party Congress for “not doing enough for the SC community.” “The major difference between the BJP and the Congress which I can see is the fact that the former has worked towards making SC community self-dependent but Congress always made them disabled by making them rely on subsidies,” said Rajkumar. Earlier, a BJP insider said that Rajkumar was supposed to join the party in a formal event on Saturday but couldn’t after he had put a condition before the party leadership. “He was demanding a ticket from Rajpur road constituency of Dehradun from where Khajan Das is party MLA. The party was a little hesitant in accepting it because it feared angering the party workers in the area by doing so. But it seems the demand has been met,” said the leader on condition of anonymity. “It is good that weaker links are leaving party before polls,” Congress state president Ganesh Godiyal said. Reacting to the development, Godiyal claimed that it “won’t affect” the party as it is going to win the 2022 polls. “It is in fact a good thing that the weaker links are leaving the party before the polls. Rajkumar was aware of his weakening political status in his constituency and was wary of it. Hence, in order to save himself, he switched sides before the polls,” said Godiyal. He also said that he tried contacting Rajkumar before his joining but failed. “I had earlier got to know about his probable joining from the media reports after which I tried to contact him to know the reason but failed. He must have sensed his situation for some reasons leading to his defection,” said Godiyal. The Opposition state head also categorically denied that any other party MLA is also in talks with BJP to switch sides. “I can say with full confidence that apart from Rajkumar, no other MLA is in touch with the BJP. They are all working for the party to win the 2022 polls along with the hard work of our party workers on the ground,” said Godiyal. Meanwhile, amid the fresh political development, a senior Congress leader has claimed that two BJP sitting MLAs, one each from Haridwar and Dehradun, are in touch with Congress and are willing to switch sides. “The one from Haridwar is ready to join the party but on a guaranteed ticket for the 2022 elections while the other one from Dehradun is the one who had defected to the BJP in 2017 and is currently disgruntled with the BJP leadership,” said the leader. He added, “Congress right now is not in a hurry to accept them in the party fearing political repercussions in the organisation. It is possible that both are sensing that they won’t be given tickets by the BJP in 2022 and are hence trying to switch sides. And if that happens, then BJP will be in a position to say that Congress accepted those leaders who were rejected by them. It will be then a political self-goal for us ahead of the elections. We have enough strong candidates of our own in both those constituencies.” When enquired, party state head Godiyal didn’t deny the reports and said, “I have already said that some BJP MLAs are in touch with us to join the party but we will go head after proper analysis and c||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/congress-mla-joins-bjp-ahead-of-assembly-polls-says-impressed-by-pm-modi-101631457324109.html
12-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Asha workers await Covid-19 incentives since April, to protest on Sept 24||Over 1.50 lakh Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) workers will be going on a strike from September 24. Despite the assurance of ₹1,000 incentive from the Central government for testing and tracing Covid-19 patients, Asha workers still await the remuneration since April 2021.Since the announcement of the pandemic in March 2020, Asha workers have been doing door-to-door surveys of infected Covid-19 patients for contact tracing of closed contacts. They also visit villagers to maintain data of children with malnutrition and health updates of pregnant women. This often makes them vulnerable to contracting Covid on the field, as claimed by the Asha workers. Already 45 Asha workers have lost their lives to the novel coronavirus in Maharashtra, since its outbreak.Though the pandemic curve has flattened in the state, a few districts like Pune, Aurangabad and Sangli are still recording a higher positivity rate than the state’s average which stands at 3.1%. Despite this, the central government has stopped playing them the Covid-19 incentives of ₹1,000.“It is the responsibility of the Asha workers to track the close contacts of the infected patients. Also, daily, they have to maintain the health updates of malnourished children, pregnant women and lactating mothers. These expose the workers to contracting Covid-19 cases. Despite this, they aren’t getting their Covid-19 incentives,” said MA Patil from Maharashtra Rajya Asha Gatpravatak Karamchari Kruti Samiti. “Although doctors from private setups get lakhs for their services,” he added.The Asha workers get an honorarium amount between ₹4,000 to ₹8,500 depending on their experience.“These workers are risking their lives for such less honorarium amount. Also, we didn’t get the hiked payment of ₹2,000 from April 2021 onward. No one cares for the foot soldiers who are risking their lives amid the pandemic,” said Patil.In response to the allegations, state-wide Asha workers have decided to go on a strike on September 24.“The state government had recently declared to pay them ₹3,000 addition but so far, it hasn’t been implemented. This is unethical,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-asha-workers-await-covid-19-incentives-since-april-to-protest-on-sept-24-101631456662112.html
12-09-2021||Mumbai||SIT to handle probe into Sakinaka rape and murder case||Investigations into the brutal rape and murder of a 32-year-old woman in Sakinaka were on Sunday transferred to a special investigation team (SIT). The SIT consists of 11 officers, including a woman assistant commissioner of police who heads the team, officials said. The case would be tried in a fast-track court according to Hemant Nagrale, commissioner of Mumbai Police. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced that the case will be tried in a fast-track court. Pressure had been mounting from various quarters, including from the opposition, to ensure that strictest action is taken in the case and the accused is tried and convicted at the earliest. The police, however, did not disclose the need to set up the SIT. The woman who was raped and brutalised with an iron rod in Mumbai died while undergoing treatment at a hospital early on Saturday, police said. According to the police, the control room received a phone call at 3.20am on Friday, informing them about an injured couple in Sakinaka. On reaching the spot, the police found a woman, who was bleeding profusely, inside a parked tempo. Police arrested a 45-year-old pavement dweller in connection with the crime on Friday itself after he was spotted exiting the tempo in CCTV footage, officials familiar with the matter said. He was remanded in police custody till September 21. He was booked under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape), 323 (assault) and 34 (common intention). The police said they were yet to ascertain the motive behind the crime as the victim had succumbed to her injuries on Saturday morning and her statement could not be recorded. The police had rushed the woman to Rajawadi Hospital in the same tempo. At the hospital, the woman was admitted into the intensive care unit, where she battled for life for almost 33 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sit-to-handle-probe-in-sakinaka-rape-murder-case-101631456422106.html

He was the brother of Manpreet Kaur (13), who had died on the spot. Gurpreet was admitted to Government Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, with serious injuries on Saturday and breathed his last late at night. The high-intensity blast had occurred at an illegal firecracker store in Rajpura’s Sant Nagar, demolishing the building into rubble and leaving several houses in the vicinity with cracks on the walls. Meanwhile, police are yet to take any criminal action against the owner of the house as the raw material used for manufacturing firecrackers was stacked illegally. Rajpura SHO Gurpartap Singh said a team has been constituted to carry out investigations into the matter. “The case will be registered once the inquiry is done. The statements have been recorded,” he said. Past incidents December 18, 2017 A Rajpura resident, Sanjay Kumar, was killed when a truck loaded with firecrackers exploded at Sorgir Basti in Mirch Mandi area.

The project was conceived at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) conference held at Lahore in 2013. After HT had highlighted the forgotten project in May this year, social worker Naresh Johar had sought information from the Union health ministry under RTI. The ministry referred this plea to the MEA, which has replied, “As per information with this division, no such proposal is under consideration of the government within the SAARC framework.”Amritsar was chosen for this hospital in view of its location, its international airport, hotel industry and religious tourism. It was also decided that renowned medicos from SAARC countries will offer their services at this hospital. The project, now, is dead, even as the Punjab government and SAARC officials had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) eight years ago. Since then, the state government has failed to follow it up. “The Central government is responsible for the failure of this project, and the state government has not pursued this up. This will have been a milestone in the development of medical tourism in the holy city. All city MLAs, including Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, are from the ruling party in Punjab. They failed to ensure the establishment of this already sanctioned project,” Johar added. In 2016, Amritsar Vikas Manch, a city-based NGO, had raised the issue with the then Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan through an RTI. The ministry stated that the matter was under the consideration of the Punjab government, but state government officials feigned ignorance.A tentative site for the SAARC hospital was chosen on the premises of an abandoned community health centre building in Verka locality; the state government is yet to allot a site. The proposed site for the hospital is situated in Amritsar East assembly segment that Sidhu represents. When his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu represented this segment, she said the file was on the table of the then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/8-years-after-it-was-mooted-centre-says-no-saarc-hospital-in-amritsar-in-the-works-101631453121817.html

Speaking at the inauguration event, Kejriwal said that the street food joints will be allowed till midnight in a bid to transform the market into a major tourist hub.“It has already become an important tourist place. I came to know that people come here to roam till 12 am,” the Delhi chief minister said. "Street food joints will be allowed to open for 3-4 more hours till 12 am so that people can come here in the night and enjoy. Lots of street food joints will be opened after closure of the market," he announced.Kejriwal told a gathering near Fountain Chowk that Chandni Chowk used to have cracked roads, traffic jams and loose wires but has now become beautiful and aesthetically appealing."We have beautified almost 1.4 km stretch of the Chandni Chowk market and made it extremely beautiful. Traffic on the stretch was improved, dangling wires were made underground, CCTVs were installed under the redevelopment project,” he said.The main stretch between Chandani Chowk and the Red Fort has been improved, including pedestrian-friendly corridors. It has been made aesthetically appealing with the help of red granite stone, decorative lights and plants and street furniture, reported PTI. Motorised vehicles won’t be allowed on the stretch between 9am-9pm since it has been made a “no traffic zone.”The project witnessed several delays due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The redevelopment project was approved in August 2018 and was scheduled to be completed in March 2020 but, according to PWD officials, the pandemic forced the delay.

Advanced surveillance measures already in place in all border districts. People coming from Kerala will be under surveillance,” Karnataka health commissioner KV Trilok Chandra was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.On September 7, the Karnataka government had directed administrations of districts bordering Kerala to strengthen surveillance and preparedness after the first confirmed case of Nipah virus was reported in the state.Officials were asked to monitor arrivals from Kerala for any symptoms like fever, altered mental status, severe weakness, headache, respiratory distress, cough, vomiting, muscle pain, convulsion and diarrhea -- all signs of a Nipah virus infection.Also Read: 68 primary contacts free of Nipah virus as 7 more samples turn negative: Kerala health minister Veena George“Regarding Nipah virus, I have given directions to the health secretary and experts.

Sugarcane is mainly grown in western UP, which is the hotbed of the UP farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three farm laws.Referring to the farming community’s alleged economic distress, the BJP MP pitched for a ₹200 per quintal bonus for farmers who grow wheat and rice apart from giving them seeds at cheaper rates and at least ₹20 per litre subsidy in diesel prices.He also demanded the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme to be doubled to ₹12,000 per annum for farmers with the state government contributing ₹6,000 from its funds.This is not the first time when Gandhi has raised issues related to the farmers. On September 5, when a large number of farmers gathered for the Muzaffarnagar Mahapanchayat, which was organised by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha against the three farm laws, Gandhi said the government should re-engage with them to reach common ground as they are “our own flesh and blood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-mp-varun-gandhi-writes-to-yogi-to-increase-sugarcane-prices-subsidize-diesel-101631447542708.html
12-09-2021||Pune||Curtain call: The moment all my world was a stage||The play ‘The Kite Runner’ was around the corner. It was set to open on August 31, 2019, at the Jamshed Bhabha Theatre of the National Centre of Performing Arts at Nariman Point, Mumbai. We had our grand rehearsal at the venue for a few days before the actual show, so we were all accustomed to that venue. The play was shaping up nicely. I was acting in it and the director, Akarsh Khurrana, had considered me to be a good fit for the role of the protagonist – Amir. While I was happy to be a part of it, it was also daunting as the protagonist was also the narrator of the play and, without exaggeration, had more than fifty per cent of the total dialogues. That was not all. The play also boasted a stellar cast which included veterans like Akash Khurrana and Kumud Mishra. While it was already a task to memorise so many lines, there was additional pressure to perform with such seasoned actors. Of course, the previous line will be followed by a cliché of how supportive they were, but I can’t help it, because they really were! There were multiple locations in the play, ranging from Amir’s sprawling house in Kabul, his favourite spot with his friend Hassan on top of a hill, the streets of Kabul, an empty oil tanker, a flea market in San Francisco, their home in America, and different locations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. When I read it, I had no idea how the director and the set designer were planning to pull it off. They made a permanent set structure which resembled large rocks and then used smaller, portable set elements to turn them into something else. A large cloth with an Arabic design was also hung on both sides, from the top. It added a certain aesthetic to the overall visual. So a large rock became the hill in Kabul, it was also a terrace café on the streets on Kabul. It became a part of the beach on San Francisco just by adding the sound of waves and sea gulls. A smaller rock became a stall in the flea market when some items were kept on it. It was the same rock that was also a bed when Akash sir slept on it with his robe on. And it just worked. Because the director made us believe that a set element served a particular purpose. And since we believed in it, the audience believed in it too. It also depicted the ruins Kabul was in, in the latter half of the play. Light design by Quasar Thakore Padamsee was another highlight. It would have been easy for any other light designer to make use of multiple colour shades to highlight the serious situations in the play. But Quasar followed the subtlety in the script and with the use of soft, dim, yellow and amber lights he set a visual mood. There were a few scenes which had a bit of humour and romance and the lights were a little brighter then. I couldn’t experience the visuals myself, of course, but I could imagine what it must have looked like. And the audience reactions after the show confirmed that. It was the first play of mine which was so heavily publicised. It was one of the plays curated for ‘Aadyam’, a theatre initiative by the Birla Group. Every year, five full length plays are produced and funded by ‘Aadyam’ and they organise nine shows at venues in Mumbai and New Delhi. Billboards were put up all over Mumbai! Articles were being written. And this just amped up the nervousness. On the day of our first show I remember travelling to the venue in a cab, not looking anywhere else. I couldn’t get myself to look at the multiple messages from friends wishing me good luck. A few of them were on their way from Pune just for the show. All shows had been sold out the moment tickets went online and I had hoped against hope that my friends and family wouldn’t get tickets. They still managed to get them and I had no choice now but to perform in front of them. Just before the third bell, there was a small red light in the wings. I kept looking at that, trying to focus. Akarsh had decided to keep the curtain open from the beginning, making the audience familiar with the set as soon as they entered. The third bell rang and I entered the stage. I started my lines on the music cue and I don’t remember much of what happened for two hours after that. I suppose it went well, because I remember being hugged by my director, friends, family, and a few strangers too. I remember shaking Mr. Birla’s hand. (He came for two more shows after that, one in Delhi. So I can safely say that he liked it.) The next shows were a breeze too, with similar reactions. The shows of this production were on hold till we got the schedule of the huge cast in order and then the pandemic struck, making the possibility of future shows bleaker. While I would love for more and more people to see this, I cannot emphasise enough the wonders it has done to my confidence as an actor and as a person. It will remain one of the most important plays of my life. Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-the-moment-all-my-world-was-a-stage-101631447481592.html
12-09-2021||Pune||Your space: Reopening of schools with fully vaccinated staff||Even as all teaching and non-teaching staff of civic schools are fully vaccinated, the vax count at private schools in the city is a poor 50 per cent. With authorities planning to reopen schools, readers suggest steps that should be taken to ensure all staff at private schools are fully vaccinated Reopen schools only for fully vaccinated staff Public schools lead their private counterparts in terms of Covid-19 inoculation among teaching and non-teaching staff members, data from Pune district administration shows. There are 56,189 intended beneficiaries from the public and private schools which includes teaching and non-teaching staff members. In public schools, there are 22,125 teachers and 6,476 non-teaching staff members who have been identified by the administration for vaccination. In private schools, there are 22,406 teachers and 5,181 non-teaching staff members who are being targeted for fast-track vaccination. However, vaccination is moving at a slow pace and schools must not be allowed to reopen as it can prove dangerous for kids. Dr Sameer Rajvanshi Govt took decision on an impulse Parent groups have been actively opposing the idea of physical classes, where Covid-19 numbers are still being recorded. Even if schools divide their batches into smaller groups and spread them across different classrooms, how will the teacher manage to teach all students? Before announcing a blanket decision, the state government should first try pilot batches and understand how physical schools could pose difficulties to schools as well as students. Who will be responsible if one or more students contract the virus? The state government has taken the decision on an impulse without even discussing the same with school-heads. Manoj Salunke With vax count low, do not resume offline school in hurry As the state is poised to take a decision in the next few days on reopening schools in the state, the government has stressed vaccinating teachers and non-teaching staff must be prioritised among other things. Bachchu Kadu, Maharashtra minister of state for school education, has said that the decision on reopening schools would be taken in the next few days. Schools have restarted in other states of the country and should be resumed in the state as well. But the decision will have to be taken carefully considering the fact that Maharashtra has the highest number of active cases after Kerala. Physical classes in schools were shut in Maharashtra in March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the state. Schools in rural areas were allowed to resume physical classes for Class 8 to 12 students on July 12, but only in areas where Covid-19 cases are minimal. The rate of vaccination is very slow, so there should not be any hurry in reopening of the school. Manohar Kulkarni Reopen schools under Covid norms The health task force has discussed the plan with the state school education department officials to reopen schools in the state and wants to ensure schools are fully prepared and physical classes will not lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases. We also want the schools to be reopened but with certain precautions as we are concerned about their health. Children are definitely suffering from mental health issues and nutrition and thus schools should be reopened but in a safe environment. Currently vaccination of teachers and non-teaching staff is going on so the schools must reopen from next June. The task force has recommended that teaching and non-teaching staff of schools should be vaccinated and there must be proper seating arrangements in classes and one bench should be reserved for one student only. If possible, schools with online teaching infrastructure can simultaneously hold physical as well as online classes. Students can attend in-person classes by rotation. Classes must be sanitised and there must be a monitoring system in place in all schools. The school staff should also be trained to deal in case of a medical emergency Ranjana Girase Reopen schools after parents’ consent Schools should divide students into two batches and they should be called for physical classes on alternate days. Sports activities, which require close contact, should be avoided. Schools can also be started in a staggered manner by allowing some classes now and increasing them later based on the situation and if in case any Covid case is reported they can be stopped immediately. Dr Bakul Parekh, a member of the paediatric task force, said vehicles ferrying schoolchildren should not have closed windows and they should have sufficient ventilation. The government has suggested the school administration hold parent-teacher meetings before reopening schools. At these meetings, parents should be apprised about precautions schools will be taking for the safety of students. Kamal Dhore Many teachers got the jab as frontline workers It would take more than a few months to get all teachers and non-teaching staff vaccinated. The central government had set September 5 as the deadline to get teachers and non-teaching staff vaccinated, but that has not happened. A sizable number of teachers in the city has already gained from the priority vaccination in the frontline workers’ category during the initial roll-out of the immunisation programme. Teachers were deployed for contact tracing work and other field duties along with health workers to contain the spread of the virus. Hence, most have got their first dose under the frontline workers category. So, we don’t see there is any further problem in reopening of schools.

Besides, there are at least 12 private libraries in the district. “We are preparing for competitive examinations so that we can take jobs at the earliest,” Amit Kumar Mandal, who passed the intermediate examination this year, said “Our first priority is to get a government job and till yesterday it seemed to be impossible in the village, but ever since the library has started functioning, we have become hopeful about our career.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-purnia-district-set-to-become-a-bibliophile-s-haven-101631441540884.html

The PM also sent him a long message expressing his respect for senior Paswan’s contributions to politics and it came at a time when Chirag was locked in an internal feud with his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras for Ram Vilas Paswan’s legacy by retaining control of the party he had founded.Describing late Ram Vilas Paswan as a “great son of the nation, Bihar’s pride and a strong voice for social justice”, PM said Paswan’s life can teach a lot to young aspiring politicians.“For the youth who want to go into politics or serve the nation through politics, Ram Vilas Paswan’s life can teach them a lot. Despite reaching the top of politics, he always remained connected with his workers. He always relied on communication and cordiality and that was the reason he maintained good relations with all leaders, irrespective of political parties, and maintained a ubiquitous smile on his face. He was a man of the masses,” Modi’s message said.Chirag posted the letter on his Twitter handle and wrote that it gave him and his family strength. “You have epitomised my father’s entire life in your words to honour his contributions to the society and demonstrated your love for him. May the affection and blessings always remain like this,” he wrote.The exchange is significant because of speculations that Chirag’s faction of the LJP could consider joining hands with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) ahead of the by polls for two seats in Bihar, both of which were earlier with the JD-U, the ruling party Chirag aimed to oust from power in 2020 assembly elections but failed. Chirag has been isolated within the NDA after his uncle split the party faulting his election strategy to attack NDA constituent JD-U, which led to LJP winning just one seat and spoiling JD-U’s chances of victory on multiple seats due to suspected division of votes. Ally Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) alleged role in Chirag’s sidelining in the LJP had also led to perception of tensions between the two. However, the PM’s message seemed to have warmed up Chirag’s heart.“He will always have his own place in the history of independent India and how he reached the pinnacle from a modest background and remained firmly attached to his roots. Whenever he met me, he always talked about his experience about the welfare of deprived sections. He stepped into politics in the 1960s, when the political scenario in the country was completely different and there was predominately just one ideology in the country. Yet, he chose a different path for him and surprised everyone by winning the Lok Sabha election in 1977,” the PM said, describing Paswan’s first death anniversary as an emotional day for him since he not only remembered him as a close friend but also felt the void he had left in Indian politics.The PM wrote that Paswan always tried to give positive direction to whatever responsibilities he shouldered as Union minister of railways, telecom, chemical and fertilisers and other departments in his long political life. “In the six years as a minister in the NDA government, he took many effective steps in the field of consumer rights and public distribution system,” PM added.On Saturday evening, former Bihar deputy chief minister and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi also demanded that a statue of Ram Vilas Paswan should be installed in Patna in view of his enormous contributions to Bihar’s development and national politics. “There should be a state function on his birth anniversary. He always struggled for the cause of Dalits,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chirags-heart-warms-up-with-pm-modi-s-message-on-paswan-s-death-anniversary-101631425519114.html

This was the third protest under the ‘Freedom From Pollution’ movement. The protesters, under the banner of the Public Action Committee (PAC), asked why crores were being spent on establishing effluent treatment plants (ETPs) for treating dairy waste, when the MC has to shift the dairy units sooner or later.PAC member Col CM Lakhanpal said, “A significant amount of pollutants entering the nullah are from dairy units. As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines, no dairy unit is allowed to operate within city limits. Secondly, dairy farms cannot be located in flood prone areas and cannot be within 500m of a river. The dairy complexes on Tajpur Road and Haibowal are in violation of these norms. The government will have to shift these units out of the city limits.” Jaskirat Singh of the Naroa Punjab Manch said, “Senior officials working on the project to clean the nullah have clearly said that the problem cannot be resolved until dairy units are shifted. The government had also agreed to shift the units, but now ETPs are being established on the site under the ₹650-crore project to clean the nullah. If the government has to ultimately shift the units, then why is public money being wasted?” Dr Amandeep Bains of RBS Roots said no environmental scientist had been involved in the project to clean the nullah, which indicates the authorities’ sincerity.Kuldeep Singh Khaira of Vigilant Citizens Forum said, “The government seems to be taking decisions based on political calculations rather than for the welfare of the city. Instead of solving the problem, it is complicating things by taking contradictory decisions such as shifting dairies and building ETPs at the same time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngos-protest-amid-rain-in-ludhiana-say-shift-dairy-units-rather-than-setting-up-etps-101631397252983.html
12-09-2021||Mumbai||Woman raped, brutalised in Mumbai succumbs||A 32-year-old woman who was raped and brutalised with an iron rod in Mumbai died while undergoing treatment at a hospital in the wee hours of Saturday, police said.According to Mumbai deputy commissioner Maheshwar Reddy, the police control room received a phone call at 3.20am on Friday, informing them about an injured couple in the city’s Sakinaka area. On reaching the spot, the police found a woman, who was bleeding profusely, inside a parked tempo.“The police officers drove the tempo [in which the woman was found] and rushed her to the Rajawadi Hospital,” Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said.Police arrested a 45-year-old pavement dweller in connection with the crime on Friday itself, after he was spotted exiting the tempo in CCTV footage, officials familiar with the matter said. He was remanded to police custody till September 21. He has been booked under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape), 323 (assault) and 34 (common intention).Police said they were yet to ascertain the motive behind the crime.“As the victim was unconscious, her statement could not be recorded. Therefore, police are as yet clueless about what exactly happened. But it will be ascertained during the investigation, Nagrale said.The crime bore resemblance to the December 16, 2012 Delhi gang rape case, in which a woman was assaulted and brutalized in a moving bus. She died about two weeks later in a hospital in Singapore where she was taken for emergency treatment. The incident outraged the entire nation and triggered street protests and candlelight vigils across the country, eventually leading to tougher punishment for crimes against women.Six suspects were arrested for the crime, one of whom was alleged to have committed suicide in jail. Another, a juvenile, was convicted of rape and murder and given the maximum sentence of three years imprisonment in a reform facility under the Juvenile Justice Act. The other four were hanged to death in March, 2020.Calling the Sakinaka incident, a “blot on humanity”, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said in a statement: “The rape and subsequent death of a woman in the Sakinaka area is an act of disgrace to humanity and the perpetrator will be severely punished. In this regard, I have also spoken to the home minister of the state. The trial in the case will be held on a fast track and the victim will get justice,” he said in a statement.Leader of Opposition in the state Devendra Fadnavis demanded capital punishment for the guilty. “I know that awarding a sentence is in the hands of the judiciary. But I feel the culprit in the Sakinaka rape should be hanged to death,” the BJP leader said.Fadnavis also questioned the state government over what he called an increase in crimes against women. “If we look at the record of a month, the cases of rapes and gang rapes are increasing in the state, the state government need to take action now,” he added.When asked as to how the crime occurred while there was heavy police bandobast due to the Ganesh Chaturthi festival, Nagrale responded stating that it was not possible to be present everywhere at all times. He however claimed that as soon as the crime was reported a police team reached the spot within ten minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/woman-raped-brutalised-in-mumbai-succumbs-101631391179444.html

12-09-2021||Chandigarh||Finally, Ludhiana fire department gets new tenders, gadget upgrade||After a long wait, the under-equipped fire department in the industrial hub has been contemporised and stocked with hi-tech gadgets and four new fire tenders, which will help minimise destruction and streamline rescue operations. The modernised fire brigade now has thermal imaging cameras, life detectors, inflatable lighting towers, battery operated cutters, and aluminium fire safety suits among other hi-tech gadgets in its arsenal.On Saturday, Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and mayor Balkar Sandhu dedicated the advanced firefighting and rescue equipment purchased under the Smart City Mission to the fire brigade at its headquarters near the railway station. The Congress leaders said that four mini-fire tenders with water and foam tanks, which had been purchased for ₹88.64 lakh, had been provided to the fire brigade to douse flames in narrow streets in the Old City areas.  To improve the chances of survival for those buried under debris during a blaze, three life detectors worth ₹66.02 lakh have been provided to the fire department, Ashu said, adding that the ₹69.5 lakh combi tools will also help save time and improve efficiency during rescue operations. The tools can cut through iron and steel rods easily. Five thermal imaging cameras, which cost ₹41.79 lakh, will help to firefighters see through smoke and monitor the spread of fire. Besides, five aluminium firefighting suits worth ₹51 lakh have also been purchased for firemen so that they may safely enter burning buildings and douse the flames from inside.  Five portable inflatable emergency lights have also been bought for ₹11.74 lakh, said Ashu, while adding that the lights are based on a petrol engine system. Lights are required during a fire incident as the power supply of the area is snapped after a fire breaks out. Ashu said, “More equipment will be purchased for the department. We are actively monitoring smart city projects and our ranking has improved from the 54 to 37 in terms of projects proposed and completed under the mission.” The local bodies department has also provided two bullet motorcycles equipped with water mist extinguishers for quick response. Shortage of firefighters Meanwhile, the fire brigade officials say they are understaffed and have asked the state government and municipal corporation to fill the vacant posts and sanction more posts for fire fighters in the industrial hub. A firefighter, requesting anonymity, they were facing an acute staff shortage. “Against 15 sanctioned posts of sub-fire officers, only five posts have been filled, and there is only one permanent fire station officer (FSO) against five sanctioned posts. Similarly, the department only has nine permanent firefighters against 86 sanctioned posts, while 50 have been deployed on contractual basis.” The permanent posts have not been filled in over two decades. Making do with limited resources Firefighters have been facing a tough time dousing flames without proper fire safety equipment. The resourceful firefighters have been making do with what they had. They have been using a dampened cloth to cover their faces while entering smoke-filled buildings and have used headlights for illumination during rescue operations at night. Fire safety suits were not available at all, which endangered due to which made the team vulnerable to burns. The fire brigade does not have a hydraulic ladder, a proposal for which was made around 15 years ago. After 16 people, including nine firefighters died in the ‘plastic factory tragedy’ in 2017, the fire fighters had demanded that the ladder be made available. MC officials said that a hydraulic ladder is also being purchased under the smart city mission. They have also demanded more fire stations in the industrial hub.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/finally-ludhiana-fire-department-gets-new-tenders-gadget-upgrade-101631395990436.html

12-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Cop, home guard held for siphoning off ₹1 crore||A Chandigarh Police personnel and a home guard volunteer have been arrested in the ₹1.1 crore salary scam that had rocked the police department in 2019. The cop, Balwinder Singh, a junior assistant with the UT Police, was the in-charge of the salary branch back then, with Surjit Singh, a home guard volunteer, also posted there. “ ₹1.1 crore were siphoned off by the two accused and transferred to the accounts of various police personnel. An audit pointed out 161 such accounts that received extra salary through fraudulent means,” said superintendent of police (SP, Crime) Manoj Kumar Meena.“The surplus amount has been recovered and more arrests are likely,” the police official added. Anonymous complaint exposed scam It was an anonymous complaint that blew the lid off of the scam. The complaint spurred the checking of salaries of the police personnel for December 2019 and excess deposits were discovered in 35 such accounts. Following the revelation, a case was registered under Sections 420, 468, 471 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 13(1)(b) & 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act on February 25, 2020.The crime branch constituted a special investigation team (SIT), and a special audit for 2015 to 2020 was conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on the request of the police department. The audit was completed and submitted around 10 days back, pointing out excess payments amounting to ₹1.1 crore. The two accused were nabbed on Saturday and produced before a court. Balwinder was remanded to three-day custody and Surjit to one day. Modus operandi Investigation revealed that Balwinder Kumar, the then in-charge of the A4 Branch, dealt with the salaries of constables and head constables of Chandigarh Police. Surjit Singh was attached with the branch as an assistant. The accused would deposit excess salary in the accounts of police personnel under fake entries of conveyance and food allowances, among others. After depositing the amount, Surjit would act as the conduit to recover most of it from the account holder through a prior understanding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-cop-home-guard-held-for-siphoning-off-1-crore-101631394429764.html

12-09-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | The mysterious, elegant water shrew||Most of us have had unpleasant encounters with the house shrew or ‘chhuchhundar’ / ‘gheece’ as it is known in the vernacular. The creature creeps into rooms after dusk and steals along the sides of the walls, as if trying to muster enough courage to venture into the middle but never managing to do so. It secretes a musky odour from its glands, which is repugnant to human nostrils. Especially so, on cold winter nights when ceiling fans are stilled, and flatulence and shrew odours take long to dissipate.Fact is, the shrew for all its odours and ‘repulsive’ looks rids houses of cockroaches and keeps rats at bay. If most of us are ignorant about the shrew’s role as a pest controller existing right under our noses, its remote cousin species, the elegant water shrew (Nectogale elegans), would but naturally attract the tag of complete mystery! Highly adapted to a life in mountain currents, the very elusive elegant shrew has defied popular human awareness as it is seldom clicked by cameras and very rarely gets trapped in fishing nets. An intrepid field researcher, Aashna Sharma – an alum of Panjab University’s zoology department who has studied fishes at Harike Wildlife sanctuary — stumbled upon the elegant shrew while she was assessing the effect of climate change on the snow trout in the pristine Uttarakhand wilderness. Currently employed as a Senior Research Fellow at the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, Sharma could not believe such a creature existed till her local fisherman enlightened her! “Often, Nature and its creatures are better known by local people who have spent their lives in the neighbouring wilderness. When my fisherman, Suman, told me about the ‘paani ka chooha’, I doubted him. I had never heard of rodents that dwelt in water! But Suman was sure about his observation and asked me to wait, and be patient. He simply said, ‘Niklega fir se’. I waited, staring at the small pool on the Jamak stream, even as Suman nonchalantly enjoyed a cigarette. Suman told me that throughout his life (he was nearly 56 years old then), he had seen this ‘chooha’ just six times! Lo and behold…there it was again. I saw a greyish-black shrew swim past a small boulder, capture a snow trout fingerling, and make its way across the pool to take shelter under another small boulder,” Sharma told this writer.An excited Sharma quickly ascended a nearby mountain peak to secure signals on her cellphone. She Googled for a water rodent. Yes, Suman was right. There were 13 species of water shrews worldwide of which two, the elegant water shrew and Himalayan water shrew, are found in India. Prior to Sharma’s chance sighting in Uttarakhand, previous records showed the elegant occurring only in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. Sharma went on to co-author a research paper on the elegant shrews’ occurrence in the western Himalayas, which was published in the ‘Journal of Threatened Taxa’.“The elegant shrews are aptly named. The way they swim and vanish in a glimpse is astoundingly beautiful and elegant. Unlike other water shrews, they have a fin-like tail with fringed hair to enhance mobility and navigation across a water channel. Of the 13 species of water shrews, the elegant shrew is the only one to possess webbed feet with flaps of skin folds connecting their digits, just like ducks. Highly adapted to aquatic habitats, the elegant shrew employs an efficient strategy of swimming upstream against the current, capturing prey and then drifting downstream with the same current. On the other hand, the Himalayan shrew is a good diver but cannot stay in water for such long stretches, and does not capture prey and then drift downstream. It swims about in the same area for some time before moving towards the shore, where it spends part of its time. The elegant shrew uses the shore only to reach its burrow in the banks as its preferred mode of mobility is water streams. It has a limited capacity to forage and spend time on land,” added Sharma. Eager to catch an elegant water shrew specimen for further studies, Sharma set up rodent traps along the banks as she was unable to detect their secretive burrows. “I did this for a week and monitored those traps morning and evening. But not one fell for the traps. I guess they are cleverer than we humans are! After all, they have existed on Earth before we came in!’’ said Sharma.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-the-mysterious-elegant-water-shrew-101631393470963.html
12-09-2021||Chandigarh||Random Forays | Writers must overcome blocks and inertia||Am writing this on the road and wondering whether physical speed breakers and potholes are as impactful towards the degeneration of a vehicle as those of the mind are to a human being’s journey.Obstacles created by moods and mind-made “dangals” are perhaps a writer’s greatest foes too. Anyone who is truly comfortable with a language and blessed with a certain amount of imagination can be a writer, in my view. The harder part is to actually get down to writing as a regular activity and also to conjure up something meaningfully palatable to the reader.Many talented and even accomplished writers hesitate and dither for years before publishing anything. I have, of late, been advocating to many friends the need for them to take the plunge and sit down at their keyboards for six months with regularity. A book will then surely emerge from their efforts at dabbling into creative writing. The “writer’s block” is actually a figment of our imagination, in my opinion. The author who coined this term was clearly suffering from it himself else he would have come up with something less insipid! Perhaps “writer’s lethargy” or “writer’s inertia” may be a more apt description of what we go through when we just don’t feel like writing anything.Ruskin Bond was in his element when my family called on him some years ago at his cute little Mussoorie cottage. He spoke about how he really felt in the groove at certain times and not so much on other occasions when he sat down to write. But he did add that he felt extremely grumpy on the day when he had written nothing at all.For young and aspirational writers, I think there is an insightful message embedded in his words. Whether one feels like it or not, it is a great idea to write consistently in order to produce something of substance. On some days one may not be in the flow and that tingling excitement of trying to write something stupendous may be missing. But one can always edit and improve such uninspired writings on another day. That’s the way it truly works.Lata Mangeshkar or Sachin Tendulkar, peerless maestros of their arts, obviously had their off days. But they doubtlessly went about their tasks diligently none the less. And the overall results were joys to behold.I know a writer from Punjab who wakes up frightfully early, at 4 am, every single day to write, come what may. And of course there must be occasions when the heart is just not into it but that does not dissuade the prolific writer from delivering time after time.One of the ways to look at this philosophy is to compare the drudgery of writing when one does not feel like it, with an athlete or musician who practices endlessly before a top performance. Authors cannot expect to churn out magnificent masterpieces every day. They must go through the toil of writing, editing and reviewing repeatedly. As Ernest Hemingway said, “There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.”.All in all, when one is determined to write, one can do so on all days. And when the mind’s tide is favourable one can make hay and write better. It is a bit like trying to hit a double century when the going is good for a batsman, and somehow cobbling up a fifty on other days.Purdue University’s Online Writing Laboratory advises writers who face the block to try beginning in the middle, if they are not feeling inspired enough to pen down an inspiring opening to their work, for instance. By changing the approach, by altering the plan, by being flexible to the extent that one can indulge in some editing on the day when writing seems to be a chore, an author can finally come up trumps.The written word is not popular these days, such are our hype-energy times. If more people were to spend time reading and writing, the whole world would calm down. Perhaps!I do agree that outstanding writers are a rare commodity, but why aren’t the hundreds of good ones spending more time with the world of words? Our world needs them!vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-writers-must-overcome-blocks-and-inertia-101631393050356.html

A Punjab and Haryana High Court lawyer has alleged that the official installed interlocking tiles on a private pathway at Salina village from department funds. The deputy secretary of the central ministry directed the financial commissioner of state department to submit an action taken report in two weeks after a probe. The lawyer, HS Hundal, said, “An official forced the panchayat to install interlocking tiles on the private pathway. It was found that Sumit Kumar, IT manager posted at the ADC’s office directed the panchayat to do this. The pathway leads to a memorial of his ancestors.” “I have already apprised the ADC (development) about the misuse of funds,” he added ADC (development) Subash Chander, said, “I am aware of the matter and the head office summoned the IT manager in this regard. But I am yet to receive anything in written.” Sumit Kumar said, “I have not received any written communication in this regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-asks-punjab-rural-development-department-to-probe-misuse-of-funds-by-employee-in-moga-101631391969108.html
12-09-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | A diplomatic reprimand||Recently, an ill-informed utterance by a school teacher-turned-activist-turned-adviser to a freshly appointed state political party chief invited widespread ire. The acrimonious statement on the status of Jammu and Kashmir has now resulted in his ouster from the job. A similar faux pass took place while we were attending a staff course at the Defence Services Staff College(DSSC), Wellington, in 1993-94. The salubrious weather at the Nilgiris and an audience of the so-called creamy layer of the armed forces, not just ours but world over, attracted numerous guest speakers and delegations to address the wise-owl (crest of the DSSC, Wellington) gathering. A team of the prestigious United States Command And General Staff College (CGSC) was also in town to deliver a presentation and talk to students and faculty. The arrival of the DSSC Commandant Lt Gen BS Nalwa was announced and the packed auditorium was in rapt attention to the potential words of wisdom from the high-profile CGSC team . After mandatory introductions , the American team leader flashed the opening slide to commence his presentation. A map of India came up on the slide, which evinced least attention , being our own and sacrosanct. Immediately, we saw the Commandant signal the head of training team(HOTT). After a whispered exchange, Gen Nalwa left the auditorium. The HOTT went up the dais and after a quick word with the US team leader, announced an early tea break due to an impromptu commitment of the Commandant. Tea breaks hold special significance during the guest talks. The famous bakery at the staff college bakes out choicest cakes, pastries, patties and buns, these coupled with the sumptuous samosas and mouth watering jalebis from the bania canteen make it more enticing than the talks at times. Thus, it was a welcome break. However, we did not have the foggiest as to why the God-send break had been declared prematurely. The audience re-assembled after the 20 minute treat. After settling down, Gen Nalwa addressed the team leader, “Colonel general, my apologies for the unscheduled delay, please commence your presentation.” The map of India flashed again and the talk progressed thereafter. After the talk the guest speakers left and the rest were asked to remain seated. The HOTT came on the stage and said, “Lady (for we really had one lady, Mahua Pal from the Defence audit accounts service as one of the course students)and gentlemen, to some of you it must have seemed like an abrupt and strange disruption. Well, the map flashed by CGSC team at the beginning of the talk showed Jammu and Kashmir as part of the Pakistan- Occupied Kashmir(POK). The Commandant noticed it in a flash, and assumed that it was a draftsman’s mistake. The team was politely asked to amend the map before proceeding with the talk. Thus, the delay”. To end the day on a lighter note as was customary during most guest lectures , he asked an open question as to what one-liner could best describe the situation? The ever alert Major Kumar, popularly called keen Kumar by fellow students, shot his hand up in a jiffy. “Sir, it may be appropriately termed, ‘A diplomatic reprimand!’” he quipped. He was of course spot on. avnishrms59@gmail.com (The writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-a-diplomatic-reprimand-101631391672148.html

The police said the five men were working at the behest of two jailed criminals —Narinder Singh, alias Nindi and Rajinder Singh, alias Ganja who are lodged in the Faridkot and Amritsar jails. The arrested accused have already sent ₹20 lakh from the heroin proceeds. “A team of the crime investigation agency (CIA) intercepted a vehicle at a checkpoint at the Vallah bypass after getting a tip-off. Harbhej, Lovepreet, Jugal and Vishal are already facing several criminal cases, including that of murder, attempt to murder and drug peddling. They are linked to Nindi and Ganja,” said Amritsar police commissioner Vikram Jeet Duggal during a press conference. A case was registered under the sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and the Arms Act against the accused at the Makboolpura police station. Deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar said Nindi has been into drug smuggling for a long time. “Both Nindi and Ganja will be brought on production warrant to find out where the heroin was being smuggled from.”Another police official said, “The arrested men were supplying the heroin at ₹25 lakh per kg. We are also working to nab those whom they were supplying the contraband.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drug-racket-being-run-from-2-punjab-jails-busted-5-held-with-1-5-kg-heroin-in-amritsar-101631391669564.html
12-09-2021||Chandigarh||BJP, Youth Congress workers clash in Ludhiana, 14 injured||Workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Youth Congress entered into a violent clash in Ludhiana city on Saturday after a protest against the central government over rising inflation, leaving at least 14 persons injured. The clash involving the use of sticks, exchange of fists and pelting of stones took place outside the saffron party’s office near Clock Tower. The police used mild force to disperse the workers of both parties. A heavy police force was deployed in the area to avoid further clashes.Of those taken to hospital for treatment, 10 were from the saffron party while four belonged to the Youth Congress, officials said. The incident took place when Youth Congress workers led by their district president Yogesh Handa staged a protest outside the BJP office against rise in prices of essential commodities. Since they were planning to put a lock on the BJP office, the volunteers belonging to the saffron party started gathering there. The protesters broke through the barricades put up by the police to reach the BJP office, entering into a scuffle with the rival activists.Later, the BJP workers staged a protest, accusing their Youth Congress counterparts of assault and indulging in hooliganism.The clash occurred two days after the BJP workers put a lock on the gate of the Ludhiana Improvement Trust, alleging a land scam. Later in the evening, the police lodged an FIR under section 160 (committing affray) of the Indian Penal Code against unidentified persons.BJP state president Ashwani Sharma, who was in the city to attend a function, visited the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) to meet the injured party workers. “The Congress leadership is frustrated as our party has unearthed a land scam. State food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and other Congress leaders wanted to grab government land through a fake auction that was cancelled after the scam came to the fore.”It was the Congress workers who started pelting of stones at the BJP workers, he alleged. “There is no law and order in Punjab and the Congress leaders are trying to suppress the voice of people. As many as 10 of our party workers suffered severe injuries in the clash. Navin Saini, a party worker, suffered injuries on his eye and he may lose his vision. Our mandal president Yashpal Sharma also sustained head injury,” Sharma added.He demanded action against the Congress workers, saying they should be booked on charges of attempt to murder on the BJP workers. “We will start a protest if no action is taken,” he warned. Parminder Mehta, a Congress leader, alleged the BJP workers threw stones at their volunteers from the office building when the latter staging a protest. Additional deputy commissioner of police (city 1) Pragya Jain said the police have lodged an FIR against unidentified men for the clash. “We are trying to identify the accused and will later name them in the FIR,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-youth-congress-workers-clash-in-ludhiana-14-injured-101631391370928.html
12-09-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout | Long live the anthem writer of women’s movement||Think of feminist activist Kamla Bhasin and you will immediately recall the peppy folk number ‘Kut kut bajra main kothe utte paani haan,’ which was made popular by the musical sisters, Prakash Kaur and Surinder Kaur, and was a crowd favourite at Punjabi weddings of yore. The song, which is about crows that make a mess of the beaten grain drying on the terraces and querulous husbands, was rewritten by Bhasin as a siren call for women to break all shackles and build a new world: “Todh todh ke bandhanon ko dekho behane aati hai…Ayengi zulm mitaeingi…Yeh to naya zamana laayengi!”Bhasin, who emerged as one of the most charismatic and prominent leaders of the women’s movement in India and other south Asian countries in the 1970s, always held that feminism is not a war between men and women but a war between ideologies: “One that elevates men and gives them power, and the other, that advocates for equality!” she has said. Her achievements as a social scientist, author, a developmental professional and south Asia coordinator of the One Billion Rising Of Women are many. She has worked with underprivileged women from tribal and working classes with a strong belief in feminist theory and community action. Active with Jagori Women’s Resource Centre and other women’s groups in neighbouring countries, she resigned from her job with the United Nations as the south Asian coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in 2002, and founded Sangat, which reaches out to women in communities with low literacy rates, with songs, plays and other non-literary methods.A phenomenal and innovative organiser, it was a standing ovation for Bhasin as she delivered her lecture at the Beijing Women’s Conference in 1995. Her substantial oeuvre includes Feminism and Its Relevance in South Asia, Borders and Boundaries: Women in India’s Partition and Understanding Gender.Knowing Midnight’s daughterShe refers to herself as the ‘midnight generation’, born as she was in 1946, a year before the Partition. Her father was a doctor and she was the fourth of six siblings. She was born in Shahidanwaali village in Gujrat district of Punjab, now in Pakistan. Her ties across the barbed wire remained strong and it was she who brought the ‘Azadi’ chant to India, which was not a Kashmir invention chanted by Kanhayia at Jawaharlal Nehru University but a creation of Pakistani feminists in their protest against patriarchy. Bhasin recalls, “ I had learnt the slogan ‘Meri behane maange Azaadi’ from Pakistani feminists and later improvised the words. The words would change many times depending on what we were protesting against, discrimination on the basis of caste, injustice to tribals or violence against women.” An early memory of dancing and chanting to the catchy beat of the “Azaadi” number dates back to 1991, at the Women’s Studies Conference in Kolkata’s Jadavpur University. A vibrant and charismatic Bhasin, in her early forties, chanted it with a little drum in hand and women surrounded her, throwing their fists in the air. My five-year-old daughter, who had accompanied me there once, caught on the song and chanted it throughout her childhood.Trials and tribulations Kamla grew up in Rajasthan and pursued her graduation and postgraduation there. Later, she won a fellowship to study ‘sociology of development’ at the University of Münster in West Germany and returned to work at the Seva Mandir in Rajasthan where she met her husband, the late Baljit Malik. The first setback was when their child Chotu, just a year old then, reacted to a vaccine and was mentally and physically disabled for life. The second blow and the most painful came many decades later after their daughter Meeto died by suicide. She was pursuing her doctorate on the ‘Synchronic Secular Traditions of Pre-Independence Punjab’ at the Oxford University. Yet, Kamla moved on instituting scholarships in her name and doing the work she was committed towards.Song sung trueNow as the hero, for that is what she was to women in struggle, is battling against an advanced stage of liver cancer. She writes to friends on her timeline page on how weak she has become but that does not stop her from doing a 45-minute session with young women inspiring them to struggle and sing one of her many songs like: ‘Poochhenge ham khoob sawal, aa gayi chetna’ (We will ask many questions for now we have awareness) which her feminist comrades had asked her to write in the early 1980s. In spite of her frailty, she has the same zest and sparkle of songs sung true in celebration of life, struggle and even fatality. Cheers! Kamla, you never fail to inspire!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-long-live-the-anthem-writer-of-women-s-movement-101631391310222.html

12-09-2021||Delhi||Intense 3-hour rain spell brings Delhi to a grinding halt yet again||Traffic slowed to a crawl, several commuters were stranded on the roads, power lines were shut, at least seven houses were damaged, and a wall at a Metro station collapsed, as the national capital struggled to deal with an intense spell of rain yet again on Saturday.In what was a rerun of most of the city’s rainy days during the monsoon this year, a sharp three-hour spell of rain spared few parts of the Capital, leaving homes, shops, marketplaces, and commuters to deal with the aftermath of the shower over the rest of the day.Delhi traffic police said that Saturday’s rain resulted in several arterial stretches getting inundated, and underpasses were hit hardest, with many shut throughout the day, exacerbating snarls throughout the city.Also Read| Monsoon likely to withdraw late this year, Met predicts; more rain in storeThe police said underpasses at Azadpur, Dwarka Link Road, Rani Khera and Pul Prahladpur were closed for traffic and vehicles diverted.“Most of the rain was in the morning, but its impact was seen on the roads through the day. Many roads and underpasses had to be barricaded and diversions put in place till the water levels in many areas came to safe levels,” said a senior traffic police official.Moti Bagh crossing, Malviya Nagar, Dwarka Link Road, Dhaula Kuan, Sardar Patel Marg, Uttam Nagar intersection, GT Karnal Road, Mukarba Chowk, Pragati Maidan and Hauz Khas (Outer Ring Road), were among the stretches worst affected on Saturday, said police officers.Senior fire department officials on Saturday said that the control room received three calls reporting people trapped in vehicles that were stuck on waterlogged roads or underpasses.The department rescued at least 59 people, trapped in four separate vehicles, officials said.Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said that around 11.30am, a private bus, carrying 40 passengers, was stuck in the waterlogged Palam Flyover underpass. Passengers were later rescued by two fire tenders and DFS teams.A tempo and a truck were also trapped at Mundka underpass.At least seven house collapses were reported from Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk, Sadar Bazar, Nabi Karim, Burari, Rohini and Mayur Vihar Phase 3 said the fire chief.South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) officials said that a majority of the complaints received on Saturday were from individuals and resident groups reporting water inside their houses or in complexes.“Of the 35 complaints of waterlogging we received till Saturday afternoon, 27 were regarding individual houses or residential societies getting flooded,” a senior SDMC official said.In many areas, residents said the power supply was shut off for several hours, till water was pumped out of the complexes.Discom teams were on high alert to take care of exigencies due to the rain, and even put preventive shutdowns in place in a few areas, officials said. These included parts of Hastsal, Aya Nagar, Uttam Nagar, Bijwasan, Johri Farm, Mahaveer Nagar, Seelampur, Chandi Mahal, Model Town, Vijay Nagar, Mukherjee Nagar, Azadpur Mandi and Peeragarh.Resident groups said the city’s situation during sharp spells of rain highlighted the apathy of the city’s civic agencies.“IIT-Delhi submitted its final report on the city’s Drainage Master Plan in 2018. Why has the implementation process not started even after three years? This could have saved the residents from these regular waterlogging woes,” said BS Vohra, president of Federation of East Delhi RWAs.The rain also led to a portion of a wall at Dwarka Metro station on the Blue Line collapsing.Also Read| Gurugram rain leaves roads waterlogged, commuters stranded“The said Metro gate was closed and regular passenger movement resumed from other gates. No one was hurt,” a senior Delhi Metro official said.State Public Works Department officials said the roads were blocked due to the rainfall, but efforts were made to pump out the water as soon as possible. However, they said this took longer than usual due to the continuous rainfall.Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.Experts stressed that with the climate crisis causing increased episodes of intense rain spells, the city’s authorities need to redraw their plans to tackle flash floods and urban flooding.“Understandably, when it rains over 100mm in a matter of two or three hours, there will be instances of urban flooding. These are impacts of climate change and these episodes will only increase in the future, so we need to prepare,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/intense-3-hour-rain-spell-brings-delhi-to-a-grinding-halt-yet-again-101631388559566.html

It stated that LIT should first decide whether it wants to sell the chunk of land (vacant plot) or establish shop-cum-offices (SCOs) at the site and then auction those. The reserve price should then be decided by the price and rate fixation committee.The LIT authorities have also been directed to refund around ₹14 crore, which was submitted by the highest bidder during the auction held on August 16, which was cancelled later.Earlier on Friday, local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra stated that the auction was cancelled as there were discrepancies in the statements issued by LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam and deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma regarding the reserve price of the land. The decision has not been taken due to allegations of any scam but to clear the facts, he added.The opposition parties had been targeting the Congress cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and LIT over the alleged auction of the said land at a throwaway price. The trust had auctioned off 3.79 acres (16,344 square yards) of prime land for around ₹98.38 crore, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had alleged, claiming that the land was worth approximately ₹350 crore. The controversy had erupted after DC Sharma denied fixing the reserve price ( ₹91.86 crores) of the land, while the chairman stated that the price was fixed by a panel led by DC. On Friday, Ashu had also recommended the cancellation of the auction to the state government.Approval for auction of 22 other propertiesMeanwhile, the local bodies department has approved the proceedings of 22 other properties along with the chunk of land in Model Town Extension, that was auctioned by LIT on August 16. Further, it has been stated that the decision to fix the residential and commercial reserve prices in Gian Singh Rarewala Market at ₹34,000 and ₹46,900 should be taken as per the rules fixed by the department in the past.

With the local bodies department cancelling the auction, the scam has been proved. An FIR should be lodged against the chairman and others involved in the nexus.” SAD district president Ranjit Dhillon reiterated the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/row-over-prime-land-s-sale-in-ludhiana-local-bodies-department-directs-lit-to-refix-reserve-price-101631387468691.html

It has roped in a Pune-based firm for a pilot project to provide preventive health check-up to the residents of Kalyanbigha in Nalanda, chief minister Nitish Kumar’s home district, and to create their electronic medical record, said health officials. The initiative, as part of the national digital health mission, aims to enable people to access digitally their medical records, synced to their health card, after the system has been put in place. The pilot project of eHealthSystems Technologies LLP, initiated on September 1, will provide a set of essential diagnostic services free of cost to all the residents, using the mobile laboratory units and fully automatic laboratory units, said Dr Ambarish Darak, director of eHealthSystems. “We will conduct investigations on 76 parameters, including blood serum, urine and ECG tests, and talk to people to know about their medical case history. The digital health records will be stored on a cloud server system and can be accessed on eHealthSystem mobile application for the mobile users, on a personal health card to non-mobile users and through wrist-band for children,” he added. Subsequently, it can also be integrated with the hospital management information system to access data stored on the central server. The pilot project proposes to offer a central dashboard for the district and health authorities to facilitate better healthcare outcome, said Dr Darak. Besides benefiting patients, who will not be required to carry their previous test reports, doctors’ summary or narrate their medical case history in case of emergency, it will help the government in early tracking and treatment of disease. At the same time, it will help create a database, which the government can use for analytics, identifying disease prevalence, tracking chronic diseases, etc., Dr Darak added. Additionally, in case of emergency, the resident can click the ‘help’ button and immediately send GPS location to five pre-added emergency contacts in the mobile app. They can alternatively, call the local police or ambulance during an emergency. Women can use emergency ‘help’ button in case of any attack or emergency. The mobile app for the eHealthSystem products can be downloaded from Google Play store. “We have already got the permission to execute the project in all 30 districts of Odisha. We hope to complete our pilot project at Kalyanbigha this month itself and showcase our work to the health department so that we can replicate it in all 38 districts of Bihar,” said Dr Darak. Nalanda civil surgeon Dr Sunil Kumar said, “We have completed taking samples and digitising records of 1,000 out of the target group population of 10,000. We target those coming to our district hospital, sub-divisional hospital, referral hospitals and selected primary health centres.

He, however, added that unfortunately nearly 80% hospitals on the planet did not have electronic medical records.Addressing the 16th e-convocation of Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad (IIIT-A) as the chief guest, he said, “We want all hospitals to have the smartest electronic medical record at a price that they can afford to pay and are working in this regard.”“This is what you need to do also either by producing or delivering essentials of life to everyone at a price that they can afford to pay by building digital tools,” he said to the passing out students in his virtual address.In all, 465 students were awarded different degrees via online mode during the ceremony that saw a handful of IIIT-A officials gracing the stage in the institute’s auditorium and the guests as well as students attending the ceremony virtually. Besides, the institute also awarded 23 medals to meritorious students at the convocation during which 29 research scholars were awarded PhD degrees.In his address, Dr Shetty, who is also chairman, Narayana Hrudayalaya, said stock market valuation is not real India. “Real India still depends on agricultural economy which has not changed since independence. Nearly half of our country’s population still depends on rain and price of that they grow. Unfortunately, farming is a business in which many will end up in bankruptcy. It is just a matter of time,” he said.“Agricultural income still depends on rain and when there is no rain there is no crop, no money while when there is too much rain again there is no crop and no money. Interestingly, when there is adequate rain there is bumper crop, still no money since what the farmer has grown has no market value. Your business strategy, if it includes the farmers, migrant labourers and working-class people, can make you enter the blue ocean of business where there is no competition”, he added.“When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bonds – your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction and you find yourself in a new, great and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive and you discover yourself to be the greater person by far than you ever dreamed”, Dr Shetty said. Prof P Nagabhushan, director and officiating chairman of Board of Governors (BoG) , IIIT-A, in his address said during the Covid period, the institution suffered its share of setbacks.“Yet that did not deter us. The institute has remained active with its research,” he said citing development of a rapid diagnostic kit for the detection of corona virus besides autonomously propelled catalytic magnetic nanobots designed for degradation of toxic industrial dyes in water bodies by institute scientists.“Despite Covid disruption, our students have excelled in hackathons and other coding competitions.

12-09-2021||Other||Implementation of liquor, meat ban in Mathura begins||Agra/Lucknow After Mathura city was declared a pilgrimage centre by chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath on Friday, the administrative machinery swung into action the same day to implement ban on sale of meat and liquor. Most of the meat shops as well as restaurants serving non vegetarian food were closed down by Saturday, while a list of liquor vends to be closed or relocated was being prepared. “Excise and animal husbandry departments, Food and Drug Administration, district administration, police and the municipal corporation will work towards the implementation of liquor and meat sale ban in the area (22 municipal wards of Mathura),” said a senior government officer in Lucknow. “The government has announced Mathura as teeth sthal (pilgrimage centre). Villages like Nandgaon and Barsana were already teerth sthals and now the area has been enlarged. Once our department gets the notification, we will begin rolling out the ban. The department will relocate the existing licensed liquor shops. They have paid the license fee etc, so they will be relocated outside the teerth sthal limits “, said Sanjay R Bhoosreddy, additional chief secretary, excise department, Government of UP. On Friday, the Yogi Adityanath government declared an area of 10 sq km around the birthplace of Lord Krishna in Mathura-Vrindavan as a ‘teerth sthal’ (pilgrimage site). Sale of liquor and meat was banned in this area comprising 22 wards of the Mathura Nagar Nigam. “The Mathura Nagar Nigam had forwarded the proposal to declare 22 wards as teerth sthal and it was accepted. Various government bodies will now ensure implementation of the ban because shops and vends selling meat and liquor will either be closed or relocated. Mainly the district excise department and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will ensure compliance with the ban,” said Anunay Jha, municipal commissioner of Mathura. Dr. Gauri Shankar, the designated officer for Food and Drug Administration said that action against meat shops and restaurants serving non vegetarian food had begun on Friday night. “There are 18 such registered outlets within these 22 wards of Mathura Nagar Nigam. The action began on Friday night and most of the meat shops and restaurants selling non vegetarian food were closed by Saturday. The remaining are in the process of being closed,” said Dr Gauri Shankar. “However, in compliance with the alternative suggested by the chief minister, we have offered rehabilitation of those owning these outlets. In case they plan to switch over to another business, like milk or grocery, we will issue license for that at the earliest,” he added. “A list is being prepared of liquor vends falling in the 22 wards of Mathura Nagar Nigam and this will be forwarded to the excise commissioner in Lucknow. Owners of these vends will have the option to re-locate away from the teerth sthal area or look for other alternatives,” informed sources in the office of the district magistrate in Mathura. Welcoming the decision, social activist and founder chairperson of ‘Kanak Dhara’ foundation, Dr Laxmi Gautam demanded full compliance with the chief minister’s order. Seven other spots in Mathura, linked to the life of Lord Krishna and his beloved Radha, were already declared pilgrimage sites by the Yogi regime in the past. These include Vrindavan, Gokul, Barsana, Nandgaon, Goverdhan, Baldev and Radhakund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/implementation-of-liquor-meat-ban-in-mathura-begins-101631385248607.html
12-09-2021||Delhi||Intense showers, long dry spells: An exceptional monsoon for Delhi||According to the Regional Meteorological Centre, New Delhi, the Capital’s Safdarjung station recorded 94.7 mm rainfall in the 24 hours up to 8:30 AM on 11 September. To put this in perspective, this is 8.6% of the total rainfall of 1100 mm received by the city-state till Saturday morning.The gridded dataset of the India Meteorological Department shows the rain in Delhi at 672 mm till Friday morning; the corresponding figure for Safdarjung is 1005.3 mm. The difference is because the gridded dataset is based on interpolation of rainfall from multiple stations that have operated consistently over the years to generate the area average of rainfall in a grid. There are two such grids in Delhi, data from which are averaged to generate average rainfall.And here is where it starts to get interesting.The 672 mm is, in absolute terms, the 20th highest rainfall in the Capital in the past 120 years in the June 1- September 10 period.Of this 672mm, 391.1mm or 58.2% was classified “heavy” or “extreme” rainfall. This share is the fifth highest since 1901. The other four years are 1912, 1933, 1975, and 1978. In other words, Delhi has seen the most patchily intense monsoon rains in 43 years in 2021.How patchily intense?The maximum LPA (long period average) or expected rainfall for any day up to September 10 in Delhi is 11.87 mm. Of the 102 days of the monsoon up to 8:30 AM on September 10, on 18 days, rain in excess of 11.87 mm fell in the Capital. On nine of these days, rain in excess of 32.60 mm fell. In contrast to this, there was no rainfall on 44 days.This combination of extremely dry and extremely wet days in 2021 is exceptional compared to historical averages. In the 1961-2010 period, it took 7.54 days on average for 50% of the monsoon rainfall up to September 10 to fall in Delhi. In 2011-2020 decade, it took 8 days on average, while in 2021, this mark was reached in just 6 days. Similarly, 99% of the monsoon rainfall up to September 10 fell in 43.14 days on average in 1961-2010, in 43.3 days in 2011-2020, but in just 35 days in 2021.The heavy rains of Friday-Saturday (which will reflect in the gridded dataset 24 hours later) will skew these proportions even more. The reason HT used the gridded dataset is because it’s the only way to perform a long-term analysis of monsoon trends in Delhi. To return to the 2021 monsoon’s patchy intensity in Delhi, it’s interesting to note that the long-term trend in rainfall in the Capital — to the extent that it can be measured in the gridded dataset which only gives data for 24-hour intervals — is that the share of high and extreme intensity rainfall (more than 35.5 mm in a day in a grid) and its share in total rainfall has actually been declining in Delhi. IMD measures deviations in rainfall for any interval by comparing it with the average rainfall for that interval in the 1961-2010 period or the Long Period Average (LPA). Average “heavy” and “extreme” intensity monsoon rainfall was 82 mm in the 2011-2020 decade in Delhi compared to the LPA of 234 mm. Its share in total rainfall in the decade was 19% compared to the LPA of 36%. This year, the numbers (as mentioned above) were 391.1 mm and 58.2%To be sure, does not necessarily mean that rainfall in Delhi became less intense in the 2011-2020 decade. If the increase in intensity of rainfall in Delhi was such that it fell in fewer hours than before, it would not be measured by the gridded dataset. This is because this data is collated only for 24-hour rainfall.But 2021 is an outlier even in terms of the 24-hour metric. By the end of the monsoon season on September 30, it will likely be even more so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/intense-showers-long-dry-spells-why-2021-has-been-an-exceptional-monsoon-for-delhi-101631384588161.html
12-09-2021||Delhi||Arrival area of Delhi airport’s T3 floods, over 100 flights delayed||The intense rain on Saturday left Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport in complete disarray, flooding the arrival area in Terminal 3 as well as the apron (where aircraft are parked), even as over 100 flights were delayed and five diverted.Videos from the airport recorded by fliers did the rounds on social media throughout the day, as officials said rainwater leaked into Terminal 3 from at least four spots on the roof. Officials of the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) — the airport operator — attributed the waterlogging inside the terminal to “a steep gradient” between Terminal 3 and National Highway 48 adjoining it.Jai, a flyer at the airport who goes by a single name, said his morning flight to Mumbai was delayed by two hours due to the weather. “I booked an early morning flight so that I could attend a meeting in the afternoon, but the delay disrupted my day completely,” he said. Of the five flights that were diverted, four were landed in Jaipur and the other landed in Ahmedabad, said airport officials. Three IndiGo flights —to Lucknow, Indore and Hyderabad — were also cancelled. A DIAL spokesperson said, “Delhi has been witnessing record-breaking rain since last evening. This morning [Saturday], due to sudden extremely intense downpour, the forecourt of Terminal 3 of Delhi Airport saw some waterlogging, which was cleared within a few minutes.” “Due to a steep gradient, the entire area between NH-48 and Terminal 3 acts as a catchment and drains water towards the terminal. This water is eventually carried by the city’s underground drainage system from Terminal 3 to Najafgarh drain,” said the official. The airport’s forecourt flooded in October 2019 as well after an intense spell of rain.Spokespersons, however, maintained that no passengers missed their flight due to the waterlogged forecourt. Officials, who asked not to be named, said the drainage system from T3 to Najafgarh drain needs to be widened. “Several discussions in this matter have already taken place. We hope it will be widened soon,” the official added. The roads leading to the airport and the Aerocity area were severely waterlogged too. An underpass leading to the airport was heavily waterlogged too, leading the traffic police to divert the traffic from there. State Public Works Department officials confirmed that the underpass leading to the airport was waterlogged, because of which the traffic there was diverted onto the other roads. “Traffic jams were reported from other stretches too. We managed to clear out the water at the underpass within an hour, but traffic had to be stopped there for longer due to excessive rainfall,” said the official.During the day, passengers shared pictures of the apron area too which showed waterlogging there as well. An airport staffer said that they cleared up the area within half an hour. The bad weather also affected flight operations at the airport, with airlines like IndiGo, SpiceJet requesting passengers to track their flight status before leaving for the airport. SpiceJet tweeted, “#WeatherUpdate: Due to bad weather in Delhi (DEL), all departures/arrivals and their consequential flights may get affected. Passengers are requested to keep a check on their flight status.” The other airlines made similar posts on the Twitter handles to alert the passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arrival-area-of-delhi-airport-s-t3-floods-over-100-flights-delayed-101631384408258.html
12-09-2021||Lucknow||Ahead of Uttar Pradesh assembly election, Priyanka tells Congress workers to work round the clock||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has asked party workers to work round the clock and assured them that the party organisation will play an important role in the selection of candidates for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly election.Priyanka gave this assurance to the party workers at meetings with them at the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) headquarters in Lucknow over the past two days (Friday and Saturday). A large number of aspirants for Congress tickets have made a bid to meet her and put up their request for a ticket to leaders close to them.Although the Pradesh Election Committee (PEC) has approved a list of candidates for about 40 seats, the final decision on the issue has been left to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.The Congress has asked ticket aspirants to submit their applications at the UPCC headquarters or with the party units in the districts from September 11 to 25. The party has decided to finalise party tickets well in advance this time and PEC is scheduled to meet on October 5.“District Congress Committees and City Congress Committees have been asked to send recommendations about potential candidates for the remaining seats in a given format. PEC is scheduled to meet again on October 5, 2021 to discuss more recommendations,” said a senior leader.Priyanka on Saturday held a separate meeting with all the eight UPCC vice- presidents. As most of these vice-presidents are likely to be fielded as candidates in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly election, the party is looking to make alternative arrangements. She also completed a review of the party’s organisation structure set-up at various levels in the remaining four of eight zones on Saturday. She had completed a review of four zones on Friday.The Congress general secretary pointed out to some office bearers of districts the need for an improvement, though she appeared satisfied with the work of a large number of district and city party units.“Priyanka Gandhi Vadra got feedback from office bearers about the functioning of party’s 831 blocks, 2614 wards and 8134 nyay panchayats in the past two days. She pointed out to some office bearers that the party has not received good reports about them. She has asked the partymen to work round the clock, bring about improvement and reach out to people with policies and programmes,” said another party leader.Priyanka is scheduled to leave for Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha seat of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, after winding up her Lucknow tour on Sunday. She is scheduled to review preparations for the 2022 assembly election there. Besides interacting with the office bearers of the district and city party units, she is set to meet party chiefs of blocks, nyay panchayats and wards. She will have another round of interactions with former legislators and party candidates who contested the 2017 assembly election. She may also visit Amethi though a programme in this connection is yet to be worked out.“It’s good to know that the Congress is launching a good campaign and plans statewide yatras to reach out to the people. The party should go to the people with a positive approach. The Congress should have started such campaigns right from the time when the BJP came to power in 2017. Such campaigns should be a regular feature and not launched only at the time of elections,” said professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.Congress may appoint four working presidents in Uttar PradeshThe Congress is contemplating a move to appoint four working presidents to oversee the party organisation ahead of the 2022 assembly election in Uttar Pradesh.Although senior Congress leaders refuse to confirm any such move, those aware of the development said the party may appoint the working presidents to oversee the organisation during the election as senior leaders, including UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu, and some vice-presidents would contest the polls.According to a party leader, Priyanka said at a meeting late on Saturday evening that the party would like to have “jitau (winnable)” and “tikau (stable)” candidates who can lead the party for the next 20 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ahead-of-uttar-pradesh-assembly-election-priyanka-tells-congress-workers-to-work-round-the-clock-101631384049192.html
12-09-2021||Delhi||Work to better society, not for posts: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday urged party workers to work for the betterment of society without aspiring for any posts, as the party reconstituted its national executive to elect 34 members, including prominent leaders from Uttarakhand, Goa and Karnataka, among others, through online voting.Addressing party workers during AAP’s 10th national council meeting, Kejriwal said the AAP has come to change the politics of “power through money and money through power”.The national executive includes new faces like Col (retired) Ajay Kothiyal, AAP’s CM face for the Uttarakhand elections; Venzy Viegas of AAP’s Goa unit; Prithvi Reddy, AAP’s Karnataka president, in addition to current members like Kejriwal; deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia; Delhi cabinet ministers except Kailash Gahlot; and MLAs Raghav Chadha and Atishi.AAP is focusing on poll-bound Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat as part of its plan for national expansion.“I want to make it clear to everyone, when you join the AAP, do not come here with the expectation of getting any position or getting a ticket for the elections. We have to work for the society and the country with complete dedication and honesty. We all have to work in our own areas to the best of our abilities. In this party, you should only be at peace when you are satisfied with your work, not because you have reached some position. Your work should be of such quality that the position comes to you and you don’t have to go after seeking that position,” Kejriwal said.“There are so many people in our party whom we approached ourselves, and asked them to take a position or a ticket. One should not be greedy. Being greedy cannot result in service and sacrifice. When someone takes something by crook, they remain crooks throughout their life. One must leave such desires and ambition, this won’t get anyone anything,” he said.Kejriwal also invoked freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and BR Ambedkar in his address: “Shahid-e-azam Bhagat Singh and Baba Saheb Ambedkar are two supreme ideals of our party. Each of our volunteers should be ready to make sacrifices like them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/work-to-better-society-not-for-postskejriwal-101631383028017.html
12-09-2021||Mumbai||Thane: 9-year-old kidnapped boy found, 4 arrested||Thane local police and crime branch officers on Saturday arrested four persons for kidnapping a 9-year-old boy. The boy from Ambernath was allegedly kidnapped by his father’s former business partner who demanded a ransom ₹40 lakh from the family. The victim’s father, who had started the vada pav stall, couldn’t arrange the money and informed police about the same. The boy, a resident of Green City, Shivaji Nagar of Ambernath, went missing on the evening of September 8, after he went for tuition and did not return. An officer from Ambernath police station said, “The four accused — Amjad Khan, Chotu Singh, Yogendra Singh, Sunil Lad — who knew the victim’s family for the past few years, befriended the boy and used to lure him with chocolates and played cricket with him. On the evening of September 8, they kidnapped him and kept him at two different places in Kalyan’s Mohane village. Later the accused called his father for ransom for ₹40 lakh.” Five teams of the crime branch and local police officers were formed to search the accused. Deputy police commissioner, L Patil said, “Our teams searched all CCTV footage and found out people who were frequently seen around the area and connected to boy in the past few days. With all the efforts by the team, we were able to trace the boy on Saturday afternoon at Mohane village. He is completely fine and is handed over to his family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-9-year-old-kidnapped-boy-found-4-arrested-101631381229022.html
12-09-2021||Noida||Maharashtra CM: Sakinaka rape, murder case to be tried in fast-track court||While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has attacked the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over the death of the Sakinaka rape and murder victim, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has announced that the case will be tried in a fast-track court. “This is a blot on humanity. I have asked home minister Dilip Walse Patil and Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale to expedite the probe,” the CM said. He added that the state will ensure that the perpetrator gets the strictest punishment. Thackeray held a high-level meeting with police and home department officials on Saturday evening over the incident. He has directed the home department to appoint a special public prosecutor and file the charge sheet in one month. “The department should build a strong case by collecting forensic and electronic proofs related to the case without leaving any weak link behind. The charge sheet should be filed in one month to ensure that the justice is ensured in stipulated time,” he said.The CM has also directed the police to identify hotspots that are potential threats to women and beef up patrolling at these spots by appointing Nirbhaya squads in each of the police stations as well as ramp up the CCTV networks in the city. “CCTV network plays an important role in investigations of such cases. The home department should take steps to install cameras in rest of the areas in the city. The police should keep a close watch on history sheeters with a background in such cases. They must constitute a Nirbhaya squad with lady police constables in each of the police stations. The squads should keep 24X7 vigilance at spots with potential activities of crimes against women. Patrolling at spots with high footfall of women should be increased after identifying such spots,” CM directed the officials. Thackeray said steps should be taken to maintain the identity of Mumbai as a safe city. Meanwhile, stating that the law-and-order situation has paralysed, the BJP has questioned the delay in the enactment of the proposed Shakti law and the appointment of the chairperson for women’s commission. Leader of Opposition and former CM Devendra Fadnavis has attacked the government and said cases of rapes and gang rapes have increased in the state over the past one month. He said the government should think over it seriously. “CM should speak to the chief justice of Bombay high court for the designated fast-track court to try the case. The perpetrator should be hanged at the earliest,” he said. Fadnavis added that there is unrest among top-level police officers owing to the “out-of-turn appointments” of a few officers by political bosses. “A few Indian Police Service (IPS) officers spoke to me over the recent reshuffle in the force, in which junior officers were being appointed to key posts by downgrading the posts to accommodate them. This has created unrest among the officers who have been left out. It [Mumbai Police] is a disciplined force and such type of indiscipline gives anti-social elements a reason to take undue advantage,” he said. BJP vice-president Chitra Wagh has criticised the state government for its failure to appoint the chairperson to head the Maharashtra State Commission for Women (MSCW) and enacting the Shakti Act. “The government will soon complete two years in the office, but it has not been able to appoint a person to head MSCW. The ministers in the government start politicising the issue by raising questions over Delhi and Hathras cases. They should first look at the state of law and order in Maharashtra. The government hasn’t been able to enact the Shakti law that proposed stricter punishment in atrocities against women,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/maharashtra-cm-sakinaka-rape-murder-case-to-be-tried-in-fast-track-court-101631378707568.html
12-09-2021||Mumbai||Supreme Court directs Maharashtra election commission to take call on local body polls||The Supreme Court, in a ruling two days ago, has directed the State Election Commission (SEC) to take a call on the local body election at its level and added that the state government cannot decide on the conduct of the local body election. It earlier stated that the absence of the political quota to Other Backward Classes (OBC) in local body elections cannot be the grounds for the postponement of the elections. While hearing a case related to due local body elections and bypolls to the seats fallen vacant in five district council after the quota was quashed, the Apex court said the the decision over the elections should be taken by the State Election Commission. Pointing at the notification issued by the state government on August 11, banning the campaigning of the elections, the SC said the government cannot constrict the court decision related to the OBC quota on March 4. “The SC verdict further clarified that the state government has no right to decide on the conduct of the elections to the local bodies, and the power are with the SEC. The SEC should decide on the dates for election by considering the Covid-19 situation in the state,” said an official from Mantralaya. The elections to more than five municipal corporations, two district councils, over 100 municipal councils and nagar panchayats and bypolls to dozens of seats in five district councils are due since the past few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-directs-maharashtra-election-commission-to-take-call-on-local-body-polls-101631378587760.html
12-09-2021||Mumbai||Centre recommends final notification of ESZ around Bor Tiger Reserve||The Union environment ministry has recommended the final notification of the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of 678 square kilometres (sqkm) around Bor Tiger Reserve (BTR) in Maharashtra’s Wardha district. The decision was made in the 47th meeting of the the ministry’s expert committee on ESZ held on August 17, the minutes of which were published on September 8, following the publication of a draft notification by the ministry on February 5 this year.The final declaration of the ESZ, meant to act as a buffer zone to ease development pressures around the protected area, has been pending for several years. The Maharashtra government had first notified a buffer zone of 678.15 sqkm as a protected area under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 via a notification dated December 4, 2015, for Bor Wildlife Sanctuary, New Bor and Extended New Bor forests which together make up 138 sqkms of tiger habitat. Now, with the Centre’s nod, the government of Maharashtra will have to prepare a Zonal Master Plan and Tourism Master Plan within a period of two years from the notification being published in the official gazette, which is expected to happen within the month. The environment ministry has also constituted an 11-member ESZ monitoring committee which will regulate non-forestry activities in the ESZ area around Bor, as per the schedule of controlled activities mentioned in the Environment Protection Act.The minimum width of the finally notified ESZ will be 0.5 km, and 26.5 km at its widest point. The ESZ will straddle forest divisions in Nagpur and Wardha divisions, and will consist of 355 sqkms of protected forest land and 322 sqkms of non-forest area across five villages in Nagpur and two in Wardha.Initially a wildlife sanctuary, Bor was declared as a tiger reserve in 2014, and is the smallest such protected area in the country with a population of four tigers in 2014. In 2020, the estimated population of tigers in Bor stood at six. In all, BTR has so far recorded 30 species of mammals, 26 species of reptiles and several other amphibian species. It also supports important endangered or vulnerable wildlife including leopards, sloth bears, wild dogs, four horned-antelopes and sambar deer, in addition to about 160 species of resident and migratory waterfowl.Kishor Rithe, director of the Satpuda Foundation and member of state wildlife board, said, “It usually does not take this long for the Centre to notify an ESZ after the state government, but in the case of Bor, there are actually three different protected areas which have had their own separate issues with notification and resettlement of affected populations. That’s one reason for the lag. Frequent changes in official positions have also slowed down the bureaucratic process.”Rithe, who has served on state-level committees to delineate critical tiger habitat and buffer area around BTR pursuant to the Tiger Conservation Plan, said Bor is a critical habitat for tigers in eastern Maharashtra, serving as a corridor between larger tiger reserves such as Pench and Tadoba-Andhari. “As far as the Zonal Master Plan is concerned, the forest department has so far been reluctant to draw up the plans for any protected area in Maharashtra. It involves a lot of coordination between various departments, like irrigation and agriculture departments. It’s been conveyed to us that the task may be outsourced to a third-party agency, but there aren’t any organisations with the requisite expertise. At the moment, there are no such master plans for any protected area in Maharashtra. Worryingly, there are no good examples from anywhere else in the country for the forest department or third-party agency to refer to,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-recommends-final-notification-of-esz-around-bor-tiger-reserve-101631378467737.html

The action against rickshaw drivers came after two cases of child sexual assault by autorickshaw drivers were exposed this past week. In one case registered at Wanowrie police station, a teenage girl was kidnapped from the railway station and subjected to sexual assault by at least 13 men within a span of three days. A total of 14 men are in police custody in the case.In light of the Wanowrie case, the Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta promised of strict implementation of existing rules on all modes of passenger transport without singling out autorickshaw drivers. However, in the recent action, rickshaw drivers were the focus of all actions.“We started the drive three days ago. On the first day, traffic police took 740 actions and RTO officials, 177. On the second day (Friday), traffic police had 1,237 cases and RTO officials had 224 actions. On the third day, the number of actions is ___,” said Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police, traffic, Pune police. The action includes violators of set rules for rickshaw drivers - uniform and buckle number not displayed, riding without permit, no passenger vehicle registration, traffic rule violations, and use of vehicle beyond scrap lifespan, among others, according to DCP Shrirame.“The number of violating rickshaw drivers had become a menace. There are good-intentioned rickshaw drivers who form unions and work. Their name is getting dragged through the mud because of the wrong-doers. So there were rickshaw mandal members who actually encouraged us to take action against some of these problematic drivers,” said Ajit Shinde, Regional transport officer, Pune.The RTO officials have seized hundreds of autorickshaws compounding a number of violations stacked against the vehicles. The vehicles were handed over to the Bundgarden traffic police division officials.“We have stacked them in a parking lot and they will remain there until further orders,” said police inspector Ajit Dalvi of Bund Garden traffic division.The rickshaw drivers will have to brace themselves for stricter actions as the issue of child sexual assault cases has piqued the interest of Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, Dilip Walse-Patil, home minister of the state, and several opposition members including former CM Devendra Fadnavis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-rto-crackdown-on-errant-rickshaw-drivers-3-000-violations-in-3-days-101631377446962.html

As per the Cantonment Act 2006, the board can also charge fines of Rs50,000. Traders, who have trade licences before 2006, do not have to apply, barring certain exceptions, states the Cantonment Act, 2006. “Till date only 20 applications have been approved and sanctioned. Our decision is final and sealing will take place if they don’t have the valid trade licence. This license is mandatory for eateries, restaurants, grocery shops, pharmacies and other business establishments. Under the Cantonment Act, the board is empowered to serve a notice if a particular shop or restaurant is in an unhygienic condition. The board has already shortlisted such establishments and sent notices three months ago,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pcb-to-seal-business-outlets-with-no-licence-from-sept-15-101631376366900.html

During the investigation, IAS officer Ayush Sinha will remain on leave,” said additional chief secretary to Haryana government, Devender Singh in a joint conference along with farmer leaders on Saturday.He said that the government has also agreed to give two government jobs on DC rate, against sanction posts to the next kin of the farmer Shushil Kajal, who, according to the farmers, died due to lathi-charge. However, there was no MLR or postmortem report to prove their claims.During the two rounds of meetings with Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav, the farmer leaders were adamant about the registration of FIR and the suspension of the IAS officer.But on Friday evening, during the third meeting with ACS Devender Singh, the farmers agreed to a judicial probe to investigate the role of the IAS officer in the lathi-charge.“We had taken a legal opinion and found that judicial enquiry is a better option than the registration of FIR. And the FIR will be registered later if he was found guilty in the investigation,” said Charuni, who also addressed the joint press conference.However, there was no official confirmation on the financial assistance to the victims of the lathi-charge.Soon after the joint conference, farmers leader Gurnam Singh Charuni announced to end the protest but said that the farmers will continue to protest programmes of BJP-JJP leaders until the protest against three farm laws goes on at Delhi borders.High drama unfolded in chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s constituency of Karnal on August 28 after around 10 farmers allegedly sustained injuries in the lathi-charge at Bastara poll plaza.The farmers had gathered to protest a meeting of the ruling BJP in Karnal. The administration claimed that the police had to restore to lathi-charge as some farmers had blocked the NH 44.Later, a video of then Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha went viral on social media in which he was seen directing the cops to hit farmers and “crack their heads” if they crossed barricades installed near the venue of the BJP’s meeting scheduled at a private hotel.Later, the government the IAS officer was shifted to Chandigarh as the controversy blew up. The agitated farmers called a Mahapanchayat at Gharuanda grain market on August 30 and decided to gherao the Karnal mini-secretariat indefinitely if the government did not accept their demands including FIR and suspension of the IAS officer and compensation to injured farmers.Thousands of farmers from Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh gathered at Mahapanchayat called by senior SKM leaders on September 7. The farmers took out a 5-km protest march and laid siege of the main entrance of Karnal’s mini-secretariat despite the deployment of around 40 companies of police and paramilitary forces in Karnal.Timeline of eventsAugust 28: Police restored to lathi-charge on farmers who were protesting a meeting of Haryana BJP leaders including chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar at Karnal.August 30: Farmers held a meeting at Gharaunda grain market and gave a week’s ultimatum to the Haryana government for action against the SDM and compensation of injured farmers.September 6: Karnal DC invited farmer leaders for talks but the talks remained inconclusiveSeptember 7: Farmers called another Mahapanchayat at Karnal grain market and later laid siege of mini-secretariat indefinitely.September 8: Administration called farmers for another meeting but talks failed again.September 10: Farmers and government representatives led by ACS Devender Singh held a meeting and farmers agreed to lift the blockade following assurance on their most of demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-call-off-karnal-protest-after-govt-agrees-to-main-demands-101631361546581.html

All reported 20 positive Covid-19 cases were from Xianyou county, the largest county in Putian.Preliminary analysis of the Covid strain shows the outbreak was triggered by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. The new cluster comes weeks after China contained the July wave of the Delta variant that had spread across the country, the worst since the Wuhan outbreak in 2020.The new cases have been linked to a Chinese national who returned from Singapore last month. At least six infections have been traced back to him. Hundreds of contacts including children in an elementary school have been isolated.Six people from two families were first to test positive on Friday, including three children aged between 10 and 12 years.Villages in Xianyou, where confirmed cases were found, have been sealed, a state media report said.The county’s Fengting town has been designated as a Covid-19 high-risk area after new local infections were reported, news agency Xinhua reported.The Covid-19 response headquarters of Xianyou has advised residents to work from home and wear masks on public transportation, and has banned large gatherings.“The operations of the county’s indoor entertainment venues, such as museums and movie theatres, have been suspended. Also, customer flow has been restricted in supermarkets and other essential services providers,” the report said.Putian authorities announced the suspension of inter-city and inter-province bus services until further notice. Cinemas, card rooms, gyms, tourist sites and other facilities in Putian have been shut down. Restaurants and supermarkets have been told to “strictly control” customer numbers and to check for fever.The national health commission (NHC) has deployed a work team to Fujian to guide local epidemic control.“The city government of Putian reported the viral genome sequencing of 19 relevant cases in the outbreak has preliminarily identified the strains as the highly infectious Delta variant,” the Xinhua report added.The mainland on Sunday also reported 26 new imported cases for Saturday, including 11 in Yunnan, six in Guangdong, three in Shanghai, two in Inner Mongolia, and one each in Tianjin, Liaoning, Fujian and Henan.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland stood at 95,199 until Saturday, with the death toll unchanged at 4,636.Meanwhile, China has administered a total of 2.14 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines as of September 11, data from the NHC showed on Sunday.More than 969 million Chinese people, which is about 69% of the country’s population, were fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as of September 7, the NHC said last week.China aims to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus disease by the end of this year. China’s top respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan told state media in August that the country would need more than 80% of the population to be fully inoculated to achieve that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-outbreak-hits-eastern-china-putian-city-sealed-off-travel-restricted-101631469923179.html

Tehran has agreed to allow the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to install new memory cards into surveillance cameras at its sensitive nuclear sites and continue the recording. The announcement comes after a meeting between IAEA director-general Rafael Grossi and the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) in Tehran.“IAEA's inspectors are permitted to service the identified equipment and replace their storage media which will be kept under the joint IAEA and AEOI seals in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The way and the timing are agreed by the two sides,” Grossi and Eslami said in a joint statement.In 2015, the US, Russia, China, Germany, Britain and France entered a deal with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA). But the Donald Trump administration withdrew from the deal in 2018 and imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran as a part of its “maximum pressure” campaign. The negotiations over the US and Iran returning to the nuclear deal continue to be stalled in Vienna. Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic is enriching small amounts of uranium as the country’s stockpile grows.While Iran has agreed to allow filming the sensitive nuclear sites, it continues to hold all recordings at its sites. In a confidential quarterly report, the UN atomic agency had sounded the alarm bell over Iran's repeated refusal to let inspectors access the monitoring equipment. Eslami said that the memory cards are sealed and kept in Iran “according to the routine.” “New memory cards will be installed in cameras. That is a routine and natural trend in the agency’s monitoring system,” he added.Terming the agreement a “very constructive result”, Grossi said that it has to do with the continuity of the operation of the IAEA’s equipment in Iran. It "is indispensable for us to provide the necessary guarantee and information to the IAEA and to the world that everything is in order.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-memory-cards-but-no-access-to-footage-iran-s-deal-with-un-atomic-agency-101631457466578.html

The same perception helped Zabiuallah stay right under the nose of the US and the Afghan forces in Kabul for years. It is his secret recce that might have given an edge to the Taliban against the Afghanistan army, the Taliban leader has proudly admitted in an exclusive interview with The Express Tribune.“I lived in Kabul for a long time, right under everyone’s noses. I roamed the width and breadth of the country. I also managed to have first-hand access to the frontlines, where the Taliban carried out their actions, and up to date information. It was quite puzzling for our adversaries," Mujahid told.'Pakistan our second home, there is peace in Afghanistan': Taliban spokespersonMujahid told that he escaped so many times from the US and Afghan national forces that they started believing that Zabuillah Mujahid is just a ghost, a made-up character, and not a real person.The 43-year-old Taliban leader said he never left Afghanistan. He had travelled to many places to attend seminaries, even to Pakistan, but never thought of leaving the country forever, despite being under the constant man-hunt of the US and the Afghan forces. The US forces used to pay local people a good amount of money to know about his whereabouts but he somehow managed to escape their radar, the spokesperson added.Recounting his childhood, the spokesperson told The Express Tribune that he was enrolled at a normal school at the very beginning but was soon shifted to a madrassa and was on the path of religious education. He also stayed at Haqqani seminary in Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. He joined the Taliban at the age of 16 years and never saw founder Mullah Umar.About the popular perception about his 'non-existence, he confirmed that Zabiullah is his actual name. "Mujahid, however, is something my seniors in the Tehreek started calling me," he said.After the Taliban captured Kabul, the group attempted to project a moderate image and a press meet was called which was addressed by Zabiuallah. Over time, the group also claimed that the Taliban leaders will not remain in theshadows as they did during the previous regime. Consequently, several leaders came before the press, answered questions and now that the interim cabinet has been formed, the Taliban are looking for international recognition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/was-right-under-their-nose-in-kabul-taliban-spokesperson-divulges-how-he-fooled-us-afghan-forces-101631451875748.html

Under international law, submarines passing off the coast of another country are required to surface and show a national flag inside territorial waters.Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force sent three reconnaissance aircraft and two destroyers to the area for early warning and information gathering to analyze China’s intentions.A submarine believed to be Chinese also was spotted in the area in June 2020.China has defended its maritime activities and says it has the right to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.Japan, alarmed by China's growing naval activities in the East and South China seas, has been stepping up defense in the country’s southwestern regions and islands north of the disputed islands.Tokyo says it opposes China's unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the region, and regularly protests the Chinese coast guard’s growing presence near the disputed islands. Japanese officials say Chinese vessels routinely violate Japanese territorial waters around the islands, sometimes threatening fishing boats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-detects-suspected-china-submarine-near-southern-island-101631436812947.html

According to the Xinhua News Agency, local officials in Putian in eastern China’s Fujian province have said residents must not leave the city without good reason such as seeking medical treatment. They must have proof of a negative coronavirus test within the past 48 hours, the city government announced.China’s National Health Commission sent a special team to Putian after Covid-19 cases were reported, according to broadcaster CGTN. The commission said in a statement on Sunday that China recorded 20 new local cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, all from Fujian and including 19 in Putian. The officials in the province have also found 18 asymptomatic cases, 17 of which were in Putian, according to the statement. The new outbreak in Putian comes less than a month after China quelled its most widespread resurgence of the coronavirus since the initial Wuhan outbreak.The official Global Times newspaper reported that the first Covid-19 cases in Putian were students from Xianyou County, but experts suspect the outbreak might have originated with the father of one student who returned from Singapore on August 4.The traveller, identified by the surname Lin, underwent a 14-day quarantine and nine nucleic acid and serologic tests, all of which were negative, the Global Times said, citing local authorities in Putian. It said he tested positive on Friday.Cinemas, card rooms, gyms, tourist sites and other facilities in Putian were ordered to be closed, the city government announced.

Now refugees in alien shores far away from their native land, football remains the only constant that these women hold dear to their hearts, and the flash of hope that perhaps, one day, all will be okay.“Football is like food to me,” The New York Times quoted 21-year-old Susan as saying. The former captain of a women's soccer team from Afghanistan has also been the subject of a 2017 documentary – ‘Herat Football Club’. The publication only mentioned the first name of the sportswoman, to protect her identity from potential attack by the Taliban, which have been known to track down their targets.Also Read | No ‘future’ for women under Taliban: Former Afghan football player after fleeingSusan is one of the three members of the Afghan soccer team who arrived in Rome days after the Taliban laid siege to Herat, all thanks to the help provided by two Italian journalists, a Florence-based NGO, several lawmakers, and officials from Italy. Part of a group of 16 who transited from Herat through a tent camp run by the Italian Red Cross, Susan was also accompanied by her coach and her family on the journey. In a series of interviews with the NYT, Susan mentioned that the fear that she might never be able to play football again under the Taliban regime made her feel as though she was “dead”.Read the entire interview and more here.Historically, the Taliban have never been known to be appreciative of women's liberties, but the newly installed regime is looking to forbid women from participating in sports altogether, the conservative outfit's reasoning being that their bodies might be seen. Referring to the sport of cricket, a deputy head of the Taliban's cultural commission told Australian public broadcaster SBS, “It is the media era, and there will be photos and videos, and then people watch it.”“Islam and the Islamic Emirate do not allow women to play cricket or play the kind of sports where they get exposed,” he added.Also Read | No one knows what the future of Afghan sports will beThe hardline regime's decisions are betraying the group's former commitments that it would be more open towards accepting women's rights, and a Taliban spokesperson even went as far ahead recently as to proclaim that women cannot even play a role in governing a nation; instead, he said, women in Afghanistan should just “give birth”.Female athletes, who once aspired to compete at the international level, have resorted to hiding or attempting to flee Afghanistan, a grave situation that could threaten the nation's standing in the sports world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-foreign-shores-football-empowers-the-afghan-women-who-escaped-taliban-clutch-101631418545222.html

The IAEA and Iran's envoy to the agency said he would meet the new head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Mohammad Eslami.Grossi is expected to hold a news conference at Vienna airport around 8:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) after returning later on Sunday, the IAEA said.The IAEA informed member states this week that there had been no progress on two central issues: explaining uranium traces found at several old, undeclared sites and getting urgent access to some monitoring equipment so the agency can continue to keep track of parts of Iran's nuclear programme as provided for by the 2015 deal.Separate, indirect talks between the United States and Iran on both returning to compliance with the deal have been halted since June. Washington and its European allies have been urging hardline president Ebrahim Raisi's administration, which took office in August, to return to the talks.Under the 2015 deal between Iran and major powers, Tehran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018, re-introducing painful economic sanctions. Iran responded as of 2019 by breaching many of the deal's core restrictions, like enriching uranium to a higher purity, closer to that suitable for use in nuclear weapons.Western powers must decide whether to push for a resolution criticising Iran and raising pressure on it for stonewalling the IAEA at next week's meeting of the agency's 35-nation Board of Governors. A resolution could jeopardise the resumption of talks on the deal as Tehran bristles at such moves.Countries on the IAEA Board of Governors will be watching Grossi's visit to see whether Iran yields either on granting access to the monitoring equipment to service it or offers the prospect of answers on the uranium particles found at the undeclared former sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-nuclear-watchdog-chief-in-iran-set-to-ease-showdown-with-the-west-101631422625263.html
12-09-2021||World||Al Qaeda leader, rumoured dead, surfaces in video on 9/11 anniversary||Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, rumoured to be dead, was seen in a new video on released on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the United States. US-based SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the online activity of jihadist groups, reported that al-Zawahiri spoke on a number of issues, including a raid on a Russian military base, in the new hour-long video released by al Qaeda. Rita Katz, SITE’s director, noted that al-Zawahiri made no mention of the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan. Katz pointed out al-Zawahiri was shown in the video even though reports last November claimed he had died. He last appeared in a video message for the group on the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.In June this year, a United Nations report said that a significant part of the al Qaeda leadership resides in the Afghanistan and Pakistan border region, including al-Zawahiri, who is “probably alive but too frail to be featured in propaganda”. "One member state reports that he is probably alive but too frail to be featured in propaganda,” the UN report said, without identifying the country.“Amid rumors of his death, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri shown in new 60-minute video, this time offering some evidence that he is not dead--particularly, reference to events after December, when rumors of death surfaced. (A speech from March offered no such proof),” Katz said in a series of tweets. “Event Zawahiri referenced was a raid on a Russian military base by the al-Qaeda-aligned Hurras al-Deen in Syria, which it claimed on Jan 1 (after rumors/reporting of his death surfaced in Nov). Also introduces Zawahiri with "May Allah Protect Him”,” she added.

Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, the prime minister of the Taliban interim government, hoisted the banner in a low-key ceremony on Saturday, said Ahmadullah Muttaqi, multimedia branch chief of the group cultural commission.The Taliban announced an interim government earlier this week and the all-male, all-Taliban government was met with disappointment by the international community which had hoped the hardline Islamist group would keep an earlier promise of an inclusive cabinet. The Taliban formed the interim "Islamic Emirate" and named hardliners in its new government, who oversaw the 20-year fight against the US-led military coalition, and it was dominated by members of the group's old guard, with no women.Also watch | Why Taliban cancelled oath-taking ceremony of its government on 9/11 anniversary

Although there was no official confirmation from either side, those familiar with the development said that that the meeting, hosted by the director-general of the ISI, indeed took place and it was attended by the intelligence chiefs of China, Russia, Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. They said the participants exchanged views on the measures needed for “lasting peace and stability” in the region.Also Read | Leaked audio reveals Taliban's rift with Pakistan, claims reportPakistan has been seeking an active hand in the situation which developed in Afghanistan after the Taliban's lightning-fast offensive won the militants control of the state machinery in the war-torn land.

The development takes an interesting perspective for Afghanistan experts and political observers, many of who believe that it was, in fact, Islamabad which was behind the Taliban's aggressive advance against the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani government's forces in August.

12-09-2021||World||FBI releases newly declassified record on September 11 attacks||The FBI late Saturday released a newly declassified 16-page document related to logistical support provided to two of the Saudi hijackers in the run-up to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.The document describes contacts the hijackers had with Saudi associates in the US but offers no evidence the Saudi government was complicit in the plot.The document, released on the 20th anniversary of the attacks, is the first investigative record to be disclosed since President Joe Biden ordered a declassification review of materials that for years have remained out of public view.Biden had encountered pressure in recent weeks from victims' families, who have long sought the records as they pursue a lawsuit in New York alleging that senior Saudi officials were complicit in the attacks.The Saudi government has long denied any involvement. The Saudi Embassy in Washington said Wednesday that it supported the full declassification of all records as a way to “end the baseless allegations against the Kingdom once and for all.”The embassy said that any allegation that Saudi Arabia was complicit was “categorically false.”Biden last week ordered the Justice Department and other agencies to conduct a declassification review of investigative documents and release what they can over the next six months. The 16 pages were released on Saturday night, hours after Biden attended September 11 memorial events in New York, Pennsylvania and northern Virginia.Victims' relatives had earlier objected to Biden's presence at ceremonial events as long as the documents remained classified.The heavily redacted record released Saturday describes a 2015 interview with a person who was applying for US citizenship and years earlier had repeated contacts with Saudi nationals who investigators said provided “significant logistical support” to several of the hijackers.The documents are being released at a politically delicate time for the US and Saudi Arabia, two nations that have forged a strategic -- if difficult -- alliance, particularly on counterterrorism matters. The Biden administration in February released an intelligence assessment implicating Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the 2018 killing of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi but drew criticism from Democrats for avoiding a direct punishment of the crown prince himself.Regarding September 11, there has been speculation of official involvement since shortly after the attacks, when it was revealed that 15 of the 19 attackers were Saudis. Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida at the time, was from a prominent family in the kingdom.The US investigated some Saudi diplomats and others with Saudi government ties who knew hijackers after they arrived in the US, according to documents that have already been declassified.Still, the 9/11 Commission report found “no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded” the attacks that al-Qaida masterminded. But the commission also noted “the likelihood” that Saudi government-sponsored charities did.Particular scrutiny has centered on the first two hijackers to arrive in the US, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar. In February 2000, shortly after their arrival in southern California, they encountered at a halal restaurant a Saudi national named Omar al-Bayoumi who helped them find and lease an apartment in San Diego, had ties to the Saudi government and had earlier attracted FBI scrutiny.

12-09-2021||World||She was one of the last US Marines killed in Afghanistan. Now brought home, 20 years after 9/11||US Marine Sergeant Johanny Rosario returned to her hometown in Massachusetts in a casket on Saturday, one of the last American soldiers killed in Afghanistan during a war set in motion exactly two decades ago by the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.Several hundred people gathered near the Farrah Funeral Home in Lawrence, Mass., where Rosario's remains arrived in a black hearse with a police motorcycle escort. Marines in dress uniform carried the casket into the funeral home, as veterans in the crowd, some of whom had not worn a uniform in years, snapped to attention."We came out because she is a hero to us," said Mary Beth Chosse, who waited for several hours with her 12-year-old son, Gavin. Chosse's older son is a Marine on active duty. "Sergeant Rosario's sacrifice and bravery should always be remembered."Rosario, 25, was among 13 US service members killed last month in a suicide bombing outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan's capital Kabul. She was helping to screen evacuees at a checkpoint at the airport's Abbey Gate when the bomb ripped through a crowd.About 7,100 US military personnel have been killed in conflicts tied to the Sept. 11 attacks, with about 2,500 of those deaths happening in Afghanistan, according to the Costs of War project at Brown University's Watson Institute. The financial cost of those conflicts runs to nearly $6 trillion, according to the project.Like many Americans, Sheila Arias, 41, remembers Sept. 11, 2001, in vivid detail. She was at a hair salon in Lawrence when she watched the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center collapse after al Qaeda hijackers seized control of two airplanes and crashed them into the buildings. Hijacked airplanes would also crash into the Pentagon outside Washington and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.Arias soon after enlisted in the US Army, leaving a comfortable, steady job as a clerk in Lawrence's water department to join the military effort to root out al Qaeda."There was no question that I had to serve," Arias said. "I'm sure Johanny Rosario felt the same way."‘Always remember her name’Rosario, who was 5-years-old when the attacks occurred, would begin her service years later when the United States was already deeply involved in Afghanistan.Shortly after graduating from high school in 2014, she enlisted and landed with the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade.Eventually, she would become a supply chief, a role usually held by a more senior noncommissioned officer, according to the Marines, and volunteered to be a member of the female engagement team to interact with Afghan women, barred by local custom from talking to male strangers.Just three months before her death, she was recognized with an award for her attention to detail and expertise in tracking and reconciling some $400,000 worth of open supply requisitions.On Saturday, a group of her friends from Lawrence High School huddled near the steps of the funeral home. Wearing black face masks, they spoke of Rosario's desire to serve her country, take college courses and financially support her family.One of the women, who like the others declined to give her name, cradled a framed picture of Rosario in a formal gown."I can't talk. I would just cry," the woman said.Like many residents in Lawrence, a working-class city about 30 miles (48 km) north of Boston with a strong Hispanic community, Rosario's roots extend to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, said William Lantigua, a former mayor of the city who knows her family.Rosario is survived by her mother and a younger sister.On Saturday, Maria Ogando joined the crowd gathered to pay tribute to Rosario after driving an hour from Worcester, Massachusetts with her family. Her daughter, 9-year-old Kayla, wore a T-shirt with Rosario's full name on the back."She is a hero and it is very sad for me to see her pass away," Kayla said. "But I will always remember her name and what she did for our country."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/she-was-one-of-the-last-us-marines-killed-in-afghanistan-now-brought-home-20-years-after-911-101631410023009.html

"But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit.""And it is our continuing duty to confront them," he added.Bush's speech at the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, came eight months after violent insurrectionists breached the US Capitol on January 6, CNM reported.The former Republican President has been outspoken about condemning the violent mob of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol that day."This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic -- not our democratic republic," he said in a statement at the time, adding that he was "appalled by the reckless behaviour of some political leaders since the election."His remarks come on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attack, which left nearly 3,000 people dead.Meanwhile, a moment of silence was observed on Saturday at a memorial in Lower Manhattan to mark the 9/11 terror attack.US President Joe Biden was joined by former President Barack Obama and Bill Clinton in Lower Manhattan for the ceremony at the National September 11th Memorial, CNN reported.Family members of the victims read the names of all their relatives at the National September 11th Memorial to honour them.Last year, the annual name-reading ceremony was altered due to the coronavirus pandemic, with prerecorded names played over speakers to avoid contact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-former-president-bush-calls-on-americans-to-confront-violent-extremists-101631411192321.html

Fars reported on Saturday that rumours about Massoud, the son of late former Afghan guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, leaving Afghanistan for Turkey or any other place are false and the resistance leader is said to be in a safe place.The Taliban have said that they have captured the Afghan province of Panjshir, the last resistance stronghold in the country, a claim denied by the National Resistance Front (NRF) led by Massoud and former Afghan vice president Amrullah Saleh, who has declared himself caretaker president. Panjshir was the last Afghan province holding out against the Taliban who swept to power last month and have now declared an interim government. The NRF said that the resistance forces are present at all strategic positions across the valley to continue the fight."In recent days, the Taliban entered Panjshir and now 70 per cent of the main streets and passages are under their control, but the valleys of Panjshir are still under the complete control of the popular forces," Qassem Mohammadi, who is said to be close to Massaoud, was quoted as saying by Fars.Also read | 'His body should rot': Taliban after killing Amrullah Saleh's brotherAhmad Massoud last Monday called for a "national uprising" against the Taliban in an audio message sent to media. “Wherever you are, inside or outside, I call on you to begin a national uprising for the dignity, freedom and prosperity of our country," Ahmad Massoud said, according to Al Jazeera.Last Wednesday, the ousted Afghan government's ambassador to Tajikistan said Ahmad Shah Massoud and Amrullah Saleh have not fled Afghanistan and their resistance forces are still fighting the Taliban.

He will also meet private sector leaders to discuss efforts to raise global climate ambition and speed India's clean energy transition, the US state department said in a statement on Saturday.During Kerry's visit, India and the US will launch the Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue (CAFMD). This is one of the two main tracks of the US-India Agenda 2030 Partnership that President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced at the Leaders Summit on Climate in April this year.The state department statement said that Kerry's visit will bolster the US bilateral and multilateral climate efforts ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which will be held from October 31 to November 12, 2021, in Glasgow, United Kingdom.On August 24, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav called Kerry, during which both sides agreed that India and the US will engage for a constructive engagement under the India-US Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership.Last month, PM Modi announced the India-US climate and clean energy partnership to help mobilise investments and enable green collaborations. "As a climate-responsible developing country, India welcomes partners to create templates of sustainable development in India.

On Friday, the United Arab Emirates said that it will allow the return of those vaccinated fully with WHO-approved Covid-19 jabs and holding valid residence visas from 15 nations previously on the suspended list, including India. Passengers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Namibia, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, South Africa, Nigeria, and Afghanistan can now enter the UAE.The decision to lift the travel ban comes as Dubai is preparing to open the Expo 2020 world fair on October 1 after a year-long delay due to the coronavirus pandemic. The National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority (NCEMA) in a tweet shared an official statement and said that those who can return also include those who stayed abroad for over six months."UAE allows return of fully vaccinated (WHO-approved vaccines) holders of valid residence visa, including those who stayed abroad for over six months, starting from September 12, 2021," the statement reads.Last week, the UAE announced to resume tourist visas for fully vaccinated travelers. This came as the daily number of Covid-19 positive cases continued to drop in the nation, having gone lower than 1,000 since last week, reports AFP.Here's what is required for arrival:1. The NCEMA said that passengers can apply via the website of the Federal Authority For Identity and Citizenship (ICA) and complete the vaccination application in order to get the necessary approval in addition to presenting the approved vaccination certification upon departure for the UAE.2. The passengers are also required to present a negative PCR test result done within 48 hours before the departure at an approved lab that has a QR code. However, children under 16 years are exempted from these procedures, it said.3. Travelers who wish to receive the benefits provided to individuals vaccinated in the UAE, like visiting malls and public spaces in Abu Dhabi, can register their vaccination via the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship platform or Al Hosn application.4. All other previously announced precautionary measures for unvaccinated people coming from those nations remain in place, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-lifts-restrictions-on-entry-of-fully-vaccinated-residents-from-india-other-countries-from-today-101631403520693.html

At 10.03am, they remembered the fourth plane to crash in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers fought the hijackers. At 10.28am, it was when the North Tower started falling.Bruce Springsteen sang I’ll See You in My Dreams in New York, while, smaller ceremonies took place across the country.US President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden were joined at the New York memorial service by former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and their first ladies Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama respectively. Heart-wrenching commemorations also took place at the Pentagon and Shanksville, where former president George W Bush, who was president at the time of the attacks and subsequently launched the Afghanistan war said the unity America showed following the attacks “seems distant” today.Ahead of Saturday’s commemorations, Biden said in a six-minute message from the White House on Friday calling for “national unity”. “In the days that followed September 11, 2001, we saw heroism everywhere. We also saw something all too rare: national unity,” he said in the video message.“Unity is what makes us who we are, America at its best,” Biden said. “To me, that’s the central lesson of September 11th.”Biden then flew to Shanksville, Pennsylvania where he was to lay a wreath. He was slated later on Saturday to return to the Washington area to visit the Pentagon, the symbol of US military might that was pierced by another of the planes that were used as missiles that day.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20th-anniversary-of-9-11-six-moments-of-silence-reflection-101631401294302.html
12-09-2021||World||In Kabul airstrike, US hit aid worker not IS fighters||A video analysis shows the US may have mistakenly targeted an aid worker rather than Islamic State fighters in its final strike in Afghanistan which killed 10 civilians, The New York Times said on Friday.The Pentagon has said it disrupted a new attack planned by the Islamic State extremist group through a Reaper drone strike on August 29 - the day before US troops ended their 20-year mission and following a devastating attack outside the Kabul airport that killed more than a 100 people.But Kabul resident Aimal Ahmadi earlier told AFP that the strike killed 10 civilians including his small daughter, nephews, nieces and his brother Ezmarai Ahmadi, who was driving the car that was struck after he parked.The New York Times, analysing security camera footage, said the US military may have been seeing the slain Ahmadi and a colleague loading canisters of water, which was in short supply after the collapse of the Western-backed government, and picking up a laptop for his boss.Ezmarai Ahmadi was an electrical engineer for the California-based aid and lobbying group Nutrition and Education International and himself was among thousands of Afghans who had applied for resettlement in the United States, relatives said.US officials say that a larger blast took place after the drone strike, showing that there were explosives in the vehicle.But the New York Times investigation said there was no evidence of a second explosion, with only one dent on a nearby gate and no clear signs of an additional blast such as blown-out walls. Commenting on the report, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that US Central Command “continues to assess” the strike but that “no other military works harder than we do to prevent civilian casualties”.“As Chairman (Mark) Milley said, the strike was based on good intelligence, and we still believe that it prevented an imminent threat to the airport and to our men and women that were still serving at the airport,” Kirby said, referring to the top US general.The New York Times noted that a rocket attack the following morning, claimed by the Islamic State group, was carried out from a Toyota Corolla similar to Ahmadi’s.‘Taliban’s victory might embolden other groups’The Taliban’s victory might embolden other groups in different parts of the world, United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres has warned, expressing worry over global terrorism.He also asserted that dialogue with the militant group is “absolutely essential” as the UN wants the country to play a “constructive role” in international relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-kabul-airstrike-us-hit-aid-worker-not-is-fighters-101631401242918.html
12-09-2021||World||On 9/11 anniversary, Afghans blame departed US forces for their woes||War-weary residents of Kabul expressed anger and feelings of betrayal by the United States on Saturday, as the world marked the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that prompted a US invasion of Afghanistan and the toppling of its Taliban rulers.After a two-decade occupation, US forces abruptly pulled out of Afghanistan last month, triggering the collapse of its Western-backed government and the Taliban’s dramatic return to power.“The misfortunes we are currently experiencing are because of America,” said Abdul Waris, a Kabul resident. Some of the mostly young men who spoke to Reuters complained that US forces had not tried to help the Afghan people.“After the September 11 events took place, the Americans were in our country for 20 years for their own benefit,” said Jalil Ahmad.“They took the benefits they had in mind for 20 years while we did not get any benefit from them. They have left the country in a state of confusion.”Bearded Taliban fighters with guns slung over their shoulders were visible around the capital but the mood was quiet and calm following the dramatic changes of recent weeks.“Now there is security and security is good... May God give the Taliban more strength to maintain this (calm) forever,” said resident Gul Agha Laghmni.US forces toppled the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks because they had provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, leader of Al-Qaeda, which carried out the attacks. Since returning to power last month, the Taliban have appointed an acting cabinet including several former militants held by the United States in Guantanamo Bay.There were relatively few women on the streets of Kabul on Saturday, and all those who were out had their heads covered - a fact welcomed by residents such as Shah Raoof.“In the presence of America, there was a lot of commotion in our country. Women were unveiled,” he said.“The majority of our youth fled, a number were martyred and a number of others were afflicted by America through war and misery.”Taliban flag flies at presidential palaceThe Taliban flag waved over the Afghan presidential palace the same day the US and the world marked the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.The Taliban flag was raised on Friday and could be seen waving over the presidential palace in Kabul on Saturday. The militant group also painted their white backdrop flag on the wall of the US embassy building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-9-11-anniversary-afghans-blame-departed-us-forces-for-their-woes-101631401215703.html

All fully vaccinated, all ready to go - safely and socially distanced! We will watch this closely,” Rishad Premji, the Chairman of Wipro, said in a post on Twitter. Premji also put out a video in which employees will go through a series of checks, including temperature, identification and scanning of QR codes to enter the office premises. According to the company, it will adopt a flexible and hybrid approach in its policy and fully vaccinated employees in leadership roles will return to office. The development comes at a time when Karnataka, and its largest technology hub Bengaluru, stares at the looming threat of an impending third wave of Covid infections. Former Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa had announced restrictions almost a week before the curfew announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March last year, following which Information Technology (IT) companies had adopted the work from home (WFH) policy that later became the norm among large corporations. The WFH policy had helped reduce some of the traffic congestion in the city. However, the fear of contracting the virus in public transport has forced several of Bengaluru’s residents to depend on private transport that has added to the city’s challenges that include poor quality of roads, dipping air and water quality and endless traffic jams. Even the state IT/BT department had requested most of the IT companies to continue its WFH policy, at least till December 2022, in the light of Bengaluru Metro authorities about to start the construction work on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) stretch which houses some of these companies, and is dubbed one of the largest IT corridors of Bengaluru. Wipro’s decision could also open the doors for its peers to initiate the return of its employees to the offices. “Wipro Ltd will adopt a flexible, hybrid approach in our return to office policy. Beginning September 13, fully vaccinated employees in leadership roles will return to work from offices in India, twice a week (Mondays and Thursdays). We have extended work from home for all other employees until October 31, 2021,” the company said in a statement. The company said that almost 70% of all its employees have taken at least one dose of vaccine so far. “The health and safety of employees remain our utmost priority. We have put in place several measures, including round-the-clock workplace sanitization, wearing masks at all times and strict social distancing practices to ensure employee safety,” the company said in a statement on Sunday. Bengaluru is home to a number of technology companies such as Infosys, Wipro, Intel, Accenture and several other corporate giants in the fields of aerospace, biotechnology, startups among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-18-months-wipro-senior-staff-to-return-to-office-today-101631471366513.html
12-09-2021||India||Separate health care authority for Bengaluru on anvil: Karnataka government||The Karnataka government is planning to make an independent health authority for Bengaluru, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Sunday, a move that comes after the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the inadequacies in the healthcare system of the city.“I am preparing an independent health system for Bengaluru. Health is not with the corporation (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, the city’s civic body) or the (state health) department and will make an effort to bring this under one system,” Bommai said.He said Bengaluru has a high population density, making it harder to separate the city and state authorities in health care. “It would be right if all of Bengaluru’s health infrastructure should be under one authority,” Bommai said.The statements come at a time when there appears to be an overlap in the overall health system of Karnataka and the BBMP, especially during the two waves of Covid-19 infections. The renewed focus on healthcare comes at a time when the threat of a third wave of infections looms over the city and state.Bommai said the Kalyana Karnataka (formerly Hyderabad Karnataka) region has a ratio of 10,000 patients for one hospital bed. Even the number of patients per doctor is very high due to regional imbalance as well as lack of focus on healthcare infrastructure in the past 70 years, he said.Bommai acknowledged that the healthcare system was inadequate during the first two bouts of the pandemic in Bengaluru. Hundreds of thousands have suffered with many lives lost due to pandemic-related infrastructure problems including lack of hospital beds, oxygen, life-saving medication and even space to cremate the dead, exposing the fault lines in one of India’s most technologically advanced cities. Karnataka’s Covid caseload nears 3 million and fatalities stand at over 37,400, according to government data.Bommai mooted that there be a diploma in public health in which people would be trained to visit each home, gather information on medical history, raise awareness on nutrition and hygiene that would help keep the population more secure.Bommai unveiled 120 advanced life support ambulances under the Arogya Kavacha scheme.“There are about 710 ambulances operating under the Arogya Kavacha -- 108 scheme and 155 among them are ALS ambulances. All the 120 ambulances flagged off by CM today are ALS ambulances,” said Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education.The minister said that if technologies, such as GPS and mobile app, are adopted, then ambulances can reach the patient within 10-15 minutes as against around 45 minutes now due to the disorganised approach and traffic snarls.“At present there is one ambulance for 1 lakh (10 million) population and we want to increase it to make 1 ambulance for every 45,000 to 50,000 population. We also provide training to drivers and paramedical staff to make the service more people-friendly,” Sudhakar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/separate-health-care-authority-for-bengaluru-on-anvil-karnataka-government-101631471309318.html
12-09-2021||India||The Week Ahead: Markets brace for consumer inflation report; IPL to resume in UAE||Mumbai The consumer price index (CPI) and the wholesale price index (WPI) are fair indicators of the impact of inflation on the common person. It is therefore quite natural that Monday’s announcement of the CPI data for August will be looked upon with significant interest. On Tuesday, the WPI will be announced. CPI inflation had eased to 5.6% in July after remaining above the 6% mark – the upper limit of Reserve Bank of India’s tolerance zone of 2%-6% -- in May and June. Food prices, which have a weight of 39% in CPI, were largely responsible for this decrease in inflation. Food inflation decreased from 5.1% in June to 4% in July. Non-food inflation decreased only marginally: from 7% in June to 6.7% in July. At 11.2%, WPI grew in double digits for the fourth consecutive month in July . However, this was lower than the June WPI inflation of 12.1%.The other topic of mass interest will be the Indian Premier League, the country’s most popular cricket tournament. Transferred out of India due to Covid’s devastating second wave in April, IPL 2021 resumes in the UAE on September 19. Players have begun to gather in the UAE bio bubble, including the 21 India players who were on the England tour where the final Test was cancelled after a Covid scare in the Indian contingent.Meanwhile, in the English Premier League, Manchester City and Liverpool continue their quest for the title with City playing Southampton and Liverpool vs Crystal Palace on September 18.Back to India for more important political developments. The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on data protection will meet on September 15 and 16 to discuss what format the new data protection bill should have. This is the first meeting under chairman PP Chaudhary.In Punjab, chief minister Amarinder Singh has a series of outreach programmes lined up. To make up for the time lost on account of Covid and internal bickering, Amarinder may launch whirlwind tours of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ferozepur and other important districts in Malwa and Doaba, sources said, stressing the need for a speedy campaign to counter anti-incumbency.In West Bengal, TMC minister Partha Chatterjee will appear in front of the CBI on September 13 for questioning in the I-Core ponzi scam that the agency is probing since 2014. The campaign for the crucial Bhabanipur assembly seat is expected intensify from next week as BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal will file her nomination papers on Monday and chief minister Mamata Banerjee is expected to address her first election rally in the constituency. Votes will be polled on September 30. The Congress, too, has a busy week ahead. A Digvijay Singh led committee with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will meet for the first time to plan sustained agitations ahead of elections next year.Jharkhand is likely to become the latest state to take a call on reopening schools from Classes 1 to 8. Chief minister Hemant Soren may also announce the reopening of temples, too, this week.In northeast India, a select committee of Nagaland assembly will meet on September 14 to discuss the Assam-Nagaland border issue. Both states share a 434 km border with each other. In July, both states had agreed to deescalate tensions at two border points by withdrawing security forces.Home Minister Amit Shah is expected to visit Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh on September 18 to celebrate Balidan Diwas or martyrdom day of Gond king Shankar Shah and his son Kunwar Raghunath Shah, who were killed by British forces during the first war of Independence in 1857. The visit is aimed to lure back the tribals, who had weaned towards Congress and tribal political party, JAYs, in the 2018 assembly polls. But before that, Shah will be in Nirmal district of Telangana on September 17 to participate in BJP’s Liberation Day, which marks the Hyderabad state joining the Indian republic in 1948, a year after India’s independence. The BJP celebrates the day, whereas the state government holds no such function on that day as many people died in riots before September 18.The other issue that is consuming Indian policymakers is the climate crisis. US Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry will be in India from Sunday to Tuesday to meet the environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, and various other ministers and senior officials of the Indian government regarding India’s climate change goals.A statement issued by the US department of state said Kerry will engage with international counterparts on efforts to address the climate crisis. He will meet with Indian counterparts and private sector leaders to discuss efforts to raise “global climate ambition and speed India’s clean energy transition.”During his visit, the United States and India will launch the Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue (CAFMD), one of the two main tracks of the U.S.-India Agenda 2030 Partnership that President Biden and Prime Minister Modi announced at the Leaders Summit on Climate in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-week-ahead-markets-brace-for-consumer-inflation-report-ipl-to-resume-in-uae-101631471307834.html

12-09-2021||India||All banks should embrace digitisation: Sitharaman in Tamil Nadu visit||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said banks, including private sector should embrace digitisation towards ensuring that government schemes reach the poor and downtrodden, besides adopting financial inclusion for a wider reach.Delivering her address at the centenary celebrations of the city-based Tamilnad Mercantile Bank here, Sitharaman said even during Covid-19 pandemic with the use of digitisation through banking correspondents, the government’s financial disbursements were distributed to the needy after verifying their details.“Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) was clearly aware that banking is important and did not hesitate that there can be accounts with zero balance, if they were opened under the Jandhan Yojana scheme (launched in 2014). But he ensured that every one must hold a bank account and be able to transact through a RuPay card,” she said.Stating that the government distributed ₹1,500 in three installments to the needy through their bank accounts during the Covid-19 outbreak, she said there are lot of changes happening in the banking sector at a “fast pace” through digitisation.”There is no necessity to open a branch in a place which does not have a bank. Today, to reach a bank account of the people who live there, all kinds of technologies are available...Even sitting from Tuticorin one can serve the banking requirements of people living in small villages through technology”, she said.“The way forward for any bank, particularly for a bank like Tamilnad Mercantile Bank, to be more efficient, is to adopt complete technology related solutions’ ‘, she said.“Today financial technology is the biggest area and using that we can able to populate data into forms. It may be Income Tax or GST related. Auto-populating data (of a consumer) has been very useful (today),” she said.Auto-populating data can be done only through ‘digitisation’ and the management of TMB should think of greater use of digitisation, she said.“There are a lot of prospects for banking...I think it is important for digitisation to be completely brought in. Digitisation cannot be avoided for your own good and for the sake of customers,” she said, adding TMB should onboard all its customers and ensure Financial Inclusion is implemented.Sitharaman after presenting a financial assistance to a beneficiary of the Tamilnad Mercantile Bank under the ‘PM Svanidhi scheme’, said today you are presenting a cheque to a woman who runs a business by selling ‘idlies’ in her pushcart, you are able to distribute the financial assistance because there is a scheme like PM Jandhan Yojana (financial inclusion scheme).“If that scheme was not available, today you would not have been able to distribute the assistance to the woman. It would not have been possible if PM Jandhan Yojana was not launched in 2014,” she said.Tamilnad Mercantile Bank’s 74 per cent of business was through “priority” sector lending and through this banks were able to expand into rural areas. During the Covid-19 outbreak, the Centre introduced the Emergency Credit Guarantee Liquidity Scheme towards enabling MSMEs to do business without collecting any additional collateral required, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-banks-should-embrace-digitisation-sitharaman-in-tamil-naduvisit-101631471189675.html
12-09-2021||India||TN vaccinates 2mn people in 12-hour mega drive, hopes for more supplies||Tamil Nadu on Sunday surpassed its target to inoculate two million people in a 12-hour mega vaccination drive, with 2.836 million people receiving a shot against the Covid-19 disease. The state hopes they can pitch this achievement to the Union government to get more supply of vaccines.Having received a steady supply of vaccines from the Union government, Tamil Nadu on Sunday held the drive by setting 40,000 camps across the state with a particular concern for the nine districts bordering Kerala. The vaccine drive is being carried out when there is a marginal increase in cases here, while neighbouring Kerala has more than 200k active Covid-19 cases, and the state is also dealing with Nipah and Zika, putting Tamil Nadu on alert.Tamil Nadu’s vaccination story started from absolute hesitancy due to fear of side effects, among other factors. The perception began to change only during May and June when the second wave of Covid-19 had peaked, and the state was under duress much like other regions due to a shortage in medical oxygen. Vaccinations numbers were still low, but officials said that it was due to a supply shortage.Officials in Tamil Nadu say that vaccination is the only way to prevent another wave of infections. “When we began vaccinations (in January) we began with 3000 vaccinations, and step by step, we have been increasing, and we have reached this number now. We crossed our 20-lakh target at 4 pm,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “We have been consistently telling the Centre that we can vaccinate in such high numbers. Several doubted us, but with our joint effort of health workers and local authorities and public cooperation we have been able to achieve this today.” Chief minister M K Stalin had also assigned 15 IAS officers to monitor the special drive today. 2.7 million doses were distributed across the state for Sunday’s drive, and they were exhausted in most camps by evening. The union government additionally sent 130k doses at 4 pm. “The logistics were complicated but today shows that we can vaccinate 50-lakh people per week if we get ample vaccines,” the health secretary said. “We will use this performance and make efforts to urge the Centre to supply more vaccines to us.”The capital city of Chennai, which has had maximum vaccinations was on top on Sunday too. “There was a good reception, especially in the nine districts bordering Kerala. Coimbatore district has crossed 1 lakh,” the health secretary said.Until the end of August, Tamil Nadu had vaccinated more than 30-million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tnvaccinates-2mn-people-in-12-hour-mega-drive-hopes-for-more-supplies-101631471123485.html

12-09-2021||India||‘Narcotics jihad’ row intensifies across Kerala||Political and religious parties are making efforts to contain the rising communal divide in Kerala, triggered by Pala Bishop’s ‘narcotic jihad’ jibe recently.Many religious groups are taking out rallies outside the bishop’s residence in the last two days, either supporting or decrying his statement, even as several leaders in the state have requested their supporters to maintain restraint and communal harmony.Addressing a religious congregation in a church in Kuravilangad (Kottayam) last Thursday, Bishop Mar Joseph Kallaranghatt said Catholic girls and youth were becoming victims of a ‘narcotic jihad’, perpetrated by a section and decried authorities for turning a blind eye towards it.Many, including chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Congress, criticised the Bishop for making a sweeping comment, but the Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC), the highest body of Catholics in the state, and Bharatiya Janata Party rallied behind him. The church-supported daily Deepika on Sunday wrote an editorial, reminding the CM that he represents the whole state, and has to hear all sections before rejecting their woes.“Continuous appeasement politics is fast turning the state into a nursery of terror activities. The Bishop’s statement is based on facts and experience, and instead of addressing it, some are turning against him. “Those who think that he can be silenced by a barrage of criticism, they are in fool’s world,” it wrote, asking the CM to examine his statement, before rejecting it outright.The CM had expressed surprise over his comment, saying that he heard the term for the first time.Opposition leader V D Satheesan also criticised the statement and said it was a trap set by Sangh Parivar outfits. “It seems the Bishop’s statement is based on some social media comments. We all know most of these social media accounts are being managed by Parivar cronies. It is a planned to move to create a communal polarization,” he said. The Muslim League, an ally of the Congress, also called for restraint.But the KCBC defended the bishop, saying he was cautioning against some dangerous tendencies prevailing in the society, and they cannot be dismissed summarily as isolated incidents. “It is a fact that Kerala is facing certain serious social crises and among them rise in narcotic abuse tops. His words should be taken up responsibly, instead of attacking him,” it said.Minister of state of external affairs V Muraleedharan, hailing from the state, also criticised the attack on the Bishop. “It seems he spoke based on conviction, not emotion. The term narcotic jihad is not new. Even world bodies said proceeds from narcotics was a major source of terror funding,” he said, adding there was a concerted move to silence the Bishop. He said no one is against any community, but all will have to isolate disruptive forces. Records show a sharp rise in drug-related cases and seizures in the state, indicating increased drug consumption. In the past, Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted how drugs became a major issue across states.The police busted many rave parties in Kochi and hill destinations after a tip-off during the peak of the Covid pandemic. According to state excise records, Kerala saw a sharp increase in the seizure of party drugs in Kerala. In 2018, the police seized contraband worth ₹650 crore. In 2019, it went up to ₹720 crore, and in 2020 it increased to ₹800 crore.A senior police officer, not willing to be named, admitted that the drug addiction is a matter of concern, and increased vigilance has resulted in a high number of seizures. “It is a societal problem and cannot be solved through policing. We need societal reforms to deal with it,” said Prakash Singh, former Director-General of Police, Uttar Pradesh. The Kerala high court observed that the drug abuse in the state was very high while hearing a plea in February 2020.“The scale of drug abuse in Kerala is unacceptably high. The major problem faced by probe agencies is their inability to plug supply channels that bring contraband to the state,” the court had said.Three cities, Kochi, Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram, figure on the list of 127 most vulnerable cities for drug abuse by the Union ministry of social justice with a high prevalence of drug dependency. Last week the police seized MDMA (synthetic drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine) worth ₹13 crore from a flat in Kochi.“It is a fact, use of narcotic substances is high. It is a social evil, and everyone will have to fight it united. People from all classes and religions are involved in such offences. But you can not put everything into the account of a particular community,” said Muslim Educational Society president Dr Fazal Gafoor adding such statements will vitiate the social fabric of the state asked everyone to keep utmost restraint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narcotics-jihad-row-intensifies-across-kerala-101631471063478.html

Addressing a programme in Kushinagar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said that Congress gives shelter to the mafia and insults faith in Lord Ram.“But the BJP heals the citizens, paves the way for the construction of a grand temple of Lord Shri Ram and sends the mafia to the place they deserve.

The BJP leader urged the people of Uttar Pradesh to not tolerate “the pro-Taliban, casteist and dynastic mentality that shot at the devotees of Lord Ram.” He said that there is no place for appeasement politics under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Before 2017 was everyone able to get ration?... Earlier those who used to say 'Abba Jaan' digested the ration for the poor." he said. “The ration meant for Srinagar went to Nepal and Bangladesh back then. But if someone tries to take away ration from the poor now, he will definitely land in jail.” #WATCH | Under PM Modi leadership, there is no place for appeasement politics....Before 2017 was everyone able to get ration?....Earlier only those who used to say 'Abba Jaan' were digesting the ration: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Kushinagar pic.twitter.com/CPr6IMbwrySoon after the clip of Adityanath’s speech was shared by news agency ANI, Omar Abdullah, former chief minister of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, hit back at the BJP leader for “blatant communalism” and “hatred” directed towards Muslims.“I’ve always maintained the BJP has no intention of fighting any election with an agenda other than blatant communalism & hatred with all the venom directed towards Muslims.

The move came at the conclusion of ICY’s two-day national executive meeting last Monday.Rahul Gandhi, who took over as the Congress president from Sonia Gandhi in 2017, quit the post after the party’s flop show in the 2019 general elections.In his resignation letter, Gandhi had stated that a non-Gandhi should head the Congress, which has mostly been run by members of the Nehru-Gandhi family during its 135-year-long history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-student-body-passes-resolution-to-re-appoint-rahul-gandhi-as-party-chief-101631463925961.html
12-09-2021||India||Not at least in next 25 years…: Hardik Patel has a message for new Gujarat CM||The Opposition in Gujarat welcomed the new chief minister with a jibe claiming first-time MLA Bhupendra Patel may have a tough time to save the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the next election given its monumental failure in handling the coronavirus crisis, besides other major concerns.While extending his wishes to the new CM, Congress working president Hardik Patel said the ruling BJP was trying to hide its failures ahead of the next Assembly elections by bringing a new face. “But what your party could not do in the fields of education and health, for women, youth and farmers in 25 years, how would you achieve the same in one year?”The new CM’s name was announced by Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday, a day after Vijay Rupani gave up the reins.मैं गुजरात के नवनिर्वाचित मुख्यमंत्री भूपेन्द्र भाई पटेल को अपनी शुभकामनाएँ देता हूँ।भाजपा ने आपके रूप में अपना आख़री मुख्यमंत्री बना लिया है, क्योंकि कम से कम अगले 25 वर्षों तक गुजरात की जनता, अब गरीब और युवा विरोधी भाजपा को सत्ता से बाहर रखने का मन बना चुकी हैं। pic.twitter.com/tE1fuHbW1YHe further claimed the BJP got its last chief minister in Patel, because for at least the next 25 years, the state’s voters have decided to keep the anti-poor and anti-youth party away from power. “Now, it’s time to not just change the chief minister, but the entire party,” the Patidar agitation leader further wrote in a tweet.Earlier, he said the resignation of Rupani as the chief minister had made it clear that the BJP was unsuccessful in running the government.Also read | Who is Bhupendra Patel, Gujarat CM, first-time MLA and minister?Meanwhile, independent MLA Jignesh Mevani used a line of late actor AK Hangal from the famous yesteryear blockbuster ‘Sholay’ to welcome the new CM.

The decision is in the view of the emerging scenario following the Taliban taking over Afghanistan, the report said.The existing training module has a segment dedicated to the "changing dynamics of border management", which has information on the Taliban, but it is not updated. "That is being added through open-source authentic information and others available in a classified manner to us and the focus is the developments of the last twenty years that took place in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks," an officer told PTI. The training module is meant for BSF, SSB, state police units and those involved in counter-terrorist duties like CRPF, J&K Police etc.After the fall of Afghanistan in the hand of the Taliban on August 15, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat said India is ready to handle terror overflow into India from Afghanistan. "We were concerned about how the terrorist activity from Afghanistan could overflow into India. To that extent, our contingency planning had been ongoing and we are prepared for that," he had said.The new module, which is being prepared has a full-fledged training, intelligence, combat module on the Taliban apart from the latest updates on its leadership, modus operandi etc."It is very important for the last man standing at the border, a checkpost or under a police jurisdiction to know about the Taliban's history and linked activities and strategies. Senior and top commanders of the security forces may know most of the things about Afghanistan and the Taliban situation but they draw their operational strength from the troops or the constable standing on the ground. They need to be informed well," a senior official said.A recent report by news agency ANI claimed that there have been intelligence inputs of a group of 25 Indians with IS allegiance trying to enter India.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/counterterrorism-forces-to-have-fresh-training-module-on-taliban-claims-report-101631460149362.html

12-09-2021||India||Tamil Nadu student’s suicide ahead of NEET sparks political row||In yet another tragic incident, a 19-year-old medical aspirant from Salem was found dead in his home on Sunday hours ahead of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) that is being conducted across the country on Sunday. The student is suspected to have died by suicide allegedly due to the fear of not succeeding in the exam as this was his third attempt, officials said. “There is no suicide note but circumstantial evidence points to suicide due to exam fear as he has failed twice in the past and couldn’t get a medical admission,” said a senior police official in Salem who did not wish to be named. “His parents were compelling him to prepare and clear NEET and not go for any other course. The family also says that he was under pressure,” the official added. The student was found dead in his room in the early hours of Sunday. His elder brother is an engineering graduate and his father was an industry worker turned farmhand. The police have registered a case of unnatural death under section 174 of the Indian Penal Code and are conducting enquiries. His death quickly turned into a political storm in the state with the opposition blaming the ruling DMK and the ruling government. The ruling government and its allies in turn have been blaming the Union government. Chief minister MK Stalin assured students that they will bring a bill on Monday that seeks the President’s assent to exempt Tamil Nadu from NEET.Former AIADMK chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, who hails from the region, blamed the DMK for not fulfilling its election promise to abolish NEET and causing confusion among students over whether the exam will happen or not. “What happened to the promise of the DMK?” he tweeted. State BJP president K Annamalai said that the DMK should stop playing with students’ lives when the Supreme Court has made the exam mandatory. “Students’ lives are being lost for politics,” he said. The BJP is the only party in the state that supports NEET. Reacting to the death of the student, Stalin said in a statement that the DMK government will pass a Bill in the Tamil Nadu assembly on Monday seeking permanent exemption from NEET. “Let the injustice end,” he said. “Our legal battle against NEET is just beginning.” He blamed the Union government’s ‘indifference’ and said that the death reinforces the need to bring back education from the concurrent list to the state list under the Constitution. He appealed to students not to lose hope. Since NEET was introduced in Tamil Nadu in 2017, more than a dozen medical aspirants have died by suicide either due to fear of failing or having failed in the exam. What is the NEET issue in Tamil Nadu?Before NEET, Tamil Nadu considered class 12 board exam marks for admissions to medical colleges. Following a Supreme Court ruling, NEET became a reality in 2017 in Tamil Nadu which had availed an exemption successfully until then. Since then, the state has tried to be exempted from the exam through an ordinance, inside court halls and negotiations with the Union government and civil society protests spilt over to the streets but nothing has worked. Tamil Nadu has one of the highest medical aspirants in the country- one in eight doctors from India is from Tamil Nadu, based on data from the Medical Council of India provided by former Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in the parliament in 2019. The staunch resistance to NEET originated from the plight of disadvantaged students from Tamil Nadu’s hinterlands who have to compete with urban and affluent students who have more access to resources to crack the exam. Like any other exam, NEET too is marred by the tragedy of students dying by suicide. S Anitha, a Dalit teenager, died by suicide in 2017 after failing in NEET, although she was a school topper with 98%. She continues to be the face to rally against the exam for politicians. Her death led to widespread protests across Tamil Nadu. On 22 August 2017, the Supreme Court did not give Tamil Nadu an exemption from NEET in a case in which Anitha had impleaded herself. The fight against the exam also extended as one where the state argues that the Union government is interfering in their autonomy. Voices opposing NEET have argued that the exam has not led to more meritorious students but it has only helped the mushrooming of private centres charging exorbitant fees. Tamil Nadu has been offering free coaching to government and government-aided school students to prepare for NEET. Those for it say that while the rest of the country has taken up NEET, Tamil Nadu has to help its poor and rural students by giving them the right resources. Last year during its regime, the AIADMK introduced a 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical colleges for government school students who clear NEET. This ensured that government school students got 405 seats in the 2020-2021 academic year as opposed to six seats earlier. The previous regime also passed an ordinance against NEET in the state assembly in 2017 but the President did not give his assent.The DMK government after taking over in May constituted a committee chaired by Justice AK Rajan to study the adverse impact of NEET on socially and economically backward students. The state BJP challenged this in the Madras high court which was disposed of. After submitting the report to Stalin on 14 July, Rajan said that a majority among the 86,343 stakeholders in the exercise, were against NEET.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-student-s-suicide-ahead-of-neet-sparks-political-row-101631459303727.html
12-09-2021||India||‘Narcotics jihad’ remark: Kerala BJP unit urges Amit Shah to protect Pala bishop||The Kerala unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has written to Union home minister Amit Shah, seeking Central protection fors Pala bishop Joseph Kallarangatt, who they alleged were threatened by “some extremists” following his ‘narcotics jihad’ comment. The BJP leadership said the “extremist” elements entered the Bishop’s home and threatened him of harming him physically.In a letter dated September 11, BJP general secretary George Kurian wrote, "In this circumstance, I request you (Shah) to kindly intervene in this matter and take necessary action to protect the Bishop and the Christian community," a PTI report said.During a church ceremony in Kottayam on September 9, Kallaranghatt, the bishop of Pala Diocese of the Syro-Malabar church, created a controversy when he said that after “love jihad”, Catholic girls were being lured into committing extremist activities with the help of drugs. Calling them victims of “narcotics jihad”, the bishop urged parents to be careful.“Wherever arms are not used, narcotic drugs are being used and Catholic girls turn victims. Some groups are functioning in the state to help them. To understand this, one needs to analyse how women from other religions landed in the Islamic State camps,” he said.‘Love jihad’ is a controversial term employed by right wing groups to describe inter-religious unions. The bishop said the state authorities are turning a blind eye to instances of ‘love jihad’.The bishop’s statements were severely criticised by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “It (narcotic jihad) is a new term. I never expected such a statement from a person like him. I have no idea what prompted him to make it. Narcotics has no religion and nobody encourages it,” Vijayan said.“Persons holding such respectable positions should be careful while making such a statement. It will create unnecessary rift and animosity,” he added.Congress legislator and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly VD Satheesan also urged religious leaders to speak with to ensure social harmony. “We can’t count the number of crimes based on caste or religion. Such a statement was not expected from a religious leader. All will have to keep restraint to ensure brotherhood and peace,” he said.The BJP and several political leaders from the Christian community, however, defended the bishop. State BJP president K Surendran said ‘narcotics jihad’ was reality and those arrested for drug possession have links to terrorist networks.Kurian also claimed in his letter that the “extremists” were incited by Vijayan and Satheesan criticisms of the Bishop.Satheesan, however, hit out at those who went to the bishop’s house over the matter. "We want religious harmony and communal harmony in Kerala more than politics. Do not make this issue worse. Both sections must end this. This should not continue."Muslim political groups in the state like Samasta Kerala Sunni Students Federation (SKSSF) and Kerala Naduvathul Mujahideen have asked the bishop to produce evidence to substantiate his claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narcotics-jihad-remark-kerala-bjp-unit-urges-amit-shah-to-protect-pala-bishop-101631456412251.html
12-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Sept 13, 1965 — Jawans advance in Lahore sector, Pak loses 55 tanks in fierce battle||New Delhi – In their onward march in the Lahore and Sialkot sectors in the last 24 hours, Indian troops continued to batter Pakistan’s armour capturing 15 more tanks and destroying 40. It was another day of fierce battles and found Pakistan’s crack unit, the First Armoured Division, in complete disarray. Yesterday, the Division, rendered leaderless by the death of its commander, had lost 27 tanks. Of these, 15 had been captured by Indian forces in normal working condition.There was no change in the situation in the Chhamb-Jaurian sector, an official spokesman said here tonight. With the latest toll, the number of the Pakistani tanks accounted for so far has risen to 246-212 destroyed or damaged and 34 captured. On the 50-mile Lahore front from Wagah to Kasur, the Indian forces continued to press forward, despite heavy counter-attacks. Our performance was equally impressive in the Sialkot area. Here too, substantial quantities of armour and equipment were destroyed or captured. Pakistani ranks also lost heavily. In Kashmir, where the Uri-Poonch link-up had already been established, Indian troops occupied two important positions, eight miles north-west of Uri, and a Pakistani post north of Poonch. In the valley as well as in the Poonch-Rajouri area, several Pakistani infiltrators were killed in engagements with the Indian troops. As a result, the raiders were forced to break themselves up in smaller groups.Jammu operationsThese solid successes were, to a large extent, made possible by flying sorties of the Indian Air Force in support of the ground units. Fresh attacks were also made on several Pakistani airfields. The Pakistani air force bombed Adampur, Pathankot and Halwara airports but no significant damage was done. According to first details of the operation Sialkot, given today by an army observer, the Indian bag included a huge ammunition dump -anti-tank recoilless guns, Bren guns, light machine-guns, automatic rifles, mines, grenades and other ammunition-and heavy trucks and jeeps.The operations in the Jammu sector, he said, began with heavy artillery bombardment by Indian troops on the midnight of Sept. 7 and 8, following reports that Pakistan was building up for a strike. The stiff resistance encountered confirmed this. Indian troops had, by the morning overcome the enemy and occupied two strategic strongholds, commanding a vital trunk route in Pakistani territory. Indian troops advanced along this route.Indian Army engineers quickly built roads in the face of enemy fire so that our vehicles and guns could move. The signals played their part a laying communication lines, while the personnel of the Medical Corps rendered assistance to the wounded right under enemy fire. The ASC kept the wheels moving so that supplies were carried to the frontline. Officers and jawans of the Indian Army, the observer said, were at their best and performed acts of gallantry in utter disregard of their personal safety. Jawans approached the enemy machine-gun positions which were belching fire and silenced them. A jawan, who was severely wounded himself, refused to be evacuated b and killed four of the enemy at close quarters. A junior commissioned officer, leading a platoon, found his advance blocked by machine-gun positions. The entire platoon crawled under the enemy’s wilting fire, hurled grenades at the machine-guns and in a final assault, took the position. The troops combed the villages for weapons, arms and ammunition, while ensuring that the civilian population did not suffer. Indian troops gave food to many Pakistani villagers who did not have anything to eat, An old lady told the observer: “We have no doubt that you are not to blame for what is happening to us. The trouble was started by our Government.” The two-pronged drive from Uri and Poonch to straighten the loop on the ceasefire line was completed on Friday night with the capture of three more Pakistani posts in the area.The loop covers an area of about 150 sq. miles with high mountain ranges rising from 8,000 ft. to 13,000 ft. The mountain heights in the area have been used by the Pakistanis for repeated attacks on both the Kashmir valley and the Poonch area of Jammu. They were also used as bases by Pakistani infiltrators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-sept-13-1965-jawans-advance-in-lahore-sector-pak-loses-55-tanks-in-fierce-battle-101631455762622.html

Chadha’s remarks follow the resignation of Vijay Rupani as Gujarat CM earlier on Saturday and the ensuing episode on Sunday, when Ghatlodia MLA Bhupendra Patel was elected unanimously for the state’s top post during the BJP’s legislature party meeting.“Be it Uttarakhand or Gujarat where the AAP has entered BJP had to change the chief ministers. They changed the chief minister in Uttarakhand several times. Now is the time for Gujarat. The influence of AAP is growing in Gujarat. AAP is the big reason that BJP needs to change the chief minister in Gujarat,” news agency ANI quoted Chadha as saying.Also read | Work to better society, not for posts: Delhi CM Arvind KejriwalFurther, he also slammed the opposition Indian National Congress (INC) party and called it a “compromised opposition” and said only AAP has challenged the BJP. “There was no one who challenged the non-performing chief minister or the government in the state. Congress does not have that ability as it is a compromised Opposition. It is AAP that has challenged the BJP. It came under pressure. AAP made BJP understand: either perform or perish,” he further said.However, this was not the first time Chadha has made such a claim. After Rupani’s resignation on Saturday, Chadha tweeted “AAP breaches BJP's citadel, wins 27 seats in Surat, captures the space of opposition in Gujarat dislodging ineffective Congress. BJP forced to remove its CM,” sharing a news clipping about the resignation. He referred to the elections to the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) earlier in February this year, where the AAP won 27 out of the 120 seats and the BJP won the remaining 93. Congress, which held 36 seats earlier, won no seats in SMC.The AAP has made its national ambitions clear and has tried to project itself as the alternative for the two national parties, BJP and the Congress, in many states. The party has announced its decision to contest in the state assembly elections to be held in Uttar Pradesh (UP), Uttarakhand, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, all set to go to polls in 2022, drawing major inspiration from their performance in the local body elections.Senior AAP leader and party’s UP incharge Sanjay Singh said that the party would contest from all seats in UP, where it had previously tried its luck in the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary elections from some seats without any gains. Similar to Chadha, Singh also pointed to the party’s performance in the UP panchayat polls where it won more than the Congress. “Our party is stronger than the Congress in the state. While the Congress won 40 seats in panchayat polls, we scored a victory in 83 panchayats. AAP got over 40 lakh votes in these polls, where 1600 party candidates contested,” news agency PTI on Sunday quoted him as saying.With the state elections due next year, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was re-elected as the party’s national convenor for the third time, in the party’s national council meeting. The newly elected 34-member executive council met for the first time on Sunday via video-conferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aaps-growing-influence-pushed-bjp-to-change-cm-in-gujarat-raghav-chadha-on-vijay-rupani-s-resignation-101631454938336.html

We let her hide and keep blankets to drown out the sound as much as we can.” For animals, anxiety is the body’s natural response to stress. “Storm anxiety in pets can be defined as their body’s natural response of restlessness and disarray during thunderstorms, lightning or when the cloud cover gets dark. Pets are the first to sense the drop of barometric pressure and the change in scents due to their superior hearing and sense of smell and this leads to a whole lot of behavioural changes,” says Dr Dilip Sonune, director of veterinary services, Wiggles.in. From hiding in confined spaces, trembling, barking, howling, whining, to pacing, drooling or engaging in destructive behaviour, they have various responses. Dr Pranjal Khandare, a veterinarian, Wiggles.in explains, “Pets can hear a louder range of frequency than us, hence they show thunderstorm anxiety by urinating, hiding or barking excessively.” Empathy is the key to helping your furry buddy. It is very important to observe and understand the triggers that make them anxious. “Stay close to your pet to give them a sense of security and love. Distract them with their favourite toys, food or treats but do not force it upon them,” advises Dr Sonune. Urvi Raghvani, a dog mom to Groot, a two-and-a-half months old Labrador says, “Groot does not eat anything when it starts thundering. I take him close and talk to him in a calm tone.”They can be covered with blankets or a jacket, or they can hold on to your old t-shirt for reassurance that you’re with them. It’s also important to be patient with them to make them feel loved. It’s important to be patient and understanding when your dog deals with anxiety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ruff-weather-help-your-pet-battle-storm-anxiety-101631449521497.html
12-09-2021||India||Who is Bhupendra Patel, Gujarat CM, first-time MLA and minister?||Bhupendra Patel, popularly known as Bhupendrabhai Patel, will lead Gujarat in its next assembly election in 2022 as the party has announced his name as the successor of Vijay Rupani, who resigned from the post on Saturday. The announcement is as surprising as Vijay Rupani's resignation as 59-year-old Bhupendra Patel is not only the first-time Chief minister but also the first-time minister of Gujarat.Here is all you need to know about the new chief minister of Gujarat> Bhupendra Patel is a first-time minister but his association with the RSS goes long back.> He is believed to be a close aide of Anandiben Patel.> Bhupendra Patel became an MLA for the first time in 2017 when he defeated Congress's Shashikant Patel by over 1 lakh votes. He represents the Assembly constituency that is part of the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat represented by Union minister Amit Shah.> Before contesting the Assembly election, he was active in local politics.> Bhupendra Patel belongs to the Patidar community.> Bhupendra Patel held various administrative posts of civic bodies in past. He served as the chairman of the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority. He also served as the president of Memnagar Nagarpalika.> The new CM is an engineer by profession.> Bhupendra Patel also has a very clear political background with no criminal record, a report said.>  Patel is also a trustee of Sardardham Vishwa Patidar Kendra, an organisation dedicated to the socio-economic development of the Patidar community, PTI reported. Amid allegations and speculations that Bhupendra Patel will be a "remote-controlled" CM, Union home minister Amit Shah expressed confidence in Bhupendra Patel's leadership. "I believe that under the guidance of Narendra Modi, the state's sustainable development will keep up its momentum," Amit Shah tweeted.After Vijay Rupani resigned on Saturday, speculations regarding the probable contenders for the tough job to handle Prime Minister and home minister's home state in the election year were going on. Names of Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, deputy chief minister Nitin Patel were doing the rounds as the argument was that the BJP might want to replace soft-spoken Vijay Rupani with a strong, more mainstream politician. Bhupendra Patel's name was not among the frontrunners. But in the meeting, his name was unanimously accepted while he was sitting in the last row, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-is-bhupendra-patel-gujarat-cm-first-time-mla-and-minister-101631446281167.html

Voicing strong support for Kishor’s inclusion, Moily argued that it will be “quite beneficial” for Congress if he joins the party instead of working from outside. Congress president Sonia Gandhi has already held discussions with several senior leaders on the issue and is expected to take a final call on Kishor’s induction, news agency PTI reported last week."Let there be strong willpower to join hands with Sonia ji to ensure that the party's organisation is strengthened within a couple of months. This is what I proposed that Prashant Kishor can inject that kind of resurgence of the Congress party (that is needed) by plan and design," Moily told PTI.The former Union minister also warned against the institutionalisation of G-23, the group of 23 Congress leaders who had written to Sonia Gandhi seeking a complete overhaul of the party. Talking about the letter written to Sonia Gandhi last year, Moily said that he and some other leaders only signed on it to bring reforms to the party and “not to destroy it.” He accused some of the Congress leaders of misusing G-23."If they (some leaders) persist (with G-23) that means there is a vested interest for a few of them to work against the Congress party which we don't subscribe to and rather oppose it," the former Karnataka chief minister said.Speaking on the prospects of Congress, Moily asserted that the grand old party would be the fulcrum of the Opposition alliance in the 2024 general elections. Recounting the party's comeback in the past, he insisted that Congress remains the main plank of Indian politics."We may lose sometimes but it cannot be said that we will lose forever. For example, in 1977 we lost and in 1980 with all the allegations against her (Indira Gandhi), ultimately the people found that they wanted the Congress and Indira ji came back, this is the history of the Congress," Moily said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moily-bats-for-prashant-kishor-s-induction-in-congress-blasts-anti-reform-g-23-leaders-101631445049791.html

12-09-2021||India||Traffic moves without restrictions in Kochi as Kerala repeals Sunday lockdown||Traffic movement continued normally without any restrictions at Kochi in Kerala on the first Sunday after the state government repealed the full lockdown on Sundays earlier in the week, news agency ANI reported. Previously on September 7, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced that the weekend lockdown in the state would be lifted, along with the night curfew, citing a fall in the state’s test positivity rate.Night curfews from Monday to Saturday, between 10pm and 6am, were introduced in the state to control the high number of daily infections in the state following the Onam festival. Kerala reported over 30,000 new cases everyday for several days after the festival, following which the night curfew and the complete lockdown on Sundays were introduced to curb the spread of the virus.Also read | ‘Kerala accounts for 68.59% of India’s Covid-19 cases’, says health ministryHowever, on September 7, Vijayan said that the weekly positivity rate fell to 17.91% for the period between August 31 to September 6 from the 18.49% recorded during the previous week.Further, educational institutions would also be reopened in the state from October 4, the CM had announced. The state government has said that all teachers, staff and students should be vaccinated before they enter the premises again.While the daily new infections in Kerala have been high recently, it has been found decreasing in the past two days. The state logged 20,487 new cases on Saturday and 26,200 new cases on Friday after reporting over 30,000 cases on Thursday. At least 4,355,191 people have tested positive for the disease so far, according to a bulletin from the state government on Saturday while the death toll stood at 22,484.

12-09-2021||India||Heat and dust over Bishop’s ‘narcotic jihad’ comment yet to settle in Kerala||Hectic efforts are on to contain a communal divide in Kerala after the controversial remark of the Pala Bishop on “narcotic jihad” triggered a war of words between different communities. Many groups took out rallies outside the bishop’s house in the last two days supporting and decrying his statement even as religious and political leaders asked their supporters to maintain restraint and keep communal amity. While addressing a religious congregation in a church in Kuravilangad (Kottayam) Bishop Mar Joseph Kallaranghatt last Thursday said Catholic girls and youth were becoming victims of a “narcotic jihad” perpetrated by a section and decried authorities for turning a blind eye towards it. Many including, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Congress leaders, decried the Bishop for making a sweeping comment but the Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC), the highest body of Catholics in the state, and the Bharatiya Janata Party rallied behind him. The church-supported Deepika daily on Sunday wrote an editorial reminding the CM that he represents the whole state and he has to hear all sections before rejecting their woes. “Continuous appeasement politics is fast turning the state into a nursery of terror activities. The Bishop’s statement is based on facts and experience and instead of addressing it, some are turning against him. Those who think that he can be silenced by a barrage of criticism they are in fool’s world,” it wrote in a hard-hitting editorial asking the CM to examine his statement before rejecting it outright. The CM had expressed surprise over the Bishop’s comment, saying he was hearing the term, ‘narcotic jihad’ for the first time. “I never expected such a statement from a person like him. Persons holding such respectable positions should be careful while making such a statement. It will create rift and animosity. It is a fact that all religions, as well as the government, are concerned about the increased use of narcotics. It is not proper to put everything into the account of a particular section,” he said on Friday. Opposition leader VD Satheesan also criticised it and said it was a trap set by Sangh Parivar outfits. “It seems the Bishop’s statement is based on some social media comments. We all know most of these social media accounts are being managed by the parivar cronies. It is a planned to move to create a communal polarization,” he said. The Muslim League, an ally of the Congress, also called for restraint. But the KCBC defended the bishop saying he was cautioning against some dangerous tendencies prevailing in the society and they can’t be dismissed summarily as isolated incidents. “It is a fact that Kerala is facing certain serious social crises and among them rise in narcotic abuse tops. His words should be taken up responsibly, instead of attacking him,” it said. Minister of state of external affairs, V Muraleedharan, also criticised the attack on the Bishop. “It seems he spoke on the basis of conviction, not emotion. The term ‘narcotic jihad’ is not new, even world bodies said proceeds from narcotics was a major source of terror funding,” he said, adding, there was a concerted move to silence the Bishop. He said no one is against any community but all will have to isolate disruptive forces. Addressing a church ceremony, the Bishop came out against a particular community saying that Catholic girls and youth were targeted by it. “Wherever arms are not used, narcotic drugs are being used and Catholic girls turn victims. Some groups are functioning in the state to support them. To understand this, one needs to analyse how women from other religions landed in the Islamic State camps,” he said. He was referring to the trip of 21 people, including five converts to Islam, from north Kerala to Afghanistan in 2016 to reportedly join the Islamic State. Drug abuse on the rise Records show a sharp rise in drug-related cases and seizures in the state, indicating an increase in drug consumption in the state like several other parts of the country. In the past, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also highlighted how drugs was becoming a major issue across states.Even at the peak of the pandemic, many rave parties were busted in Kochi and hill destinations after a tip-off. According to state excise records, there is a sharp increase in the seizure of party drugs in Kerala. In 2018, contraband worth ₹650 crore was seized and in 2019 it went up to ₹720 crore while in 2020, it increased to ₹800 crore.A senior police officer, not willing to be named, admitted that drug addiction was a major issue of concern and higher seizure has is a result of increased vigilance by police. “It is a societal problem and cannot be solved through policing. We need societal reforms to deal with it,” said Prakash Singh, former Director-General of Police, Uttar Pradesh. While hearing a plea in February 2020, the High Court had observed that the drug abuse in the state was very high. “The scale of drug abuse in Kerala is unacceptably high. The major problem faced by probe agencies is their inability to plug supply channels that bring contraband to the state,” the court had said. Three cities from the state - Kochi, Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram - figure on the list of 127 most vulnerable cities for drug abuse by the Union ministry of social justice with a high prevalence of drug dependency. Last week MDMA (a synthetic drug called methylenedioxymethamphetamine) worth ₹13 crore was seized from a flat in Kochi. “It is a fact that the use of narcotic substances is high. It is a social evil and everyone will have to fight it united. People from all classes and religions are involved in such offences. But you can’t put everything into the account of a particular community,” said Muslim Educational Society president Dr Fazal Gafoor. Such statements will vitiate the social fabric of the state, he said and asked everyone to keep utmost restraint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heat-and-dust-over-bishop-s-narcotic-jihad-comment-yet-to-settle-in-kerala-101631444182757.html
12-09-2021||India||Bhupendra Patel to be new Gujarat Chief Minister, to take oath tomorrow||Bhupendra Patel will be the chief minister of Gujarat, the party decided on Sunday in its meeting to pick up the successor for Vijay Rupani, a day after Rupani resigned. Bhupendra Patel became an MLA in 2017 from the Ghatlodiya assembly constituency in Gujarat after defeating Congress's Shashikant Patel by a margin of over 1,17,000 votes. He also chaired the standing committee of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. "Bhupendra Patel elected as the new leader of BJP legislative party," Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar said announcing Patel's name as the next CM. The meeting to decide a successor of Vijay Rupani began at 3pm in the presence of central observers Tomar and Prahlad Joshi. It has been decided that the new CM will take oath on Monday. With a year left before the state goes to the polls, the removal of Rupani was seen as BJP's usual process of pre-poll shake-up, following feedback from the grassroots level. All eyes were on the crucial choice that the party makes to replace Vijay Rupani and observers believe that once again the party has gone for an unusual choice. Bhupendra Patel is not only the first time chief minister of the state but also a first-time minister.After Rupani resigned, several names were doing the rounds but choosing Bhupendra Patel was a surprise decision of the BJP as he was not among the frontrunners.  Apart from Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitin Patel's name was doing the rounds as a probable successor to which he reacted and said the new CM will have to be popular, strong, experienced and the one who is known and acceptable to all. "I am not here to express my personal opinion on the possible name. The exercise to elect the next chief minister is not just a work to fill in a vacancy. Gujarat should get a successful leadership so that the state can develop, keeping all together," PTI quoted Nitin Patel as saying before the meeting started.State BJP chief CR Paatil, who was also believed to be one of the contenders dismissed the speculation on Saturday and said he was not in the race. "Vijay Rupani has resigned from his post today. Naturally, there are a lot of names in the media for the new Chief Minister, including my name. I want to make it clear that I am not in any such race. Together with the new chief minister appointed by the party and Vijay Rupani, we will achieve our target of winning 182 out of 182 seats in the next assembly elections and work to strengthen the party," Paatil said.Rupani was the fourth chief minister to have resigned this year following Uttarakhand's Trivendra Singh Rawat, Tirath Singh Rawat and Karnataka's BS Yediyurappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupendra-patel-to-be-new-gujarat-chief-minister-101631442423654.html

The student is suspected to have died by suicide, driven allegedly by the fear of failure in his third attempt to clear the examination, police said.“There is no suicide note but circumstantial evidence points to death by suicide due to fear of the examination as he couldn’t clear it in the past to secure a medical seat,” said a senior police officer in Salem who did not wish to be named. The student was found dead in his room in the early hours of Sunday.“His parents were compelling him to prepare and clear NEET. The family also says that he was under pressure,” the officer added. The police have registered a case of unnatural death under Section 174 of the IPC and are conducting enquiries.Former All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, who hails from the region, accused the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam or DMK for not fulfilling its election promise to abolish NEET and thereby causing confusion among students who didn’t know whether the examinations will happen or not. “What happened to the promise of the DMK?” he tweeted.Reacting to the death of the student, chief minister M K Stalin, said in a statement that the DMK government will pass a bill in the Tamil Nadu assembly tomorrow seeking permanent exemption from NEET. “Let the injustice end,” he said. Since NEET was introduced in Tamil Nadu in 2017, more than a dozen medical aspirants have died by suicide either due to the fear of failure or failure in the exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-boy-dies-by-suicide-before-neet-stalin-promises-law-for-exemption-from-exam-101631439560307.html

12-09-2021||India||BJP MP Varun Gandhi raises farmers’ issues like sugarcane prices, subsidies||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh, Varun Gandhi has written to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath seeking more remuneration for sugarcane crop; subsidy in diesel and electricity prices and doubling of money given to farmers under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana.Gandhi has said that farmers in his constituency have raised the demand for re-visiting the prices of sugarcane crop, pointing out that the prices have gone up by just ₹10 per quintal in the last four years. He has sought an increase in the minimum support price (MSP) for sugarcane to at least ₹400 per quintal for the year 2021–22 keeping in view the increased input costs.While the UP government has claimed to have cleared almost 84% of dues to about 4.5 million sugar cane farmers of the state, Gandhi has pointed out that some dues still remain unpaid. The Yogi Adityanath government claims to have paid ₹1.42 lakh crore to sugarcane farmers in the past four years.Referring to the farming community’s alleged economic distress, the BJP MP pitched for a ₹200 per quintal bonus for farmers who grow wheat and rice apart from giving them seeds at cheaper rates and at least ₹20 per litre subsidy in diesel prices.Gandhi has also pitched for doubling the ₹6,000 per annum, paid to farmers under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana and accepting their demand to be included among workers, considered eligible to participate in the national minimum rural employment guarantee scheme.This is not the first time that Gandhi has raised issues related to the farmers. Last week, commenting on the ongoing farmers’ stir and the rally seeking a roll back of the farm laws, Gandhi said there was a need for “re-engagement” with the protesting farmers. Referring to the farmers as “our own flesh and blood”, Gandhi insisted that their “hardships” should be taken into consideration.“The last few years have been an economically tumultuous time more-so for our farmers who have borne the brunt on many angles,” said Varun Gandhi. “As a public representative who has written on rural economics and worked with farmers for years, I felt the requests I made to the UP CM are fiscally affordable and can be immediately actualised and would go a long way in normalising Govt-farmer relations”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mp-varun-gandhi-raises-farmers-issues-like-sugarcane-prices-subsidies-101631437400201.html
12-09-2021||India||Over 100 Myanmar nationals enter Mizoram after military offensive across border||Over 100 Myanmar nationals have entered two districts of Mizoram in the past few days following a military offensive across the border, the state government said. “I have heard that hundreds of people from Myanmar have entered Mizoram in the past few days. But I don’t have the exact figure of how many as I am under quarantine at present,” Mizoram home minister Lalchamliana said. According to news reports “intense fighting” has broken out between armed civilians opposed to the military rule in Myanmar and the neighbouring nation’s army in the past few days near the border with Mizoram. The fresh influx is believed to comprise Myanmarese nationals trying to flee the violence. Since March this year, thousands of Myanmar nationals, especially those residing close to the border with India, have entered Mizoram. According to official figures, over 10,000 of them are residing in the northeastern state at present. “There has been a fresh influx of Myanmar nationals into Mizoram in recent days due to fighting just across the border. These people have entered Champhai and Hnahthial districts. I believe they will return as soon as the situation across the border improves,” Mizoram chief secretary Lalnunmawia Chuaungo said. Mizoram and Myanmar share a 510 km border. Most of the refugees who have entered Mizoram are from the Chin state of Myanmar, which borders six districts of the state—Champhai, Hnahthial, Serchhip, Saitual, Siaha and Lawngtlai. Mizos and Chins share close ethnic ties. “Since the past few days several groups of people in small batches have entered our district through various border points. We don’t have the exact figure of the influx in recent days. At present the district has around 730 people who came in during the past few months. They are being accommodated by village elders in 6-7 villages,” said Saizikpuii, additional deputy commissioner Hnahthial. “On Wednesday, 35 Myanmar nationals, most of them old and infirm women and small children, entered our district. Local NGOs have accommodated them in temporary shelters built away from Zawlsei village,” Maria CT Zuali, deputy commissioner of Champhai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-100-myanmar-nationals-enter-mizoram-after-military-offensive-across-border-101631435480134.html

12-09-2021||India||India, Australia converges on Kabul, Indo-Pacific, set stage for QUAD summit||With India and Australia on the same page on Afghanistan and Indo-Pacific, the stage is set for the QUAD summit in Washington as External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar leaves for the US on September 20 to attend the UNGA and prepare the groundwork for the first bilateral summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden.While EAM Jaishankar will fly to New York and be in Washington on September 22 evening when PM Modi lands, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval will be accompanying the PM on Air India One. PM Modi will address the UNGA on September 25 morning and then depart for India unless some bilateral meetings are fixed at the last minute on the sidelines of the UNGA. EAM Jaishankar will be holding bilateral meetings with other foreign ministers throughout the UNGA high segment week starting September 21 and will return later.During the US visit, the focus will be on Taliban ruled Afghanistan as it is increasingly becoming evident that the Sunni Islamist forces will continue to remain ultra-conservative and will be brutal in approach to women and the other minorities. With Pakistani ISI overtly involved in political and military affairs of the Taliban government in Kabul, the global community will be holding Islamabad responsible in case any terrorist attack emanates from Afghanistan in future. The QUAD physical summit will discuss the Afghanistan situation, the spread of coronavirus, Indo-Pacific and climate change in detail with all the participants virtually on the same page on key issues. In 2021 Taliban ruled Afghanistan a new power axis has emerged with Pakistan, Qatar and Turkey being the main players with Chinese support unlike Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE support and legitimacy to the Sunni Pashtuns during 1996-2001. The role played by Qatari intelligence chief Mohammed bin Ahmed Al-Misnad in first facilitating the so-called Doha process and then giving a private plane to the entourage of UN-designated terrorist Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, now deputy PM, to land in Kandahar after the Taliban seized Kabul cannot be underestimated. Apart from Pakistani ISI, the closeness of Qatar with the Taliban is evident as the latter has made the Kabul airport operational.The other important issue to resonate during PM Modi’s visit to the US will be the Indo-Pacific and right to free navigation in the South China Sea with Beijing getting increasing belligerent in enforcing its unfounded maritime claims in the region. The QUAD navies, on the other hand, are routinely exercising in Indo-Pacific with Malabar Exercise just concluded off the coast of Guam last month.The first two plus two dialogue between India and Australia on Friday clearly showed that both countries have similar concerns over Indo-Pacific and Afghanistan as Canberra’s position is different from the pro-Pakistan stand of the UK in the Taliban takeover of Kabul. Just as India is being pressed by Beijing all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Australia has a running battle with China asking investigation of alleged human rights abuses by the Australian military during deployment in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-australia-converges-on-kabul-indo-pacific-set-stage-for-quad-summit-101631421377941.html

12-09-2021||India||Odisha: 20,035 excess deaths in 2020 amid Covid deaths underreporting cloud||Odisha reported 20,035 excess deaths registered by the state’s Civil Registration System in 2020 as compared to 2019 amid allegations that the state under-reported Covid-19 deaths last year, data obtained through Right to Information (RTI) application by HT shows.As per the data, Odisha registered 342,947 deaths in 2019 while it was 362,982 in 2020, indicating that some of the 20,000-odd excess deaths in 2020 may possibly have been caused by Covid-19.In 2017, the state recorded 322,660 deaths while in 2018 it was 328,799, as per the Civil Registration System. As many as 300,884 deaths (provisional figure) have been recorded at the state’s 430 registration units between January and September this year.As per health experts, excess deaths are defined as the difference between the observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers of deaths in a time period. The excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Provisional data during 2020 showed Odisha saw a major jump in deaths from September last year when the Covid mortalities were rising. As per the provisional data of month-wise deaths in 2020, 5,000 more deaths were reported in September and October last year compared to the previous year, while 10,000 excess deaths per month were recorded in November and December.The state government, however, announced only 1,876 Covid deaths in 2020 while 6,216 deaths have been reported in 2021 so far. As per the provisional data, the number of deaths reported between September and December 2020 was around 10 times the official Covid toll for the same period. While 150,000 deaths were registered across the state in those four months, only 1,356 Covid deaths were acknowledged by the government.Incidentally, in May this year, more than 1,000 deaths have been reported from 20 districts with Ganjam recording the maximum 4,641 followed by Cuttack (3,754), Bolangir (3,716), Sundargarh(3,619) and Khurda (3,571). Early this week, Orissa high court had pointed out several discrepancies in a government affidavit while hearing a PIL over Covid deaths in the state. The state government in its affidavit had said there were 3,097 deaths between July 15 and August 31 this year, while in another affidavit filed at a later date, the government said there were 8,022 deaths in Odisha due to the pandemic as on August 31. The court indicated it was not satisfied by government’s data reporting and also the counting methodology. Noted microbiologist Dr Tribhuvan Mohapatra said that some of the excess deaths witnessed last year may be due to Covid or causes linked to Covid. “It is quite possible that some people in rural areas may not have been able to travel to Covid hospital or have not been tested at all before they died. Some may have even died of post-Covid complications which the governments don’t count as Covid deaths. Many others who have been suffering from cancer or other chronic diseases may have died due to lack of medical facilities as health infrastructure in most states were diverted for Covid treatment,” said Dr Mohapatra.State BJP leader Mohan Majhi said the death figures showed that the government had been misleading everyone by hiding the actual data on Covid casualty. “The suppression of fact from the public is a cognisable offence and a crime against humanity. Children who have lost their parents to the pandemic will be deprived of the government welfare schemes for orphans. The government should publish a white paper on actual Covid deaths,” said Majhi.Similarly, Gouranga Mohapatra of Jana Swasthya Abhiyan, an NGO working in the health sector, said they have been alleging undercounting of Covid deaths since last year. “The government for long has been hiding details about deaths due to diarrhoea and other illnesses. It did the same with Covid deaths,” he alleged.Dr Samiran Panda, head of the epidemiology division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, however said that one can’t jump to conclusions that excessive deaths were due to Covid. “It is true that last year several cancer patients as well as those with other comorbidities did not get the attention they deserved due to pressure on health infrastructure. So each of the deaths need to be analysed and studied before drawing any definite conclusion,” he said.However, additional director of the health department, Dr Ramachandra Rout attributed the excessive numbers to better reporting by ASHA workers. “As ASHA workers are getting an incentive of ₹100 for each death that they report in their locality, the reporting has increased. Besides, over the last 4 years, Odisha is witnessing rise in death rates and a decline in birth rates. So there is nothing abnormal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-20-035-excess-deaths-in-2020-amid-covid-deaths-underreporting-cloud-101631417118338.html

12-09-2021||India||Ram Vilas Paswan death anniversary: Top leaders, ex-contenders among invitees||The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in Bihar will on Sunday observe the ‘barsi’ or the first death anniversary of its founder and stalwart leader Ram Vilas Paswan, who died in October last year after undergoing heart surgery. A Union minister in the first and second Modi ministries, nine-times Lok Sabha member and Rajya Sabha MP Ram Vilas Paswan left a lasting legacy in Bihar's political scenario.Also Read | LJP denies speculation of Paswan family’s reluctance to vacate 12 Janpath bunglowChirag Paswan, LJP leader and son of Ram Vilas, will be organising the mega ‘barsi’ event on Sunday in Bihar's capital of Patna. Speaking to reporters a day before, Chirag said that he was ‘desperately seeking’ an appointment with Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) chief and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who he wanted to invite to the event. Notably, Chirag was reported to have burnt his bridges with many of the party's political rivals, most notably Kumar, ahead of the assembly polls last year when he pulled out of the NDA vowing to defeat the JD(U) leader against who he levelled many accusations, which included “misbehaviour” with his late father.Although it has not yet been confirmed if Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief and former chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav will be attending the ‘barsi’, speculation is rife in Bihar ever since it was reported that Chirag had extended him an invite for the event. Lalu's son, Tejashwi Yadav, wrote a letter to Nitish Kumar on Friday, suggesting that the birth anniversaries of former Union ministers, including that of the late Ram Vilas Paswan, be declared state functions.Although the LJP is fraught with issues concerning party leadership, its current chief and Ram Vilas' brother Pashupati Kumar Paras has said that he will attend the death anniversary event on September 12. The PTI news agency noted that Paras is embroiled in a bitter dispute with his nephew, Chirag, to claim the legacy of the late Paswan in Bihar, but the conflict has not deterred either of the politicians from paying out their respects to the party's founding member.Also Read | From leadership aspirations to losing LJP, how Chirag Paswan got outmaneuvered“I will definitely attend the event on September 12,” Paras said on Friday. “It is an event to mark the death anniversary of my elder brother [Ram Vilas Paswan]. There is no question of not attending it. Whatever I am today, it is because of his blessings, although I have the good wishes of the Prime Minister [Narendra Modi] as well.”Top national leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, and Congress president Sonia Gandhi have also received invites to the event. Chirag also met President Ram Nath Kovind earlier this week and extended him an invite to the event.Ram Vilas Paswan died in Patna on October 8, 2020, after being hospitalised and undergoing heart surgery. He was the cabinet minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-vilas-paswan-death-anniversary-top-leaders-ex-contenders-among-invitees-101631403389582.html

The flight was carrying 190 passengers and crew. It was the deadliest commercial aviation disaster in the country in 10 years, claiming 21 lives. Another Air India Express flight from Dubai overshot Mangaluru’s table-top runway in 2010. It slid down a hill and left 158 people dead.“A large number of similar accidents/incidents that have continued to take place, more so in AIXL (Air India Express Ltd), reinforce existing systemic failures within the aviation sector. These usually occur due to prevailing safety culture that give rise to errors, mistakes and violation of routine tasks performed by people operating within the system,” the report said.It noted the actions and decisions of the pilot in command) were steered by a “misplaced motivation to land back at Kozhikode to operate next day morning flight AXB 1373.”The report also noted that the possibility of visual illusions causing errors in distance and depth perception could not be ruled out due to low visibility and sub-optimal performance of the windshield wiper in rain.“The AIXL pilot training program lacked effectiveness and did not impart the requisite skills for performance enhancement,” it said.AAIB in August last year appointed a team of five investigators to lead the probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilots-violation-of-sops-caused-kozhikode-crash-probe-report-101631396816405.html
12-09-2021||India||‘Why has Govt not used its majority in House to pass Women's Reservation Bill?’: Brinda Karat||Twenty-five years after it was first introduced in Parliament, the Women’s Reservation Bill is yet to become a reality. In an interview with Hindustan Times, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s politburo member and former MP, Brinda Karat, talks about whether this proposed law is still relevant, and the significance of reservation for women in politics. Edited excerpts:Has anything changed since the introduction of the bill in 1996?We were all so happy and felt that it was going to usher in a mechanism to fill the gap between men and women, but just the next day, BJP MPs raised the issue of reservation for women belonging to the Other Backward Classes within this bill. Since then, Parliament and the successive governments have never thought to put the bill at the top of their agenda.How is it that despite enjoying the support of two major parties — the Congress and BJP — the legislation seems impossible?I don’t think it’s impossible, it just requires political will... At the end of the day, political will ensured that the bill was discussed, debated and adopted (in the RS). So, why is it that the Centre, which has pushed through several anti-worker, anti-farmer legislation... has not used its strong majority in the House to pass this bill?... One of the reasons is also their cultural framework... One of the objections was... our women whose main job is to bring up children, preferably sons, what is going to happen to that?But, why didn’t the UPA push it through between 2010 and 2014?They didn’t have the numbers... they were dependent on certain parties which were not in favour... they have had three committees... I don’t think any other bill has gone through that torturous process... A lot of women question the need for quotas? But, look at the figures — in the 1st Parliament in 1952, we had 24 women. In 2019, we have 78. So, if it takes 73 years to get about 50 more women in Parliament, how many years is it going to take to reach one-third reservation without a quota?The government is proud of the fact that they have two Cabinet ministers, top ministers, including the finance minister, as women. It counts for something.Certainly... increasing the number of women in leadership positions holds an important message for the country. The question, however, is: Why are they not raising their voices?...Do you think, in the last 25 years, things have become easier for women in politics?Women have gained confidence... The patriarchal conservative framework that “aurat ka sthaan ghar pe hai, pehle maa bano, fir kuch aur bano ” has changed.Why is the bill still relevant?Patriarchy is bad for everyone — men, women and the Indian society... bringing the legislation will weaken the patriarchal process..., reduce the inequality in public spaces..., and will further strengthen the Indian democracy.With inputs by Amitoj Singh Kalsi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-has-centre-not-used-its-majority-in-house-to-pass-the-bill-brinda-karat-101631395863510.html
12-09-2021||India||Why BJP pit youth leader Priyanka Tibrewal against CM Mamata in Bhawanipore?||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s decision to field a youth leader Priyanka Tibrewal, who lost at least two elections, against TMC chief Mamata Banerjee from Bhawanipore constituency in the upcoming by-poll may have raised some eyebrows, but senior BJP leaders said that a lot of thought has gone into it before the announcement was made. Tibrewal is the vice-president of the BJP’s youth wing in the state and an advocate, who played a pivotal role in the BJP’s legal battle in the Calcutta high court on post poll violence, which ultimately led a five-judge bench to order for a CBI probe. “Only a woman candidate would be able to mount a direct attack against another woman candidate. A male candidate would have to think twice before making a public statement against a woman candidate. Mamata Banerjee starts crying foul whenever she is on the back foot and plays the woman-victim card. We had to take a safeguard against this,” said a senior BJP leader. A second BJP leader said that as Tibrewal has been in the forefront of the legal battle related to post-poll violence, projecting her from Bhawanipore against Mamata Banerjee would help to boost the morale of the party workers. Tibrewal had earlier contested the civic polls in 2015, but lost. In the recently held assembly polls she was fielded from Entally seat in north Kolkata. This time too she lost to TMC’s lightweight leader Swarna Kamal Saha by more than 58,000 votes. “We have pitted one defeated leader against another. Mamata Banerjee too was defeated four months back by BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari. As far as the question of fielding a youth leader is concerned, Tibrewal is a good fighter. In 1984 Mamata Banerjee had defeated Somnath Chatterjee. Before that who knew the name of Banerjee,” Dilip Ghosh, BJP’s state president told the media. BJP leaders said that Rudranil Ghosh, the party’s candidate who lost from Bhawanipore in the recently held assembly polls, had also expressed interest to contest against Banerjee in the upcoming polls. He had lost to Sovandeb Chatterjee, a TMC veteran, by around 28,000 votes. But BJP leaders in Delhi chose Tibrewal. “While on the one hand the woman-to-woman fight factor was there, another factor which could have played a role is the decision behind selecting Tibrewal is that a sizeable population of the electors in Bhawanipore are Sikhs and Gujratis,” said a BJP leader. A BJP leader said that a section of leaders in the state had wanted that a Bengali face should be pitted from Bhawanipore so that the TMC may not play the ‘outsider’ card again this time. In the 2021 polls, the party had judiciously played the ‘outsider’ card in its favour. The final call was however taken by the BJP leadership in Delhi. “The BJP’s unit in West Bengal had sent a list, comprising some names, to the party’s leadership in Delhi. The name of Rudranil Ghosh, who had contested from Bhawanipore in the recently held assembly election, was also there. The final call was made by the party’s top leaders,” said a BJP leader. Banerjee, who filed her nomination later in the day, has to win the bypoll to become a member of the assembly in order to continue in the chair. She had taken oath on May 5 and must get elected within six months as per protocols – November 5. “The people of Bhawanipore have already chosen their leader. Let the BJP bring all their central leaders and field any one in Bhawanipore. When the results are declared on May 3, they would lose by a record margin,” said Tapas Roy, veteran TMC leader and a party spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-bjp-pit-youth-leader-priyanka-tibrewal-against-cm-mamata-in-bhawanipore-101631389388818.html
12-09-2021||India||Monsoon likely to withdraw late this year, Met predicts; more rain in store||The monsoon has entered an active phase from Saturday because of a low-pressure system that will travel across central and northwest India, bringing the region widespread and heavy rain over the next four to five days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned on Saturday.The monsoon starts waning in September and usually begins withdrawing from September 17.But the Met department’s extended range forecast indicates that there is likely to be widespread rain over the country, including northwest India, till around September 30.Normally, around six depressions form through the course of the monsoon season, but this time the first monsoon depression is likely to form only in the next 24 to 48 hours.Also Read| Intense 3-hour rain spell brings Delhi to a grinding halt yet again“Normally, however, July and August are the main monsoon months, when active spells are common. We have also indicated that monsoon deficiency will reduce and settle in the normal category by the end of the season,” said OP Sreejith, head, climate monitoring and prediction group, IMD.“The formation of fewer low-pressure systems compared to the climatology and absence of their longer westward movements during August contributed to the large deficient rainfall in central India as well as all India,” the IMD said in a statement on Friday.So far, the monsoon deficiency is 7% across the country.August received 24% less rainfall than it usually does, but September has so far seen 16.4% excess rain, showed data from the Met department.A Negative Indian Ocean Dipole over the tropical Indian Ocean — a phenomenon where the western Indian ocean becomes colder than the eastern one and which is unfavourable for monsoon — prevailed throughout August, contributing to deficient rainfall.There were also fewer typhoons in the West Pacific and so there was an absence of westward movement of their remnants into Bay of Bengal. This led to fewer low-pressure systems forming over Bay of Bengal.“But now West Pacific is very active. The sea surface temperatures over central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean are also cooler indicating weak La Nina setting in. This is also associated with good rains,” added Sreejith.La Niña refers to the large-scale cooling of the ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, coupled with changes in the tropical atmospheric circulation, namely winds, pressure and rainfall. It usually has the opposite impacts on weather and climate as El Niño, which is the warm phase of the so-called El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.Also Read| Arrival area of Delhi airport’s T3 floods, over 100 flights delayed“Monsoon will be in its active phase for the next 4-5 days. This is mainly because a low-pressure area is lying over east central and adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal which will intensify and move west-northwest wards and monsoon trough will be active. The combination of these two will bring widespread rains to central India starting from Odisha covering Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Delhi, and some more parts of northwest India during the next few days,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.Heavy rains in September can impact standing crops, particularly pulses, experts said.“Pulses are particularly vulnerable to damage. However, the heavy rain spell will fill reservoirs in Gujarat, Rajasthan where there was a very long dry spell in August which will be useful for the Rabi crop,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/monsoon-likely-to-withdraw-late-this-year-met-predicts-more-rain-in-store-101631388597445.html
12-09-2021||India||Failed medicos disrupt OPD at Patna Medical College Hospital, demand re-evaluation||Some MBBS second year students of 2019 batch forced closure of the outdoor patient departments (OPDs) at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) on Saturday as a mark of protest, demanding re-evaluation of answer sheets of the MBBS first professional examination, conducted by the Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU) in March. As many as 423 of the 1,140 MBBS students (37.10%) who appeared in the exams across nine medical colleges in Bihar have failed the first university examinations, in what was the worst performance by medicos since the inception of the AKU in 2010, university officials said. Students, who accessed copies of their answer-sheets through the Right to Information Act, claimed that some of their correct answers remained unmarked during evaluation. The agitating students, who staged a protest near the principal’s office, forced closure of the OPD by 10.30 am, two hours after the services began on Saturday. They also met the principal and gave him a representation, addressed to the AKU vice-chancellor, demanding re-evaluation of answer-sheets. The students said they would continue to agitate and allow only emergency services to function at the hospital if their demands were not met. PMCH principal Dr Vidyapati Choudhary sympathised with the students whose correct answers remained unmarked, while some had failed narrowly. “There were around 5-6 students who were not awarded marks for answers evaluated to be correct. I spoke to the registrar of university and have forwarded their application for consideration. A few students have failed by just one or two marks. Still, our result has been better than most other medical colleges, as 19 out of the 172 students who appeared in the examination had failed,” said Dr Choudhary. The principal said the undergraduate students, for the first time, interrupted OPD services twice during the day, but he got the services restored within an hour or two. The medicos had earlier demanded that the failed students be promoted on the basis of their internal marks, obtained in the first and second semester exams, conducted by the respective medical colleges. The National Medical Commission, which governs the medical curriculum, however, does not allow it, said university officials. The AKU stand so far has been that medicos who have flunked the exams should appear in the supplementary exams to be held from September 27. Medicos of Patna’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital had protested on the AKU campus on September 1, after the university declared the results on August 30. Protests were also reported earlier at the Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences in Pawapuri and the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital, Gaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/failed-medicos-disrupt-opd-at-patna-medical-college-hospital-demand-reevaluation-101631388248854.html

12-09-2021||India||25 years on, bill seeking 33% women in Parliament awaits nod||Over a decade ago, former Union minister Kumari Selja found herself at the side of late law minister HR Bhardwaj, who was set to introduce the “new and improved” Women’s Reservation Bill in the Rajya Sabha in 2008. The Bill sought 33% reservation for women in Parliament and state legislative assemblies, and promised a quota for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes within the ambit of the umbrella legislation.But before long, there was bedlam in the Upper House. Samajwadi Party members attempted to snatch and shred the Bill, before it could even be discussed, with Selja finding herself protecting both Bhardwaj and his Bill.Also Read| ‘Why has Govt not used its majority in House to pass Women's Reservation Bill?’“Ambika Soni (former Congress Union minister) and I were on either side of Bhardwaj as those from the opposition and even some of our allies were up in arms against the Bill,” said Selja, the current Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president. The women, including Renuka Chowdhury, Jayanti Natarajan and Alka Balram Kshatriya, formed a ring around Bhardwaj to ensure the passage of the Bill through Rajya Sabha. The Bill was inevitably sent to the standing committee for review after which it was reintroduced and passed by the Upper House in 2010. However, it soon lapsed with the 15th Lok Sabha.This was the fourth time the Bill was introduced in Parliament and failed to go through. First introduced in 1996, the Bill has witnessed a tumultuous journey in Parliament. It has been opposed on many grounds, from perpetuating a “proxy culture’’ or a similar concept of “sarpanch pati” to stressing the lack of merit. Those backing the Bill hailed it as a means to empower women who continue to remain marginalised in the political discourse.On Sunday, it will be 25 years since the first time the Women’s Reservation Bill was introduced in Parliament.According to PRS Legislative Research, a non-profit legislative watchdog, “There are 78 women MPs in Lok Sabha today. This is the highest number in the history of the House. The first LS only had 24 women members.”But both experts and opposition parties argue that even as India envisions a new egalitarian society that envisages equal rights for men and women, the reservation Bill remains crucial as its need has not diminished, especially considering that the rise in the number of women parliamentarians is marginal.Women’s reservation: The logic, the historyFirst introduced in 1996, the Bill aimed to achieve 33% reservation for women in Parliament and state assemblies. The idea for the Bill originated from a constitutional amendment in 1993 that stated that one third of sarpanch (or council leader) positions in the gram panchayat should be reserved for women.The Bill was opposed on many counts, with critics arguing it would underline the lack of women’s merit as they would enter on the basis of reservation. It was then reintroduced in 1998, 1999 and 2008. “Opponents argue that it would perpetuate the unequal status of women since they would not be perceived to be competing on merit. They also contend that this policy diverts attention from the larger issues of electoral reform such as criminalisation of politics and inner party democracy,” PRS Legislative Research stated in a research paper.India globally ranks 148th in a list of 193 countries vis-à-vis women’s representation in Parliament, according to the global data on national parliamentarians by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). This despite the fact that the country’s present number of women parliamentarians is at an all-time high of over 14%, which still falls way short of the international average of nearly 22%.The head of outreach, PRS Legislative Research, Chakshu Roy, said studies indicate political reservation has increased redistribution of resources in favour of the groups that benefit from reservation. “So far, there have been four unsuccessful attempts to bring a women’s reservation Bill in Parliament. On the last two occasions, copies of the Bill were snatched and torn in the House,” he said.“Reservation for women in panchayats has also shown that women elected under reservation invest more in the public goods closely linked to women’s concerns. On the other hand, a women member in the constituent assembly argued that reservation of constituencies for women will result in them not being considered for general seats, despite their competency.”Also Read| International Women's Day: Women MPs push for 33% reservation in ParliamentCommunist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) (CPI-ML) leader Kavita Krishnan said there may be technicalities in the Bill that could be examined but the essence of it is the need of the hour. “This is not the time to look at technicalities,” she said, adding, “There already is a draft Bill, it should be put to vote.”Selja concurred with the sentiment. “In our time, there was a will but not a majority. Today, the ruling party has a majority but does not have the will, the situation is different,” she said.Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Sushmita Dev said reservation of seats for women alone will not result in empowerment of women. “It would also have to be accompanied with other political reforms,” she said.Just follow our model: BJPShazia Ilmi, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson, said the need for women’s reservation was unnecessary if one “follows the ruling party model”. “The BJP rewards people on merit, irrespective of whether it is men or women,” she said. “Look at the number of women ministers in the Union cabinet and even the number of women parliamentarians. It is the highest number we have ever seen. Moreover, even in the national executive, BJP has a significant number of women.”Opposition party leaders, however, feel the BJP has aligned itself to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideology that excludes women. Dev, who recently joined the TMC from Congress, said there was no space for women in the Sangh. “BJP and RSS ideology is completely against women…They do tokenism, which is counter-productive to women empowerment,” she added.Countering the argument of proxy representation, Dev said women being subjected to such scrutiny was unfair as men never were evaluated on similar grounds. “How is that we always talk about incompetent women, aren’t there incompetent men?” she asked.“This is a double standard. There as many competent women as there are men. Nearly 14 lakh (1.4 million) women are part of the panchayati raj structure, are we trying to imply they are all incompetent?”She also highlighted that West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee led by example when it comes to empowering women in positions of power. “Look at the number of women MPs, it is greater than the percentage share of any party,” Dev said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-years-on-bill-seeking-33-women-in-parliament-awaits-nod-101631387888722.html

During his address at the India-Singapore mediation summit in July, Chief Justice of India, NV Ramana, had favoured a special enactment that would make mediation mandatory before litigation while citing the backlog of 30 million cases in the country’s courts and the rising costs of litigation. “Given the growing scope of mediation, it’s time for India to enter mission mode. To popularise mediation as a cheaper and faster dispute resolution mechanism, a movement needs to be launched,” Justice Ramana had said.“Prescribing mediation as a mandatory first step for resolution of every allowable dispute will go a long way in promoting mediation. Perhaps, an omnibus law in this regard is needed to fill the vacuum,” the judge had added. Barring a handful of legislations, there is no provision for mandatory mediation or other alternative dispute resolution processes such as conciliation and arbitration in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-table-bill-on-arbitration-in-winter-session-of-parliament-rijiju-101631387408539.html

During the incident, a video of former Karnal Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Ayush Sinha purportedly telling police personnel to “break the heads” of anyone who tried to cross the barricades went viral. On September 2, he was transferred out of Karnal and posted as additional secretary of Citizen Resources Information Department.Also Read| Farmers’ protests sponsored by Cong with eye on Punjab polls: VijFollowing the incident, the farmers called for Sinha’s suspension and an investigation into police action. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) – a platform for farm unions –began an indefinite protest at the main entrance of the Karnal mini-secretariat on September 7 over the demands.“A judicial inquiry of the incident (lathi-charge) at the Bastara toll plaza on August 28 will be conducted by a retired high court judge and the judge will submit the report in one month. During the investigation, IAS officer Ayush Sinha will remain on leave,” said additional chief secretary to Haryana government, Devender Singh in a joint conference along with farmer leaders.The additional chief secretary also announced that government jobs would be given to two family members of a farmer, who, the protesters claimed, died after being injured during the lathicharge. The administration had earlier rejected this claim.Also Read| Karnal stir to mirror Delhi agitation: Rakesh Tikait“The Haryana government will give jobs to two family members of deceased farmer Satish Kajal under sanctioned posts at DC rate in Karnal,” Singh announced.The farmers held three rounds of talks with the administration over their demands during which they pressed for an FIR against Sinha.“We had taken a legal opinion and found that judicial inquiry is a better option than the registration of FIR. And the FIR will be registered later if he was found guilty in the investigation,” said farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni Charuni, who also addressed the joint press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-call-off-karnal-protest-as-haryana-govt-agrees-to-demands-101631386628888.html

In this regard, the Office of Registrar General of India has issued a communication to Chief Registrars of all states and Union Territories.In the event where the next of kin of the deceased are not satisfied with the cause of death given in MCCD, their application shall be forwarded by the concerned state/UT to a four-member committee that will verify and issue remedial directions, including issuance of official document for Covid-19 death within 30 days of submission of the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-dead-within-30-days-of-testing-positive-to-be-considered-covid-fatalities-centre-101631386390014.html

12-09-2021||India||Playing sport comes at a price in Bengaluru||Ashish Adhikari came to Bengaluru in 2018 after he got a job as a graphic designer in the city. A sport enthusiast, one of the first things Adhikari searched for in the city, after an apartment, was a football ground. The 26-year-old said everyone guided him towards football turfs in the city, which were good but playing there required shelling out money. “Each game used to have around 10 people and the ground cost was ₹1,500 per hour. Every month, I ended up paying ₹900 for football and since I play badminton as well, my monthly expenses on sport were around ₹1,700 per month,” he said, adding that back home in Assam playing sports didn’t cost a penny. With the public playgrounds in the city shrinking with time, more sports enthusiasts are moving towards the artificial grounds, which come at a price. Reuben Varghese Kurien, who runs Bangalore Football Turf in east Bengaluru’s Hennur, said people are ready to pay for better facilities that offer safety. “Most of the public grounds in the city are crowded and chances of injuries are high because the grounds are not maintained. So, most of the customers want the flexibility – availability of a good-quality ground at a time convenient to them,” he said. According to Kurien, there are more than 100 such grounds in Bengaluru and at least 90 of them were already existing when he launched his football turf in 2016. “There are at least 100 people playing here every day,” he said. One of the reasons for Bengaluru’s shrinking public spaces, especially public grounds, has been a result of poor planning and policies. Ravindran DS, a former Indian Forest Service officer who conducted research on public spaces in Bangalore, said that over the period of time, Bengaluru was showing an alarming reduction in the available public space, which includes playgrounds. “If you look at the Karnataka town country planning Act (1961), it said there should be at least 15% open area. In the development plans that came in the 1980s, 1990s, and in 2005, a similar percentage of public place was proposed. But it never happened,” he said. The retired officer said that during his study in 2005, he found that Bengaluru was not anywhere near the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendation of having a 10 metre square area per person. “From having an 8 metre square per person in 1968, we had come down to around 1 metre square per person. It was a drastic drop. The built-up area in Bengaluru was around 71%, whereas it should have been 30%,” added the official. He attributed the change to two reasons. Firstly, bad planning and secondly, a cultural change. “The governments have not been able to enforce the regulations they had brought in. Secondly, culturally speaking, Bengaluru didn’t have a ‘vertical growth’ with multiple apartments coming up until recently. When there was an explosion of population, the bad planning meant there was little public space available,” he said. Leo Saldana, Bengaluru-based environmental activist, said the impact of not having a healthy ratio between open spaces and population was seen during the recent lockdowns. “Those living in congested neighborhoods suffered more (because of lack of access to public spaces). So far there is no study on its impact but a good way to assess the impact of lack of access to public spaces, for release of human energy, is the Nimhans’ reporting that from getting a few calls before lockdown, they are getting around 250 calls per day (during the lockdown) from distressed children,” he said. Senior BBMP officials claimed that the city had around 256 public playgrounds. However, for a population over 10.2 million, these numbers are not enough, say activists. “We have identified more places that can be developed as playgrounds and we are in the process of developing them,” said a senior official of BBMP’s estate department. “But compared to many metros in the city, Bengaluru still has a large number of playgrounds. As the city is developing further, we are ensuring such facilities are part of the development plan,” the official added. While BBMP’s claims get objections from activists, enthusiast like Adhikari has to shell out money to play any sport of his choice in the city and for those who cannot afford it, the option is to fight out for space in overcrowded playgrounds of Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/playing-sport-comes-at-a-price-in-bengaluru-101631385968345.html
12-09-2021||India||Kerala House Speaker slams drop in India’s place on press freedom index||India’s position in the World Press Freedom Index is declining and this is the time when journalists should be on the constant lookout for anything that could jeopardise secularism and unity of the people, Kerala Assembly Speaker M B Rajesh said on Saturday. He said in today’s world, media is facing direct attacks across the globe and it means democracy is in danger.Delivering a speech at the launch of a website of Global Malayalee Press Club (GMPC) here, the Speaker said journalists must not become propagandists of those who divide society. Leader of Opposition in the Assembly V D Satheesan warned those who misuse the media. In a sensitive period like this, the challenge before the media is to handle issues which affect unity of society, he said.“The other day, there was news of journalists being brutally attacked in Afghanistan came. It is easy for us to talk about Afghanistan but it will be difficult for us to say about India, where an editor Gauri Lankesh was shot. Many local journalists have been killed. India’s position in the World Press Freedom Index is declining. That means democracy is in danger,” Rajesh said. As per the World Press Freedom Index, 2021, of Paris-based Reporters without Borders, India is in the 142nd position among 180 countries. India’s rank was 133 in 2016 which came down to 142 in 2020.“This is the time when journalists should be on the constant lookout for anything that could jeopardise secularism and unity of the people,” he said.Apart from Rajesh and Satheesan, Ernakulam Member of Parliament Hibi Eden and others participated in the launch of the website of GMPC, an international network of Malayalee journalists and media community.“We will be very popular tonight but social media can make us unpopular within hours. There are people who misuse social media. Similarly, there are people who misuse the media. In a sensitive period like this, the challenge before the media is to handle issues which affect the unity of society,” Satheesan said.Rajesh said society, these days, is witnessing people holding responsible positions making irrational and irresponsible statements. “Not to become the propagandists of those, who say things detrimental to the communal unity and harmony of a society like Kerala, is an important qualification of a journalist,” Rajesh said.George Kallivayalil, president of GMPC, addressing the gathering, gave an insight into the formation of such an initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-house-speaker-slams-drop-in-india-s-place-on-press-freedom-index-101631385849956.html
12-09-2021||India||Kerala begins seroprevalence study on Covid-19 situation||The Kerala government is conducting a seroprevalence study to take stock of the spread of Covid-19 virus among the people in the state.Health minister Veena George said the study began earlier this month and is expected to be completed by the end of September.The study would help understand the Covid seropositivity rate among various age groups including children, she told reporters here.“The Health Department is conducting the seroprevalence study. It is expected to completed by this month end. It will be carried out among children as well as adults,” the minister said.Asked about the school reopening in the state, George said the study would help understand the seropositivity among children and the government would take further decisions about it after the study.The study report would be submitted to the CM, General Education and other concerned officials, who would take a call on the reopening of schools after that.On the concerns regarding Nipah virus, reported in Kozhikode last week, she said all the samples tested so far had turned out to be negative, which is a matter of relief.“Source tracing is equally important as that of the contract tracing. A special team from the National Institute of Virology is already collecting samples from the state to identify the source of the spread of the virus infection,” she said.However, the minister said the ongoing strict vigil and the restrictions in the affected areas would continue for some more time. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday said his government had conducted a complete house-to-house survey within three-km-radius from the house of the 12-year-old boy who succumbed to Nipah virus on September 5 as part of is fever surveillance.He said in the survey around 15,000 houses were included from the containment zone and details were sought from around 68,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-begins-seroprevalence-study-on-covid-19-situation-101631385848491.html

On Saturday, Kerala reported 20,487 new Covid-19 cases and 181 deaths, taking the state’s cumulative tally to 4,355,191. The toll in the state has reached 22,484. In its affidavit, filed on Friday, APM Muhammad Hanish, principal secretary (Department of General Education)  said: “The conduct of examination through online mode will prejudice a large number of students who have no access to laptops, desktops or even mobile phones. The students belonging to the lower strata of society are depending on mobile phones or tablets for attending online classes. In many areas, internet connection or mobile data are not available. These students will never be able to write online examinations.”“The issue of lack of electronic gadgets to students could also be eliminated and a fair, equitable and transparent method of conducting examinations could be ensured, eliminating chances of any complaints,” the affidavit added. On May 28, the state government announced that the Class 11 examinations, will be held offline between September 6 and 27, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. This decision was challenged by advocate A Rasoolshan before the Kerala high court, which observed that conducting examination was a matter of government policy and no interference was warranted. Challenging the HC decision, Rasoolshan told the top court that holding physical exams was a huge risk since children have not yet been vaccinated.On September 3, an SC bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar acknowledged the petitioner’s concern and observed: “There is an alarming situation in Kerala... Children of tender age cannot be exposed to any risk in this situation... Prima facie, we find force in the submission made by the petitioner that the state government has not seriously considered the prevailing situation before deciding to conduct physical examination (for Class 11).”The top court bench issued a notice on the petition to the Kerala government and put the examination on hold till September 13 -- the next date of hearing.In the affidavit, the state government stood by its decision to hold Class 11 examinations, citing the success of offline examinations for Class 10 and 12 students in April. The state further pointed out that all safety protocols are in place for the physical Class 11 examinations, and the state has also arranged separate rooms for students showing symptoms of illness. “Examination in offline mode can be conducted by strictly adhering to all precautionary measures issued by state and Central governments in preventing further spread of Covid-19 pandemic,” the affidavit said.This is not the first instance where Kerala has been hauled up by the top court for its potentially dangerous decisions to spread Covid-19. In July, the state government’s decision to relax lockdown restrictions in view of Bakrid festivities was challenged before the top court. The Court slammed the state’s decision as “extremely alarming” and said that if the decision of the state resulted in any untoward spread of the Covid-19 infection, any member of the public would be free to approach the Court after which action will be accordingly taken. As two days of restrictions got over by the date when the order was passed, the state government decided not to continue with further relaxation of lockdown curbs.This is not the first instance where Kerala has been hauled up by the top court for its potentially dangerous decisions to spread Covid-19.

Talking to reporters on Saturday, the Kagwad MLA said he was offered money at the time of quitting Congress by the BJP government, but he refused. “I’m someone who joined the BJP without taking any money. They had asked me how much of money I wanted, but I didn’t take a single paisa,” he said. “I declined the offer of money and told them that when the party is in power, they should give a good position so that I can do social service. Now, they (BJP) have dropped me from the new cabinet. However, I am confident of getting a cabinet berth in the coming days,” he said. He further added that he had discussed with senior leaders regarding the cabinet portfolio. “The Maratha community is also pitching in for me, demanding my inclusion in the new cabinet. The senior BJP leaders have assured me that I will be accommodated in the cabinet,” Patil added. The BJP is yet to react to Patil’s remarks. However, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee Working President Eshwar Khandre said that the leader’s statement is only proving what the Congress party has been alleging, and the truth is before the people. “The leaders are now openly talking about it. They are not happy with the BJP and cabinet position. The Supreme Court should take note of these statements,” he said. In 2019, the opposition parties in Karnataka accused the BJP of horse-trading 16 MLAs, belonging to the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular), which ended their coalition government. Later, the party triumphed over the bypolls and formed the government under the leadership of BS Yediyurappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-offered-money-to-quit-congress-says-ex-karnataka-minister-101631385788383.html
12-09-2021||India||Andhra CID files FIR against 16 people in ₹321cr FiberNet case||Two months after it was entrusted with the case, the Crime Investigation Department of Andhra Pradesh has registered an FIR on the alleged irregularities in AP State FiberNet Limited, putting the sum involved at ₹321 crores.The FiberNet project was meant to provide Internet and telephone services to all households in the state, as part of the Bharat Net project of the Government of India.The Centre initially provided a financial assistance of ₹3,840 crores for the FiberNet project under the National Optic Fibre Network.In the FIR registered on September 9, copy of which became public on Saturday, the CID named 16 people and two companies as the accused in the case.Citing a complaint filed by APSFL Chairman P Goutham Reddy, the CID said Vemuri Harikrishna Prasad, the then member of the e-Governance Authority governing council, colluded with Tera Software Limited to ensure the tender for ₹321 crore was illegally awarded to the company.The company lacked the necessary qualifications for the award of the tender, the CID FIR said.Besides Vemuri Harikrishna Prasad, the CID named the then managing director of Infrastructure Corporation of AP K Sambasiva Rao, Tera Software chairman SSR Koteswara Rao, managing director T Gopi Chand and six other directors as accused in the case.Also, six directors of another company Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited were listed as accused, along with unnamed government officials and others.A case under various sections of Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered against the accused and the report submitted to the Special Judge for Anti-Corruption Bureau and Special Police Establishment cases.On July 11, Energy Secretary Srikant Nagulapalli issued an order directing the Additional Director General of CID to investigate the irregularities and submit a detailed report to the government.The Central Bureau of Investigation allegedly did not show any interest in taking up the case, though the state government issued a confidential order on July 13, 2020, according consent to the national agency to exercise powers and jurisdiction “for taking up regular investigation and follow up action pertaining to the scam in APSFL.” The case was then entrusted to the state CID for investigation.The Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government constituted a Cabinet Sub-Committee in June 2019 to look into various “financial scandals” committed by the previous Chandrababu Naidu regime in different schemes, causing a loss running into hundreds of crores of rupees.The Cabinet Sub-Committee headed by Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath found out that the project costs were inflated by at least ₹700 crore.Besides, a person with fake certificates was appointed as head of the project.Also, inferior quality set top boxes were purchased from different companies, sidestepping the lowest bidder (a South Korean firm) that came forward to supply high-end STBs at a lower price.“This alone cost hundreds of crores of rupees to the exchequer while the project remained unaccomplished,” the Cabinet Sub-Committee pointed out.Based on the Cabinet Sub-Committee’s preliminary inquiry report, the state Cabinet on June 11, 2020, decided to order a CBI probe into the case.But the CBI allegedly did not show any interest in taking up the case, despite the Chief Minister writing several letters to the Centre and also personally taking up the issue with Union Home Minister Amit Shah.“Tender conditions were relaxed to facilitate the award of work to Tera Software Ltd., though the Central Public Sector Enterprise, Telecommunication Consultants India, emerged as the lowest bidder. It was not considered for ‘Project Monitoring Authority’ on inadequate grounds even though the firm quoted a lesser price but instead the APSFL chose to call for fresh bids. Non-selection of TCIL was due to the fear that the Central PSE would expose the compromised tender conditions to favour Tera Software Ltd. Hence the decision to seek a CBI inquiry to unearth the massive irregularities,” the state had then said, while seeking the central agency’s probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cid-files-fir-against-16-people-in-321cr-fibernet-case-101631385728760.html

In this regard, the Office of Registrar General of India has issued a communication to Chief Registrars of all states and union territories.In the event where next of kin of the deceased are not satisfied with the cause of death given in MCCD, their application shall be forwarded by the concerned state/UT to a four-member Committee that will verify and issue remedial directions, including issuance of official document for Covid-19 death within 30 days of submission of application.The top court in its June 30 order had specified the need for such a Committee to reduce hassles being caused to common man. This Committee to be constituted at the district level will comprise of Additional District Collector, Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH), Additional CMOH/ Principal or HOD Medicine of a Medical College (if one exists in the district) and a subject expert.The June 30 decision had also directed the Centre to frame guidelines for payment of ex-gratia compensation for Covid-19 deaths under the National Disaster Management Act 2005. The Court had granted six weeks for the Centre to frame the scheme under the 2005 Act and specify the amount since Covid-19 was notified as a disaster under the 2005 Act.On August 16, the Court extended this time by four weeks. The judgment of June 30 also required the Centre to consider framing a national insurance scheme for disaster-related deaths in line with recommendations made by the 15th Finance Commission. The present affidavit has not indicated any compliance on this aspect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-treat-all-deaths-within-30-days-of-testing-positive-as-covid-19-fatalities-101631385668174.html
12-09-2021||India||Judicial infrastructure neglected after Independence, says CJI Ramana||Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana on Saturday rued that judicial infrastructure was largely “neglected” after the country got its independence in 1947 and lack of facilities continues to cripple access to justice. Laying emphasis on strengthening judicial infrastructure, Justice Ramana said poor infrastructure in courts across the country was not only adverse for litigants but also for judicial officers and court staff who were bound to work under deleterious conditions. “We neglected and failed to focus on providing good infrastructure for courts in India after the British left,” the CJI said at the foundation stone laying ceremony of the National Law University, proposed to be established at Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. “Courts in India still operate from dilapidated structures, without proper facilities. Such a situation is severely detrimental to the experience of litigants and lawyers. It is an unpleasant work environment for court staff and judges, making it difficult to effectively perform their functions,” Justice Ramana added. The event was also attended by President Ram Nath Kovind, Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel, Union law minister Kiren Rijiju, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and acting chief justice of Allahabad high court MN Bhandari. Supreme Court judges Vineet Saran, Dinesh Maheshwari, Krishna Murari and Vikram Nath were also present. During his address, the CJI highlighted the role of National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation (NJIC) in developing concepts of the national court development project and its implementation to build modern and self-sufficient judicial infrastructure. “NJIC shall be along the lines of different infrastructure development statutory bodies that work towards creating National Assets across the country. One of the design principles that NJIC will follow, is socially responsible and inclusive architecture,” said Justice Ramana. The judge underlined that sufficient judicial infrastructure can help improve access to justice, by catering to the ever-rising number of cases and litigants, and their changing needs. NJIC, an ambitious plan by CJI Ramana, envisages collection of actionable data from across the country on requirement and upgradation of court buildings along with ancillary infrastructure. The managing committee to NJIC has to include the CJI and other Supreme Court judges who are in line to become CJI in future, chief justices of high courts and finance secretaries of the Union and state governments. According to the proposal, states would be required to fund modern court complexes through a one-time grant. Justice Ramana also expressed his concerns about pendency in the Allahabad high court. “I do not want to point any fingers or lay any blame regarding the pendency in the Allahabad high court relating to criminal cases, which is very worrying. I request the Allahabad bar and bench, to work together and cooperate to resolve this issue.” Allahabad high court has the maximum pendency among the 26 high courts across the country. The data submitted by the Uttar Pradesh government in the Supreme Court last month disclosed that around 180,000 criminal cases were pending in the Allahabad high court, which presently has a vacancy of 68 judges. Against the sanctioned strength of 160, the high court currently has 92 judges. In addition to the criminal cases, there are more than 600,000 civil cases pending before the high court. Justice Ramana placed on record his gratitude for President Ram Nath Kovind over his support to the legal community. “It was his (Kovind’s) idea to translate the judgments of the Supreme Court to vernacular languages to increase access to justice, which has now been implemented. Whenever we meet, he always asks about the welfare of the legal fraternity, and is always thinking of improving the legal aid system for the under privileged,” added the CJI. At the occasion, President Kovind said to achieve the inclusive ideals of the Indian Constitution, the role of women in the judiciary needs to be increased, while hailing the appointment of three women judges in the Supreme Court last month as a “historic” decision towards women empowerment. “If we have to achieve the inclusive ideals of our Constitution, then the role of women in the judiciary also has to be increased,” the President added. The CJI also paid rich tributes to Anand Bhushan Saran, an eminent lawyer and father of Justice Vineet Saran. “Till his last days, he never wavered from his routine and was still working, without ever making excuses of ill health. This earned him universal respect and admiration. Working closely with his son, brother Justice Vineet Saran, I can state that my brother has imbibed some of his best qualities by watching his eminent father.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judicial-infrastructure-neglected-after-independence-says-cji-ramana-101631385008782.html
12-09-2021||India||India, Australia share concerns on Afghanistan||New Delhi India and Australia on Saturday insisted Afghanistan’s soil must not become a safe haven for terrorists or be used for attacks on other nations, even as they called for steps to ensure an inclusive governing structure in Kabul and the safe departure of people wishing to leave the war-torn country.At the conclusion of the inaugural India-Australia 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers, the two sides asserted that their bilateral partnership and cooperation in groupings such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad was focused on ensuring an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and not aimed at any country.Remarks by defence minister Rajnath Singh, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and their Australian counterparts, Marise Payne and Peter Dutton, at a media interaction following the meeting made it evident the situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover on August 15, and mounting concerns about terror emanating from Afghan soil were a major part of the discussions.The significance of the meeting being held on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US – an event that triggered the American invasion of Afghanistan – wasn’t lost on the ministers. Jaishankar said in his opening remarks this was a reminder of the importance of “combating terrorism without compromise”, and India appreciates the value of global cooperation given its location close to the “epicentre” of terrorism.In her opening remarks, Payne said: “Last month did see the fall of Kabul and along with the ongoing fight of terrorism, the future of Afghanistan remains a central concern to both of our countries.”Jaishankar said in response to a question that UN Security Council resolution 2593 emphasises “Afghanistan must not allow its soil to be used in any manner, by anybody for terrorism”. Payne added: “We do share a very strong interest in ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for the breeding or the training of terrorists and that is an abiding concern of the international community.” The two sides, Jaishankar said, have concerns about the “inclusiveness of the dispensation” in Kabul, the treatment of women and minorities, the travel of Afghan nationals and humanitarian aid. Payne said Australia’s focus is on seeking safe passage for its citizens, foreign nationals and visa holders of other countries who want to leave Afghanistan. “We are very conscious of the impact of violence and breaches of human rights on the Afghanistan community and again would call for those fundamental human rights to be observed,” she said. The Taliban takeover exacerbated issues that were already affecting the Afghans, such as a drought and significant internal and external displacement of citizens, and international organisations such as UNHCR should be allowed unimpeded access to provide humanitarian support, she added. Payne, who is also Australia’s minister for women, spoke strongly for the rights of Afghan women and girls. Australia worked for two decades to ensure such rights, including in education and participation in the workforce, were preserved and the international community must now ensure these rights are “not wound back”, she said. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that developments in Afghanistan were a key part of separate meetings held by the foreign and defence ministers. The Indian side also raised its concerns about terrorism from Afghan soil and Pakistan’s backing for the Taliban at all the meetings, the people said. Jaishankar’s reference to the Taliban setup in Kabul as a “dispensation” was an indication the Indian side is in no hurry to accord any recognition to the interim cabinet formed by the group this week. Responding to another question on the Chinese side referring to Quad as an “Asian NATO”, Jaishankar said this is a platform for India, Australia, Japan and the US to cooperate for the benefit of the world, and such a description amounts to a misrepresentation of reality. “I think a term like NATO is very much a Cold War term, looking back. I think Quad looks [to] the future, it reflects globalisation [and] the compulsions of countries to work together,” he said. There is no relationship between issues the Quad is focused on – such as vaccines, supply chains, education and connectivity –and NATO, he added. Payne said the Quad champions Asean centrality and has a “positive and practical agenda” that includes Covid-19 vaccines, climate change, critical technologies and countering “dangerous disinformation”. She added, “Our constructive engagement in an informal diplomatic network is overwhelmingly about contributing positively for that open, inclusive and resilient region in which we all want to live.” The four ministers asserted that India and Australia are committed to bolstering cooperation across the Indo-Pacific to ensure a free and open region based on a rules-based order and to improve coordination for maritime security and information-sharing. Singh said the two sides discussed institutional frameworks for collaboration in defence and fighting the pandemic, and emphasised the need to ensure free flow of trade and adherence to international rules. “On bilateral defence cooperation, we decided to expand military engagements across services, facilitate greater defence information-sharing and to work closely for mutual logistics support,” Singh said. Dutton described India as a “rising Indo-Pacific great power” and an “increasingly significant security partner for Australia”, and said the bilateral logistics support arrangement enabled Australia to airlift oxygen to India during the second wave of Covid-19 infections this year. He said he and Singh had agreed on new initiatives to further defence ties and engagement between the armed forces. Australia will invite India to participate in the Talisman Sabre exercise and continue to participate in India’s Malabar naval exercise along with the US and Japan. The two sides agreed to reinforce each other’s maritime domain awareness through increased information-sharing, and Australia will increase its defence diplomatic representation in New Delhi to support coordination on maritime security and greater information-sharing, Dutton said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiaaustralia-share-concerns-on-afghanistan-101631384647604.html
12-09-2021||India||Vijay Rupani resigns as Gujarat CM ahead of polls next year||Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani resigned from the post on Saturday, an announcement that came a little over a year before the assembly elections in the state that is ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).While it was not immediately clear what led to the move, with Saturday’s sudden change of the guard, Gujarat joined a list of states where the central BJP brass opted to change the leadership ahead of assembly elections. After Karnataka, where chief minister BS Yeddiyurappa was replaced by Basavaraj Bommai ahead of the 2023 elections, and Uttarakhand, where the incumbent Trivendra Singh Rawat was first replaced by Tirath Singh and later by Pushkar Dhami, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani on Saturday announced his resignation. Both Gujarat and Uttarakhand will pick new assemblies in 2022.BJP’s general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh and Gujarat state unit incharge Bhupender Yadav met party functionaries soon after Rupani announced his resignation. Rupani and state cabinet colleagues met the governor and submitted their resignations.Rupani, who tendered his resignation to Governor Acharya Devvrat in the afternoon, told reporters: “I am a loyal soldier of the BJP and have resigned of my own accord; nobody asked me to do so. I will work for the party organisation or whatever role the party leadership assigns me.” Amid speculation of infighting, he denied he had any differences with state BJP president CR Paatil.Asked about the reason for his resignation, Rupani said: “In BJP, it is like a relay race for party workers. One gives the baton to the other.” A person aware of the matter said Rupani’s successor will be discussed at a legislature party meeting likely to be held on Sunday.Among the names that are likely to be considered for the next CM is Lakshadweep and Daman and Diu administrator Praful Patel. The others are state general secretary Gordhan Jhadaphia, a Patidar leader, and Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, said a senior BJP functionary, asking not to be named.Among the reasons cited by party leaders, who asked not to be named, for the 65-year-old’s exit were his response to the Covid-19 pandemic and his caste. The Jain CM’s performance in facing the challenges posed by the pandemic and failure to build cohesive political support for the BJP which still faces challenges from the Patidars, a community with immense political heft that can swing electoral outcomes, were stated as key determinants in the decision, according to the leaders.A change of face a little over a year ahead of the elections is expected to blunt anti-incumbency in the state. The term of the 182-member assembly ends in February 2023.A senior party leader based in Delhi said the change should not be attributed to Rupani’s performance but is part of the BJP’s policy of fostering newer leadership. “The BJP believes in leadership development process whereby newer people are given a chance to be in charge. In Gujarat that is what has happened… it’s a generational change. New leaders will take over the charge with enthusiasm,” said the functionary.However, there is a section of party leaders that said the resignation is an indication that the central command is not inclined to go to the polls with incumbent leaders in states where the public perception is not in their favour.“Even though the chief minister carried forward the development agenda that was set by Prime Minister Modi when he was the chief minister of the state, there were many issues that could be attributed for this change. The first and foremost being the state’s response to the Covid challenge,” said second leader. He went on to add: “…Since he also did not meet the criterion that was arrived at after doing the electoral calculations the party decided that he should to replaced and a new person given the charge till the election.”The central leadership that included Santhosh and Yadav held a series of meetings with the state party leaders in the past few months to get an insight into the public sentiment against the CM.In April this year, the high court of Gujarat took a serious view of the state’s preparedness for the pandemic and said the manner in which the government had dealt with the challenge was “not satisfactory and not transparent”. There was an uproar over the lack of oxygen supply in hospitals; beds were also in short supply.Rupani, a non-Patidar leader, replaced Anandiben Patel in 2016 in the aftermath of the agitation by the politically powerful Patidar community that was rallying for being brought under the ambit of reservation. He was sworn in for a second term after the party won the 2017 assembly elections even though there were reservations among state leaders on his elevation.The party has been concerned over the state unit leaders losing hold over the electorate. In 2017 when the party returned to power it won just 99 of the 182 seats, down from the previous election’s 115. Later, the Aam Aadmi Party’s performance in the Surat municipal corporation rang the alarm bells again. The party has officially dismissed the AAP’s emergence in the state, but it is aware of the simmering discontent among the Patidars over the delay in taking back cases that were filed against those booked in the 2015 agitation, said a third leader.Political commentator Ghanshaym Shah said there was pressure from party cadres and the Patidar community to change the chief minister. “The party cadres had relayed to the central leadership the need to have the Patidars on their side, so the change can be attributed to this pressure,” he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rupani-resigns-as-cm-ahead-of-polls-next-year-101631384590678.html
12-09-2021||India||In 1 day, National Lok Adalat settles 1.5 million cases worth ₹2,281 crore||New Delhi Organised by the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), the National Lok Adalat on Saturday succeeded in getting over 1.5 million cases settled in a day, involving a settlement amount of whopping ₹2,281 crore . Data available till 4 pm on Saturday from legal services authorities across the country demonstrated that 3.3 million cases were taken up, out of which 1.5 million were disposed of. Of the settled cases, more than 592,000 cases were pending before various courts at different stages while 940,000 cases have been resolved at pre-litigation stage. Lok Adalats were organised in both virtual and hybrid mode and chiefly took up cases of motor accident, matrimonial disputes, cheque bounce, labour disputes, criminal compoundable cases and revenue cases. Justice Uday U Lalit, Executive Chairman of NALSA, virtually joined the ongoing proceedings of the Lok Adalat benches constituted at district levels and also interacted with more than 50 presiding judges of these benches. During his interaction with the judicial officers, Justice Lalit emphasised that Lok Adalats are imperative to reduce the huge pendency in the justice system of the country. The Adalat on Saturday also achieved the feat of establishing a virtual connect up to taluka level and some of the places connected for the first time included Pindwara in Sirohi district, which is a Tribal area of Rajasthan and Keshkal in Kondagaon district, which is a Moaist-affected area of Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-1-day-national-lok-adalat-settles-1-5-million-cases-worth-2-281-crore-101631383928776.html
12-09-2021||India||Centre clears appointments to NCLT , ITAT||New Delhi: The central government on Saturday approved the appointment of judicial and technical members to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) days after the Supreme Court pulled up the Centre over vacancies in tribunals across the country. In an official communication, the Centre announced the appointment of eighteen members to the NCLT - eight judicial members and ten technical members — and thirteen new appointments to ITAT - six judicial members and seven accountant members. A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had on September 6, pulled up the government for its inaction in filling up vacancies in tribunals. As of September 6, more than 200 posts lying vacant across 15 tribunals in the country. The Union government has no respect for the judgments of the top court and is now testing its patience, said an anguished Supreme, adding the government is “emasculating tribunals” by not filling up vacancies in them. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, further observed it is “very upset” by the government and censured the Centre for re-enacting the very same provisions for the administration of tribunals that were struck down by the court in July. “The government is bent upon not honouring the orders of this court... Virtually the same Act is re-enacted. We cannot have this situation. Legislature can take away the basis of a judgment but you cannot overrule a judgment by re-enacting the very same provisions,” said the bench, which also included justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao. The bench said that the court will have to consider staying the new law since it is a “replica” of the old law, which was held to be unconstitutional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-clears-appointments-to-national-company-law-tribunal-income-tax-appellate-tribunal-101631383689636.html
12-09-2021||India||Govt slashes edible oil duties again as prices soar||The Union government on Saturday slashed duties on edible oils to a decade’s low to ease prices at home, which have spiralled on the back of high global rates. The country meets two-thirds of its domestic demand for vegetable oils through imports.The government has “further reduced the standard rate of duty on crude palm oil, crude soyabean oil and crude sunflower oil by up to 2.5%”, a statement said. The standard rate of duty on refined oils of palm, soyabean and sunflower stands had been cut by 32.5% in a series of moves to make vegetable oils cheaper.In June, the government had cut duties on palm oil by 5% and lifted restrictions in the import of refined palm oil, as food inflation worries mounted.Also Read| Govt hikes rabi MSPs, sharper raise for oilseedsEdible oil prices have risen by up to 60%, according to data from the consumer affairs ministry from a year ago. Average costs of a litre of mustard oil rose to ₹170 in August compared to ₹120 a year ago.“It may be noted that the International prices and thereby domestic prices of edible oils have been ruling high during 2021-22 which is a cause of serious concern from inflation as well as consumer’s point of view,” a government statement said.According to an August report of the Food and Agricultural Organisation, global prices have rallied sharply in recent months due to bad crop in key producing nations and higher demand as economies reopened from Covid-19 shutdowns.Higher food inflation not only impacts poorer households more, which tend to spend a larger share of their monthly budgets on food, compared to the well-off, but they also throw the Reserve Bank’s inflation targets off gear.Palm is one of the most widely consumed oils, which is found in everything from bread to ice-creams. Cutting import duties can lower prices instantly. Edible oil is India’s third most high-value import, after crude oil and gold. India typically imports from producers such as Malaysia, Indonesia Brazil, Argentina and Russia.Throughout June, the government was evaluating the price trends before taking a “decision” on cutting import duties, an official with knowledge of the matter said. The first cuts in tariffs came in June itself as global commodity outlook showed the high prices were likely to hold, the official said.Also Read| Ambiguous definition means oil-palm plantations will count as forest cover“Prices are likely to slide only when summer harvests kick in by December. The duty cuts should bring down prices without much lag unless there is hoarding,” said Abhishek Agrawal, an analyst with Comtrade, a private commodity brokerage firm, adding retail prices should come down by at least ₹5.Currently, India’s levies on edible oil imports ranges between 32.5% (for palm oil, the cheapest edible oil) and 35% for soyabean oil. The country produces about 11 million tonne of edible oil but consumption hovers around 24 million tonne.According to official data, the share of rural and urban consumption in total is 3.8% and 2.7%. Much of the demand comes from commercial users, like biscuit and snack makers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-slashes-edible-oil-duties-again-as-prices-soar-101631381287890.html

12-09-2021||Today's||The young, anxious Indian millennial||In 2018, I started conducting research for my book on the economic aspirations, social views, and political attitudes of Indian millennials. My mission was simple. I wanted to understand the views of those we didn’t hear much from. How do young Indians in the country’s small towns and cities view their place in India’s future?
12-09-2021||Today's||At 15, BRICS has made incremental progress. But there is palpable disconnect too||Celebrating 15 years, BRICS — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — countries held their 13th summit on September 9 virtually. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as the chair and host, described the group as “an influential voice of the emerging economies”.

12-09-2021||Editorials||The epidemic of sexual violence persists||In the past week, three heinous crimes against women were reported in different parts of the country. In Sakinaka, Mumbai, a woman was raped and brutalised in a parked tempo. In Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, an athlete was found dead with grave injuries and suspected rape. In Bemetara, Chhattisgarh, a woman was gang raped and murdered. These horrific, unrelated crimes point to a common denominator: India remains unsafe for women. The Delhi gang rape of 2012, which led to stricter laws, is now a distant memory, as horrific cases of sexual violence continue to shock the country.
