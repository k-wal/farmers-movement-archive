17-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 80% commercial vehicles using RFID tags to enter the Capital, say SDMC officials||New Delhi: The number of commercial vehicles using the radio frequency identification (RFID) system to enter the city has gone up to 80%, with officials of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) claiming that it will have a marked effect on reducing pollution in the city, especially during winter, as it has resulted in shorter queues at toll booths.“We had been carrying out dedicated drives over the past two months to make vehicles comply with RFID, more so because winter is near. As a result, now vehicles paying toll fee using RFID has touched 80%, up from around 25% over the last year because of the ongoing pandemic. This will go a long way in reducing pollution in the city. While most drivers had got tags, they were lax in recharging it,” said a senior corporation official, who didn’t wish to be named. Every winter, air pollution in Delhi rises to hazardous levels owing to a combination of factors, including adverse weather conditions, vehicular and dust emissions, waste burning, and fumes from crop stubble burning in neighbouring states. The RFID tags, which are pasted on the windshield of vehicles, allows automatic deduction of toll tax and environment compensation charge (ECC), and does away with the need for vehicles to halt at toll plazas.Officials said that 509,938 RFID tags have been sold so far since 2019, when the system was implemented in the national capital. Officials said they are issuing 100-150 challans to errant vehicles on a daily basis. “Also, we have written to the Delhi transport department to cancel permits of vehicles that are repeatedly defaulting. They are working out a strategy for the same,” the official said. Civic officials said that an estimated 100,000 commercial vehicles enter the city on a daily basis. “Of this, approximately 12-14% are heavy duty vehicles such as trucks that are liable to pay ECC. Around 50% are taxis including private cab aggregators. Then there are other vehicles such as tempos, goods carriers etc as well as CNG vehicles,” the official said. Special teams have been deployed by the civic body at the toll plazas for monitoring and better enforcement. Since March-end this year, all the 124 toll plazas have been equipped with the RFID system.RFID system was introduced to decongest city borders and smoothen traffic movement so as to cut down air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi80-commercial-vehicles-using-rfid-tags-to-enter-the-capital-say-sdmc-officials-101631902826705.html

The party also demanded that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) administration should scrap road work tenders where contractors have bid up to 33% lower than BMC’s estimated cost for the road work.Prabhakar Shinde, BJP leader said in a statement on Friday, “As a part of the tendering process, this year, 31 tenders were floated totalling to ₹1,200 crore. It has been observed that in this process, the contractors have quoted about 26-33% lower than the estimated costs in the tenders. Similarly for the tenders to fill in the trenches, this difference is 27-36.6% lower than the estimated costs. As a policy, if contractors quote an amount that goes below 12% lower than the estimated cost, they are required to deposit an additional security deposit amount to the civic body. If we look at the overall calculation, contractors have quoted amounts that are 40-45% lower than the estimated costs.Alongside the whitepaper, BJP has also demanded an audit of all road works at the hands of an external auditor under the BMC. Shinde said, “Contractors which quote way lower than the estimated costs can not assure quality work as far as repairs, maintenance and fresh roadworks is concerned.

The fifth sero survey was started by BMC on August 12 across all 24 administrative wards in the city.Its results have indicated that 90.2% of fully or partially vaccinated citizens had antibodies, and 79.8% of those who were not vaccinated had antibodies. Sero-prevalence in slums is 87%, while in non-slums it is 86%. About 65% of the sample size was citizens who have been fully or partially vaccinated, and 35% of the sample size were citizens who have not been vaccinated yet, according to BMC. This is significant in the context of the possibility of a third wave of the pandemic. The presence of antibodies in a significant number of surveyed population means the city might handle the next wave in a better way.Of the 8,674 samples collected, approximately 50% were from slum areas and 50% were from non-slum areas.The results of the latest survey indicate almost equal sero-prevalence among Mumbaiites living in slum and non-slum areas, contrary to the results of the first three surveys, which shows a relatively higher sero-prevalence among residents of slums. The fourth was a sero-survey for the paediatric age group.Sero prevalence studies are conducted to understand past exposure of an individual to a virus and to know the extent of the spread of infection in the population, with the prevalence of antibodies.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of BMC’s public health department said, “The results of this fifth sero-survey are promising. However, this does not mean we can let our guards down. We must strictly adhere to safety protocols in public places, wear masks, maintain social distancing. This survey was a significant one as it was conducted across all 24 wards in the city.”A senior civic officer from BMC’s public health department said, “Since there is greater sero-prevalence among those who have been fully or partially vaccinated, it appears promising as the number of fully vaccinated citizens is increasing by the day.”While 85.07% sero-prevalence was noted among males, it was higher among females, at 88.29%. Around 20% of the samples were collected from healthcare workers, and the results show that 87.14% sero-prevalence among them.In a statement on Friday, BMC said, “There is no statistical difference in sero-prevalance in the island city and in Mumbai’s suburbs. The results correspond with the recent trend in cases in Mumbai observed by BMC. However, this in no way indicates the level of immunity to the virus among citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/8664-mumbaiites-have-covid-antibodies-5th-sero-survey-of-8-674-samples-reveals-101631897066257.html

The SOPs were issued days after the high court lifted its June 28 stay on the yatra but cautioned the state to conduct the annual pilgrimage with strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines.The Covid negative test report will, however, be mandatory for pilgrims from Kerala, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, three states that account for 75 per cent of the country’s 3,39,056 active Covid cases on Friday, irrespective of their vaccination status.The tests should have been conducted within 72 hours of the Char Dham yatra.In case of people who produce a vaccination certificate, the SOP requires that at least 15 days should have passed after receiving their second dose.Outstation pilgrims are also required to register on the state government’s portal for the Char Dham yatra. Pilgrims from within the state can straightaway apply for the yatra e-pass from the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board website.The daily limit of pilgrims will be 1,000 for Badrinath, 800 for Kedarnath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri shrines.Kedarnath, along with Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri, collectively called Char Dham, attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. Traditionally, Char Dham pilgrimage begins from the west from Yamunotri, then proceeding to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east. Kedarnath shrine is located in Rudraprayag district, while Badrinath is in Chamoli district. Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines are located in Uttarkashi district.Pilgrims suspected to be infected or have symptoms of Covid will be tested at the designated testing facilities in the state and if found positive, they will be isolated and referred to the designated Covid treatment facilities in the state.The SOPs mandate that the Char Dham shrines and their surrounding areas will be sanitised thrice a day.At Char Dham shrines, CCTVs will also be used for checking whether pilgrims are following social distancing and wearing facemasks, apart from continuous checking by law enforcement agencies, according to the SOPs.There will be Covid testing facilities, availability of medicines, medical oxygen on Char Dham routes. For natural disasters along the routes, heli-ambulance will be available for Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath areas.Employees of hotels, resorts, dharamshala, homestay and guesthouses where pilgrims can stay should be vaccinated.Pilgrims cannot touch the idols or bells at the temples. Also, they cannot take ritualistic baths at the temple kunds (springs or holy water sources).Six people can come for pilgrimage through one registration certificate and they have to visit the shrines within two days (starting from the day for which they have registered for the darshan). Pilgrims will not be allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the shrines. They also can’t offer any type of prasad (sanctified food) in the temples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/in-new-sops-covid-ve-report-must-for-char-dham-pilgrims-from-3-states-101631896586011.html

17-09-2021||Mumbai||Corruption by public servants a huge problem: Special CBI court||Corruption by public servants has become a gigantic problem and now no facet of public life has been left unaffected by the stink of corruption, a special CBI court observed while convicting a clerk working with Poddar Mills, a unit of National Textiles Corporation. Additional sessions judge AS Sayyad sentenced the clerk, Milind Birje, to four years of imprisonment for accepting ₹1,500 as bribe for clearing pension of a senior citizen. The special court also imposed fine of ₹10,000 on the clerk.The court observed that “corruption by public servants has become a gigantic problem. It has spread everywhere. No facet of public life has been left unaffected by the stink of corruption. It has deep and pervasive impact on the functioning of the entire country. Large scale corruption retards the nation building activity and everyone suffers due to it.”The court said the minimum sentence of four years imprisonment, as provided under section 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, would be a just and proper sentence for the accused in view the nature and gravity of offence.Special prosecutor Sandeep Singh said a trap was laid on January 28, 2016 and Birje was arrested while accepting bribe of ₹1,500. Initially, the demand was for ₹2,000 to expedite and clear the pension file of the complainant, which was reduced after bargaining.The accused had not disputed that he was a public servant for being an employee of a unit of the National Textiles Corporation. Sanction was accordingly taken to prosecute him from competent authority. The evidence of prosecution witness clearly established the demand, acceptance and the recovery at the instance of the accused, said the prosecutor. There is overwhelming evidence on record which establishes the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, he added.The accused was charged under sections 7 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act) and 13(1) (public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.The accused through his counsel VN Shingnapurkar argued that the pre-trap and post-trap process was defective, and there was no witness to prove that the accused had actually demanded the money. He argued that the complaint was filed out of personal vendetta. He said that the first information report in the case was filed on January 27 whereas the demand was made on January 21, and thus there was inordinate delay in registering the case. The accused had argued that there was no evidence to show that the demand was made.The special court, however, noted that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had recorded the conversation with the help of a DVR in a SD card that was a part of the case records and sentenced him to prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/corruption-by-public-servants-a-huge-problem-special-cbi-court-101631895565869.html

The number of deaths has dropped by 54%, as they have reduced to 964 from 2,103 last month.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor, government of Maharashtra on Covid-19 management said, “There is currently a false sense of normalcy which can be counter-productive. There was a similar situation after the first Covid-19 wave and we were hit hard by the second wave.”“However this time, we are better prepared due to mass vaccination and also because many citizens have developed antibodies,” said Salunkhe.He added that the real picture will be known only after October 5 when the impact of the transmission during the Ganpati festival will be known.Dr Ishwar Gilada. secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, said these figures indicate the waning of the second wave. “Maharashtra has done a remarkable job in vaccination, especially in the urban pockets. The problem will be mainly in the rural parts where the vaccination numbers are poor. In addition, we are seeing a substantial population with antibodies. These factors will blunt the virulency of Covid-19 significantly,” said Dr Gilada.Maharashtra on Friday recorded 3,586 new Covid cases with 67 deaths, while Mumbai saw 472 new cases with three deaths.There are currently 48,451 active patients across the state of which Pune tops with 13,432 patients followed by Thane with 7240 active patients and Ahmednagar with 6607.The state’s case tally has now reached 65,15,111, while the toll stands at 138,389.There were 179,246 tests done on Friday in state, while the number of recoveries clocked 4410.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/35-drop-in-new-covid-cases-in-maharashtra-in-sept-than-aug-deaths-down-by-54-101631895386025.html
17-09-2021||Lucknow||After Tokyo Paralympics, silver medallist Praveen Kumar hungry for more success||In childhood, para athlete Praveen Kumar was always discouraged from taking up sport but he went on to become a silver medallist at the Tokyo Paralympics. Back then, people would say sport wasn’t his cup of tea due to physical issues. But his love of athleticism kept him going, and he never missed a chance to play volleyball.Praveen Kumar, son of a poor farmer from a village near Jewar in Gautam Buddha Nagar district, has a congenital impairment that affects the bones that connect his hip to his left leg. He surprised everyone by bagging a silver medal in the men’s high jump T64 category at the Tokyo Paralympics early this month.“Those words of discouragement always inspired me to keep working hard in sport. That’s the reason I made it. I am thankful to the people who, in fact, gave me courage to excel,” said Praveen Kumar, who cleared 2.07 metre at the Tokyo Games to set a new Asian record.Praveen Kumar fell short of the gold medal by a whisker. Great Britain’s Jonathan Broom-Edwards, who notched up his season’s best of 2.10m, claimed the gold.“I am just 18 now and have a long way to go. The 2022 Asian Para Games would be an opportunity for me to change the colour of my Tokyo Games medal. I am sure to win a gold medal at the 2024 Paris Paralympics,” said Praveen Kumar, who begins his training from Monday at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium in New Delhi.Even after winning the silver medal at the Paralympics, his life hasn’t changed much.“My perception towards my life, especially targets, hasn’t changed, but people’s perspective on me has altered a lot. Now, people around me want to spend time with me, discuss sport and even request selfies,” he said.“I know how tempting this change is but I am focused on bigger targets in life, including a gold medal at the Paris Paralympics in 2024,” he said.World no. 3 in men’s high jump T44 category, Praveen Kumar had his first international medal, also a silver, in men’s high jump T44 in the World Para Athletics Junior Championship at Nottwil, Switzerland, in 2019 before winning a gold medal with a new Asian Record in World Para Athletics FAZZA Grand Prix at Dubai early this year.“Both the medals boosted my confidence ahead of the Tokyo Games and I was very sure of a podium finish even before my first jump there,” said Praveen Kumar, who is pursuing the Bachelor of Arts course from Motilal College at Delhi University.“Politics and history are my favourite subjects, but my first love in sport is still volleyball. In fact, Satyapal Sir changed my life as he was the one who asked me to take up high jump and even coached me to this level.”He said he took part in a district-level competition where he met one Ashok Saini who gave him the phone number of Satyapal Sir. Praveen Kumar, who is just in his second year in the international circuit, said the ₹4 crore cash award, which he would get from the Uttar Pradesh government next week, would be spent wisely.“I have no fixed plans on how I am going to spend the cash award, but it would be used wisely. I have seen my family struggling for everything and being a member of a joint family I have certain responsibilities too on my shoulders,” he said.“Right now, money isn’t my focus area. I’m hungry for more success at the international level.”“The silver medal in Tokyo Games has just kick-started my sporting career and I have a long way to go,” said Praveen Kumar, who appreciates the support of his parents, the sports ministry and Paralympic Committee of India in achieving this success.“They all stood behind me like rocks and only then I could achieve this medal.”His coach Satyapal said he initially had some reservations about Praveen’s short stature but found he had very strong muscles on his right leg.“His left leg is the impaired one but his right leg has very strong muscles. So, despite his short stature, I took him under my wings,” Satyapal said.He also said Praveen Kumar was a sure shot gold medal candidate at the Asian Para Games next year in Hangzhou in China.“He started competing in international events only two years back and now he has won a silver medal at Paralympics. He is quite young and will be the country’s top Paralympian in future,” the coach added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/after-tokyo-paralympics-silver-medallist-praveen-kumar-hungry-for-more-success-101631895086016.html

17-09-2021||Delhi||Hospitals in Delhi see surge in seasonal flu cases among children||Amid the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in Delhi which has infected 1,438,428 people till now, hospitals in the national capital are also seeing a surge in cases of seasonal flu among children, news agency PTI reported on Friday. The symptoms of seasonal flu are similar to that of Covid-19 including fever, cough, sore throat, headache.Amid the threats of a possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, experts suggested during a recent meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government should continue with robust testing to contain the spread of Covid-19 during the flu season.Speaking to PTI, doctors at the PSRI Hospital said that 70% of the children coming to the outpatient department (OPD) were having flu-like symptoms. Dr Sarita Sharma, a senior consultant of paediatrics at the hospital, said children have been coming with high fever of up to 102 to 103 for the past three to four days. At least 15-20% of them require hospitalisation, the doctor said.“Besides cough, cold, poor oral intake, vomiting has also been seen among the children. Cough is dry and spasmodic for small children below five years of age. Few children are also having wheezing problems. This is seasonal flu caused by a virus affecting the respiratory tract like RSV and Influenza,” Dr Sharma further said.On the other hand, another medical practitioner, Dr Meena from Aakash Healthcare in Delhi’s Dwarka, said there has been a sharp rise in cases of fever along with cough, cold and vomiting.Infants below the age of one have been showing severe symptoms and few of them had to be admitted, Dr Meena said. “Many of them suffer from temperatures as high as 103-104 degrees and the fever does not decrease after oral medication sometimes,” she added. Advising people to exercise proper respiratory hygiene and avoid going to crowded places, Dr Meena said that children should be kept at a distance from a person who is experiencing cold or fever.The doctor also pointed out that this time cases of dengue in Delhi are also being reported among children. “We are seeing three to five positive cases of dengue among children daily for almost two weeks. Children are symptomatic, show fever, body ache, fatigue symptoms and are diagnosed later after tests,” Dr Meena further told the news agency. She said that her hospital has admitted three to four children with the vector-borne disease.Till now, the Delhi government has not expressed fears over the dengue outbreak, with health minister Satyendar Jain saying that the 158 cases recorded are in control and the government is ready to deal with any situation arising out of the disease.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hospitals-in-delhi-see-surge-in-seasonal-flu-cases-among-children-101631890846507.html

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) fears that the number of infections may increase with the inflow of people and this testing strategy aims at combatting the spread. The state’s weekly positivity rate as of September 14 stood at 2.6%. Mumbai had a much lower positivity rate at 1.3%. However, some districts like Pune (5.8%), Ahmednagar (5.5%), Sangli (3.8%), Nashik (3.7%), Satara (3.5%), Osmanabad (3.2%), Palghar (3.1%) and Sindhudurg (3%) have higher positivity rate compared to the states average. “Many people travel to their villages or hometown for the Ganesh festival and any such travel can lead to a spurt in the city’s Covid-19 infections,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “We have therefore asked our field staff to target people with travel history for testing in order the catch the infections early,” he said. Kakani said that the civic body is also setting up testing camps in localities. Healthcare workers are going door-to-door asking people who have returned after travelling to come and get tested. Emphasis is put on those who have the slightest of symptoms or those who have come in contact when someone who has tested positive. The daily caseload in Mumbai has been under 500 for the past two months, crossing the 500-mark in a few days. The state’s daily caseload has been fluctuating between 3,000 to 4,000 over the past fortnight. Health officials have predicted the possibility of a surge with the lockdown restrictions eased and excessive travel between districts. “Screening at the points of entry into the city and targetted testing of people with travel history is a good idea,” said Soumitra Ghosh, associate professor at the Centre for Health Policy, planning and management, Tata Institute of Social Sciences.“Another important intervention should be to target areas that are reporting more cases,” he said. Most recently, the civic body tweaked its testing policy and asked all the wards to test symptomatic individuals and high-risk contacts within the first or second day itself, instead of waiting for the fifth or sixth day as mandated earlier. The civic body has now asked the wards to do a follow-up test on the fifth or sixth day in case the first one is negative. “Our circular issued about 10-day sago stated that individuals should be tested immediately, and one must not wait till the symptoms are more pronounced or for the symptoms to arise in case of high-risk contacts,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/target-festival-returnees-for-covid-tests-bmc-tells-field-staff-101631888905420.html
17-09-2021||Mumbai||MPCB tells Mumbai civic body to stop spraying herbicides in Powai lake||Acting on a complaint by a city-based environment group, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) on Thursday sent a notice to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) asking the latter to stop spraying herbicides containing glyphosate in Powai lake to control the growth of water hyacinths, until further notice. MPCB has also asked BMC to “submit any technical say towards use of this herbicide in lake area”.The civic body had in August floated a tender for removal of water hyacinths at Ganesh Ghat, Pawarwadi and other areas to make space for immersion activities during Ganesh Chaturthi. The work was later awarded to an organisation called Saguna Rural Foundation. According to a preliminary inquiry and site visit conducted by a field officer on September 15, “The said contractor has sprayed glyphosate as herbicide on Powai lake area from September 3 to September 8.”Glyphosate, a staple ingredient in herbicides, can pose adverse toxicological effects on flora and fauna, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Depending on the extent of use, it may lead to an increase in the water body’s phosphorus content, which in turn will lead to the proliferation of algae and exacerbate eutrophication. This can reduce the ability of zooplankton to reproduce for other biodiversity to thrive.MPCB in their notice to BMC’s assistant commissioner of S ward also pointed out that the lake is a habitat for the Indian marsh crocodile, a species protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Despite requests, assistant municipal commissioner of S ward, Ajit Kumar Ambi, and BMC’s chief engineer of hydraulics department Ajay Rathore did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment on Friday.This action by MPCB comes on the heels of complaints raised by NGO Vanashakti, which had, on September 13, written to the pollution control board, BMC and forest department objecting to the use of herbicides in Powai lake. The next day, citizens living in the vicinity had reported that drones were being used to spray herbicide into far reaches of the lake, which MPCB officials corroborated during their visit on September 15. However, MPCB pointed out that the work was not underway on the specific date of their site visit.Stalin D, director of Vanashakti, said simply removing these weeds is not enough to restore the health of the lake. “The water hyacinths no doubt reduce the levels of the lake and reduce its boundaries, but at the same time they also remove organic pollutants and heavy metals in the lake. If the hyacinths are removed without tackling the issue of pollution due to discharge of sewage, the move will be counterproductive,” Stalin said. He advocated for the area to be handed over to the forest department for safekeeping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mpcb-tells-mumbai-civic-body-to-stop-spraying-herbicides-in-powai-lake-101631888605451.html
17-09-2021||Mumbai||1 Ganesh idol immersion at a time from same building; BMC issues guidelines for 10th day||In view of the 10th-day immersion of the ongoing Ganesh festival on Sunday, the Brihanmumnai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday said 25,000 of its workers will be on duty. The BMC has issued guidelines restricting of immersion of more than one Ganesh idol together, in the case of same building or chawl. According to BMC, if there are more than one idol immersions, they have to keep a safe time gap between the two.The civic body has appealed that children and senior citizens should avoid going to the immersion site. Further, the BMC has ruled out that not more than five people (preferably fully vaccinated), will be allowed at immersion site for household idols, followed by not more than 10 people (preferably fully vaccinated) will be allowed at immersion site for idols of Ganesh mandals.In a statement issued on Friday, the BMC said, “Around 715 lifeguards have been appointed at various natural and artificial immersion sites. We have also arranged for 338 nirmlaya kalash to dispose of flowers, followed by 182 mobile nirmalay kalash. Around 185 mobile control rooms have been set up; 144 first aid centres, 39 ambulances also have been arranged.”The statement further added, “The BMC has arranged for 145 reception rooms, 84 temporary mobile toilets, 3,707 floodlights, 116 searchlights, 48 observation towers, 36 motorboats, 30 German rafts at natural immersion sites have also been provided.”Further, the BMC has appealed that the citizens should carry out immersion at their homes, in case of an eco-friendly idol. The BMC has appealed that citizen should also avoid going to natural immersion sites and should conduct immersion at the artificial ponds set up by the civic body. Lastly, the BMC has also not allowed any procession or usage of loudspeakers on the last day of immersion. The citizens are requested to prohibit rituals at immersion spots. Citizens are asked to wear masks, carry sanitisers and follow social distancing norms.Meanwhile, a 31% dip was recorded in the immersion of Ganesh idols in 2020 compared to 2019. The BMC attributed this fall to Covid-19, as many preferred to conduct immersion at their home or inside their buildings. According to the figures provided by the BMC, around 1.35 lakh Ganesh idols were immersed in 2020 compared to 1.96 lakh idols immersed in 2019. However, usage of artificial ponds for immersion doubled from 33,000 in 2019 to 70,000 in 2020. The increased usage of artificial ponds the BMC said was owing to the 2km limit imposed for immersion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1-ganesh-idol-immersion-at-a-time-from-same-building-bmc-issues-guidelines-for-10th-day-101631888425448.html
17-09-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: A Modern-Day Mumbai Miracle||What does one say to a woman who has donated land worth ₹120 crore (approximately USD 16 million) to a hospital without wanting anyone to know about her act of staggering altruism? A woman who hails from an ordinary middle-class family, one which is certainly not steeped in wealth, who says that she does not expect anything in return for her largesse, not even any personal acclaim? A woman, who having performed this amazing act of generosity almost three years ago, has since then, laid low, lived anonymously, carried on her life quietly, not breathed a word about it to any one besides her inner circle, and what’s more, has sought neither praise nor publicity for it; in fact a woman who agrees to an interview with me as long as her privacy is respected and her name strictly does not figure anywhere? What indeed can one say to such a person, except to tell her that at a time when self-interest, greed and materialism appear to have spread their tentacles everywhere and colonised every heart — her story is nothing short of a modern-day Mumbai miracle and must be told, for the simple reason that it restores one’s faith in humanity and in the goodness of ordinary people. **************************************A few days ago, a rare ray of sunshine broke through the usual doom and gloom that dominate our present-day news cycle; ricocheting through WhatsApp chats and online sites, before one could say Melinda Gates and MacKenzie Scott, came the news that a 61-year-old Mumbai lady had donated her ancestral property worth around ₹120 crore to Tata Memorial Hospital — India’s largest cancer hospital, where 60% of the patients who come for first aid are treated free of cost — for the construction of a new chemo centre which will greatly alleviate the colossal demand for beds and suffering of patients. “Could this be even true?” was the query on everyone’s lips, when the news began to sink in. A Mumbai woman. Who no one had even heard of. Had given away ₹120 crore worth of. Prime Mumbai real estate… And along with the incredulity came the curiosity about the mystery lady… **************************************“All the credit for making me who I am goes first and foremost to my parents, who gave me my sense of values and taught me to stay grounded. I also credit my teachers at The JB Vachha School at Kings Circle who further inculcated those values, and of course my husband and his family who have supported my decision all along,” said the mystery lady, when, with a seasoned newshound’s nose, I manage to track her down, a couple of hours later. “I don’t know how the news with my name came out last week, even after I had requested that it shouldn’t. And I was hugely embarrassed by it,” she said. As she tells it, DM (for those are her initials) who grew up at Dadar’s King Circle, the daughter of an unassuming Gujarati father and Parsi mother, inherited 30,000 square feet of property, on which her father’s printing press stood in Parel, on his passing in 2005. Being an only child and, as she says, having been brought up in an atmosphere of giving, she thought that the best way she could honour her parents’ memory was to donate the entire property to Tata Memorial Hospital, which lies just 400 metres away, so that it could construct an additional chemotherapy centre. Currently, the hospital, which is said to treat one-third of the country’s total population of cancer patients, has 100 beds for chemotherapy, vastly inadequate for the over 500 patients who require the lifesaving intervention. “I used to see the condition of patients when I used to visit my dad’s press, many of them were in a pitiful state, sometimes waiting even on the roads and pavements outside the hospital in extremely harsh conditions,” she tells me by way of explanation of what led her to her act of unbound magnanimity and selflessness. “Later, through my aunt Dr Zarin Bharucha, who was a leading figure in the Red Cross and the establishment of blood banks in India, I had many opportunities to visit the hospital to donate blood and see first-hand the immense suffering faced by patients due to the shortage of beds. So, when I inherited the property, I had no doubt that this was the right thing to do,” she says. Here, I interject with the 120 crore questions on everyone’s mind: Was there no opposition from her family to the idea? No one who discouraged her saying there could be more pressing, personal compunctions to be considered? After all, how many people would turn down the opportunity to enjoy the windfall of such a large fortune? “Fortunately, with God’s grace, my husband who is a successful chartered accountant and hails from a solid middle-class Maharashtrian family that believes in giving, encouraged me to do so. And touch wood, even my son who is working as a techie in Bengaluru did not have any objections. I guess we were all brought up to know the difference between one’s needs and one’s wants,” she says, adding “Also, my parents taught me that when it comes to charity, one’s right hand must not know what one’s left hand does.” As she tells me, it was her aunt Dr Bharucha, her mother’s sister-in-law, who had been instrumental in making her wish to donate her land to the hospital a reality. “My aunt introduced me to the hospital trust, got the ball rolling and encouraged me through the entire process of dealing with authorities in the hospital and the civic body which took around two-and-a-half years,” she says. **************************************Ironically, it is a day after Dr Bharucha’s funeral that I have my conversation with DM. “She will not be there to see the opening of the new wing,” says the doting niece about her aunt who passed away last Sunday, due to age-related illnesses, after a life spent in service and selflessness. Finally, I ask DM, if in the absence of her name, she would at least like to share a photograph of her late parents, to be carried along with this article and she says she will reflect on it and let me know. The next day, I receive the following message from her, as always, polite and to the point, but firm. “Good morning,” it reads, “Slept on your suggestion for the photograph, but I feel my parents would have also wanted it to be kept quiet…” And that gentle readers, concludes my conversation with the amazing Mumbai lady who, in an age of rampant greed and self-interest where few acts of kindness and selflessness get done and then too never without accompanying hype and hyperbole, has proven that empathy, decency and humanity still exist. And that you do not have to be rich or famous to be generous, just an ordinary citizen of Mumbai whose heart beats for the city and its people. And yes, although I know DM’s name and have her number, I have every intention of respecting her wish for anonymity and privacy and not revealing her personal details. After all, that’s the least she deserves — don’t you think?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-a-modern-day-mumbai-miracle-101631888365667.html
17-09-2021||Chandigarh||This Kashmiri Pandit has dedicated her life to saving animals||A 10-year-old girl, who had to flee the Valley with her parents and younger brother back in the 1989, is in her 40s today, who chose not to marry so that she can devote her time to take care of her 331 ‘children’. Meet Namrata Hakhoo, a Kashmiri Pandit migrant, who has dedicated her life to look after abandoned and injured street animals as “she can feel their pain and suffering”. “I am a single woman living with my elderly parents in Jammu since 1989 when we had to flee our home in Kashmir to escape radicals and terrorists. I am the founder of Hakhoo Street Animals Foundation Trust (registered) and we are taking care of street animals since 1993,” she says. Namrata runs the shelter inside her home on three and a half kanals in Hakkal village near Chatha on the outskirts of Jammu city. “Right now, we are living with 331 street animals on whom we spend ₹14,000 daily,” she says. Being a Kashmiri Pandit migrant, her father gets a cash relief of ₹9,750 every month, which is not enough for the family. “We have sold everything, including gold ornaments of my mother. We don’t have any source of income. We want to do more for animals on the streets, but financial crisis is giving us a tough time,” she adds. Future plans“We want to build a 100-kennel rehabilitation shelter for street animals. But without the support of the society, the goal can’t be achieved. We want that more and more street animals get timely treatment, surgeries, shelter and food,” she says. Available 24x7 for rescue and rehabilitation of street animals for the past 28 years, Namrata’s trust currently has 331 animals, including oxen, cows, pigs, monkeys, eagles, pigeons, cats, dogs, owl, parrots, horses, and calves. Notably, all the animals have been vaccinated. “We are also very particular about deworming procedure of animals and follow every suggestion of veterinary doctor,” she says. Namrata, who had to shut her computer institute in a bid to house animals, tries to provide proper diet to the animals but has lately cut her meals to twice a day. “We are in debt of ₹6 lakh as we had to buy food, medicines and other things needed for the rescued animals,” she says. “We are facing severe financial crunch, but to treat an injured voiceless animal and bring him home gives us immense satisfaction. I am doing it for myself and not for others,” she adds. She recalls how ‘Hakhoo Ghar’, which started with two pet dogs, has become a big family of 331 animals. “We, in the meantime, also feed 1,000 animals on the street,” she says. The ever-swelling number of animals has compelled Namrata to sleep on a mattress in her kitchen while her parents sleep in a small room. “We have dedicated our lives to animal welfare and have given up on luxuries,” she says. Namrata passed her Class 12 from Kendriya Vidyalaya before getting an NCSC degree in networking essentials. She has so far received no help either from the government or any NGO. “Since 1993 till 2019, we were doing it on our own but now we are seeking support from the people. I approached J&K L-G Manoj Sinha on his grievances cell, wrote to the PM on his official account and contacted actor Sonu Sood in Mumbai, but am yet receive any response,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/this-kashmiri-pandit-has-dedicated-her-life-to-saving-animals-101631887525422.html
17-09-2021||Pune||Noted physicist Thanu Padmanabhan passes away in Pune||Pune: Renowned physicist and professor at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Thanu Padmanabhan passed away after suffering a heart attack at his official residence in Pune on Friday. The theoretical physicist was rushed to a hospital, where he died during treatment, according to his former colleague. The 64-year-old scientist is survived by his wife Dr Vasanthi Padmanabhan and daughter Hamsa. A Padma Shri recipient in 2007, Padmanabhan has authored over 300 research papers and several books on gravitation, quantum gravity, and structure and formation of the universe. He was ranked 24th amongst top scientists in the world by the Stanford University for his research in Theoretical Physics. Born in Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala) on March 10, 1957, Padmanabhan completed his graduation and post-graduation from the University College of Kerala with gold medals. He joined the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai in 1979, and later pursued a postdoctoral degree from the Institute of Astronomy under the University of Cambridge, UK. In 1992, he moved to Pune to join as dean of IUCAA and has been working here since then. Professor Ajit Kembhavi, former IUCAA director, who worked along with Prof Padmanabhan for the past more than 30 years, said, “He was an outstanding physicist, astronomer and scholar. He has written a series of highly acclaimed and technical books on different aspects of Theoretical Astrophysics and Theoretical Physics. It is a great loss to the astronomical community.” “He was not only my colleague in IUCAA, but we first worked together in TIFR in Mumbai prior to 1989. Then I moved to IUCAA Pune and he also later joined the institute. Though we were both working in the same institute for so many years, we did not do any research together but our bond as colleagues was strong,” said Kembhavi. Kembhavi said that Prof Padmanabhan was a quiet person engaged in his work along with his team of students, post-doctorates and co-workers. “He was busy with his research in his field and used to regularly publish his works,” Kembhavi said. Staff, colleagues and students paid homage to Prof Padmanabhan at the IUCAA campus and he was taken to the crematorium in Aundh for last rites at around 2 pm. “This is one of the saddest days in the history of IUCAA, Pune and the Indian scientific community today. Professor Thanu Padmanabhan Padma Shri passed away this morning as a result of a cardiac arrest. Padmanabhan known as Paddy to us all, leaves behind his wife and daughter, innumerable friends, admirers, colleagues, teachers and his monumental legacy of research and textbooks.” said IUCAA director Prof Somak Raychaudhury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/noted-physicist-thanu-padmanabhan-passed-away-in-pune-101631884585211.html

While the Telangana police said it was a clear case of suicide, the family of the deceased alleged it was a murder by the police.On Friday, Telangana state civil liberties committee secretary G Laxman moved a lunch-motion petition before the state high court expressing doubts over the manner in which the accused died. He alleged that the police killed the man and called it a suicide.The high court bench, comprising acting chief justice MS Ramachandar Rao and justice T Amarnath Goud then ordered a judicial inquiry.The high court appointed Third Metropolitan Magistrate of Warangal court as the judicial officer to conduct the inquiry and submit his report in a sealed cover within four weeks.The high court bench ordered that all the videos be submitted to the judicial officer in Warangal by 8pm on Saturday.Also Read | Dead Maoist leader’s wife Sammakka surrenders to Telangana PoliceAt a press conference earlier, director general of police M Mahender Reddy said there was no foul play. “There were witnesses to the incident, including railway workers and locals.

It is not correct to make baseless allegations against the police,” he said.The deceased was on the run since the night of September 9, when the Hyderabad police found the body of the six-year-old girl in his room at Saidabad, following a complaint lodged by her parents that she was missing. Post-mortem report revealed that she was raped and strangled to death.The Hyderabad Police, which booked a case of murder and rape case, besides under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, formed 15 special teams to track down the suspect.They also widely circulated his details, particularly the tattoos on his arms. They also announced a cash reward of ₹10 lakh for those giving information about him. A week later, his body was found on railway tracks near Station Ghanpur.

17-09-2021||Kolkata||Following Rajya Sabha exit, Arpita Ghosh appointed TMC Bengal general secretary||Two days after resigning as the Member of Parliament (MP) of Rajya Sabha, Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Arpita Ghosh has been appointed as the general secretary of the party’s West Bengal committee.In a letter, TMC president Subrata Bakshi informed the party’s decision to appoint Ghosh in the role. “As desired by West Bengal Trinamool Congress Committee, I would like to inform you that you have been nominated as general secretary… with immediate effect. I trust and hope you will work sincerely for the betterment of the organisation,” the letter read.Following her resignation and the acceptance of the same by Vice President and chairman of House, M Venkaiah Naidu, on Wednesday, Ghosh said that she now wants to work for TMC’s organisation.Ghosh thanked TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who is also the nephew of party supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, for giving the artiste-turned politician the opportunity to serve the people in different capacities.In a letter explaining her thoughts regarding the exit from Parliament, Ghosh said she had been pondering over her continuing role in TMC following the party’s landslide victory in the West Bengal Assembly elections. “My goal is clear: I wish to continue to serve the people of Bengal under the leadership of chief minister Mamata Banerjee,” she said, adding that she would be in a “better position” to achieve her goals by resigning from the Rajya Sabha.However, people familiar with the development of the matter reportedly hinted that Ghosh’s move was prompted by the TMC. BJP West Bengal president Dilip Ghosh said that the TMC leader was “forced to resign” by the “dictatorial leadership” of the party. “It shows the party does not believe in democracy within the organisation,” he added.However, TMC leader and West Bengal minister Firhad Hakim asserted that the TMC “granted” Ghosh’s “wish” of working for the organisation. “Dilip Ghosh should not meddle into internal affairs of the Trinamool Congress,” Hakim added.Ghosh echoed Hakim’s statement and stuck to her earlier point to work for the organisation, adding that staying in West Bengal would also allow her to devote “more time” to her “passion – theatre.”Arpita Ghosh had won the 2014 Lok Sabha polls as a TMC candidate from the Balurghat constituency in West Bengal. She was elected as the Rajya Sabha MP following her defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from the same constituency.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/following-rajya-sabha-exit-arpita-ghosh-appointed-tmc-bengal-general-secretary-101631878023214.html
17-09-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan government considering opening camel shelters amid declining population||In view of the sharp decline in camel population in Rajasthan and for its effective conservation, the Rajasthan government is considering starting oonth shala (camel shelters), similar to cow shelters, officials. According to the state government, the camel population has witnessed a sharp decline of 34%. From 3.5 lakh in 2015 the numbers of camels across the state stood at 2.13 lakh in 2019. On 16 September 2014, camel was declared as the state animal in Rajasthan. According to the Animal Census 2019, about 84.43% of the total number of camels in the country are in Rajasthan. The census shows that the number of camels is on the decline for the last 30 years. Minister of the animal husbandry department, Lal Chand Kataria, said the main reason for the decline in the number of camels is the continuous development of mechanical resources and availability of a high level of transport facility up to the village level. Under the Rajasthan Camel (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act 2015, there is a ban on the slaughter of camels and taking them out of the state without competent permission, due to which the use of camels is continuously decreasing. “It is true that ever since the law for camel protection has been enacted in the state, the number of camels in the state has decreased since then. I am a farmer and can understand the problems being faced by the camel owners,” he said replying to the attention motion raised by MLA Rajendra Rathod during the zero hour in the state assembly. He said the suggestion by assembly members, such as deputy opposition leader Rajendra Rathore and others, to build a camel shelter like a gaushala (cow shelter) is justified. ‘We also want that a camel shelter should be considered like a gaushala,” he added. The minister said in the absence of effective efforts to stop camel smuggling and its conservation, in the coming time, may risk their survival. Kataria said the government is committed to the protection of camels. “There is a need for partial amendment in the law made in the year 2015 for camel protection. A draft has been prepared to amend this law and it will be passed in the next session of the assembly,” he said. It is learned that the government in the amendments might allow the sale of camels outside the state. The sale of camels outside the state and their use as transport medium are banned Under the Rajasthan Camel (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act 2015, which affected the revenue model of the camel owners. The state police, to date, has recovered over 230 camels, which were being smuggled. As many as 21 were arrested in associated cases. The decline is not new, as per official livestock census figures available with the animal husbandry department of the state government. Between 1951 and 1992, the number of camels in Rajasthan continued to increase, barring a small decline in 1988. The first major decline was registered between 1992 and 1997 when the number of camels declined from 7.46 lakh to 6.69 lakh. The highest-ever camel population in the state was 7.56 lakh in the year 1983. However, the current figure of 2.13 lakh camels in the state is lower than 3.41 lakh camels in the year 1951. On the idea of camel shelters, Hanwant Singh, president of Lokhit Pashu Palak Sansthan, an NGO which works with camel pastoralists, said, “The shelter can be for old, injured, stray, and ill camels, but the healthy and useful ones should not be kept there.” He suggested developing a camel sanctuary. “Cows can be kept in hundreds but five camels cannot be kept together during the breeding season,” he reasoned. On declining population, he said the price of camels is continuously dropping – in the recent Tilwara fair held in Barmer district a camel between 4 to 5 years old was sold at ₹5000 to ₹7000. Before 2015, pastoralists used to get up to ₹50,000 for a camel but the law has resulted in a fall in prices, he added. Singh said earlier, the buyers used to come from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and other states, they used camels for agriculture purposes. “After the Rajasthan Camel (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 2015 came into force, the process to take a camel out of state has become a tedious one. It takes months to years to get a clearance. The law was to protect the camel but instead, the number is decreasing,” he said. He demanded that the government should allow its sale outside the state and even abroad – the camel prices in Pakistan are between ₹2 to ₹2.5 lakh. And here in the state, there is a ban on its transport and sale. Meanwhile, the Rajasthan high court has taken suo-moto note of the sharp decline of the camel population in the state and appointed Advocate Prateek Kasliwal as amicus curiae to suggest changes in the law enacted in 2015 to regulate slaughter and transport of the state animal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-government-considering-opening-camel-shelters-amid-declining-population-101631879246680.html
17-09-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: When Anarchy gets a seat at the Democratic table||September 15 was International Day of Democracy, so I got to thinking and eventually realised that I love half-baked knowledge, just love it. It allows me to make bold statements, paint grand visions, construct surface-level premises with no depth and generally spare no effort in making a fool of myself.Thankfully we are living in times where no one is really listening to what I am saying. That’s because everyone can - and is - expressing their own opinion. We are all equal.Imagine if I were to be elected to a committee or become a member of a group for people. Or, if I were to start a community… or a technology company backed by investors. Then the matter would be different. Because there would be others who would have a vested interest in my opinion and its popularity and dissemination, and would, probably, support and even defend my opinions and positions.Now let’s alter a variable and say that my bold statements were not about making a fool of myself, but something that would alter society‘s status quo if they gained support from others. Or change the way business is done. Or change the negotiating leverage of a section of society. The stakes are now a little higher. Because I have support of others, it makes me an influencer. And with the support of my newfound community, and their hard work and intelligence and passion, slowly but steadily, my sphere of influence will increase, putting me in competition with other influencers, which in turn increases the chances of neighbourhood or local (definitely some social) media attention. Thus, my unimportant opinions now grow into some value. From here, depending on the momentum (all of the stakeholders generate) it can grow into a movement, a force, maybe even a policy if someone gets elected to a public body or office.Now let’s specify the knowledge I am spewing and call it “data”. Let us also acknowledge that data is a resource. For any given resource, there are many different interests and therefore, many different positioning statements for each interest and therefore many different stakeholders for each of those positioning statements. Once a viewpoint gains momentum it becomes a force (small or big) and then it has political clout. And each political clout negotiates with all other political clouts, which works as a check and balance for overall society on most matters.That’s how democracy functions. Laws are made around this concept and the idea of justice is defined within this understanding. It’s like a free-market economy. This is also how nations of the world work with each other. In times past, there has been the age of monarchies, there has been the age of oligarchies. This is the age of democratic negotiations. But all nations are not democratic, just as all power-centres are not governments.We often assume that the opposite of democracy is autocracy (as in communist or theocratic or monarchial states). That’s a fallacy. At one end of the spectrum is organised rule and at the other end of that spectrum is anarchy. Organised rule is the existence of control groups within a society of individuals - democracy, socialism, communism, monarchy, theocracy, oligarchy are different forms of organised rule. The objective of organised rule is to maintain order through negotiated homogeneity, or acceptance of a common uniformity. Anarchy is the existence of individuals and small disorganised groups. The objective of anarchy is absence of controlling authority and absolute individual freedom. (If we replace the “individual” with nation, and “controlling authority” with world order, we can read this as: The objective of anarchy is absence of control from the world order and absolute freedom for the nation to conduct itself as it pleases.)The history of human civilisation is the history of development of different forms of organised rule. For not so obvious reasons, anarchies have rarely survived since they have been usually assimilated by neighbouring organised-rule nations. But like with all ages, there are always voices of anarchic dissent. And with the right environment and some astute alliances, dissenting voices can easily become a movement, then a force and maybe even get a seat at the table.The conflict in the current age is a conflict between religion and organised government for control of the human masses, their mind-spaces and their productivity. We have been through several ages and types of rule, and in each the control of human productivity was with the ruler of the times - religious leaders, monarchs, tyrants, governments - end result in each was the same for the individual - subjugation.Democracy has emerged as the most effective of the types of rule because it provides an impression of freedom, and systematically dismantles the influence of religion and other power centres till the common wo(man) willingly conforms to the progressive life prescribed by the alliance between political parties and business organisations. That’s because the rhetoric of democracy is inclusion, equal treatment and participation.What happens if an anarchic wave finds support from religious totalitarian and autocratic allies in an overwhelmingly large democratic environment? By nature, democracies first quote procedure, law, and rights, then they sanction (economic always, economic), embargo and use armed deterrent; then they talk, discuss, negotiate and eventually, if the dissenter has potential to damage the world order, they make space and accommodate with terms and conditions and start releasing resources to the new entrant. But what is likely to happen when a primarily violent anarchic state with no common ground with democratic ideals, is accommodated in a democratic setup? Democratic nations will hope that the anarchists will come into the fold. History, however, shows that anarchists do not deviate from their agenda, especially religious anarchies. A violent theocracy is usually what emerges.What does this mean for the displaced people of the erstwhile nation? What does it mean for the democracies of the world? And what does it mean for the democracy of the region? Is an appeasing democratic approach capable of addressing the threat of an alliance of autocratic, military dictatorship and theocratic nations? Is it responsible of democratic institutions to fork out billions of dollars in aid into the hands of violent regimes?It is unfair and unjust (in a democracy) to suspect and persecute people on grounds of religion or caste or colour or creed or socio-economic background. Similarly, it is naive and dangerous to think of religious anarchic extremism as a form of plurality within the democratic vocabulary. These are twains that are unlikely to ever meet. Thankfully, there are enough wise people to think about all of this and protect the world at large. Hopefully, our future and safety will not rest in the hands of the same wise people who have brought us to where we stand today.

17-09-2021||Dehradun||Char Dham yatra to start from Saturday with capping on number of pilgrims||After the Uttarakhand high the court lifted its stay on Char Dham yatra, it will officially start from Saturday with a capping on the number of pilgrims that will be allowed daily to the four revered Himalayan shrines., officials said.Ravinath Raman, chief executive officer of Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, said, the yatra will start on Saturday and the SOPs related to it will be released by the evening. “The pilgrims from anywhere who want to visit Char Dham will have to register themselves on the website of Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board (https://badrinath-kedarnath.gov.in/) where a sub-link will be provided for the same after the state government issues the SOPs. Also, they will have to bring a negative Covid-19 report with them or a certificate of having received both the doses of Covid-19 vaccination,” he said. On Thursday, the HC lifted its June 28 stay on Char Dham yatra. The number of pilgrims to be allowed daily will be 800 for Kedarnath, 1000 for Badrinath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri. Following the development, chief secretary SS Sandhu chaired a high-level meeting with senior officials from various departments on Thursday evening, issuing important directions to the district magistrates of Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi, where four revered shrines are located, regarding various arrangements and preparations for Char Dham yatra. Kedarnath shrine is located in Rudraprayag district, while Badrinath is in Chamoli district. Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines are located in Uttarkashi district. Singh directed the district magistrates (DMs) that proper arrangements be made on the Char Dham route with regard to road safety, sanitation, crowd management, transport management, Covid testing. Singh also issued directions that road stretches on the Char Dham route, which need repair work, should be repaired on a war footing. He also directed them to ensure sensitive points on Char Dham routes where pilgrims walk on foot to be sanitised, have drinking water and toilet facility and so on. The chief secretary also directed the DMs to ensure that SOPs on Char Dham are followed by the pilgrims and that they are tested for Covid-19 and follow all norms. He also directed for Covid-19 to be announced on loudspeakers along the routes. Other directions included ensuring the availability of enough doctors, ambulances on the routes, registration of pilgrims, providing important information to pilgrims on their mobile phones and through banners along the Char Dham routes. Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri, collectively, are called the Char Dham. The shrines attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. Traditionally, the Char Dham pilgrimage begins from the west from Yamunotri, proceeding to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east. Last year in June, the state government restricted the number of local pilgrims for Char Dham pilgrimage. The authorities had capped the daily influx of local pilgrims, allowing only 1200 per day for Badrinath, 800 for Kedarnath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for the Yamunotri shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/char-dham-yatra-to-start-from-saturday-with-capping-on-number-of-pilgrims-101631876248304.html

However, essential services will remain exempted, Pawar said.According to news agency ANI, the senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) also said that restaurants and hotels will remain open. The shutdown will be effective across Pune city, Pune cantonment and rural areas.The 10-day Ganesh Chaturthi festival, which usually sees millions crowding the city streets, is being celebrated across Maharashtra in a low-key manner with several curbs in place amid the unrelenting Covid-19 pandemic.In the wake of a ban on physical visits of devotees to community pandals (marquees), a lot of mandals in the state have arranged online ‘darshan’ or telecast of their idols through their official websites.The government has been urging for a muted celebration of the key festival as fears of an imminent third wave of the virus writ large.Earlier, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said people's health was more important than any festival and appealed to citizens to launch a strong movement against coronavirus. He said he prayed to Lord Ganesh to destroy all "evil and negativity".In Mumbai, police have imposed orders under CrPC section 144 prohibiting assembly of five or more persons between September 10 and 19.No procession of any kind would be allowed in the city during this period and devotees would not be allowed to visit Ganesh pandals either.While the home department has issued a circular banning visits to pandals, the height of Lord Ganesh idols to be installed has been restricted as well.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/all-shops-in-pune-to-stay-shut-on-sunday-for-ganesh-visarjan-ajit-pawar-101631868987480.html

Congratulating the people of the state, Kovind said this was a year of delight as India was celebrating the 75th anniversary of Independence, while Himachal Pradesh was commemorating the golden jubilee of its statehood. Democratic consciousness of people Appreciating the democratic traditions set by the Himachal assembly, the President said the address of the leader of opposition was a perfect example of the mature democratic setup of the Vidhan Sabha. He remembered the efforts made by leaders, including former chief minister Yashwant Singh Parmar and Pandit Padam Dev, in the integration of hill states. “It’s due to democratic consciousness of people of this state that the credit of being the first voter of independent India goes to Himachal’s Shyam Saran Negi hails from here,” he said. 101-year-old Ram Sharan Negi of Kinnaur is the first voter of independent India and is now the brand ambassador of the Election Commission. Hill state a hydel powerhouse The President said Himachal had been ranked second in Sustainable Development Goals India Index 2020-21. Lauding the contribution of Himachal in defence forces, the President paid tributes to valiant soldiers, including Param Vir Chakra awardees Som Nath Sharma, Captain Vikram Batra and Rifleman Subedar Sanjay Kumar and Kargil martyr Saurabh Kalia. He appreciated Himachal for its efforts for the conservation of the environment. “Today, Himachal has become a model hill state,” he said, adding it generates one-fourth of the country’s total 45,000MW hydel generation capacity and is a power surplus state. He said the total road length has gone up to 37,808km as compared to 7,370km in 1971. Call for setting up Himachal Regiment Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said the state has imposed a ban on forest felling but has not been compensated yet. He urged the President for setting up a Himachal Regiment in the Indian Army in view the contribution of the state in defence forces. “Being a small state, we also lack in railway and air connectivity. Himachal’s apple economy is worth ₹5000 crore but the apple growers are not getting remunerable prices for their produce,” said Aghnihotri. He demanded to stop the import of apple or hike the import tax so that farmers of Himachal get a fair price for their crop. In his address, Himachal governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar said the Vidhan Sabha is a temple of democracy as MLAs raise issues concerning the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/president-lauds-democratic-traditions-set-by-himachal-assembly-101631867834726.html

The two-day mela is centered on the theme: ‘Karie parali di sambhal, dharti maa hove khushhal’, in line with the state government’s focus on eliminating crop stubble burning.“Till date, the Indian Constitution has been amended 127 times, so why can it not be amended once again to scrap the farm laws and resolve the imbroglio resulting from them,” asked the chief minister. “What is the problem in doing it a 128th time,” he demanded to know from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Narendra Modi government at the Centre.Says protest democratic right of farmersRecalling that he had been asked by the Centre to stop Punjab’s farmers from going to Delhi last November, the chief minister said he had refused to do so, as protest is the democratic right of farmers. “Why should they not protest? How can I stop them?” he asked.Capt Amarinder said Punjab, with only 1.53% of total geographical area of India, produces about 18% of the country’s wheat, 11% paddy, 4.4% cotton and 10% milk. For the past many decades, Punjab has been contributing about 35-40% of wheat and 25-30% of rice to the central pool, he said.The chief minister pointed out that the state had attained a record wheat productivity (5188 kg/ha) and production (182.6 lakh tonnes) during 2018-19. It also achieved a record rice productivity (4366 kg/ha) and production (133.8 lakh tons) during 2017-18. Record cotton productivity (827 kg lint/ha) was also achieved during 2019-20, he added.Checking stubble burning, promoting diversificationIn his welcome address earlier, Anirudh Tewari, ACS(D)-cum-vice chancellor, PAU, said that during the Covid pandemic, the chief minister had asked all departments to be innovative to ensure continuance of work and extension service to farmers and the virtual Kisan Mela was a step in this direction.Referring to the Kisan Mela’s theme, Tewari pointed out that Punjab had been demanding ₹100 per quintal assistance for farmers for stubble management from the Centre, with the Chief Minister raising the issue with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He referred to the promotion of horticulture and exotic vegetables to wean farmers away from the wheat-paddy cycle.Platform to support farmersDr Jaskaran Singh Mehal, director of extension education, PAU, spoke about the reach of the Kisan Mela, which farmers from across the country had been joining. The live telecast of the mela and the interactions with the farmers on YouTube and Facebook helped in a bigger outreach and impact, he added.Dr Inderjeet Singh, vice-chancellor, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana, described the Mela as an important platform to support farmers. These Kisan Melas are a source of information on advances in agriculture.The Kisan Mela will witness panel discussions on: Crop residue management, scope of horticultural and forestry crops, natural resource management, livestock production and subsidiary occupations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/scrap-farm-laws-talk-to-farmers-for-way-forward-punjab-cm-to-centre-101631866094660.html
17-09-2021||Chandigarh||Sports ministry asks NRAI to initiate fresh election process||Just a day before the National Rifle Association of India’s (NRAI) elections in Mohali, the sports ministry has directed the shooting body to initiate the process afresh after presidential candidate Shyam Singh Yadav cited “perceptible conflict of interest” in the appointment of the returning officer for the polls. The NRAI will, however, go ahead with the elections on Saturday as the matter is pending before the Delhi high court with the next date of hearing in December. Incumbent president Raninder Singh is seeking re-election and is being challenged by Yadav. Also read: Tenure issue raised ahead of NRAI pollIn view of the ministry order, the elections are set to be declared null and void. Acting on a petition filed by Uttar Pradesh State Rifle Association president Yadav, the ministry ordered that the returning officer should be changed to ensure that the national sports code, 2011, is not violated. Yadav is a Bahujan Samaj Party Lok Sabha MP from UP’s Jaunpur constituency, while Raninder Singh, serving his third term in the top job, is the son of Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Returning officer is Punjab vigilance head The returning officer for the elections is Justice (retd) Mehtab Singh Gill, whose appointment, the petitioner alleged, was not done in a fair manner. “It has also been contended by the petitioner that the returning officer was appointed as the chief vigilance commissioner (CVC) of the state of Punjab under the Punjab State Vigilance Commission Act;....and that name for the said post has been recommended by a three-member committee headed by a close relative of the present president of the NRAI,” the ministry said in the letter which is in possession of PTI. “A perceptible conflict of interest arising out of imputed personal and professional relations among the RO and the concerned stakeholders has been drawn by the petitioner. Therefore, NRAI is directed to appoint a new returning officer and initiate a fresh election process for conducting elections to its governing body in a fair, objective and transparent manner by adhering to the provisions of National Sports Development Code of India, 2011,” the letter added. Raninder completes 12 years by 2022-end The ministry also looked into the objections raised by Yadav regarding Raninder Singh’s tenure but found the incumbent to have a legitimate claim at re-election. According to the sports code, “The president of any recognised NSF, including the IOA, can hold the office for a maximum of 12 years, with or without a break.” Going by the technicalities, Raninder Singh remains a valid candidate as he will complete 12 years in the post at the end of 2022. “The petitioner has raised the issue of the present president of NRAI seeking his re-election as president for the fourth term, whereas this ministry, letter No. 52-66/2009 SP-I (Vol.II) dated 30.10.2017, provides that he is serving his third term as president of NRAI for 2017-21,” the ministry noted. Raninder Singh had defeated Yadav for the president’s post in the NRAI’s 2010 and 2017 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sports-ministry-asks-nrai-to-initiate-fresh-election-process-101631861234116.html

"Entry and exit for Pandit Shree Ram Sharma and Bahadurgarh City have been closed," Delhi Metro tweeted.The two stations are near Tikri border with Haryana, one of the sites of the ongoing farmers protests. These station fall on the Green Line of the network.Vehicular movement was also affected at Jhandewalan-Panchkuian road in the national capital ahead of protests led by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) over the farm laws. In a traffic advisory, Delhi Traffic Police said both the routes on the Jharoda Kalan border will remain closed because of the protests. Traffic from the Pusa roundabout going towards Shankar Road has also been diverted towards Pusa Road.SAD leaders Sukhbir Singh Badal and Harsimrat Kaur Badal have decided to hold a protest march to Parliament on Friday as the party is observing September 17 as 'Black Day' on completion of one year of enactment of the three contentious farm laws. The protest march will be held from Delhi's Gurdwara Rakabganj to the Parliament, demanding repeal of the three laws.The three farm laws that were passed last year include the Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020.The three legislation opened the agriculture sector to the private players of the country, prompting countrywide protests by farmers' unions. The agitators claim that the laws are anti farmers and it would erode a longstanding mechanism that ensures farmers a minimum guaranteed price for their produce. However, the government says this will help growers get better prices.Since the agitation began in November last year, the Union government has had several rounds of discussions but failed to bring any resolution to the impasse. Farmers are firm on their demands of complete repeal of laws and say they will not back down until the government agrees. In November, the farmers' agitation will complete one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-entry-and-exit-gates-closed-at-these-delhi-metro-stations-101631857393842.html

With the Mahanadi basin recording a massive 27.6 mm rainfall on Wednesday, which is 341 per cent more than the normal, the water inflow to Hirakud reservoir has crossed the 10500 cubic meters per second on Friday morning hours forcing the officials to open 28 gates of the reservoir.The flood situation in Balasore, Bhadrak and Mayurbhanj turned grim as rivers Baitarani, Subaranarekha and Jalaka were flowing above danger level due to rains in upper catchment areas. In Balasore district, the flood-like situation turned grim after the Galudiha barrage released 6100 cusec water from the reservoir inundating 40 villages under Bhograi block and 30 villages in Baliapal block in low lying areas. In Bhadrak district, hundreds of villages under Dhamnagar block were marooned by the floodwaters.The floods have so far led to 8 deaths while two are still missing. The flood has affected over 2.4 million people in 4,964 villages, 33 municipalities and 139 blocks of 24 districts in Odisha. While over 7,500 houses have been damaged, around 130,000 hectares of agricultural land has been inundated.A minor boy, who was swept away in floodwater in Dhenkanal district on Tuesday, was miraculously rescued in Brahmani river. The boy who was staying at his uncle’s house had come to the bank of Brahmani river to take a bath. However, he lost his footing on the edge and slipped into the river.Officials however said they are worried over a cyclonic circulation over East-central Bay of Bengal and adjoining Myanmar that would reach Northwest Bay of Bengal off north Odisha West Bengal coasts around September 18. India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said the cyclonic circulation is likely to intensify into a Low-Pressure Area and trigger low to moderate rainfall in some districts of north Odisha on the evening of September 18 and heavy rainfall on September 19 and 20 in few districts of north Odisha.Heavy rainfall is very likely to occur at one or two places over the districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Mayurbhanj on September 18. Heavy rainfall is very likely to occur at one or two places over the districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Kendrapara, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Khurda, Sundargarh, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Dhenkanal on September 19, said an IMD official. As September 20 is a full moon day, officials are worried over seawater blocking the discharge of floodwater.One more low-pressure system forecast to brew over the Bay of Bengal between September 26 and 28 is also likely to cause a fresh headache for Odisha farmers. Under its influence, Balasore is going to record rainfall up to around 8mm per hour while other north Odisha districts like Bhadrak, Jajpur, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Dhenkanal and Cuttack are predicted to measure rain in the range of 4 mm per hour.Farmers said the two consecutive low-pressure formations may hamper agricultural operations in northern Odisha as paddy in low lying areas would be inundated. “The current spate of rains due to last week’s depression over the Bay was good for the crops. But two more low-pressure systems would ruin crops on low lying areas of northern Odisha,” said farmer leader Arun Jena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-stations-46-disaster-response-teams-as-flood-situation-turns-grim-101631857455971.html

In a week-long signature campaign run by the Progressive Students’ Forum (PSF)—an informal student group on campus—426 students have said they would like the institute to reopen to address the learning difficulties faced by students during online teaching. The institute shut down its campuses and switched to online education in March 2020 following the Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. “The TISS administration must reopen the campus with a plan of action, taking into account the feedback and participation of the student community. Election committee to be set up following which an elected Student Union is to be constituted. Reduce the fees considering the online education mode, and due to difficulties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, students and families are in severe crisis,” said the PSF in a statement issued on Thursday. A senior official from TISS administration, on the condition of anonymity, said that irrespective of the signature campaign by students, the institute is assessing the situation based on its internal processes. In November last year, the PSF had conducted a survey of 549 students across all four campuses—Mumbai, Hyderabad, Tuljapur, Guwahati. Almost 70% of the respondents had said they wanted the campus to reopen and only 28.8% were comfortable with online education. At that time, the PSF had written to the administration demanding reopening of campuses in a phase-wise manner, with guidelines for attendance and how to conduct classes while maintaining social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/over-400-tiss-students-vote-in-favour-of-reopening-campus-101631853195284.html

17-09-2021||Patna||Bihar schools reopen after Covid disruption, wait for books continues midsession||In Bihar, the availability of books is never ensured to students in schools at the start of the academic session in April and often stretches beyond mid-session. This year is no different despite the Patna high court also taking cognizance of the delayed supply of books a few years ago while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) and directing the government to ensure timely availability.In August, the Karnataka High Court had also observed that “printing of textbooks must keep pace with the opening of schools” and directed the state government to submit a status report on the distribution of textbooks, notebooks to students.After the Bihar government failed to ensure timely availability of books to students studying in thousands of government schools year after year, it sought approval from the Centre in 2017 for giving commensurate amount to students through direct benefit transfer (DBT) in the bank accounts of the students or parents of wards below 10 years of age for purchase of books from the open market. After initially refusing permission, the Centre later agreed.However, that has not solved the problem, as even in September this year, as the schools reopened after a long gap due to the Covid-19 pandemic, lakhs of students continue to wait for the money to purchase books from the open market, if available. Strangely, Bihar still has a big set up of the Bihar state textbook publishing corporation, which earlier supplied books to students.In many cases, money has been deposited, but books are still not purchased for varying reasons ranging from non-availability to reluctance.A school headmaster said that providing books timely to the students would have been the best option, as the small amount provided with delay in the name of books is invariably misused or is of no use, as aware parents of students don’t wait for it and manage it on their own. “The schools remained closed for over a year and reopening without books does not serve the purpose. We are also managing it for students. The preparations should have been made beforehand,” he added.After September, there will be long holidays for Dussehra, Diwali and Chhath and before the winter vacation, it will be time to fill up forms for exams. In between, there is panchayat poll, training for it and other non-academic engagements for teachers. That will leave the students, already affected due to almost missing education in the schools during the Covid period, as reflected through different surveys, with very little time even to flip through the books whenever made available.Managing Director of the Bihar state textbook publishing corporation, Manoj Kumar, said the process had been initiated to transfer the amount in the bank accounts of students. “We have sought information from the district level officials. We have got ₹402-crore for disbursal of amount for this year and the process has begun. The printers have said that the books are available with the retailers and the students can get it. The money will also reach them,” he added.The MD said that camps would also be organised at the local level later this month to make books available. “We held a meeting with the printers also. The district officials have been asked to monitor that all students purchase books,” he added.Principal secretary, department of education, Sanjay Kumar had on September 1 issued guidelines to all district-level officials regarding the purchase of books by students with the money transferred in bank accounts of students. He expressed displeasure on September 9 over reports that books were not being purchased. “Availability of prescribed books is of paramount importance for quality education and this must be ensured through inspection. The report regarding availability of books should also reach the department in the prescribed format every Monday,” he wrote to all the district education officers and district programme officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-schools-reopen-after-covid-disruption-wait-for-books-continues-midsession-101631848394829.html

17-09-2021||Chandigarh||AAP, Akali Dal to mark 'Black Day' on completion of one year of farm laws||Punjab's main opposition party – the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) – will observe September 17 (Friday) as “black day" on the completion of one year of the enactment of the Centre's three farm laws. In a statement, the Aam Aadmi Party said that it will also hold candle marches across the state to pay tribute to the farmers who died during the ongoing agitation against the farm legislations. Notably, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will also observe September 17 as “black day.”AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said there was “resentment” among farmers across the country against the “black farm laws” enacted by the Narendra Modi-led central government. On September 17, 2020, the three “black” agriculture Bills were passed in Parliament, he said, following which the farmers have been protesting against these laws for the last several months. Hence, September 17 will be observed as a “black day', said Sandhwan.SAD workers have planned to take out a protest march in Delhi from Gurdwara Rakabganj to Parliament demanding repeal of the agriculture-related laws. SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema on Thursday said the Delhi police have denied them permission to take out a protest march on Friday.Cheema described it as an “undemocratic step” to stop anyone from holding peaceful protests. However, he said the protest march will surely be taken out.A large number of SAD activists from different parts of Punjab on Thursday went to Delhi to participate in the protest march.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-akali-dal-to-mark-black-day-on-completion-of-one-year-of-farm-laws-101631840421540.html
17-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A park by the hospital||The mere sight of a hospital stirs up our deepest fears. The world around it suddenly seems too carefree, its concerns flimsy.That’s what makes Jasola District Park in south Delhi so extraordinary. It’s the only public garden in the city that exhibits the most panoramic view of a hospital. The entire hulking edifice of the Indraprastha Apollo Hospital spreads out across the length of the park’s northern boundary, beyond an impenetrable bank of trees. This evening, it is looming over like a mountain. For now, the hospital-facing side of the park is empty. It’s all trees and metallic benches — no humans.The park is knitted into a finely trimmed patchwork of hedged gardens, crisscrossed with paved pathways. Each enclosure is peopled with only a few visitors, if at all. One bench hosts a formally dressed man talking agitatedly, and loudly, on his mobile — the word “thekedar” lingers momentarily, before dissolving into the air. Another bench has a pouting couple occupied in clicking a series of selfies. Some women elsewhere are pampering a child by decorating her long hair with freshly plucked flowers. While a guard in blue dress and lathi is sitting morosely by a central roundabout flooded with purple and white flowers.An overland Metro track runs by the park’s west side. After every few minutes a train glides past with a whoosh sound, disrupting the silence. Soon this regular transgression acquires a lilting rhythm of music. Among the park’s other distractions, a visitor is bound to be struck by the scores of symmetrically positioned frangipani trees. The ground under each frangipani is carpeted with white flowers — from a distance they look like fresh snow.Meanwhile, the part of the park that faces the hospital is no longer empty. A man is lounging alone on a bench. The hospital is so near, yet seems so remote. Is anybody inside watching the evening unfold in the park? Alternatively, who among the seemingly healthy visitors at this moment in the park might be fated to soon end up in a hospital — an inevitability for almost all of us. Such gloomy thoughts cloud the mind as night’s darkness gradually settles down in this unique space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-park-by-the-hospital-101631840073560.html

17-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh health secretary seeks explanation from doc, two health workers on surprise visit||UT health secretary Yashpal Garg has sought a written explanation from a doctor and two healthcare workers, who were late in attending to their scheduled duties at the health and wellness centre (HWC), Behlana, where he came for a surprise inspection on Thursday.The health secretary reached the HWC at around 9:20am only to find the centre’s ground floor locked: the centre is supposed to be opened at nine o’clock sharp. It was also found that the vaccine storage room at the centre’s first floor was unlocked with no healthcare worker present at the spot.Though the centre was closed, patients could be seen waiting outside. Soon, an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) worker reached the health centre, but she didn’t have the keys to open it. The centre was finally opened by a sanitary beldar at 9.30am.“The ANM worker then called medical officer Dr Hansraj Rahi and requested him to reach the centre early. The doctor, however, could reach only at 9:52am, almost an hour late from his scheduled duty time. Meanwhile, another ANM worker, Jaswir Kaur, who was initially slated to be on leave, reached the centre and started giving excuses,” Garg said, adding that another sanitary beldar, Karan, reached at 10.04am. He first cited traffic jams as an excuse, but later started making excuses of health issues, added Garg.Garg further said that healthcare officers and officials need to ensure punctuality so that the patients are not made to wait.In a letter to the director, Chandigarh health services; medical superintendent, Government Multi-Speciality Hospital, Sector 16, Dr UG Gill; in-charge IDSP; and additional secretary health, UT; Garg asked the officials to take action against the medical officer and the health workers.“Dr Hasraj Rahi, medical officer; Jaswir Kaur, ANM; and Karan, sanitary beldar; must give a written explanation for being late while the authorities will have to give appropriate comments on action taken against them,” Garg said, adding that during his first night inspection at various government hospitals on September 14, action was not taken against any healthcare worker. but action will be taken against the staff this time.The health secretary was supposed to inspect two more HWCs on Thursday, but due to lapses in the working of HWC Behlana, he decided to postpone the inspections.During the secretary’s first surprise inspection on intervening nights of September 12 and 13, health workers were found missing from their duties, violating Covid guidelines. Some youth were also found consuming liquor on GMCH-32 premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-health-secretary-seeks-explanation-from-doc-two-health-workers-on-surprise-visit-101631837952575.html

17-09-2021||Chandigarh||J&K seeks ₹800-crore support to boost horticulture produce||To increase the quality and production of the horticulture products, especially apples, the J&K government has sought ₹800 crore from the Centre for modified high-density plantation in J&K.J&K’s Lt Governor Manoj Sinha, during a conference on agricultural sector organised by the ministry of agriculture and farmers’ welfare at New Delhi, sought this assistance from the Centre while sharing the J&K’s perspective on the broad approach of the UT government taking agriculture and allied sectors on the path of sustainable and inclusive growth.“Rootstock is being imported from outside the country for developing high-density plantation orchards. A new scheme vis-a-vis ‘Development of High Density Plantation Nurseries’ has been introduced to make J&K ‘Aatmanirbhar’ in the input support in terms of high-density plants,” the L-G said. He said that enhanced focus is being laid to stabilise the fruit market of horticulture produce of J&K and ensure round-the-year sale of the fruits like apple on good prices, besides establishment of storage within J&K.“During the last one year, 40,000 MT of storage has been set up thereby making available a total of 1.65 lakh MT of CA storage facilities in Jammu & Kashmir. Also, another 35,000 MT of storage capacity is under construction,” he added. Recently, the Jammu and Kashmir government gave its nod to setting up high-density plantations on 5,500 hectares in Kashmir.In the past two years, 5,000 kanals (625 acres) of high-density orchards have been developed in the Valley. They are likely to start producing fruit within one or two years.Horticulture is the backbone of J&K economy as it contributes around 8% towards the GDP of the Union Territory besides generating employment avenues for the younger generation. As per the official data, seven lakh farming families comprising 35 lakh people are directly or indirectly associated with the sector.Officials attached with the high-density plantations say even if 25-30% of the existing orchards are replaced with high-density plantations, then the production of fruit can double or triple. Currently, Kashmir produces around 23 to 24 lakh MT of fruit. “We need to go for new techniques to increase our production. We lack behind in production. Once the high-density orchards are established, quality and quantity-wise our apple production can compete in the international market,” said director, horticulture Ajaz Bhat.Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers and Dealers’ Union president Bashir Ahmad said the old orchards need to be replaced with high-density plantation. “Unfortunately, many growers aren’t inclined towards new techniques and high-density plantation. Time will come when such orchards will overtake traditional orchards,” he said, adding that the growers were still relying on old techniques. ‘Groups with int’l connections trying to disturb peace in J&K‘The lieutenant governor of J&K, Manoj Sinha, on Thursday said that various groups having international connections were trying to disturb peace in Jammu and Kashmir. He also said that terrorism is being fought with full might and those supporting it will face strongest action under the law. Addressing a passing out parade of 669 firefighters at Sher-e-Kashmir Police Academy in Udhampur, Sinha said, “The people of J&K want to live in peace and I reiterate my stand that anti-nationals won’t be spared at any cost. There will be no leniency with them”. “To fight terrorism, our jawans from police and other security forces have sacrificed their lives and with utmost responsibility I would like to say that we will jointly fight terrorism with full might and those supporting it will face strongest action,” he added. The LG said that besides combating Pak-sponsored terrorism, Jammu and Kashmir Police have to win over the trust of the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-seeks-800-crore-support-to-boost-horticulture-produce-101631829492081.html

Currently on a three-day visit to the Rajouri and Poonch districts, she also termed the present BJP government “oppressor” and equated the people of the UT with the “oppressed”. Addressing party workers at Mendhar town in Poonch, Mehbooba said, “Earlier, when the situation was bad in J&K, we could see and identify the enemy. He could be a gun-wielding militant or in the form of security forces, who used to harass people.” “But today, we can’t see the face of the enemy…it doesn’t have a face but it is everywhere. If anyone talks about something, police pick him up in the evening... This is the situation in Kashmir...Of fear and suffocation,” she claimed. “They snatched our jobs and land. Thousands of our youths continue to languish in jails across the country and so poor are their parents that they have to seek alms and donations to go and meet them,” she added. She also took a swipe at UP chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over his remarks on people from other states buying plots in J&K. “A CM says that plots will be provided to people in J&K now. Before selling plots to people in J&K, he should provide food and shelter to homeless people in UP,” she said. Recalling PM Modi’s all-party meet in June, she said, “I told the PM that I have come here to tell you that people in J&K feel suffocated. I told him that they are the same people who gave their life fighting Pakistanis in 1947.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/day-will-surely-come-when-articles-370-35-a-would-be-restored-mehbooba-101631829071917.html

17-09-2021||Chandigarh||891 properties found with parts sold outside family, Chandigarh admn informs HC||As many as 891 properties have been found in Chandigarh where a part of a property was sold to someone outside the family, a report submitted by the UT administration before the high court has revealed.At 118, the highest number of such properties was found in Sector 22, followed by 72 in Sector 37, 63 in Sector 20 and 61 in Sector 15. The survey was conducted in August after the Punjab and Haryana high court in July ordered UT to submit a list of residential properties transferred or sold up to December 31, 2019, on a pattern of share(s) to the extent of 50%, 30% or 20% transferred to a person outside the family of the original owner. In July, the administration in its response had maintained that a building plan is approved for the entire building and not floorwise. It had also submitted that fragmentation of a plot was not permitted, although there is no prohibition on occupation of the site by more than one family. It had also said that no sale of defined portion/floor of a building is permissible nor any such sale has been recognised by the administration. Developers acquired parts, sold them off furtherThe latest data submitted in high court reveals that after transfer of a share of a property, in a considerable number of cases, it was further sold off, even to multiple owners. There are also properties where a portion was acquired by developers and sold to multiple persons. The report also indicates that there are cases where sale has taken place floorwise. Furthermore, in a large number of cases, construction was underway. The 891 properties were identified on the basis of screening of Estate Office record, followed by a physical inspection of 281 houses by 10 teams. The sale deeds, excluding transfers within the family, were executed from August 28, 2016 to December 31, 2019. The high court had ordered the survey on a batch of petitions pending since 2016, seeking prohibitory orders on conversion of residential plots into apartments. Residential plots in Chandigarh are meant to be single-dwelling units. However, in the recent years, these are being sold floorwise to multiple owners, which would destroy the city and put additional burden on infrastructure, one of the pleas argues. UT has maintained that it does not allow floorwise sale.HC’s July order was also challenged by a Sector-27 resident in the Supreme Court, arguing that there is no prohibition on multiple individuals, even from distinct families, buying residential units, with a caveat that the construction of the home must be done in a cohesive manner and as a single entity.Acting on it, the apex court had stayed the survey. However, subsequently, the stay was vacated as UT apprised the court of the survey having already been undertaken.On Thursday, sealed cover reports were submitted before the high court. The court ordered that the copies be given to all parties and posted the matter for Monday, asking them to submit their views on the findings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/891-properties-found-with-parts-sold-outside-family-chandigarh-admn-informs-hc-101631825413962.html

The centre had been offering a host of courses, including MBA, MBA (Executive), MTech (CSE), MCA, MCA (lateral entry), MCom, BCA+MCA, BBA, BCom, BSc (Hons) computer science, BSc (Hons) artificial intelligence & data science, and Diploma in Computing.But while the inaugural session in September 2000 had over 600 students, currently only 60 students are enrolled at the centre, despite the varsity pumping in ₹3.2 crore annually. Authorities attribute this to students preferring other government institutes across the tricity.Students to be shifted to other govt collegesWith the Patiala varsity already running the Government College in Phase 6 and Khalsa College in Phase 3, students have been asked to shift there. Meanwhile, 12 of the 18 faculty members have already been transferred. Vice-chancellor Arvind said, “Nearly ₹3.2 crore are spent on the centre every year. It is not financially viable to run it with just 60 students. Their studies will not be affected, as they will be shifted within Mohali only.” On Thursday, when a senior professor of the university came to the campus to take students’ consent, they raised slogans against the authorities. A student, Jaskaran Singh Bhullar, said the faculty was shifted two months back and since then, students had been requesting authorities not to close the centre. “It will be difficult for us to adjust to the new environment in another college,” said Manjit Singh, another student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabi-university-bringing-down-the-curtains-on-regional-centre-in-mohali-101631825412766.html

17-09-2021||Chandigarh||Confidant questioned in 2019 liquor smuggling case, Congress MLA has face-off with SBS Nagar SSP||Congress MLA Angad Singh and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar senior superintendent of police Harmanbir Singh Gill had an altercation on Thursday after the legislator’s close confidant Vikas Soni was brought in for questioning in the 2019 liquor smuggling case. The MLA and his supporters also staged a protest against the SSP in front of the district administration complex in the evening. “Soni was questioned for around 45 minutes and then allowed to leave,” a senior official said. Interestingly, a special investigation team, comprising former SBS Nagar senior superintendent of police Alka Meena, SBS Nagar superintendent of police (SP, investigation) Wazir Singh Khaira and SP (Khanna) Manpreet Singh as its members, had indicted and named Vikas Soni as accused in the same liquor smuggling case on August 19. The SIT in its report had directed the Sadar SHO to arrest Soni and had filed challan against him. A senior official, seeking anonymity, said the district police had taken the accused into custody, but he was let off due to pressure from authorities. SBS Nagar sadar station house officer Satish Kumar, however, denied that Soni was brought to the police station to be arrested. “I have recently joined the police station and questioned Soni as his name had figured in the liquor smuggling case.” On the SIT’s findings, Kumar said that he was not aware of the SIT’s findings and had not received any report. Meanwhile, senior officials refused to comment on the matter. MLA Angad Singh, while addressing his supporters, said that Congress workers were being harassed after Harmanbir Singh joined as SSP. “Soni was falsely implicated in the case. A report was prepared in the back date because Soni helped me take possession of land in Amritsar,” said the MLA, asking why the report was completed just two days before the transfer of former SSP and if Soni was guilty, why no action was taken in the last year. “I will not tolerate any injustice with Congress workers and if the police don’t stop, they will be responsible for any emergent law-and-order situation”, said Singh, adding that the SSP was inclined towards AAP. In 2018, Angad Singh, and his family had a spat with Harmanbir Singh Gill, who is the brother of Khadoor Sahib MP, Jasbir Singh Dimpa and his family over a dispute over the Rohtak District Transport Co-operative Society Limited (RDTCSL) office in Amritsar. What was the case? Two Mohali men, including Balwinder Singh and Maan Singh, were arrested and 800 boxes of illegal liquor were recovered in SBS Nagar on April 5, 2019, ahead of the general elections. Later, the police named Hemant Kumar, Shankar Duggal and Gaurav Chopra, three partners running the shelter where the liquor was unloaded, as accused in the case. Later, Hemant Kumar and Shankar Duggal, who were affiliated with the Akali Dal, asked for a re-investigation into their role. In August 2020, Ludhiana inspector general of police Naunihal Singh formed an SIT headed by then SSP (SBS Nagar) Alka Meena, to probe the case. In the report, the SIT found that Ravinder Singh, Honey Chadha and Gaurav Chopra, all accused in the case in connivance with Vikas Soni, had bought the illegal liquor from Ranjodh Singh. Meanwhile, the SIT found Hemant Kumar and Shankar Duggal, innocent. So far, six people have been arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/confidant-questioned-in-2019-liquor-smuggling-case-congress-mla-has-face-off-with-sbs-nagar-ssp-101631824451260.html

17-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana doctor couple booked for causing death due to negligence||A doctor couple was booked for causing death due to negligence of an elderly man who died during his post-surgery treatment at a private hospital in Ludhiana in April this year. The accused, Dr Ashish Ohri and his wife Dr Shweta Ohri, run Arogya Hospital at Jassiyan Road in the city. A case was also registered against their staff members on the statement of Deepak Kumar of Bank Colony of Haibowal. In the complaint, Kumar said his father Tarlok Chand, 65, was admitted to the hospital after he developed some health complications. The patient was diagnosed with infection in his private parts and underwent a surgery on January 15. Then he was shifted to the recovery room where a hot air blower was kept in the blanket causing burn injuries on his legs, the complainant alleged. The doctors delayed the treatment of burn injuries following which he shifted his father to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, he added. As the infection spread, the doctors amputated the right leg of the 65-year-old, but his condition kept on deteriorating. Then he was shifted to PGIMER Chandigarh where he died on April 20. Before his death his father had recorded his statement to the police on April 13. Sub-inspector Bhajan Singh, who is investigating the case, said the case was registered section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code at the Haibowal police station after getting medical opinion from the civil surgeon’s office. “We will arrest the accused soon,” he said. The civil surgeon’s report says the patient sustained burns at Arogya Hospital due to a hot air blower and healing was delayed due to comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease. The report said the burn injuries at Arogya Hospital could have been avoided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-doctor-couple-booked-for-causing-death-due-to-negligence-101631823490990.html

17-09-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir Badal playing langar politics, Punjab farmers can form own govt in 2022: Charuni||Accusing Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal of playing langar politics, Bhartiya Kisan Union’s Charuni faction chief Gurnam Singh Charuni on Thursday said Punjab farmers comprising nearly 90 lakh votes can form their own government in the 2022 state assembly polls. Addressing the farmers at a rally against the Centre’s three agriculture laws at the Amarkot grain market in Tarn Taran, Charuni said, “The Congress led by Captain Amarinder Singh came to the power in 2017 with 59 lakh votes. The farmers have more votes than the required for forming government. You don’t have to look toward Amarinder or the Badals.” Charuni said he has asked several farmer leaders to lead the Mission Punjab campaign and a10-member team has been formed for this. Launching an attack at Sukhbir Badal, Charuni said, “The SAD leader wants to regain the farmers’ faith by saying that he is providing langar (free food) to the protesters. The langar system has been around for hundreds of years.” “Similarly, Captain Amarinder said we should not protest in Punjab, and do so in Haryana and Delhi. He should know that the agitation is of the entire country. The situation in Uttar Pradesh is similar to Punjab. UP has 8 crore voters from the farming community and the government was formed with 2.5 crore votes,” he added. People of Punjab, Charuni said, can choose their leaders in every constituency for contesting the upcoming polls. “If you form government no one will be able to sell your lands to the corporate houses. Instead you can sell companies to farmers. You will also be able to make a law to waive loans taken by the farmers,” he said. All parties, be it the BJP, Congress, SAD or the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), are working at the behest of the corporate houses, he claimed. Appealing to the farmers to intensify their agitation at the Delhi border, he said, “At least one member of every family should reach the protest site. A conspiracy is being hatched by filing a writ in the Supreme Court to sabotage the agitation.” Issuing a warning to the Centre, he said, “There still is time to agree to the farmers’ demand of repealing the three black laws. In the coming days, we can take a decision of laying siege to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s residence and the venues of his events.” Gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, Punjabi singers Kanwar Grewal and Jass Bajwa also addressed the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-badal-playing-langar-politics-punjab-farmers-can-form-own-govt-in-2022-charuni-101631822892387.html

The next hearing is scheduled for November 15.As per the court order, “It is submitted that objections filed by the petitioners have not been decided till date. Publication of the final electoral roll, if any, shall remain subject to the decision of this writ petition.” This fresh order has come as a setback to many in the region who are aspiring to contest in the elections that were scheduled soon after the tenure of the House ended on February 10 this year.The constitution of the board, along with 55 other boards in the country, was announced to vary by the ministry of defence (MoD) earlier this year.Constituted in 1843, Ambala Cantonment Board comprises 16 members -- eight elected from wards and eight nominated. However, officials had said that after the House dissolved, a three-member committee comprising the president and CEO of the house and one nominated member would govern it till elections are held. But, the nomination of the member by the Union government is still pending, Sahni said.

They have to look after their families also. They were appointed for teaching purposes, not for non-teaching.”He further said that Krishan Kumar, secretary of school education, Punjab, had asked the local education department officials to not let teachers go for data collection of the voters during school hours.With the election commission of India gearing up for the upcoming elections in the state, it has appointed booth-level officers for the poll duties. The booth-level officers posted at various polling stations have been asked to do door-to-door surveys in their respective areas.“DEO Lakhvir Singh Samra has directed the teachers to do their election duty. At the same time, he has asked them to adhere to the directions of the education secretary, according to which they can’t do any poll-related work during school hours. Therefore, teachers will have to work post-school hours, which is not feasible,” said Surinder Kumar Puari, state secretary, Government School Teachers’ Union, Punjab.The union leaders demanded immediate withdrawal of the letter issued to them by the education secretary in this regard.Tahal Singh said that the teachers should not be assigned poll duty as they are busy preparing the students for the National Achievement Survey to be conducted on November 12. Giving them an additional duty will affect students’ education, he added.“If Krishan Kumar is so serious about education, he should contact the election commission of India and get all teachers exempted from poll duty,” he added.Singh added that the teacher unions will meet on Friday to decide the next course of action in case their demands are not fulfilled.Despite repeated attempts, the DEO remained unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-teachers-seek-exemption-from-poll-duty-101631821760772.html

Mishra is also expected to visit the Sidhwan canal waterfront project established in the Sarabha Nagar area and the main Sarabha Nagar market, retrofitted under the Smart City Project. He will also inspect the ongoing works to reduce pollution in Buddha Nullah. Different projects proposed and being executed under the Smart City Mission will also be discussed.

17-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court restrains eviction notices against HMT employees||The Punjab and Haryana high court has restrained the Hindustan Machine Tools Limited (HMT) from evicting employees who are residing in government quarters allotted as per company policies. HC also restrained collection of water and electricity charges and discontinuation of these facilities, as employees had argued that they were not being paid salaries.It was on October 27, 2016, that the central government had decided on closure of HMT’s tractor unit in Pinjore citing continuous losses and insignificant market share. The government had announced a VRS scheme or VSS (voluntary separation scheme) for employees with a budgetary provisions of ₹718.72 crore to clear outstanding salaries, other dues and liabilities towards banks and creditors. As per reports, 1,100 employees of the unit were affected, out of which 350 odd had approached HC in 2016. A government of India public sector enterprise, HMT tractor division was set up at Pinjore in 1971. The company’s performance had started to decline in the 1990s. In their fresh plea, the employees had sought directions from the HC, restraining the authorities from evicting them from the company quarters and from charging licence fee, electricity and water charges over and above the amount as agreed under the quarter allotment letters. They had cited August 2021 notices, asking them to pay up, failing which electricity and water connections would be disconnected. Petitioners are in the category of serving employees, however, they are not being paid their salaries and therefore, are not in a position to pay the charges, the court was told.The bench of justice Girish Agnihotri observed that a very peculiar situation has risen, where the employees are not being paid by the employer. On the other hand, the company is stating that they are also not getting proper funds from the Centre. Respondents are directed to convene a meeting at the central government level and place before the court a viable solution so that such kind of situation does not arise, the court ordered, posting the matter for hearing on November 12 and staying the notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-restrains-eviction-notices-against-hmt-employees-101631821574298.html

It withdrew its permission after the intervention of municipal commissioner MS Tanwar late Thursday evening.Dr Anuj Singh, horticulture department in-charge, GMC, said the association -- Vaishali Kali Bari Samiti -- was not given any permission to hold such an event in the park. “We are not authorised to give such a permission, only the Ghaziabad district administration is. We have just reserved the space for the association,” Singh said after the intervention of municipal commissioner MS Tanwar on Thursday. Earlier, he had maintained that no trees will be felled, but only a few will be relocated for 10 days, during the puja, and the plants will be placed in their original place after that.Residents had opposed the GMC’s initial decision, worrying that trees planted inside the area would be cut or damaged in the process. The residents said that they have planted nearly 5,000 trees in the park over the years, and invested a lot of funds and efforts for the same. They said that GMC officials have allegedly decided to fell nearly 150 trees in the park to facilitate a space for the Durga Puja pandal.“The GMC was supposed to visit the park on Saturday to cut around 150 trees for the preparations of the puja, and we are worried. We urge the GMC not to fell or damage the trees, and we will stop any such activity in the park. It’s unbelievable that the GMC will cut trees to make pandals for the puja,” said Rajneesh Bhatia, a resident of Gateway Towers in Vaishali Sector 4.“We have been asked to clear the area by cutting nearly 70-80 trees on Saturday,” said a GMC official, requesting anonymity.“We have taken a written permission from the GMC to make a 60x40 feet puja pandal inside the park. However, there is absolutely no question of felling trees. The GMC has only granted us a spot in the park,” said Sandeep Ghosh, general secretary, Vaishali Kali Bari Samiti.

The effect was maximum on Thursday, and it is expected to continue till Friday. However, it will eventually wear down by Saturday, converting the moderate rain to light intensity,” IMD director general M Mohapatra said, adding that the city will see rain the next week too.“Another cyclonic circulation is developing over the east central Bay of Bengal, and this may reach the northern coast of Orissa by Sunday (September 18).

17-09-2021||Lucknow||High Court dismisses PIL seeking political asylum for three Afghan nationals||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court (HC) has dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), which sought directives to the Centre to provide political asylum in accordance with international law to three Afghan nationals. The High Court also imposed a cost of ₹10,000 on the petitioner. A division bench of Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Abdul Moin on September 13 dismissed the PIL filed by Suresh Kumar Gupta, a lawyer. In the PIL, Gupta had sought directives to the Centre for political asylum for Qazi Marzia, judge of the Supreme Court of Afghanistan, Saleema Majari, former governor of Kandhar province in Afghanistan and Nilofar Rahmani, fighter pilot of the Afghan Nationalist Army. Gupta filed the PIL, claiming to be next friend of the Afghan nationals, authorising him to file the petition on their behalf. Gupta apprised the High Court that he was their friend (Afghan nationals) on social media. “It is apparent that the petition by a person in the capacity of friend can only be filed in the case of a minor or an insane person or one who is suffering from any other disability which the law recognizes as sufficient to permit another person e.g., next friend, to move the Court on his behalf,” the High Court observed while rejecting Gupta’s petition. “Thus, we are constrained to hold that the instant Public Interest Litigation filed by Suresh Kumar Gupta in the capacity of being friend or next friend of petitioners is clearly not maintainable and deserves to be dismissed on this ground alone,” added the High Court. “Consequently, while dismissing the petition, we also impose a token cost of ₹10,000 on Suresh Kumar Gupta for having wasted the precious judicial time of the Court,” said the High Court. “Let such cost be deposited with the High Court Legal Service Sub- Committee, Lucknow, within 30 days failing which the cost shall be recovered as arrears of land revenue by the District Magistrate, Lucknow,” the High Court added. Advocate Suresh Kumar Gupta appeared in person before the High Court. Senior advocate SB Pandey, assistant solicitor general, government of India, assisted by Anand Dwivedi, represented the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/high-court-dismisses-pil-seeking-political-asylum-for-three-afghan-nationals-101631820970590.html

The process of this year’s election has already started and there are around 40 faculty members of the dental college eligible for PUTA membership. A returning officer has already been appointed for the polls. In 2019, the dental college teachers had boycotted PUTA, citing that the teachers’ body has done nothing for them, especially regarding the issue of their promotion policy, which still remains unresolved. “The faculty now feels that they need to be a part of PUTA and make it accountable for the issues pertaining to the dental institute,” said Ikreet Singh Bal, associate professor at the dental college. Promotion matter still pending The promotion policy issue of the dental faculty has remained one of the most debated issues at PU in the past years. Two years have passed after the dental faculty members had raised the issue and approached the high court, but the matter still hangs in the balance. Last year, PU had submitted its report to the HC in the matter. The recommendations of the panel, which was approved by PU’s syndicate in July last year, stated that the promotion policy framed by the varsity in 2007 will continue for the promotion of dental faculty. However, the report is yet to be approved by the PU senate, the varsity’s governing body. PUTA assures support PUTA has assured its support to the dental faculty as they decide to become part of the varsity’s teachers’ body again. PUTA president Mritunjay Kumar, said, “PUTA is for all teachers and we are glad that our colleagues at the dental institute have realised it.

According to entrepreneurs in the industry, while the prices of essential raw materials like paper and aluminium foil have increased by 70% during the pandemic, carriage charges to foreign countries also increased fivefold. Kulmani Gupta, the president of the Noida chapter of Indian Industries Association (IIA), said that at present, there are over 800 packaging units operational in Gautam Budh Nagar, providing jobs to over 20,000 people. “Packaging is an integral part of many industries, including readymade garments, automotives, home appliances, electrical components, printing, grocery and handicrafts. Most raw materials, such as aluminium foil and different varieties of paper used in this industry, are imported from other countries. After the Covid-19 outbreak, not only have the prices of raw materials gone up by 70%, but overseas exporters have also increased the transportation and carrier charges fivefold since the outbreak of the pandemic (in March 2020). As a result of these issues, orders to these packaging units are suffering a huge loss,” he said. Rajesh Bhatia, an entrepreneur, who runs a corrugated box manufacturing unit in Noida said that after the pandemic, the prices of different craft paper – which ranged between ₹20 to ₹25 per kilogram before the pandemic – have now gone up to ₹40 to ₹45 per kilogram. “These papers include craft, semi-craft and virgin craft papers in different colours. While the price hike has badly affected our production capacity, the value of our orders has also reduced from ₹500 crore per annum to nearly ₹250 crore,” he said. Another entrepreneur, Ashish Malhotra, who runs an aluminium dye cast manufacturing unit in Noida, said that the price hike in aluminium raw material has adversely affected the packaging industry in the district as well. “All the electric products, home appliances and automobile products are packed in different types of aluminium sheets. The aluminium input, which used to cost ₹100 per kilogram, is now being sold at ₹178 per kilogram. The rising prices of diesel and petrol have also multiplied our problems. Not only that, even countries we import material from have increased their carrier charges,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/packaging-industry-faces-tough-time-due-to-rising-prices-of-raw-materials-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101631820490635.html

The sanctuary also features open grasslands and has several water bodies that serve as watering holes for the animals and birds that inhabit the area.Divisional forest officer, wildlife, Pathankot range, Rajesh Mahajan: “The sanctuary had tourism potential, but we did not allow public to enter. Then Pathankot deputy commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal, who is taking initiative to promote tourism in the district, granted ₹1.2 crore from District Mineral Foundation (DMF) for its development as tourist destination. The development has been executed under the supervision of principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Rama Kant Mishra.” “The sanctuary has three zones—eco-sensitive, buffer and core zone. We can only allow people to visit first two zones as per the guidelines as the core zone is a safe home for animals. In the zones thrown open for public, we have provided facilities such as drinking water, washrooms, passage, rain shelters to the visitors and introduced tourist attractions,” he said. The 5km-long nature trail passing through dense jungle is an attraction for nature lovers. An 11-seater pollution-free and soundless vehicle, also called as golf cart, and 10 cycles have been provided to the visitors to visit the sanctuary as private vehicle is not allowed.There is an island in the middle of a lake that has fish and ducks and bamboo huts are an added attraction.

There are 30-ft tall two watch towers from where the tourists can have a view of the forest and the Ravi. Two activity points have been developed for children.Mahajan added that nominal entry fee will be charged from visitors and the money collected from them will be spent on the operation of the facilities provided at the sanctuary and maintenance through outsourcing under the supervision of local public committee.The sanctuary falls in the Bhoa constituency of Pathankot. Local MLA Joginder Pal said: “I make an appeal to the tourists to cooperate with the forest and wildlife department while visiting the sanctuary. They should not bring plastic and make any noise on seeing animals.” The sanctuary is home to several species of deer, including cheetal, sambar, hog deer and barking deer.

If I book a car, it will cost me ₹6,000 apart from food expenses. If the government cannot allocate exam centres in the neighbour districts, it should at least run buses for students,” she said.“Most of the buses will be overcrowded on September 18 and it will be difficult for us to write the paper after covering such a long distance,” she added.Another aspirant Kavita Sheoran, of Charkhi Dadri, said she will have to travel for at least five to six hours to sit in her constable exam on September 19 in Ambala.“Instead of providing facilities to girls appearing in the constable exam, the HSSC has allocated far away exam centres. Is the government unaware of the problems aspirants and their parents will face in reaching far away exam centres. How will I report at the examination centre at 9.30am on September 19. This exam will cost me ₹3,000 if I reach Ambala a day ahead of the exam otherwise I cannot report on time,” she added.The Haryana government has faced criticism from all quarters after the Haryana male constable written exam paper got leaked last month, forcing the HSSC to cancel the exam.Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader and Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala had announced in a rally in Rohtak in the run up to the 2019 assembly polls that the exam centres will be allocated to students in state within a radius of 50-60km from their native place, if his party is voted to power.“The government can curb cheating by allocating centres to students in their home districts and appointing exam invigilators from other districts. Why should students bear the brunt? If we will come to power, I promise all youth that the exam centres will be allocated in their home districts,” Chautala had said in the Rohtak rally while announcing his party manifesto.INLD general secretary Abhay Chautala and Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry of the Congress slammed the government for allocating far away exam centres to women constable aspirants.“The JJP made hollow promises during the 2019 assembly polls that the exam centres will be allocated in nearby areas. The government talks about empowering girls ad on the other hand, it forces girls to travel 300km to write the exam. Instead of taking strict action against the paper leak mafia, the government has allocated far away exam centres,” Kiran added.HSSC chairman Bhopal Singh said they have randomly picked the roll numbers and allocated exam centres.“This was done to stop cheating. We have not allocated the exam centres to aspirants in nearby areas. The board has also changed the duties of many officials to ensure free and fair exams,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hssc-women-constable-recruitments-aspirants-complain-of-being-allotted-far-off-exam-centres-101631819894488.html

The commission has sought a detailed report from the food and civil supplies department on the missing wheat within a fortnight. It had come to the notice of the commission that Jasdev Singh, inspector, food and supplies department, the main accused in the missing wheat case, siphoned off crores of rupees given as minimum support prices (MSP) on wheat that was neither brought to mandis nor purchased, PSFC chairman DP Reddy said in a statement. Fake entries for the purchase of 87,100 quintals of wheat valued at ₹20 crores were made and it was shown to have been transported to godowns in Jandiala Guru. He further said that the accused inspector who is believed to have escaped to Dubai, was allegedly in cahoots with Amritsar-based trader Ravinder Singh Bunty, who was arrested by the CBI recently. The commission, while taking a senior note of the matter, has issued advice to the food and supplies department to put systems in place (administrative and technological) to prevent recurrence of such scams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-scam-punjab-food-commission-seeks-report-asks-dept-to-take-action-101631819770313.html

17-09-2021||Mumbai||Maratha group keen on alliance with BJP||Purshottam Khedekar, the chief of Sambhaji Brigade, said the Maratha outfit wants to have an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the future elections in the state. The statement is significant as the link between hardline Maratha group Sambhaji Brigade and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is well-known in the political circles. Khedekar, in a magazine Maratha Marg, wrote that the BJP was the “best option for alliance” at the moment. Sambhaji Brigade, which is the branch of the Maratha Seva Sangh, has a considerable backing of the Maratha youth in Maharashtra. The alliance between the two could hurt the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in polls, as the BJP and Sambhaji Brigade could channelise Maratha community’s anger towards the MVA government. The reservation for the Maratha community was scrapped by the Supreme Court earlier this year. Khedekar said that Sambhaji Brigade, barring some panchayat elections, hasn’t got any success. “At the moment, we can’t go solo and succeed at the state or Lok Sabha level. Besides, the Shiv Sena has allied with the Congress and NCP, so the three parties are unlikely to give us anything in seat-sharing. The NCP and Congress have held discussions [with us] in the past 25 years, but they have not given anything substantial in seats. “Looking at the political situation now, the BJP is the party which needs smaller parties, while we also need their support. So Sambhaji Brigade has adopted the idea to align with BJP, and if they are open to the idea, we can hold talks with them. So far, we have not held any discussions with anybody in the BJP,” he said. The BJP reacted cautiously. State BJP unit chief Chandrakant Patil said that if such a proposal comes, it will be discussed in the party’s nine-member core committee. “They have expressed their wish and we will evaluate it once any concrete proposal comes before the party. We have to look at all aspects, its impact and repercussions. We are a national party, we have 12 CMs in states, so we cannot make decision in a haste,” said Patil. The pro-Maratha outfit does not see eye-to-eye with the BJP’s ideological fountainhead, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Sambhaji Brigade has been vocal against “Brahminical dominance”. Its activists had forced the Pune civic body to remove the statue of Dadoji Konddev who was a teacher of King Shivaji, saying that Brahmin historians had distorted history. The Sambhaji Brigade was also in controversy when it ransacked Pune-based Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) following a controversial book written by American author James Laine, Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India. Khedekar’s wife Rekha was a three-term BJP MLA from Buldhana district. She quit the BJP to join the NCP in 2013, contested the 2014 state poll the Sindhkhed-Raja in the district, but lost the election. Khedekar defended the move to join hands with the BJP, saying there are no permanent friends of enemies in politics. He said, “There are ample of examples before us where leaders have criticised one party and later joined the same party where they became a minister. The BJP and Sambhaji Brigade are not politically untouchable for each other.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-group-keen-on-alliance-with-bjp-101631819532449.html

Until now, the civic body has been struggling to handle the inert waste (non-reactive soil like material) which was building up during the process of bio-mining. Spread over 46 acres, the Okhla landfill receives about 50% of the approximately 3,600 metric tonnes of waste generated daily within the SDMC area.According to officials, at least 60% to 70% of the waste processed during bio-mining is inert, which can be used for levelling low-lying areas or as base filling in the construction of roads. “We have empanelled 13 private agencies to take away the inert waste from the landfill. This will help us in freeing up space at the landfill, which is required for moving machines for intensifying bio-mining. We plan to install more trommel machines to intensify the activity,” said a senior official, who asked not to be named. He also said the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has again tested the inert material and has agreed to use it in its various projects, including the Dwarka Urban Extension Road. Earlier, the NHAI after testing the material had refused to use it saying it wasn’t fit for base filling. The south civic body has also got its inert waste tested by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), which has approved its use in road construction. The SDMC has set December 2023 as the deadline for processing all legacy waste and closing the landfill.Since October 2019, when the process of bio-mining started at the Okhla landfill, the civic body has so far transported 6.30 lakh metric tonnes of inert waste to different sites such as NTPC Eco Park and Tajpur Pahadi (which has deep pits to be filled) as well as used some of it to pave a way within the landfill for moving machines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-south-civic-body-empanels-13-agencies-to-lift-inert-waste-from-okhla-landfill-101631819170225.html

Police said 46 traders applied for temporary licence to sell crackers till September 16, which was the last date for the application. However, after the Delhi government announced a complete ban on the sale, storage and use of crackers, including the less polluting ‘green’ variants, on Wednesday, these applications stand cancelled, officials said. Police records show that till September 16, the northwest district received five applications, southwest got four, and southeast district got six applications for cracker licences. North district, which includes Sadar Bazar—one of the largest wholesale cracker markets in the city—received 17 applications, and the east district received 12 such requests. Two applications were received by the outer district, senior officials confirmed. In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced his government’s decision to implement a complete ban on crackers in Delhi, to control the rising pollution levels that are seen around Diwali every year. Kejriwal said that the decision was taken to save the lives of Delhi residents and the early announcement was made to prevent traders from incurring losses. This is the fourth consecutive year when Delhi is imposing a blanket ban on the sale and use of crackers in the city. Despite a ban on crackers last year as well, Delhi’s pollution levels remained high on Diwali day (November 14) and continued to remain in the poor zone in the subsequent week. In a special report to assess the rise in pollution on Diwali, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said almost all pollutants reported higher values on Diwali in 2020 as compared to 2019. The Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) stood at 481 in Anand Vihar, 444 in IGI airport area, 457 at ITO, and 414 in Lodhi Road area -- all in the ‘severe’ category, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) data. The police said they will keep a close watch on traders so that no illegal sale of crackers happens in the national capital. Violators will be booked under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which pertains to “disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant”. “We will also be organising meetings and awareness programmes with resident welfare associations and market to make sure crackers are not burst in Delhi. We are also sensitising our beat staff to be on their toes to check any illegal storage and sale,” said Usha Rangnani, deputy commissioner of police (northwest). DPCC officials also said that their teams will also be vigilant to check any violation of the ban. “The only part that we are concerned about is that because of porous borders in Delhi, people often get crackers from neighbouring states where there is no such ban. Our main challenge will be to coordinate with the police to ensure that the ban is followed,” a senior DPCC official said.The traders, however, are not happy with another year of no sales. “The government has completely finished cracker business in Delhi. They are talking as if one day’s cracker bursting is the only thing that is responsible for Delhi’s pollution problem. What about vehicular emissions and dust pollution that you see every day? Why is the government not acting on that first?” said Narendra Gupta, fireworks and general traders association, Sadar Bazar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-anti-pollution-body-to-enforce-delhi-s-cracker-ban-101631818990248.html

The royal family of Kashi, the organiser of the Ramlila, decided to not hold the over 200- year-old event keeping in mind the fallout of the pandemic. Kunwar Anant Narayan Singh of the royal family of Kashi informed commissioner of police, Varanasi, A Satish Ganesh about the decision of the family through a letter.The letter addressed to the commissioner reads, “This is to inform you that keeping in mind the present scenario (Covid-19 pandemic), like last year this year too, it has been decided to postpone (cancel) the famous Ramnagar’s Ramlila so that the people of Kashi are protected from the viral infection by fulfilling the Covid-19 guidelines.”A senior police officer said a letter was received on Wednesday about the decision of the royal family to postpone the Ramlila this year. Though the event was not staged last year too, Chaupais (couplets) of Ramcharitmanas were recited from Anant Chaturdashi for the next one month.Vijay Yadav Ballu, who likes watching Ramlila, said, “I am disappointed over the cancellation of the historical Ramlila. I hope that Covid-19 ends and next year the famous Ramlila is staged in a grand manner.”Traditionally, the Ramlila begins on Anant Chaturdashi in Ramnagar every year and continues for 31 days. It is held under the open sky every evening till midnight. Lanterns are lit up for the people to enjoy the festivities. This year, Anant Chaturdashi is falling on September 19.The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has also recognised the event as an intangible world cultural heritage. The Ramlila is staged in the backdrop of the Ramnagar fort under the autumn sky. Traditional lamps are the only source of light, which lends an ethereal feeling to the natural surroundings.Each year, children are selected and training is imparted to hone their dramatic skills so that they can play protagonist Lord Rama and other central characters such as Goddess Sita, Laxman, Bharat and Shatrughan. In the last 238 years, this is the second occasion when the Ramlila of Ramnagar has been cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-shadow-kashi-s-famous-ramlila-not-to-be-held-for-second-year-in-row-101631818762947.html
17-09-2021||Mumbai||‘Stock in blood banks in Maharashtra to last for a week’||A fall in blood collections due to Covid-19 pandemic has seen blood banks in Maharashtra being left with stock for just a week, down from the buffer of 15-20 days that was maintained earlier.Officials from the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) have attributed this to a decline in blood donation camps and lower footfalls of donors due to the pandemic and closure of offices and educational institutions, which affected donations by the youth.A decrease in blood donations had late last week seen the Tata Memorial Centre (TMC) issuing a public appeal seeking donors.“The blood banks have stocks of around 25,500 units of blood, which can last for a week. Normally, blood banks maintain stocks for up to 20 days, but these have dwindled to just a week. We have appealed to social and religious organisations to hold blood donation camps while adhering to the government’s pandemic protocols,” said SBTC assistant director Dr Arun Thorat, adding that the blood collection graph had been fluctuating since the onset of Covid-19.According to Dr Thorat, while blood donation camps had taken place, the collections did not touch the pre-pandemic levels amid fears of contracting Covid-19 as well as vaccination of donors and restriction on gatherings. While donation camps saw between 100 and 150 bags of blood collected earlier, the numbers have dwindled to around 40-50 now.The state sees around 3,000 to 4,000 bags of blood being used daily, with the usage varying across districts and hospitals.The work-from-home policies adopted across companies and the shutting down of educational institutions during the pandemic have led to a fall in blood collection among those in the 18-44 age group, which accounts for a majority of donors. Blood has a shelf life of around 35 days and hence, cannot be stored for long.Maharashtra has 350 registered and licensed blood banks, of which 76 are run by the state government and municipal corporations, 13 by private bodies, 12 by the Red Cross and the rest by trusts.As per the National AIDS Control Organisation’s (NACO) guidelines, blood collection should be equivalent to 1% of the population. However Maharashtra, which has an estimated population of 125 million, saw around 1,546,000 units of blood being collected last year, compared to 1,723,000 units in 2019. Over 99% of these collections are from voluntary donors. The state tops the country in blood donation.One bag of blood can be separated into different components such as packed red blood cells (PRBC), platelet concentrates, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate.SBTC was set up as an autonomous body in 1966 by the state government to ensure safe and affordable supply of blood. The state also grants free blood to registered thalassemia, haemophilia and sickle cell anaemia patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stock-in-blood-banks-in-maharashtra-to-last-for-a-week-101631818750175.html
17-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi residents can now get DOB, names on their driving licences changed online||In a first for Delhi, citizens will be able to get their date of birth or name corrected on their driving licence (DL) without having to visit a regional transport office (RTO). Until now, details once printed on a licence used to be considered final with no provision to change it. The state transport department has issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) listing the documents required to carry out corrections. “We used to have a lot of requests for name correction, especially from women driving licence owners who want to change their names after marriage. As of now, there was no provision for correcting such details on licences in Delhi,” said a senior transport official. “Our software will go live from next week and people will be able to submit all the required documents online. No visit to the RTO will be required. The corrected licence will be sent by courier,” the official said. As per the SOPs issued on Wednesday, an applicant is needed to submit their Aadhaar card, Class 10 or 12 certificate, copy of passport, and birth certificate to get their date of birth changed in the licence . For name correction, one will have to submit the Aadhaar card, copy of a passport, gazette notification , and copy of an advertisement in a Delhi edition newspaper declaring the change of name. For correction in the name, the applicant will also have to file an affidavit attested by a first class judicial magistrate or a notary public. Women who want to get their names changed in their licences after marriage, or death of their spouse, will additionally have to submit a marriage certificate or divorce or death certificate of their partner. Nearly 300,000 licences are issued in Delhi every year. During the pandemic since March, approximately 150,000 permanent driving licences and about 350,000 learners’ licences were issued, according to transport department data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-residents-can-now-get-birth-date-names-on-their-driving-licences-changed-online-101631818693306.html
17-09-2021||Noida||IPC cases decline, cybercrime cases rise in Ghaziabad: NCRB report||Cases registered in Ghaziabad district under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) declined last year but the cybercrime cases doubled than what it was in 2019, showed the “Crime in India” 2020 report--the annual comprehensive report on different crimes released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Tuesday. The report includes comprehensive statistics on different crimes in 19 cities, including Ghaziabad, having more than two million population. The report indicates that 7,328 cases were registered in Ghaziabad under different sections of the IPC last year compared to 9,159 cases in 2019 and 11,765 cases in 2018. The rate of chargesheets filed by the police in 2020 was 54.6%, lower than the total average of 55.6% for the 19 metropolitan cities. On the contrary, the cybercrime cases went up from 191 in 2018, 347 in 2019 to 756 in 2020, a year that was marked by a strict lockdown that was imposed for almost two months in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak and movement of people was highly restricted.The rate of charge sheeting in cybercrime cases was 5.6% for Ghaziabad in 2020, the lowest among the 19 metropolitan cities having an overall charge sheeting rate of 45%. Officials of the Ghaziabad cyber cell said they come across cases where suspects operate from other states or cities, and this delays the investigation and the subsequent filing of chargesheets. “The cybercrime figures will increase as more and more people have started using technology and have access to computers, internet and smartphones. A majority of cases, which emerge nowadays, are the ones where victims disclose their personal information like bank details, ID numbers, etc., and get duped. This happens despite conducting many awareness activities. It is advisable that people not share any personal details to anyone over phone or open any unknown online links shared with them,” said Abhay Kumar Mishra, circle officer of Indirapuram and nodal officer for the cyber cell. With regard to crimes against women, the district saw 341 cases last year compared to 793 in 2019 and 1,128 in 2018. The rate of charge sheeting suspects in crimes perpetrated on women was about 73.4%--lower than the total average of 78.2% for the 19 metropolitan cities. “We are yet to analyse the charge sheeting data and will get it analysed on cases to case basis. The process will be expedited. The NCRB data is of 2020, and chances are that the filing of chargesheets may have increased thereafter,” said Pawan Kumar, senior superintendent of police (SSP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ipc-cases-decline-cybercrime-cases-rise-in-ghaziabad-ncrb-report-101631818510541.html
17-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai housing societies unable to hold annual general meeting without audit report||Cooperative housing societies across Maharashtra are in a fix as their annual general meeting (AGM) for the year 2020-21 – slated to take place by September-end – cannot be held owing lack of audit report.The auditors who are supposed to submit the audit report to the housing societies by August 31 every year have not been able to do so due to the Covid-imposed lockdown.The Mumbai Division Certified Auditors’ Association, which consists of 1,200 auditors, pointed that more than 60% of the societies in Maharashtra are not ready with the audit report. “It was impossible for us to complete the audit. The government allowed just 50% of our staff to work and it was not possible to complete the work with such a skeletal workforce. In addition, trains were closed for us and hence, our staff could hardly cover many buildings by road,” said Rahul Patil, president of the association.He further said that in many cases, due to Covid-19 restrictions, the housing societies were not ready with the accounts in the first place.Audit reports are prepared after auditors study the balance sheet and the working of a housing society. They point out to the discrepancies in accounts and also put remarks on the management of the society. This report is supposed to be passed by the general body in the AGM.The Maharashtra Societies’ Welfare Association (MSWA), an association of flat owners, has petitioned the state government to extend the deadline for AGMs. “Auditors should be allowed to present the audit report by November-end, while the AGM date should be extended to December 31,” said MSWA chairman Ramesh Prabhu.Dhaval Shah, chairman, Lokhandwala-Oshiwara Citizens’ Association, consisting over 150 societies, said that as a majority of buildings do not have audit reports, there was no point in conducting an AGM. “These are extraordinary circumstances and we cannot blame anyone. The best step is to postpone the date for the AGM,” said Shah.State cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil has acknowledged the problem but blamed auditors for this impasse. “The auditors should have ensured the timely filing of the audit report as there was enough flexibility given during the second lockdown as compared to the first. The society members are not at fault and hence, [we] are working on this issue positively to solve this tangle,” said Patil.There are approximately 150,000 housing societies in Maharashtra, of which 60,000 are in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-housing-societies-unable-to-hold-annual-general-meeting-without-audit-report-101631818451153.html

17-09-2021||Delhi||Lenovo Smarter Ed Conclave: Covid showed tech crucial to learning, says Pradhan||Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday said students, teachers and the entire Indian education system demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and the main takeaway from the pandemic was that technology will play a crucial role in how we acquire knowledge in the future.He was speaking at a two-day education conclave, which started on Thursday to discuss the road map for the future of learning with technology and the new order of education. Presented by Hindustan Times, the Lenovo Smarter Ed Conclave focuses on the New Education Policy (NEP), the digital divide brought to the fore by online learning during the pandemic, developments in technology in education, upskilling teachers, and encouraging interactions with decision-makers across schools and institutions of higher education. Those interested in attending the virtual conference can visit https://lenovosmarteredconclave.virtualeventexp.com/ or scan the QR code below. In his keynote address, Pradhan said, “This is the most opportune moment for us to be discussing this topic when India is successfully emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic wave. The unprecedented advent of the pandemic adversely and significantly affected our lives. No sector remained indifferent to its impact including the education sector. However, our students and teachers and the entire Indian education system demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of the pandemic.” Pradhan spoke on how one of the largest education systems in the world moved online from offline learning. “It is also during the pandemic that India came up with the first education policy of the 21st century – the National Education Policy, 2020…Basing itself on the pillars of accessibility, affordability, equity, and quality, NEP 2020 aims to overhaul our education landscape for the greater good of our children. With a set of far-reaching recommendations, the policy has given us the road map for the future… one lesson from the pandemic is that technology will play a crucial role in how we acquire knowledge,” he said. Focussing on technological innovations and solutions leading to progression and tech penetration, the conclave also discussed concerns on digital inequality and the new forms of exclusion that may arise. At least 80% of students aged between 14 and 18 years reported lower levels of learning at home during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to when they attended classes in schools, a survey conducted by the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) across six states revealed. The survey report released on Thursday also warned that approximately 8% of children are not likely to return to schools in the future. “While we emphasise on the significance of technology in the future of education, a hybrid education model wherein technology will supplement classroom teaching is vital. Indeed, technology will be used to facilitate a better teaching-learning process and make it more accessible. However, this will not devalue the importance of in-person learning,” the education minister said. “There is a strong argument that education will never go back to the pre-pandemic times and technology is going to be as important as physical campuses. The focus on large physical spaces will shrink and a hybrid model of education involving a combination of classroom teaching and online lessons will find greater acceptance,” the organisers said in a statement. The managing director of Lenovo India, Shailendra Katyal, also shared insights on how technology can help bridge the digital divide, and Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the Union minister of state for skill development, spoke about the importance of skill education and how it can be built up in the coming years. “The world in the past few decades has become much more complex and challenging to navigate. Education systems across world had to evolve to cope with the new challenges. When we talk of digital divide, it comes in the context of the new way of learning which is student centric, as per experts and educators. The new way of learning is personalised. It is not one-size-fits-all and is about creating problem solvers. And technology has to play a very critical role in asynchronous learning as every student will learn at his/her own pace,” Katyal said. He also explained that there is no other way but to adopt this new way of learning. “In India, the question of digital divide is particularly important.. We have around 30 crore students, which is the largest student pool in the world, but only 15-20% of them have access to a (communication) device or internet to learn at their own pace,” he said, adding that one has to address the question of whether India has the digital infrastructure to support the large pool of learners. The two-day conclave will touch upon the three key areas of the education sector – technological advancements in education, digital inequality, and reskilling or upskilling of the educator workforce. The conclave will also see an in-depth discussion on government policies focusing on upgrading the education sector with innovative tools and ideas. Experts will discuss the approach towards smarter education in India and the role of analytical, data driven technology in understanding young minds and providing them with a holistic curriculum.Policymakers and experts will discuss the lack of infrastructure in rural India, address the gender bias in households, digital readiness of government educational institutes, and role of communities in bridging these gaps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lenovo-smarter-ed-conclave-pandemic-taught-us-that-technology-will-play-crucial-role-in-how-we-learn-says-union-min-dharmendra-pradhan-101631818390159.html
17-09-2021||Delhi||Empowered regional bodies vital for development of mass transit modes: Experts||More power, financial support and representation to regional bodies such as Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) is needed for effective development around mass transit modes such as the Metro, experts said at a discussion organised by the World Resources Institute (WRI) India on Thursday. During the session, ‘Metro in India’, which was part of Connect Karo, an annual flagship event that highlights ways of designing inclusive, sustainable and climate forward Indian cities, experts highlighted the role of the Delhi Metro in shaping India’s journey towards developing efficient mass transit modes. Experts said the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) made a commendable expansion and shortened the distance between Delhi and its neighbouring satellite towns such as Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad. In a presentation, the WRI India said that the developmental map of Delhi Metro shows how development in the city started coming up around Metro corridors and made it easier for the workforce from NCR towns to commute to the Capital. Highlighting a similar model of mass-transit development, Mukut Sharma, senior transit oriented development expert, National Capital Region Transport Corporation, said, “We have been working with UP government, and Ghaziabad/Meerut development authorities. An advantage we have is that masterplans for Delhi, Ghaziabad, Meerut, and NCR Regional Plan are all under preparation concurrently, and that gives us opportunities for synchronisation.” He added, “We are working with Meerut development authority to properly address TOD zones, and they are incorporating the areas into their GIS-based masterplans. Thereafter, the intent is to dovetail these with regional plans and NCR transport plans.” Experts said that to make these mass-transit developments more efficient, there is a need for an authority or common forum with teeth, finance and representation with all constituent authorities, regional authorities, and infra-agencies with a regional footprint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/empowered-regional-bodies-vital-for-effective-development-of-mass-transit-modes-experts-at-wri-india-connect-karo-101631818331332.html
17-09-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh’s plea to quash probe by Maharashtra govt dismissed by HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday dismissed the petition filed by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh seeking the quashing of the two preliminary inquiries initiated against him by the Maharashtra government.HC held that the petition was “not maintainable” and directed Singh to approach the appropriate forum, which is the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT).On July 28, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar had reserved its order in the petitions filed by Singh, requesting that the preliminary inquiry initiated against him by the home department pertaining to violation of service rules in light of the Antilia explosives scare case and on allegations of corruption levelled against him by an inspector, Anup Dange. In his petition, Singh had claimed that the two inquiries were initiated against him as he had accused former state home minister Anil Deshmukh of directing dismissed police officer Sachin Vaze – now arrested in the Antilia and Mansukh Hiran murder cases – to collect money worth ₹100 crore. Singh had stated that the home department resorted to a witch hunt after he refused to withdraw the letter that he had written to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, alleging Deshmukh of corruption. Singh had further alleged in his petition that there was an attempt by the state government to hinder the HC-ordered Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the allegations against Deshmukh. Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, who appeared for Singh, had argued that the inquiries were initiated hastily with vendetta and there was an attempt to punish the former police chief, who had blown the whistle on Deshmukh. “It is obvious from the circumstances that it was issued out of confusion and vendetta. Singh complained against Deshmukh and instead of inquiring into it, the state punished the whistleblower... They are trying to shoot the messenger,” Jethmalani said, adding that the inquiries were arbitrary and against the law. Jethmalani also submitted that after Singh refused to abide by director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey’s suggestion to withdraw his letter to CM, corruption and other cases were registered against him by the state government. However, senior advocate Darius Khambata for the state had questioned the maintainability of the petition as the inquiries came under the purview of the All India Service Rules and as CAT dealt with such issues, Singh’s petition could not be entertained. While responding to Singh’s allegation of vendetta by the state, Khambata had submitted that the complaint by Dange was lodged in February, even before Singh’s letter to CM on March 20. Senior counsel Navroz Seervai, representing DGP Pandey, had adopted the arguments of the state and said that allegations made by Singh against his client were “frivolous and false” and hence, the petition was not maintainable. After hearing the arguments, Justice Jamadar, who had authored the ruling for the bench, noted that particular grievances made by Singh can only be termed as “barnacles attached to the hull of controversy”.HC said that the challenge of entrusting the inquiries to officers, allegedly junior in rank to Singh, can be raised before the CAT.It also observed that Singh’s claim that the state action was initiated as “counter-blast” to the outcome of his petitions in HC against Deshmukh “prima facie does not hold ground” as Dange had written to the state home department with his allegations in February, much before Singh’s wrote to the CM on March 20 regarding Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-s-plea-to-quash-probe-by-maharashtra-govt-dismissed-by-hc-101631818330118.html
17-09-2021||Mumbai||Money laundering case against Anil Deshmukh: ED names Sachin Vaze as accused||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has named dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze as an accused in the money laundering case against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh.Vaze has been arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases. In its charge sheet against Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and assistant Kundan Shinde, the agency has also named Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha – a Nagpur-based charitable trust run by Deshmukh and his family members – as an accused. Palande and Shinde were arrested by ED in June. Deshmukh or his family members have not been directly named as an accused in ED’s charge sheet. However, it is said that the agency requires more time to investigate the roles of other persons, including Deshmukh’s family members, and it has requested the court to permit supplementary charge sheets in the matter. ED has also named Delhi-based Surendra Kumar Jain and Virendra Jain who helped allegedly the Deshmukhs launder money to Shri Sai Shikhshan Sanstha, as well as shell companies Reliable Finance Corporation Private Limited, Utsav Securities Private Limited, VA Realcon Private Limited and Sital Leasing and Finance Private Limited. A man named Kishore Dewani, who also allegedly helped Deshmukh launder money, has been named an accused in the case. ED has also named Premiur Port Private Link Company, a firm said to be jointly owned by the Deshmukhs and Dewanis. Aparrt from these names, the agency has also added the names of chartered accountants Vinod Hassani and Vishal Khetwani to the charge sheet. The agency claimed that its investigation began after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had directed Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month from establishments in Mumbai. Singh approached the Bombay high court (HC) and filed a petition in the matter. Based on HC’s order, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered an offence in the matter, after which ED started its investigation. ED said that it has found in its investigations that Vaze, who was earlier dismissed from the force, was reinstated with Deshmukh’s help. Deshmukh had even demanded ₹2 crore from Vaze to convince other political leaders to reinstate Vaze, ED has alleged. Though Vaze then did not pay Deshmukh following his reinstatement, the former home minister allegedly asked the cop to pay in him in instalments. The agency said Vaze and Deshmukh were working as a team to get gratification through extortion and illegal activities. On Deshmukh’s instructions, Vaze had called a meeting of 1,750 bar owners and demanded ₹3 lakh each from them. The agency has stated in its charge sheet that Vaze used to visit Deshmukh’s official residence Dnyaneshwari regularly. Vaze had collected ₹4.7 crore from various bar owners between December 2020 and February 2021, at Deshmukh’s behest, said ED. According to the agency, Vaze gave the extorted money to Shinde and subsequently, a part of the amount was routed to the charitable trust in Nagpur through various shell companies. Palande was instrumental in passing on Deshmukh’s instructions to police officers and collecting tainted money, ED has alleged. He also helped Deshmukh launder money, the agency claimed in the charge sheet. The agency stated that Deshmukh in conspiracy with his son Hrishikesh had transferred the illegally-obtained money to Delhi-based bogus companies of the Jain brothers through the hawala route. The Jains layered the money and infused it into banking channels to transfer it to the charitable trust. A total of ₹4.18 crore had been transferred to Shri Sai Shikhshan Sanstha in the name of donation through various shell companies, said ED. The agency has said in its charge sheet that the Deshmukhs had created a complex web of companies and used unaccounted money for further expansion and managing day-to-day affairs of their business. The Deshmukh family allegedly owned around 13 companies directly and around 14 companies indirectly. They have been purportedly using the unaccounted money to purchase properties, and one such property was the flat in Sukhada Apartment on Sir Pochkhanwala Road in Worli, purchased in the name of Deshmukh’s wife Arti for a concessional price of ₹84 lakh. The agency said most of the payment for the flat was done in cash with “ulterior motives” and was one of the benami properties owned by the Deshmukh family. ED has claimed that the Deshmukhs run various companies through their associates. Deshmukh’s another son Salil, became the owner of various companies by purchasing them at very lower prices, and later becoming owners of huge properties and shares, said ED. Hrishikesh was allegedly running various businesses through a person named Vikram Sharma. ED said Sharma accepted that he was merely a signatory in the companies and the businesses were actually controlled by Hrishikesh. The agency claimed that one of Hrishikesh’s business associates even accepted before the agency that his company owned four vehicles, Hrishikesh used a Mercedes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/money-laundering-case-against-anil-deshmukh-ed-names-sachin-vaze-as-accused-101631818272682.html

17-09-2021||Mumbai||No change in reservation for local body bypolls: Maharashtra SEC||Even as the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has decided to promulgate an ordinance to provide reservation to Other Backward Classes (OBC) in local bodies without breaching the 50% cap mandated by the Supreme Court, it is unlikely to be applicable for the bypolls declared by the state election commission (SEC) in six zilla parishads on October 5. State election commissioner UPS Madan on Thursday said they are holding elections following the directives of the Apex court and that too under open category. He added that any change in the category can be made only by the Apex court only. It means the trouble over OBC reservation of the MVA government is far from over and they will have to approach the Apex court in this regard.“Any change in the bypolls has to be done at the directions of the Supreme Court because it has directed us to hold the bypolls based on open category candidates. If there is any change for whatever reason, the direction has to come from the SC. We are following their directives and cannot change it on our own,” Madan told HT, hinting that the state government needs to approach the SC if it wants reservation to be implemented.He also clarified that for the local body elections due early next year, they will have to take a legal opinion to ascertain if the ordinance applies to them or not. “We have to check its legal validity. The ordinance is yet to be issued. Once we get it, we will take a legal view, but as far as the bypolls are concerned, the situation is very clear,” he said.More than 15 municipal corporations, including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane; 29 of the 36 district councils; and over 90 municipal councils will go for polls over the next one year. The election bandwagon to these local bodies in such a huge number is considered as the “mini assembly polls”.On Wednesday, the state government decided to promulgate an ordinance to make amendment in the legislations to provide reservation to the OBC community in local bodies without breaching the 50% reservation cap mandated by the SC. The state rural development department will issue an ordinance to bring amendment in two legislations — Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961, and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for zilla parishads, panchayat samiti and gram panchayats. After the amendments, Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities will continue to get the reservation quota based on their population in the local bodies while the OBC community will get the remaining percentage within the 50% ceiling.Ulhas Bapat, a constitutional expert, said that the provisions of the ordinance cannot be implemented in the bypolls, and even the court cannot interfere during the election process. “In my view, the SEC will not accept it as they have already announced bypolls. It has all the rights and the state government cannot interfere. Even the court cannot interfere when the election process is declared. After the bypolls, its validity can be challenged in the court of law,” Bapat said.He further said that the ordinance can also be challenged in the high court and there could be no future to it. “This ordinance can be challenged in the high court because all the other legal aspects for providing reservation to a community such as empirical data and approval by the state backward classes commission will have to be considered,” Bapat said.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said SEC should see the issue in the perspective of no injustice to any community. “SEC is an autonomous body and is free to take decisions on its own. They will have to see that no community is deprived of their rights, and if they work with this perspective then something good can be expected,” Pawar told reporters.State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit chief Chandrakant Patil has slammed the Thackeray government and said if the ordinance could not stand in the court of law then the OBC community will feel cheated. “The MVA government has done nothing to follow the Apex court directives and restore OBC reservation. While scrapping the OBC quota in March, it had asked them to collect empirical data to determine the quota of the community. The ordinance should have been issued four months ago. If the ordinance could not stand in the SC then the move will be like throwing dust in the eyes of OBC community,” Patil said.On March 4, the SC ruled that the reservation in favour of OBCs in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% cap in reservation quota mandated by it. It has directed the state government to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which the reservation quota of the community be fixed. The SC also allowed the SEC to hold local body polls without reservations for OBCs.The state government has filed a writ petition in the Apex court seeking Socio Economic Caste Census, 2011 data from the Centre. The next hearing is going to be held on September 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-change-in-reservation-for-local-body-bypolls-maharashtra-sec-101631818210082.html
17-09-2021||Delhi||Connect Karo: City-specific holistic action plans needed to combat air pollution||India needs to follow a multi-sectoral approach for the preparation of city specific action plans for controlling pollution levels, experts said in a discussion organised by World Resources Institute (WRI), India, in its annual flagship conference Connect Karo, which highlights ways of designing inclusive, sustainable and climate forward cities. In its session, ‘Air Pollution: From Policy to Action’, panellists discussed the need for holistic plans to combat the problem. Experts also discussed how the Union government’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is leading cities to achieve its targets of reducing air pollution by 20-30% by 2024. Ajay Singh Nagpure, head (air quality and sustainable cities), WRI (India), said multiple stakeholders must come together for the execution of the clean air action planning. “Actions on ground have their effects on the natural components such as air, thus citizens and authorities must act in coherence for the best results,” Nagpure said. The NCAP was launched by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change in January 2019, as a five-year strategy to reduce pollution in different Indian states in a comprehensive manner. Under NCAP, city specific air pollution mitigation action plans were required to be developed by all cities identified by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Experts said the first step towards controlling air pollution in India’s urban centre is to identify the magnitude of the problem and to tailor plans to solve the unique problems that each city faces. “Recognising the issues of air pollution in the urban areas is the first major step in the direction of controlling it. NCAP has identified the issue of increasing air pollution in 124 urban agglomerations in India have been given the task of preparing city specific clean air programmes,” said Kishore Wankhade, manager, WRI (India). The discussion also highlighted how source apportionment studies and emission inventory could help identify the sources of pollution in a region, which would further help prepare clean air action plans. Satellites-based data and air quality monitoring stations can also be used to fill the gaps and provide a better perspective on air quality, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/connect-karo-city-specific-holistic-action-plans-needed-to-combat-air-pollution-101631818151393.html
17-09-2021||Delhi||Accessible public spaces key to fight congestion: Delhi minister Kailash Gahlot||New Delhi: For cities facing the problem of congestion such as Delhi, the best way to make public spaces more accessible is by making such pockets pedestrian friendly, and keep in mind the needs of the disabled while building public infrastructure, urban development experts said on Thursday at a conclave. Joining the discussion on how to make cities more accessible at the Connect Karo conference of World Resources Institute, India, Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the obvious way to do so is by strengthening public transport. He said after more than a decade Delhi has managed to increase its public bus fleet to over 6,700 buses.“And the buck doesn’t stop at just bringing more buses. We have to look at ways to gradually reduce the private vehicles load in Delhi, or compel a section of them to transition to green fuel. Delhi government’s approach is multi-pronged, we are aiming to increase the city’s bus fleet to at least 10,000. We are simultaneously working to make most of the people in the city to switch to electric vehicles. We have launched the Delhi EV policy under which we are also working on building a robust charging station network across the city,” Gahlot said. Giving an example of projects that were designed to make public spaces more accessible, Garima Gupta, managing director, Shahjanahabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), said the dialogue was the key to the success of Chandni Chowk redevelopment project. “The old Delhi area is a super congested, highly populated zone. We have residents, traders, tourists, basically all sorts of people. The foundation stone for the project was laid back in 2011, but it just did not took off. Until 2018, when the actual work started, the ground work was mostly consultations. We had more than 24 consultation sessions with the stakeholders. The project is also a classic example of how works can be executed despite multiplicity of authority. This project had as many as 17 stakeholders and agencies involved,” she said. Now that the entire 1.3 kilometre stretch has been pedestrianised, Gupta said the SRDC’s next focus is on facade redevelopment. “We will preserve the Havelis as they are. The work on this will start soon. Now the pedestrianised Chandni Chowk area has become such that we can find people taking a walk on the stretch even at midnight. We put a lot of thought even on something as small as the signages in the area. All of them are multilingual including Urdu and Punjabi,” she said. Natalie Draisin, director, North America office and UN representative, FIA Foundation highlighted how a key focus area in making cities accessible should be the journeys to schools. “If people walk or cycle to schools, it will also boost the economy of all the shops falling on the route because wherever there is pedestrianisation, businesses pick up. People who walk or cycle find it easier to stop by look and pick up quick items from stores as compared to those in vehicles,” she said. Draisin added that a thumb rule that should be followed without any leniency is restricting speed limits to 30 kmph on all roads around schools. “And this rule must be amplified through campaigns so that it becomes a culture which promotes children walking or cycling to school. The city of Bogota implemented this and their child fatalities in road accidents came down to 0 in 2018 from 50 in 2012,” she said. Disability rights advocate and co-founder of Samarthyam, Anjlee Agarwal said if roads and public infrastructure are built keeping in mind the differently abled, then it will cover all segments of the society and there would not be any need of retrofitting anywhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/accessible-public-spaces-key-to-fight-congestion-delhi-minister-kailash-gahlot-101631818093777.html

A case was registered against Zubair by the city police in August last year on the complaint by NCPCR referring to a tweet shared by him on August 6, 2020. In the tweet, Zubair shared the photo of a minor girl, with her face blurred out, during an online spat he was having with her father.The Delhi high court last year restrained the Delhi Police from taking any coercive action against Zubair after he had moved court seeking quashing of the FIR, while also seeking compensation of ₹50 lakh for the harassment and defaming him.In response to the plea, NCPCR, through an affidavit, has informed the court that Twitter has refused to take down the tweet posted by Zubair. The child rights body said that it had written to Twitter and Delhi Police in July 2021 regarding Zubair’s post and asked them about the follow-up action.The affidavit said in response to the commission’s letter to the city police, it was informed that a Kalandra (a sort of notice) under Section 175 IPC has been filed before the Patiala House court by the city police on February 17 against Twitter for not providing the information sought despite repeated reminders.NCPCR said that Twitter in August 2021 informed the Commission that the image of the child in the post is pixelated or blurred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/twitter-not-removing-minor-s-image-child-rights-body-to-delhi-hc-101631818091290.html

But this gives us an incredible opportunity to decide how cities should be. Getting cities right is critical as most people live there and most of economic activities take place there,” he said.However, cities and governments need to work together plan this recovery, he said, adding that the focus cannot solely be to decarbonise, but also to create jobs, increase equity and ensure that these solutions protect nature.As economies recover, he said that governments should focus on seven priority areas: green construction and retrofitting, clean mobility, renewable energy, active transport, nature-based solutions, waste and resources, and research and development for clean technologies.Dasgupta said the problem of congestion in cities must be solved by providing public transport. This, he said, is important to make cities more liveable, more attractive and to integrate all modes of public transport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wri-connect-karo-covid-an-opportunity-to-rethink-cities-101631817792869.html
17-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Begumpur Masjid roof collapse not recent: ASI counters William Dalrymple||The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on Thursday contested historian and author William Dalrymple’s claim that portions of the roof of the 14th-century Begumpur Masjid have collapsed recently due to rain. The premier heritage body shared visual evidence from the 1980s to show that the roof was damaged even then. Dalrymple had on September 13 shared a photo of the Begumpur Masjid on microblogging platform Twitter and called it an instance of ASI’s neglect, triggering a conservation appeal by many people, including Aam Aadmi Party MLA Somnath Bharti. But ASI officials produced an archival image of the mosque from 1988 to claim that the damages aren’t recent. “No recent collapses have taken place in Begumpur Mosque. ASI categorically denies it,” said an official, who did not wish to be named. ASI also rejected the charge that it has neglected the monument and said it has been carrying out conservation and repair work at the mosque for the past few months. “Several support pillars have been erected and buttress walls are also being built to neutralise the foundation settlement and prevent any collapse. Boundaries are being strengthened and water is being channelled away from the foundation. The debris that is strewn around is also being removed,” the ASI official added. When HT contacted Dalrymple on Thursday for his reaction on ASI’s rebuttal, he said he last visited the site in January last year and at that time, he had seen portions of the roof collapse towards the right end of the mihrab (alcove that points towards the direction of Mecca) and debris on the floor. At that time, he said, ASI had closed entry to the roof. “As a regular visitor to the mosque in pre-pandemic times, I was horrified to see the recent damage to one of Delhi’s major monuments, and the fact that the roof galleries that were once open had been blocked off, but could see no evidence of an attempt at restoration,” he said. He added that the photograph he had tweeted was clicked by someone who had been working on the site and documenting the damage that the mosque had sustained. He said that the photograph suggested that the roof’s condition had deteriorated since his last visit. “From the photograph, it seems that the roof that was beginning to collapse has continued to deteriorate. A monument is like a necklace. Once it begins to fall apart, all the pieces begin to disintegrate. Linked domes like the ones here are particularly vulnerable,” said the author of popular books like the City of Djinns and The Last Mughal.He criticised ASI’s decision of restricting entry to the mosque’s roof. “One of the greatest medieval monuments in South Asia is being allowed to perish. Grass is growing on the premises and the roof has not been restored. The ASI has blocked entry to the roof, presumably because the roof might collapse.” he said. Begumpur Masjid is one of the seven mosques said to have been built by Khan-i-Jahan Junan Shah, the prime minister of Feroze Shah Tughlaq (AD 1351-88). The single-storied mosque stands on a raised plinth and consists of 24 arched openings with the central one being the highest. The central arch consists of a pair of tapering monuments typical of Tughlaq architecture.Dalrymple said that the mosque deserves better treatment. “This is not some minor monument. It was the Jama Masjid of Tughlaq Delhi and one of the largest mosques of medieval Delhi. It’s a mystery to me how such a significant monument had been left unattended. In any other country of the world, people would have been selling tickets for such a monument. There would have been a museum on site. Tour buses and recreations of the monument would have been popular,” he said, adding that there was a great potential for it to become a major hub of tourism and it deserved treatment on the same lines as the Red Fort. Historian and author Rana Safvi who visited the mosque recently said that it was a monument of neglect and despair and in need of maintenance. “When I visited the mosque on September 13, I found that the majestic courtyard was partially covered by grass. This neglect of the 14th-century mosque is tragic,” said Safvi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-begumpur-masjid-roof-collapse-not-recent-asi-counters-historian-dalrymple-101631817733269.html
17-09-2021||Delhi||Plans to build two drains at Delhi airport to end waterlogging fail to take off||Last Saturday, Delhi residents woke up to videos and images of a heavily inundated Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA). As shocking as the videos were, airport officials say the waterlogging is nothing new; it happens every time there is a downpour. However, a solution has eluded them so far, with plans to construct two wider drains failing to take off even three years after they were conceived for want of clearances from agencies. Officials of the airport operator, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), said for the past three years, they have been in talks with Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the public works department (PWD) to build the two drains, wide enough to accommodate all run-off water in the event of a downpour.  A senior DDA official, in the know of project details, said, “The work on one drain has been awarded but we are awaiting tree-felling permission from the forest department.”Spread over 5,000 acres, the Delhi airport is divided into two parts -- the northern air parcel and the southern air parcel. Even though water accumulates on both sections, it is the northern side that is the worst affected. It is also the side that houses Terminal-1 and Terminal-2, said officials.A senior airport official said while one drain is awaiting clearance from the forest department, the other is yet to get a right of way approval from the DDA, despite having all clearances from other agencies, including the PWD, the agency constructing the drains.Airport officials said the drain is much needed, especially on the northern air parcel. “The DDA’s artillery drainage network, which is 2.5 metres wide and one metre deep, is inadequate to handle the storm water. Even 20mm of rainfall is enough to cause flooding on the northern side, with rainwater from the Mahipalpur junction flowing into the northern access underpass and inundating the area. There is no drainage facility in the vicinity to restrict water accumulation, and this water enters the northern side and gets accumulated at the western end of the northern main runway funnel area,” an airport official said, asking not to be named. As for the southern side, there is an existing four-cell box culvert drain -- about 12 metres wide and 2.75 metres deep. It can only handle a rainfall intensity of around 60mm before becoming causing waterlogging towards the forecourt of Terminal 3 (T3).A second airport official said a steep land gradient of 17 metres, between NH8 and T3, only makes matters worse with water from Radisson hotel and its adjacent areas also gushing towards the airport.Saturday’s waterlogging, which was cleared in about 30 minutes, took place due to the steep gradient between NH8 and T3, the official said. “The entire area acted as a catchment and drained water towards the terminal. DIAL has been working with state and central government bodies and officials for the past few years requesting to widen this underground drainage system. Several discussions in this matter have already taken place,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-years-on-plans-to-build-two-drains-at-delhi-airport-to-end-waterlogging-fail-to-take-off-101631817731355.html
17-09-2021||Mumbai||Ajit Pawar says Navi Mumbai airport will start operations in 2024||Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has said Navi Mumbai international airport will be operational in 2024 and that its naming controversy will be resolved soon. He has also questioned the morality of the Central government, accused Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Sudhir Mungatiwar of having two different opinions on GST, and also questioned Cidco on its housing and project-affected people (PAP) rehabilitation plans. Pawar was in Navi Mumbai on Thursday at Cidco Bhavan to take stock of various city-related issues. Speaking to media personnel on income tax (I-T) department raids on Sonu Sood, the deputy CM said, “You have seen the tenures of Manmohan Singh, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, PV Narasimha Rao, Rajiv Gandhi and also that of the present leader of the government. The media knows well who is working how. I do not want to encroach on your territory.” Accusing former finance minister and BJP leader Mungantiwar he said, “Mungantiwar was a minister for five years. When one is not in the chair, you change the cassette and speak different. The state government cannot mint currency. We depend on taxes for all development, recruitments and services.” He said they are confident that the airport work will now proceed as planned and 2024 is the target for flight operations by the agency. “The project has now been taken over from GVK by the Adani group which is one of the two biggest groups in the country. This will ensure that there are no financial constraints,” he added. On the controversy over naming of the airport, Pawar said an amicable solution will be sought. Pawar also questioned Cidco on various issues including pricing of its houses. Speaking about Cidco’s plans of constructing houses on open spaces near railway stations under PMAY, Pawar said, “Protecting the environment is important for this government. Once these open spaces are lost we will never get them. We will discuss the issue in the government. There are also plans for a coastal road here, but the mangroves and the migratory birds will have to be taken into account.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ajit-pawar-says-navi-mumbai-airport-will-start-operations-in-2024-101631817730109.html

Flights resuming to other centres is also one of the major factors behind the rise in flyer footfall at the airport. Both the number of flyers and flights have increased as compared to 2020 but they are still lower than 2019 when passenger traffic was 23,000 (arrival and departure).Santosh Dhoke, director, Lohegaon airport, said, “The number of flights has increased to 55 daily. The number has gone up with a few flights resuming and flights to new centres added as well.

17-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi Cantt rape case: Dalit girl died of suffocation during assault, say cops||A nine-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly raped and murdered by a priest and his accomplices at a crematorium near Delhi cantonment on August 1 died due to “suffocation” during the sexual assault, the Delhi Police have told a city court ,citing disclosure statements of two accused in the case.Quoting the disclosure statement of one of the accused, the police said in a document submitted in court -- parts of it were seen by HT -- that priest Radhey Shyam put his hand on the mouth of the minor victim while sexually assaulting her following which she couldn’t breathe and died due to “suffocation”. Kuldeep Singh allegedly held the victim’s hand while she was being assaulted by Shyam.This is the first time the girl’s cause of death has come to light, and it appears to debunk the claims made by the accused. The accused, 55-year-old Shyam and his three associates, Kuldeep Singh, Salim Ahmed and Laxmi Narayan, have maintained that the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from a cooler. The girl’s family alleged that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after raping her.According to a statement made by the police before a Delhi court on August 12, Ahmed and Narayan were primarily involved in destruction of evidence and facilitating the cremation. These two have made disclosure statements before the investigators about the role played by Shyam and Singh in the crime.To be sure, a confession or disclosure statement of any person made before a police officer is not admissible as evidence before a court unless it is backed by other evidence. Only a confession before a judge is admissible as evidence against an accused.However, documents reviewed by HT revealed that the disclosure statements of Ahmed and Narayan have now been corroborated by the Forensic Science Lab (FSL) and post mortem (PM) reports, which also ruled out death due to electrocution.The police recently told the court that there was no evidence of electrocution since there was “no electric current” in the body of the water cooler. It also said that, as per the FSL report, “no Biological fluid/DNA trace/sample was found on the body of water cooler which clearly suggests that the deceased was not electrocuted; because, in case of electrocution, DNA trace would be present on the body of the water cooler.”“As per subsequent opinion of the PM report on the basis of autopsy findings of examined body parts, we could not find any evidence related to electrocution,” the court in its order on September 16 registered it as a statement by the Investigating Officer (IO) of the case.The girl, from a Dalit family in a village near Delhi cantonment, was found dead by local villagers in a local crematorium on August 1 sparking protests by activists and politicians in the national capital. Three days later, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the family while the Bharatiya Janata Party accused them of politicising the crime. Gandhi later got into trouble for tweeting a photo of the victim’s family -- Indian laws bar any disclosure of a sexual crime victim’s identity -- and his Twitter account was temporarily locked.On August 28, police filed a charge sheet, accusing the four people of rape, wrongful confinement, murder, destruction of evidence, and under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Prevention of Atrocities Act.The statement, filed by the IO in response to an application by the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) for interim compensation for the victim’s family on account of rape, maintained that accused Shyam and Singh were seen by two witnesses as taking the victim girl from verandah of the crematorium building towards Shyam’s room where she was allegedly raped. These two witnesses, according to the IO, have also recorded their statements before the magistrate.The IO added that two other witnesses saw the two main accused taking the body of the girl from Shyam’s room to the hall with a water cooler, and kept her body on the bench. These witnesses also recorded their statements before the magistrate.All the four accused persons gathered at the crematorium ground and with common intention decided to cremate the dead body of the deceased to eliminate the evidence of rape and murder, stated the disclosure statements.The IO added that Shyam and Singh also made extra judicial confessions to two witnesses when the public had barged in the “Shamshan Ghat”, nabbed the accused persons and started asking them questions regarding the burning pyre.“…they [accused] confessed to both of them [witnesses] privately that they had raped and murdered the deceased and later forcefully cremated her. The accused also pleaded with them to get the matter sorted,” the police’s reply to the court read.The crime branch has also told the court that Shyam manipulated the entry in the Shamshan Ghat register by mentioning the time of death as 5.30 PM when the deceased was visible alive on the CCTV at 5.42 PM.“This aside he (Shyam) mentioned the reason of death as illness instead of electrocution which he presented to be as reason of death to the deceased’s parents,” the police told the court.On September 14, additional sessions judge Ashutosh Kumar directed that an interim compensation of ₹2.5 lakh be immediately disbursed to the girl’s family.As per the city government’s victim compensation scheme, the maximum compensation awarded in case of loss of life is ₹10 lakh. The court granted 25 per cent of the compensation amount as interim relief.Earlier, the court granted ₹2.5 lakh as compensation for murder under the same scheme and had asked the parties to approach again for interim compensation on the account of rape as the police, at that time, had not been able to “conclusively” say that the victim was raped before the murder.The investigating agency also told the court that the search history of Shyam’s mobile revealed that he was addicted to porn content and sexually arousing material.“He has visited around 1,300 porn websites from June 11 to July 30. He used to show the same porn content to the deceased to arouse her. He used his smart phone only to browse porn as no call logs were found on the phone. He kept the phone secret from everyone,” the police told the court.On September 9, the court had taken cognisance of the police charge sheet, summoning the accused on September 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cantt-case-dalit-girl-died-of-suffocation-during-assault-say-police-101631817551651.html

The police said that the two were by themselves at home when the incident took place. There were no signs of robbery or theft, and the house did not seem to have been broken into--indicating that the victims likely knew the assailants. The man was identified as one Naim Ul Hasan. According to family members, Hasan’s wife and three other children were away for a family wedding. Hasan’s two brothers also stay in the same locality. “Around 9am, I sent my son to fetch a helmet from my brother’s house. The main door of the house was not bolted from inside. When my son went inside, he was terrified to find the bodies of my brother and his son on blood-soaked beds. He rushed out and told us what he saw,” said Mamnul Chaudhary, Hasan’s older brother. “We reached the house and saw that both of them had been stabbed and their throats slit. None of the neighbours had heard any noise or struggle, as my brother’s house is at the end of the lane and there is no other house closeby,” Chaudhary added. The police were alerted, and forensic teams also arrived at the spot. “We have roped in several teams to crack the case. There were no signs of any household items being taken away. The two bodies bore multiple injuries which seemed to be inflicted with some sharp-edged weapon. It seems that it was a friendly entry, and the assailants were known to the victims, and this is why Hasan probably opened the door and let them in,” said Atul Kumar Sonkar, circle officer of Loni. “It seems that the assailants murdered the boy in order to hide their identities. Both bodies were sent for a postmortem examination,” he added. The police registered an FIR under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code at Tronica City police station against unidentified persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-son-found-murdered-at-home-in-ghaziabad-cops-suspect-assailants-known-to-victims-101631817492973.html

This is being done upskilling police personnel at police stations. The idea is to reduce pressure on the single cyberpolice station at Shivajinagar, in the wake of a rising number of cybercrimes being reported across the city. Gupta was addressing the media at Pune’s Patrakar Sangh.“We have put a system in place and a lot of cybercrime cases are being detected which were not taking place earlier. A lot of improvement has happened. Every police station is being trained to handle cybercrime cases, particularly detection. We register the case at the cyberpolice station and the case is then sent to the respective police station for detection,” he said.Replying to a query on an NCRB report stating that murders in the city have increased, and also crime in Pune has risen by 121 per cent, he said, “Statistics can be misleading. Actually, IPC 188 cases have increased during lockdown. Murders have risen, by one or two cases, as compared with the previous year.” Referring to the crackdown on auto drivers, commissioner Gupta said, “I am bringing RTO, PMPML, PMC and all stakeholders on one table wherein we will use technology and less manpower to curb incidents related to women safety. Whatever is needed will be done for the safety and security of women.”On anti-terrorism measures, Gupta said that top priority was being given to anti-terrorism measures aimed at making the city safe for citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/personnel-being-trained-to-investigate-cybercrime-pune-police-commissioner-gupta-101631817491259.html

17-09-2021||Pune||77 murders in Pune in 2020: NCRB data; highest in three years||PUNE: A year of lockdown to control the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020 brought down the number of violent crimes in almost all metropolitan cities. However, according to recent data published by the National crime records bureau (NCRB), the number of murder cases in Pune have seen an uptick, even as overall violent crimes reduced. The NCRB published the booklet “Crime in India, 2020” on Tuesday. The violent crimes include 16 types of crimes like murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, dowry deaths, attempted murder, kidnapping, rape, rioting, dacoity, and arson among others. Cases are registered throughout the year and the data is collated by NCRB.In 2018, Pune witnessed 1,871 violent crimes as per NCRB records, with a reduction to 1,661 in 2019 and a further reduction to 1,320 in 2020. In the corresponding years, the murder cases were 73, 74, and 77, respectively, according to the records.Of the victims, 15 were men in the age group of 30-45 and 8 women from the same age group; and 6 men and 1 woman aged above 45 years.Among the reasons for the murders, 40 were without any known motive. However, among the cases with clear motive, the motive of gaining something from a person’s death claimed highest number of lives - 12. Family disputes was the second highest reason for murder - 9. Love affairs claimed 6 while previous enmity claimed 4 lives.The year 2020 in Pune was marred by one political murder. Deepak Maratkar, a 36-year-old Shiv Sena leader was brutally stabbed in a public space near his house in Gawli aali area of Budhwar peth. The entire incident was captured on CCTV and a case was registered at Faraskhana police station. The state law against organised crime, Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) was invoked in the case. Some police personnel also faced suspension as a fallout.A 70-year-old man has been booked by the Pune police on Wednesday for the murder of his 66-year-old wife, after both of them were found dead at their apartment in Karvenagar on July 27.On the night of July 12, a local builder and two others were killing a man over his affair with the builder’s 19-year-old daughter.The death of money-lender Ghanshyam alias Pappu Padwal (51) in his Kondhwa residence was another brutal murder to mark the past year.In one of the murders that did not have a clear reason, a 34-year-old labourer was found bludgeoned to death in Bibwewadi area of Pune on June 24 and 3 people were later arrested. The police found a drunken fight over a trivial reason as the reason behind the murder.Reacting to growing murders, Pune Police Commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “Statistic can be revealing or misleading. Last year due to lockdown, most cases were of section 188 of Indian Penal Code. Since most people were at home due to lockdown, others crimes were very less. As far as murders are concerned, the figure has gone down not drastically by single digit.” The cases under Section 188 of IPC went up in all parts of the country, as per the data. “Major increase was seen in the cases registered under Disobedience to order duly promulgated by Public Servant (Section 188 of IPC) from 29,469 cases in 2019 to 6,12,179 cases in 2020,” read the summary of overall crimes in the report.Commissioner Gupta, while speaking at a press interaction organised by Pune Union of Working Journalists said, “The lockdown year was different due to the Covid19 lockdown. It is for the same reason, when I hold meetings I consider crime data of there years – 2019, 2020, and 2021.” Speaking about controlling series crimes and the audacious display of criminal acts by miscreants, Gupta said steps have been taken with stricter sections to control such events. “Earlier people used to put WhatsApp status or video of cutting of cake using swords, or similar things.

17-09-2021||Delhi||Govt defends Asthana as Delhi police commissioner||Justifying the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner, the Union government on Thursday told the Delhi high court that most officers at the appropriate level from AGMUT (the cadre of IPS officers for Union territories) did not have sufficient experience of policing in a vast and sensitive state or elsewhere for appointment as the top cop of the city.It also told the court that the Prakash Singh case, which mandated that anyone being appointed police chief of a state needs to have six months of service left, does not apply to Union territories.Both Asthana’s transfer to AGMUT, and his appointment with only four days to go for his retirement, have been challenged in court.In an affidavit filed before a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, the Union ministry of home affairs said that an experienced officer was required for Delhi, the capital of the country. Local law and order incidents have an impact not just on the rest of the country but also globally, the last in terms of the image of the country, it added.“…in the present case during the process of appointment of the Commissioner of Police, Delhi, the /Cadre Controlling Authority (CCA) was faced with precarious situation where it found that the most of the appropriate level officers of AGMUT cadre were not having sufficient balanced experience of policing in a vast law and order sensitive State/Central Investigating Agency/ National Security/Paramilitary force for appointment of Commissioner of Police Delhi…….”“Hence, considering the complexities and the sensitivities involved and also considering that no officer of appropriate seniority with balanced experience, as stated above, was available in the AGMUT Cadre, it was felt that an officer belonging to a large state cadre, who had the exposure of complexities of governance and who had the knowledge of nuances of broad canvas policing is given charge of Commissioner of Police Delhi,” the Centre said.In Prakash Singh’s case, the top court made it mandatory for the state governments to appoint police chiefs from a panel of three most senior police officers forwarded to them by the Union Public Service Commission. The selected officer must have six months of service left, and be given a tenure of two years, it said.“The said judgment has no application for appointment of commissioners/police heads of Union territories falling under the AGMUT cadre. While passing the judgment in Prakash Singh’s case, the Hon’be Supreme Court itself made it clear that in so far as its direction related to appointment of DGPs was concerned, the same was only in relation to the states and not in relation to UTs,” the affidavit said, adding that UPSC too has not raised any objection on non-empanelment of officers -- which means the commission understood that the judgment applied only to states.The Union government said that keeping the objective of “public interest” in mind, Asthana’s service tenure was extended. It said that Delhi has been witnessing diverse and extremely challenging situations of law and order which not only had national security implications but also international/cross border implications.The Centre asserted that there was a compelling need to appoint a person as a head of the police force of Delhi, who had diverse and vast experience of heading a large police force in a large state having diverse political as well as public order problem/experience of working and supervising Central Investigating Agency(s) as well as paramilitary forces.“…In view thereof, it is respectfully submitted that any statutory provision or any other regime deserves to be read in such a way that a leeway is given to the Central Government in appointment of Delhi Police Commissioner. Any straight-jacket or paediatric approach would not be in national interest,” it added.The affidavit was filed in response to a petition by Sadre Alam and an intervening application by Prashant Bhushan challenging Asthana’s appointment and seeking quashing of a July 27 order issued by the ministry of home affairs appointing him the Delhi Police commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him.The plea has sought initiation of steps for appointing Delhi Police commissioner strictly in accordance with the direction issued by the Supreme Court earlier.It has claimed the high-powered committee comprising the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition, in its meeting held on May 24, 2021, rejected the central government’s attempt to appoint Asthana as the CBI director citing the Prakash Singh case.The matter was listed for hearing on Thursday, but the concerned bench was not available and now it will be heard on September 20.Seeking dismissal of the petitions, the affidavit filed by the secretary, ministry of home affairs (MHA) said that it is an “abuse of process of law and manifestly an outcome of some personal vendetta” of the petitioners. It also said that a PIL in service matter is not maintainable.“The petitioner and the intervener are mere busy bodies. Both the petitioner and more particularly the intervener who claims to be espousing a public cause, never considered challenging appointment of eight (8) erstwhile Police Commissioners though they were appointed in the same manner as is done in the case of Respondent No.2 (Asthana).“Such a selective exhibition of ‘’public interest’’ speaks volume about the motive behind filing this petition/intervention application/writ petition in the Supreme Court respectively by the petitioner /intervener only in case of the Respondent No 2,” the affidavit said.The Union government has said that it has the powers of inter-cadre transfers.The petition with similar prayers which has been filed by CPIL before the Supreme Court has urged the central government to produce the July 27 order it issued, approving the inter-cadre deputation of Asthana from Gujarat cadre to AGMUT cadre.The petition has also urged the apex court to set aside the Centre’’s order to extend Asthana’s service period.On August 25, the Supreme Court asked the high court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment of the senior IPS officer as Delhi Police commissioner.Asthana, in his response in an affidavit, said that the petitions are entertaining a personal vengeance against him and are not in bonafide public interest litigations. He said that the please are nothing but are a flagrant abuse of august forum of the court for some hidden personal vendetta of either of them or of someone on whose behest several attempts are being made against me to derail his career.He said that NGOs Common Cause and Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) are spearheading a malicious campaign against him and consistently filing petitions against him in courts.“I state and submit that as a part of this selective campaign against me, proceedings are being consistently filed against me by these two organisations, while outside court the people having control of the said organisation spearhead a malicious campaign against me. This has been regularly happening since I was appointed as Special Director in Central Bureau of Investigation,” he said in an affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/most-in-agmut-cadre-didn-t-have-enough-experience-home-ministry-defends-asthana-as-delhi-police-commissioner-101631817251223.html
17-09-2021||Lucknow||To woo UP voters, AAP promises 24X7 power supply, 300 free units||Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, on Thursday, promised to provide “300 units of free electricity, waive pending power bills and ensure 24-hour power supply” in Uttar Pradesh, if his party is voted to power in the assembly elections due early next year.“The AAP will provide every family 300 units of free electricity if the party is voted to power in Uttar Pradesh. Under chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, people in Delhi are getting zero electricity bills. We will do the same in UP,” Sisodia said at a press conference in Lucknow. “If the AAP is voted to power, we will cancel pending electricity dues of 48 lakh (4.8 million) families who got inflated bills,” he added.The AAP has made similar promises in election-bound states of Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa.Pointing out the AAP government’s success in Delhi, Sisodia said: “In Delhi, there was a huge demand of generators and invertors before 2015. But now people are getting 24x7 uninterrupted power supply.” He also promised free electricity for farmers.In August, the AAP announced “Tiranga Yatra” across UP to mark the 75th year of India’s independence, in an attempt to make inroads into a politically crucial state. Since August 29, Sisodia and the party in charge of UP, Sanjay Singh, have conducted rallies in several parts of the state, including Agra, Lucknow and Ayodhya.The AAP intends to contest 100 of the 403 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh, for which it has announced names of probable candidates. The party has also announced that it will not enter into a pre-poll alliance with any political party.Hitting back, UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said the AAP is running the Delhi government like a Nagar Nigam. “They (AAP) will not get candidates for all the seats and will not be able to win a single seat in UP. In such a scenario, he is making promises only,” he told news agency PTI.He added that the law and order situation under the BJP regime has improved and bulldozers are running on illegal properties earned through ill-gotten money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/to-woo-up-voters-aap-promises-24x7-power-supply-300-free-units-101631817250017.html

17-09-2021||Delhi||Domestic helps commit robbery at jeweller’s house in Delhi's Pitampura||Two men, employed as domestic helps at a jeweller’s home in northwest Delhi’s Pitampura, threw chilli powder on his wife’s eyes, locked her in the bathroom and fled with a portable locker containing cash and jewellery worth over ₹50 lakh on Tuesday evening--within less than a week of their employment. Police arrested the two men, along with two of their associates, within six hours of the crime and recovered the entire loot from them, said police on Thursday. Those arrested were identified as Aman Kumar Roy (19), Sanjeev Kumar Ram (18), Ram Pukar Yadav (26), and Sunil (21). Police said all of them are natives of Bihar but were working as domestic helps in Delhi for the past few months.They all conspired to commit the robbery to gain quick and easy money, said police. Roy and Ram were employed by jeweller Yogesh Singhal, president of the Bullion and Jewellers’ Association at Kuch Mahajani near Chandni Chowk, on the recommendation of his old domestic help Rahul, six days before the robbery. Police said Singhal had not done their police verification before hiring them. Singhal said he employed the two men to remove rainwater that had flooded the basement of his house in Pitampura’s SU-block. The two lived in the basement while Singhal’s family lived on the ground floor. On Tuesday, Singhal was at his shop in Chandni Chowk with his son. In the evening, his daughter went to Rohini Sector-13 for some work, leaving her 52-year-old mother Pramila Singhal at home. Around 6pm, when Pramila called Roy to prepare a cup of tea for her, he entered the house with Ram, took a bowl of red chilli powder from the kitchen and went to the bedroom where Pramila was lying, said Singhal.“The two threw chilli powder on my wife’s face. One of them sat on her chest...and tried to throttle her. He also removed the gold earings she was wearing. The other man tied her limbs and locked her inside the bathroom,” said Singhal.Police said around 10 minutes later, Pramila somehow untied herself and came out of the bathroom. On checking the CCTV cameras installed at home, she found that the suspects fled with the portable locker kept in the room and immediately raised an alarm. “The police were informed about the crime. A case of robbery was registered at the Maurya Enclave police station and the northwest district’s special staff as well as the crime branch were roped in to nab the suspects,” said a senior police officer.“The teams analysed the call records of the suspects’ cellphone and found that they had last called one Sunil, who worked as a domestic help in the same neighbourhood. Sunil was caught and he confessed to his involvement in the robbery. His interrogation led to the arrest of the two prime suspects and Yadav from Shakurpur within six hours. The stolen cash and jewellery were recovered from them,” said the officer. In another case, a 47-year-old resident of Nepal, Raju Thapa, was arrested from the India-Nepal border on Tuesday while he was fleeing with ₹25 lakh cash and two diamond pieces worth ₹15 lakh which he had stolen from his employer’s office at a Saket shopping mall on September 11. The crime was reported on September 13 and the police nabbed Thapa within 10 hours from near Lakhimpur Kheri. Around ₹14 lakh cash and three cellphones that he purchased using the stolen money were recovered. Police is interrogating him to recover the stolen diamonds and the rest of the money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-domestic-helps-commit-robbery-at-jeweller-s-house-in-pitampura-101631816171489.html

A case was registered at the CR Park police station under the Indian Penal Code sections 304 A, 337 and 288 and the construction site contractor Shankar Viswas as well as supervisor Chandan Singh Bisht were arrested and booked for death and injuries due to negligence and negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing a building, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the police control room was alerted that a person was trapped under the sand at an under-construction building site in I-1612, CR Park. A police team reached there and rescued Roze, 21, from under the sand. He was rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre, where doctors declared him dead on admission. One more labourer, Aiyub,40, was found injured and was rushed to a nearby hospital for medical attention. He is out of danger, said the DCP.Police said prima facie, it appeared that the ground at the construction site caved in due to the rain and the two labourers were trapped under the soil and sand that was stored there for construction work. Since adequate safety and security measures were not taken, the contractor and supervisor of the site were arrested, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/one-labourer-dead-another-injured-in-construction-site-cave-in-at-delhi-s-cr-park-101631816169897.html
17-09-2021||Gurugram||Gadkari in Gurugram: Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will be completed by March 2023||The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, being built at the cost of around ₹95,000 crore, would be completed by March 2023 with a majority of the work having already been allotted to contractors, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Thursday after reviewing the status of the ongoing project work at Lohtaki village in Gurugram.Gadkari, the Union minister of road transport and highways, said that work on around 160 kilometres of the highway that falls in Haryana is expected to be completed by March 2022.Addressing a gathering in Gurugram, Gadkari said that the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway would be the longest in the country, cutting across 1,380 kilometres. “This expressway will be ready by March 2023 and part of the road from Delhi to Dausa in Rajasthan and from Vadodara to Ankleswar will be built by March 2022,” he said.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Gurugram Lok Sabha member Rao Inderjit Singh and senior officials of the state government, district administration and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)were also present at the spot.This expressway is being developed as an eight-lane access-controlled greenfield expressway, which can be expanded to 12 lanes by adding four more lanes in the future. A median of 21-metre width is being built on this expressway, which can be reduced for widening the road.The expressway will have wayside amenities, including resorts, dormitories, hospitals, food courts, petrol pumps as well as commercial spaces, such as warehouses and logistic parks, every 25 kilometres and a heliport for air ambulance, Gadkari said.In Haryana, the expressway will pass through Gurugram, Palwal and Nuh districts. The expressway will pass through 11 villages in Gurugram district, seven villages in Palwal and 47 villages in Mewat. The portion in the state is estimated to cost around ₹10,400 crore.Khattar said that Gurugram, Nuh and Palwal districts would greatly benefit once the expressway becomes operational. “The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and other expressways being built in Haryana and NCR will boost sentiment of investors. More industries will come up and people will get employment,” Khattar said.In Haryana, the expressway will start near the Gurugram-Alwar Expressway and extend up to Kolgaon in Nuh district, from where it will enter Rajasthan.Gadkari said that the highway will be the first such structure to have underpasses for animals, at wildlife sanctuaries along the route, with five structures planned to ensure their safe passage.Besides the expressway, Gadkari said that 14 road projects are underway in Delhi-NCR, at ₹53,000 crore, which will significantly reduce noise and air pollution, due to a reduction in traffic issues.Gadkari said that following demands put forth by Khattar to ease traffic on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, three projects at Bilaspur, Manesar and Kapriwas have been approved on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at a cost of about ₹250 crore.He also said that an interchange between the Palwal-Aligarh national highway and Eastern Peripheral Expressway has also been approved and that a road would be constructed to improve connectivity between Faridabad and Jewar airport.Gurugram MP Rao Inderjit Singh said that the completion of projects on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway significantly improved traffic movement and the approval for new flyovers would benefit commuters on the Delhi-Jaipur highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gadkari-in-gurugram-delhi-mumbai-expressway-will-be-completed-by-march-2023-101631813829643.html

17-09-2021||Lucknow||₹962 cr credited to accounts of two poor students in Bihar, bank probes||Authorities at Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank (UBGB) are probing how accounts of two poor students of class VI of a village in Katihar district, whose minor accounts were opened for the purpose of school scholarship and other government benefits, got credited with ₹62 crore and ₹900 crore respectively on Wednesday.The incident came into light at Pastia village of Bhaghaura panchayat in Katihar on Wednesday when outgoing mukhiya (panchayat head), Lalan Vishwas, took some of the students to the local CSP (customers’ service point) to check whether their accounts were credited with money for books and school dress.“I was surprised when I was told about the money credited in the accounts of two class VI students in Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank,” he said.The accounts of two students, identified as Ashish Kumar and Guruchand Vishwas, both with Belagunj branch of UBGB, showed ₹62,00,11,100 and ₹900,52,21,233 as balance respectively, he said.Regional manager of UBGB, Ram Nath Mishra, on Thursday dismissed reports that the accounts were credited with crores of rupees. “We have obtained the statement of these two accounts and found ₹100 and ₹128 in them.”“Account number 1008151030208081 of Ashish Kumar has Rs100 in it while account number 1008151030208018 of Guruchand Vishwas had ₹128. Both are the minor accounts,” Mishra said.“It could be a server error at the CSP. Since both are minor accounts, there is no question of any withdrawal,” he said.However, both the accounts were put on freeze after the matter was highlighted. “We are probing the matter,” Mishra said.A few days ago, a person named Ranjit Das of Khagaria district in Bihar was arrested after he refused to return ₹5.50 lakh credited in his UBGB account in April last year, claiming that it was sent to him by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi as help during the Covid-19 lockdown.

17-09-2021||Lucknow||Portion of Delhi-Meerut E-way damaged by incessant rain||MEERUT: Incessant rains over the past two months have damaged a portion of the 96-km-long Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME). The road has caved in at more than 100 spots on both sides of the newly built 46-km greenfield stretch between Meerut and Dasna (Ghaziabad).The repair work is on but opposition party leaders raised questions over the quality of construction work and demanded a high level inquiry into it. The expressway was constructed at a cost of ₹8,000-10,000 crore with an objective of reducing travel time between Meerut and Delhi to less than one hour. It comprises four stretches – Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to UP gate (8.7 kms), UP gate to Dasna in Ghaziabad (19.2 kms), Dasna to Hapur (22.2 kms) and Dasna to Meerut (46 kms).The road caved in at 48 places on the left side of Meerut-Dasna stretch and at 62 places on the other side of the expressway.Mudit Garg, DME project director, explained that the damage occurred because authorities got possession of land on this stretch quite late and barely got six months to complete the soil work. He said the area has sandy soil which needed extra time for growing grass to keep the soil intact. He also admitted that small depressions too had developed at some places on the expressway. “It could have happened because of drip system that has been used for irrigation of plants on the divider of the expressway,” added Garg.Garg claimed that a 10-day spell of dry weather is needed to fix all damages and the repair work is already going on in full swing.Meanwhile, leaders of opposition parties termed it a major quality issue, which could pose threat to the lives of commuters. Pankaj Malik, Congress party West UP incharge, demanded a high level inquiry into the issue. Senior Samajwadi party leader Sudhir Panwar said multiple damages on the expressway indicated that the government gave the responsibility of quality control to the company involved in constructing the expressway. He also demanded a high level probe to ascertain how a newly constructed flagship project suffered such damage. “If this is happening with a flagship project, then think about the quality of other highways,” commented Panwar.BJP MP from Meerut, Rajendra Agarwal, said sometimes these things happen during rain. “We have brought the issue to the notice of officials concerned and work is underway to fix the damages,” he said admitting that the expressway was built under pressure of a given time limit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/portion-of-delhi-meerut-e-way-damaged-by-incessant-rain-101631797748479.html

17-09-2021||World||UN extends Afghan mission mandate for six months||The UN Security Council voted Friday to extend the UN mission in Afghanistan for six months and called on the Taliban to create an inclusive government.The 15-member council acted in a resolution passed unanimously on the UNAMA political mission, which deals with development issues, among others, not peacekeeping.The document stressed "the importance of the establishment of an inclusive and representative government," although Afghanistan's new Islamist rulers have formed a government made up only of Taliban members and no women.The resolution also calls for "full, equal and meaningful participation of women, and upholding human rights, including for women, children and minorities."It was drafted by Estonia and Norway, which welcomed the unanimous passage.In August a council resolution calling for freedom of movement for Afghans wishing to leave the country after the Taliban takeover won 13 votes, as Russia and China abstained.The text approved Friday says the UN will continue to play an "important role" in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan.Diplomats said the Taliban did not object to the UN mandate being renewed."They are obliged to be more flexible," an Afghanistan specialist at the UN said."They are more pragmatic" than they were in the first stint in power in 1990s, the person said. The Taliban then were known to be brutal in their strict enforcement of Islamic law."The Taliban need the UN and this is our leverage" to have an influence on their decision making, the specialist told AFP.The council asked Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to brief it every other month on the situation in Afghanistan until the mandate is due again to expire in March 2022.It also wants a written report on the future of the mission by January 31.In recent weeks several NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have pressed for the UN and its 2,000 staffers in Afghanistan to stay in place to report on human rights abuses."There's little evidence to suggest the Taliban will comply with international human rights law, especially the rights of women and girls," said Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, welcoming the mission extension."UNAMA will need to regularly and publicly report on abuses, while helping meet the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-extends-afghan-mission-mandate-for-six-months-101631893334612.html

A United Nations spokesperson said that Ambassador Ghulam Isaczai has written to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres with a list of Afghanistan's delegation for the General Assembly.Guterres' spokesperson Farhan Haq said that the accreditation request was sent on Wednesday, a day after the UN General Assembly session kicked off. A nine-member committee, appointed annually, assess the credentials of all UN members around October-November before submitting a report to General Assembly for final approval.Bahamas, Bhutan, Chile, China, Namibia, Russia, Sierra Leone, Sweden and the United States have been named for this year’s UN committee that will assess the credentials. The committee usually operates by consensus, reported Reuters, setting up for a potential showdown if the Taliban put forward their own man for the seat of permanent representative at the UN.Also Read | Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani punched Taliban's Mullah Baradar before shootout in Kabul palace: ReportIsaczai, however, will remain in the New York seat until a decision is made, reported Reuters citing General Assembly rules.

Taliban replace it with ‘vice and virtue’||The ministry of virtue and vice is not new for the Taliban as they had this ministry when they ruled in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. Now they have not only brought it back but have replaced the ministry of women affairs with the ministry of virtue and vice, a Reuters report said. Workers have put up signboards of the ministry outside the department which used to be the ministry of women affairs.A sign for the building was covered by a replacement in a mixture of Dari and Arabic, reading "Ministries of Prayer and Guidance and the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice" on Friday, according to photographs and Reuters witnesses.While this happened on Friday, female employees of the ministry of women affairs were not allowed to enter the building on Thursday, reports said.What is vice and virtue ministry?This Taliban ministry was abolished after the US occupied Afghanistan. Bringing back the ministry was not surprising as the Taliban maintained that their governance will be based on Sharia law, though they promised women rights and press freedom. The aim of this ministry is to serve Islam. So, the ministry will decide and deliver punishments for what they consider as a crime. According to reports, the ministry will cust off the hands of the thieves while the punishment for illegal intercourse will be stoning.What will happen to women ministry?The ministry had no place in the earlier Taliban regime. The interim Cabinet has no women member in it, which makes it clear that there will be no ministry of women's affairs in Afghanistan. The ministry was created in 2001 and Delbar Nazari was the last minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-had-women-ministry-taliban-replace-it-with-vice-and-virtue-101631887569231.html
17-09-2021||World||Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani punched Taliban's Mullah Baradar before shootout in Kabul palace: Report||A prominent leader of the Haqqani Network punched Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Taliban co-founder and current deputy prime minister of the so-called Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan, which led to a shootout during a meeting at the presidential place in Kabul early September, according to a Bloomberg report. Baradar has earlier headed the Taliban’s political office in Doha to lead the peace talks with the United States after the Trump administration facilitated his release from a Pakistan prison.Western countries have opted for a wait-and-watch policy in recognising the Taliban government and have repeatedly called on the Sunni Pashtun group to include non-Taliban leaders and ethnic minorities. The Taliban co-founder was at the presidential place to discuss the structure of the government as he pushed for an “inclusive” cabinet that would have been more acceptable to the international community, as per multiple reports.Amid the heated discussion, Khalil ul Rahman Haqqani, a minister and senior leader of the Haqqani Network, rose from his chair began punching Baradar, reported Bloomberg citing people familiar with the development. The situation quickly escalated and their bodyguards opened fire on each other, killing and wounding a number of them, the report claimed.The shootout at the presidential palace triggered rumours about Baradar’s death. But the Taliban leader, according to Bloomberg, wasn’t injured and left for Kandahar to speak to the group’s Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has not been seen in public for a long time. Since then, members of the Taliban have repeatedly rejected the reports of a clash even as Mullah Baradar got sidelined in the Taliban setup and a lesser-known Mullah Mohammad Hassan was appointed as the acting prime minister in the interim government.Baradar even appeared on state-run television to deny the reports of his death or injury.“Praise be to God, I am safe and sound,” he said. “Another statement made by the media that we have internal disputes is also completely not true.”The cabinet has no one from outside the Taliban, with members of the Haqqani family receiving four positions. The Taliban and Haqqani groups merged around 2016. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the US-designated terrorist, was appointed acting interior minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khalilurrahman-haqqani-punched-taliban-s-mullah-baradar-before-shootout-in-kabul-palace-report-101631881918511.html

Earth’s protective ozone layer depletes and forms a hole over the South pole every Spring due to the human-made chemicals.The atmospheric ozone absorbs the harmful portion of rays coming from the Sun to preserve life on the planet. The ozone hole located over regions with populations put them at risk of being exposed to unhealthy levels of ultraviolet radiation. CAMS constantly monitors the ozone layer to track the annual chemical destruction of ozone that leads to the formation of the hole.The ozone depletion at the start of this season was similar to that of last year’s but grew considerably in the last two weeks, becoming larger than 75% of ozone holes at that stage in the season since 1979. Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the CAMS, said in a statement that the ozone hole may continue to grow slightly over the next two or three weeks.“This year, the ozone hole developed as expected at the start of the season. It seems pretty similar to last year's, which also wasn't really exceptional until early September, but then turned into one of the largest and longest-lasting ozone holes in our data record later in the season,” Peuch said.“Now our forecasts show that this year´s hole has evolved into a rather larger than usual one,” he added.In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed which led to a ban on a group of chemicals called halocarbons that contain bromine which has high ozone-depleting potential (ODP). A number of commonly used chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) have been to be extremely damaging to the ozone layer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hole-in-ozone-layer-over-southern-hemisphere-larger-than-antarctica-scientists-say-101631880824413.html

Panjshir is the only province in Afghanistan which the Taliban have not been able to fully capture, though they claimed the same. The Northern Resistance Front claimed the fighting is still on and Ahmad Massoud is also seeking the help of the United States through a lobbyist in Washington.While reports claimed that Ahmad Massoud and Amrullah Saleh, the two leaders of teh Pajnhsir Resistance, are still in the valley, the villages of the province now lie deserted with mostly old men and livestock left behind, news agency AFP reported as it took a tour in the province. VIDEO: Ghost towns and old men in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley.Fighters in Panjshir vowed to battle the Taliban to the last man, but nearly two weeks after the hardline Islamists celebrated victory, parts of the rugged valley lie empty and abandoned pic.twitter.com/LLXCI489O9'Taliban do not want people to leave'Shops are closed and most of the provinces are under Taliban control who do not want residents to leave the valley so that they can have a human shield.Why are people leaving the only one Taliban-free area of the country?

"Their fighting was very weak. They could not resist us. They were defeated with the grace of God. All of their communication was taken out, and they surrendered to us.

The withdrawal of foreign troops has opened a new page in its history. But Afghanistan still faces many daunting challenges, and it needs the support and assistance of the international community, particularly countries in our region,” Xi Jinping said.“We SCO member states need to step up coordination, make full use of platforms such as the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group and facilitate a smooth transition in Afghanistan,” he said.“We (the SCO) need to encourage Afghanistan to put in place a broad-based and inclusive political framework, adopt prudent and moderate domestic and foreign policies, resolutely fight all forms of terrorism, live in amity with its neighbours and truly embark on a path of peace, stability and development,” Xi Jinping said in his speech.In the context of not interfering in another country’s domestic affairs, Xi said external forces should never be allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of countries under any pretext.“We must never allow any external interference in the domestic affairs of countries in our region under whatever pretext. In short, we should keep the future of our countries’ development and progress firmly in our own hands,” he said.Without naming the US or any western country, Xi Jinping said: “We should maintain firm confidence in our systems, reject condescending lecturing, and firmly support countries in exploring development paths and governance models that are compatible with their national conditions. We should support each other in steadily advancing important political agenda including domestic elections.”On the issue of terrorism, Xi Jinping said the SCO needs to uphold “common security”.“Faced with complex and fluid security dynamics in the region, we need to pursue common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and take tough actions against terrorism, separatism and extremism, including the East Turkestan Islamic Movement,” Xi Jinping said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sco-countries-should-help-afghanistan-xi-jinping-101631876244626.html

US president Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the new security pact on Wednesday under which America and Britain will provide Australia with the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines. Announcing the deal, Morrison said that Australia intends to build the submarines in Adelaide in close cooperation with the UK and the US.“But let me be clear: Australia is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons or establish a civil nuclear capability. And we will continue to meet all our nuclear non-proliferation obligations,” Morrison added.The surprise announcement, however, didn’t go down well with France which will reportedly lose nearly $100 billion deal to build diesel submarines for Australia. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian expressed “total incomprehension” at the announcement of the initiative, calling it a “stab in the back”.“It looks a lot like what Trump did,” he said.China has also reacted sharply to the new defence deal which is seen as a move to counter Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the region. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing that the Aukus treaty "seriously undermines regional peace and stability, intensifies the arms race, and harms international non-proliferation efforts.""This proves once again that these countries are using nuclear exports as a tool for geopolitical games,” he said.China is among the six countries to have nuclear-powered submarines as it continues to expand its fleet to assert its power in the Indo-Pacific. On the other hand, the United States has more nuclear submarines than all the other five countries combined, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Here’s the list of countries with nuclear-powered submarines:The latest deal will make Australia the seventh nation to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aukus-which-countries-have-nuclear-powered-submarines-101631871464236.html

The two diplomats met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Dushanbe, Tajikistan on Thursday.Wang Yi said both countries need to work together, maintain peace in the border areas and prevent the recurrence of incidents.S Jaishankar said India-China ties were “indispensable” and that New Delhi doesn’t believe in a “clash of civilisations”.The two diplomats last met in July during an SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in Dushanbe.Wang, according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement issued on Friday, said, “In the previous period, the communication between the diplomatic and military departments of the two countries was serious and effective, and the border situation between the two countries has generally developed in the direction of ease.“It is hoped that the Indian side will meet the Chinese side halfway, promoting the continued stability of the [border] situation, and gradually shift from emergency response to normalised management.”China and India should “work together to maintain peace in the border areas and prevent the recurrence of border incidents”, he said.The talks at the SCO summit in Dushanbe took place in the backdrop of the India-China border tensions, which despite the withdrawal of frontline forces from Pangong Lake and Gogra areas, continue to linger.Both sides still have tens of thousands of troops deployed on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as part of a stand-off that began in May last year.“It is necessary to consolidate the results of the disengagement of frontline forces and strictly abide by the agreements and consensus reached between the two countries. [China and India should] work together to maintain peace in the border areas and prevent the recurrence of border incidents,” Wang Yi said.The senior Chinese diplomat said both countries should adhere to the consensus “that they do not pose a threat to each other” and push cooperation back on track.The Chinese statement quoted S Jaishankar as saying that India and China have made progress in handling the border situation, while there were still some unresolved issues.“The Indian side is willing to work with China to abide by the bilateral agreement, promote the next round of the military commander-level meeting to achieve positive results, and earnestly maintain peace in the border area,” Jaishankar was quoted as saying.“The Indian side does not believe in the clash of civilisations and believes that it is very important for Asian countries to maintain unity. To achieve that, India-China cooperation is indispensable,” the Indian minister said.S Jaishankar said India is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China within the framework of the Brics and the SCO to jointly respond to global challenges such as combating terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-should-focus-on-normalised-management-of-border-wang-yi-at-sco-101631871314992.html

In a weekly press briefing, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar Ahmad termed Blinken's statement as "surprise," Pakistan's daily, Dawn reported. Ahmad also noted that Pakistan's positive role in the Afghan peace process and said that his country’s continued support for an inclusive political settlement had been "duly acknowledged", including by the US state department. He also highlighted Pakistan's role in the facilitation of the multinational evacuation effort from Afghanistan.“We are going to be looking at in the days and weeks ahead, the role that Pakistan has played over the last 20 years, but also the role that we would want to see it playing in the coming years,” Ahmad was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.This comes after Blinken told the Congress that the US will be looking at ties with Pakistan in the coming weeks to formulate the role America wants Islamabad to play in the future of Afghanistan. Blinken also sent an assertive message to Pakistan telling it to "line up" with the broad majority of nations to force the Taliban regime to uphold the basic rights of Afghan people, including women and children. Blinken also alleged that Pakistan has "harboured" members of the Taliban including the terrorists from the proscribed Haqqani network.Since the fall of Kabul last month, Pakistan has come under scrutiny and criticism over its alleged role in enabling the hardliner Taliban in Afghanistan. The group is designated as a terrorist group by the United States. Pakistan has had deep ties with the Taliban and other outfits in the region. The country is also accused of supporting the group and giving shelter to several wanted terrorists.Pakistan's intelligence chief Faiz Hameed visited the Afghan capital while the insurgents' leaders were in the process of forming their government. During the visit, Hameed was briefed by his country's ambassador about the escalating situation in Kabul. According to reports, he also met with Taliban officials during the visit.On September 7, hundreds of Afghan men and women held a demonstration against Pakistan and its alleged interference in Afghanistan's affairs. During the march, the protesters also shouted slogans like "Long live the resistance," and "Death to Pakistan."According to reports, at least three rallies were also held across Kabul in a show of resistance against the Taliban, known for their brutal and radical justice system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/surprised-pakistan-after-blinken-says-us-reassessing-ties-with-islamabad-101631865356316.html

17-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Liberal Party candidate halts campaign over sexual assault allegation||In a setback to Liberals’ federal elections campaign, one of its candidates from Toronto was asked to “pause campaigning” as the party investigated an allegation of sexual assault against him.That revelation came in a report from the daily Toronto Star on Thursday night. It reported that Kevin Vuong, the party nominee from the riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) of Spadina - Fort York was charged with sexual assault by an unidentified woman in 2019.According to the Star, Vuong “unequivocally” denied the charge and described them as “false”. However, he added, “I will be taking some time with my family.”Vuong actually faced the charge in court but it was withdrawn in November 2019. However, in an interview with the daily, the alleged victim said the incident occurred in April that year but she “didn’t have the energy” to undergo a trial in this regard. The alleged victim said she only became aware that Vuong was running as a candidate for the federal elections due on September 20 when she saw his picture on election signage after returning to Toronto recently.This is the second time allegations of sexual harassment have rocked the Liberal Party campaign. On September 4, after facing allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards staffers, Indo-Canadian MP Raj Saini announced that he had decided to end his run for re-election from Kitchener Centre.Since nominations for the elections were closed at the time, his exit left the party without a candidate in the riding. Saini had also described the allegations he faced as “unequivocally false” adding that he had “never acted inappropriately towards staff, volunteers or constituents.”While Vuong’s fate as a candidate is unclear, his potential departure may leave the Liberals minus a seat that it currently holds in the House of Commons. Vuong was nominated after incumbent Adam Vaughan didn’t seek re-election.According to his campaign website, Vuong, who is of Vietnamese origin and the son of refugees from the Vietnam War, “co-founded TakeCare Supply, which rapidly developed Canada’s first evidence-based reusable mask” after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-liberal-party-candidate-halts-campaign-over-sexual-assault-allegation-101631860214053.html

Grandi has said that even before the Taliban took over last month, more than 18 million Afghans, or about half the population, required humanitarian aid. More than 3.5 million Afghans were already displaced in a country that is battling drought and the Covid-19 pandemic.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-bats-for-taliban-says-should-be-given-time-to-run-afghanistan-101631859274063.html
17-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Barack Obama backs Justin Trudeau||Justin Trudeau’s electoral campaign on Thursday received an unexpected boost from his friend and former US president Barack Obama who backed him for another term. Former US president Barack Obama tweeted, “Wishing my friend Justin Trudeau the best in Canada’s upcoming election. Justin has been an effective leader and strong voice for democratic values, and I’m proud of the work we did together.” That boost came as Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau’s central theme for the 2021 federal elections of focusing on mandating vaccinations received more support as two holdout Western provinces Alberta and Saskatchewan announced plans for introducing vaccine passports. As cases in those provinces surged during the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, those developments will only provide momentum to the campaign of the incumbent Prime Minister to return to power in Ottawa, though the likelihood is he will again command a minority government.Across the country, daily cases rose by 3,957, to a total of 1,563,383. Alberta alone contributed 1,718 new cases. Starting September 20, the province will require those seeking to enter non-essential businesses, like restaurants and gyms, to provide proof of at least a dose of a vaccine, rising to both does on October 25.Alberta has been among the provinces opposing mandates in the past and Justin Trudeau immediately jumped into the conversation, tying principal rival Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole to Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. “Just a few days ago, Mr O’Toole was still applauding Kenney for his management of the pandemic. That’s at the heart of the choice Canadians need to make in this election,” Justin Trudeau said during a campaign stop in Montreal. Speaking in French, he added, “He’s not the right leader to put an end to this pandemic. Do we stand up even stronger in our fight against this pandemic, or do we give in to anti-vaxxers in the Conservative Party and go ahead with half-measures?” according to the outlet CBC News.Erin O’Toole has opposed mandates on the public service and on travelling domestically by air or train. Erin O’Toole and Jason Kenney were colleagues in the cabinet of former prime Minister Stephen Harper.But the platform of Trudeau’s management of Covid-19 has strengthened and is now the main issue of concern for Canadians ahead of voting on Monday. It has drowned out other issues like the economy, even though Statistics Canada reported this week that inflation was at a three-decade peak in the country. While Erin O’Toole is favoured in various surveys on fiscal matters, Justin Trudeau scores high on the pandemic, and the latter issue could prove decisive.But the Liberal Party is still not close to majority territory. According to the CBC Poll Tracker, it has 31.7% vote share translating to 150 seats, while the Conservatives are at 31.2% and 120 seats.In 2019, the ruling party garnered 157 seats, 13 short of the majority mark in the House of Commons while the Conservatives had 121.The poll tracker gave Justin Trudeau just a 12% chance of getting a majority with the likelihood of another minority at 59%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-barack-obama-backs-justin-trudeau-101631856553988.html
17-09-2021||World||IMF head, accused of influencing report in China's favour, risks undermined authority||Kristalina Georgieva risks seeing her authority as head of the International Monetary Fund undermined just weeks before an annual meeting of global finance chiefs, after being accused of influencing a report in China’s favor when she worked at the World Bank.Georgieva on Thursday said that she “fundamentally” disagreed with the finding -- by an outside law firm engaged by the World Bank -- that she had applied pressure on the bank’s staff to boost China’s ranking in an economic report. She informed the IMF board of the allegations on Thursday and will be addressing the fund’s staff Friday, according to people familiar with the matter.The substance of the charge -- putting “undue pressure” on World Bank staff to adjust the rating in the “Doing Business” report when she served as the chief executive officer – was the latest in a series of scandals that have plagued the troubled report in recent years. So beleaguered, subjective, and controversial is the methodology for the report, which measures the ease and transparency of operating in an economy, that the World Bank announced it will stop producing it.But for Georgieva, 68, the scrutiny may only be starting.The ranking that she is accused of pressuring staff to improve is that of China, a magnet for criticism in Washington over everything from trade to geopolitics. The US Treasury sees the accusations as serious and is “analyzing the report,” the department said; the US holds veto power over major IMF and World Bank decisions. Republican lawmakers could use the issue to renew criticism of an expansion in IMF resources under Georgieva’s leadership.‘Pretty Damning’Justin Sandefur, a senior fellow and World Bank watcher at the Center for Global Development, a think-tank, said the report could end up affecting her relationship with IMF members.“The IMF is in charge of ensuring the integrity of international macroeconomic statistics and holding countries to account for the integrity of their data,” Sandefur said in an interview. “This report just has Georgieva red-handed actively involved in the manipulation of data for geopolitical purposes. That seems pretty damning.”The episode offers a rare window into how China has exerted influence on the leaders of international financial institutions in recent years, and how reactive those senior officials have been to sensibilities in Beijing.The World Bank-commissioned report, penned by lawyers at WilmerHale, goes out of its way to exonerate China from having done anything wrong. “To be clear our review should not be read to imply that there was any inappropriate conduct on behalf of any Chinese or other government officials,” they wrote.China EngagementGeorgieva was serving as the bank’s CEO under Jim Yong Kim, who was nominated by President Barack Obama and spent much of his tenure as president of the World Bank conducting geopolitics, often by necessity. He worked hard to build a relationship with both China and the rival to his own institution that it had established -- the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.Kim’s current employer, an investment fund called Global Infrastructure Partners, didn’t respond to a request for comment on Thursday’s report.The politics have only become more difficult as China has grown increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping and as the relationship between Washington and Beijing has grown tenser on a number of fronts, including trade and economics.Paul Romer, the Nobel winner who was the World Bank’s chief economist until he left in early 2018 -- after falling out with Kim and Georgieva -- said in an interview that China had often applied pressure on bank staff to alter draft reports. It was his parting criticism of the “Doing Business” process, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, that led to the investigation into the report and the politics surrounding it.Read More: World Bank Corrects Country Rankings After Probe of Altered DataChina’s position in the 2018 report, released in October 2017, should have been seven places lower -- at No. 85 rather than 78 -- the World Bank said in a review released last December. Kim and Georgieva had influenced a reworking of the rating, WillmerHale found.“You couldn’t have engineered a more embarrassing collection of facts for Kristalina vis-a-vis critics of the fund on Capitol Hill,” said Sandefur.IMF IntegrityGeorgieva, the first head of the IMF to hail from an emerging market -- Bulgaria -- has been overseeing a historic expansion in the reserve assets of IMF members, of $650 billion, meant to help countries deal with mounting debt and the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. Republican lawmakers have criticized the move in part as a reward to undemocratic nations, including China. GOP Representative Andy Barr of Kentucky in a statement late Thursday called the report “alarming” and urged the Treasury to “evaluate” Georgieva’s actions in the run-up to the allocation of that money, known as special drawing rights, in light of the report’s findings. “Ensuring integrity at the IMF is essential,” Barr said.According to the report and one person familiar with the events, Georgieva took charge of what was seen within the bank as an unusual intervention on China’s behalf. In the past, senior staff had done their best not to intervene with the team overseeing the “Doing Business” report for fear of violating internal rules, the person familiar with what happened said.Premier’s GrumbleIt also came at a time of intense sensitivity in China about the “Doing Business” rankings. Earlier that year Li Keqiang, the premier, had grumbled about China’s poor showing, triggering a surge in domestic efforts to improve its performance. Those efforts were too late to affect the 2018 standings, though they later paid off. In the 2020 rankings, China finished 31st, ahead of France.The issue was raised at least twice in dinners Kim had with senior Chinese officials during visits that year, according to the person familiar with the events. They also were raised by Chinese officials with Georgieva during a visit she made as part of the China Development Forum.On the World Bank’s side, they also came as Kim and Georgieva were engaged in delicate negotiations with China, the US, and other members to raise the bank’s capital. In the end, China accepted both a smaller shareholding in the bank than it sought and higher interest rates on bank loans it received as part of a plan to defuse opposition from the Trump administration.The episode detailed in the report highlighted an inherent tension in leading the Washington-based IMF and World Bank, Romer said. Both are institutions where the leaders have to be shrewd diplomats to both wins and keep their jobs -- which increasingly means securing the approval of Beijing as well as Washington.‘Worth Reading’Yet those necessary politics can be at odds with their missions to be scrupulously independent keepers of important data and analysis. That means the latest episode will have a cost to the credibility of not just the World Bank but also the IMF, Romer said.By tradition under an unwritten transatlantic agreement, Europe has selected the managing directors of the IMF while the US chooses presidents of the World Bank. Georgieva is the second woman to have run the IMF, following current European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. Attention on the WilmerHale report is unlikely to go away quickly, according to longtime observers of the fund’s politics.“The full report is worth reading, it’s quite something,” Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think tank, wrote on Twitter. “Some remarkable actions” by Georgieva, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-head-accused-of-influencing-report-in-china-s-favour-risks-undermined-authority-101631848354168.html
17-09-2021||World||‘Making Taliban great again’: Biden portrayed as terrorist on US billboards||Weeks after the US completed its withdrawal of troops from war-torn Afghanistan, ending nearly 20 years of combat, a bunch of billboards have now popped up across Pennsylvania – portraying US president Joe Biden as a Taliban terrorist and displaying the slogan “Making the Taliban great again”. According to reports, the billboard ads were commissioned by former Pennsylvania senator Scott Wagner, who rented out a dozen billboards across highways at a cost of about $15,000 to display a message that reflected his anger over the US response to the Afghanistan situation.Also Read | Afghanistan on brink of collapse, Taliban fighters surviving on donation: Report“What do you say to those veterans [who fought in the Afghanistan war]?” Wagner told the York Daily Record, reflecting on the pullout of US troops in Afghanistan. “It's like Vietnam, even worse.”A billboard has popped up along I-83 in York County, Pennsylvania, showing President Joe Biden in a military outfit with the phrase “Making the Taliban Great Again.” Here's who put it up. https://t.co/C3rBY1B33M pic.twitter.com/krhceWrh4xFormer Pennsylvania State Senator @realScottWagner Scott Wagner paid for a billboard in York, Pennsylvania that depicts President Biden in Afghan garb holding an RPG, with the heading, “Making the Taliban great again!” pic.twitter.com/fhZzFFzSi6The York Daily Record reports that the former senator met a number of veterans, who served the United States in its longest war in Afghanistan, over the years. Wagner said many of these soldiers sacrificed their entire beings – limbs and psyche – for the cause, adding that he is not shy of mocking the recent “chaotic” withdrawal in such a ‘provocative’ manner.The phrase “Making the Taliban great again” is a play on former US president Donald Trump's now-infamous election campaign slogan and a rallying cry for his supporters – “Make America Great Again”. The image with Joe Biden dressed in Taliban garb and holding a rocket launcher is meant to blame the US president for the messy situation that has developed in Afghanistan following the exit of the United States and its allies from the war-torn land.The former Pennsylvania senator, however, clarified that he is no Trump supporter, and would have similarly dissed the former US president had he pulled out of Afghanistan. “If Trump had done the same thing, he'd be looking the same way,” said Wagner, bluntly.It has been a month since the Afghan capital of Kabul fell to the Taliban, following the lightning-fast offensive which won the group control of the state machinery in the war-torn land. Afghanistan watchers and political commentators across the world were stunned by the Taliban blitzkrieg, which coincided with the withdrawal of the United States and allied troops from the country at the end of a nearly 20-year war. The militants made rapid territorial gains in a little over three months' time, as they captured one provincial capital after another; eventually, Kabul fell to the offensive on August 15, 2021.Also Read | Frozen economy, confined rights: 10 changes in Afghanistan in 30 days of Taliban ruleThe sheer tempo of the Taliban takeover surprised many in the international community, and the aftermath reflected widespread domestic and global ramifications regarding human rights and concerns regarding the proliferation of terrorism.

17-09-2021||World||Covid-19: As UK prepares to vaccinate kids, a study looks into mixed dosage||A British study will look into the immune responses of children to mixed schedules of different Covid-19 vaccines as officials try to determine the best approach to second doses in adolescents given a small risk of heart inflammation.Children aged 12-15 in Britain will be vaccinated from next week, while those aged 16-17 have been eligible for shots since August.However, while the children will be offered a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, officials have said that advice about second doses will be given at a later date, while more data is gathered.Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) initially declined to recommend shots for all 12- to 15-year-olds, citing uncertainty over the long-term impact of myocarditis, a rare side effect of mRNA-based vaccines such as Pfizer's. The heart condition typically resolves itself with mild short-term consequences, health experts have said.Hong Kong has advised children only get one shot, owing to similar concerns over heart inflammation.The study, called Com-COV3, will test different vaccine schedules in 12- to 16-year-olds, looking at the immune responses and milder side effects."The concern here is about the risks of myocarditis, particularly with the second dose with Pfizer vaccine in young men," the trial's lead researcher, Matthew Snape of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told reporters."This will provide the JCVI with information crucial to informing their advice about immunising teenagers in the UK," he said.The trial will give all participants a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. That will be followed eight weeks later by either a second full dose or a half dose of the Pfizer shot, a full dose of Novavax's vaccine, or a half dose of Moderna's shot.The trial is recruiting 360 volunteers, not large enough to directly assess the myocarditis risk of the different combinations, which Snape said was 1 in 15,000 after two doses of the Pfizer shot in young men.But, he added, it "would be reassuring to see if there was a lower inflammatory response after one of these changes compared to Pfizer (followed by) Pfizer," and that it might be "reasonable to infer that the risks of myocarditis might be lower" in such an instance.Snape is running another arm of the trial in adults, giving mixed vaccine schedules both four and 12 weeks apart, and comparing the responses. He said the results of that would be coming "very shortly".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-as-uk-prepares-to-vaccinate-kids-a-study-looks-into-mixed-dosage-101631845194218.html

Her groundbreaking research made Michiyo Tsujimura the first woman in Japan to earn a doctorate in agriculture. Tsujimura’s research focused on the health properties of green tea, a widelywor popular drink in today's times.Born in 1888 in what is now Okegawa in Saitama Prefecture of Japan, Tsujimura started her career as an unpaid laboratory assistant at Hokkaido Imperial University. This was at the time when the university did not even accept female students.A few years later, Tsujimura transferred to Tokyo Imperial University and started researching the biochemistry of green tea. She also worked with Dr Umetaro Suzuki famous for his discovery of vitamin B1. Their joint research revealed that green tea contained significant amounts of vitamin C—the first of many yet unknown molecular compounds in green tea that awaited under the microscope.Tsujimura isolated the flavonoid catechin—the bitter ingredient of tea—in 1929 and a year later she extracted tannin in crystal form from green tea. In 1932, her findings on the constituents of green tea, titled "On the Chemical Components of Green Tea", led her to graduate as Japan’s first woman doctor of agriculture from Tokyo Imperial University.In 1949, Tsujimura also made history as an educator and spent long years of her career as a University professor. She was a professor at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School from 1950 and was the school's first dean of the Faculty of Home Economics.In 1956, Tsujimura was awarded the Japan Prize of Agricultural Science for her green tea research. She was also conferred with the Order of the Precious Crown of the Fourth Class in 1968.Michiyo Tsujimura died in 1969 at the age of 81.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-honours-michiyo-tsujimura-in-today-s-doodle-101631838358959.html
17-09-2021||World||Texas judge quashes US govt bid for earlier hearing on Abortion law||A federal judge in Texas denied a US Justice Department request to move up a hearing on whether the state’s restrictive new abortion law should be put on hold while the government challenges the ban in a lawsuit.The Biden administration had argued that an Oct. 1 hearing on its motion for a temporary restraining order against the law should be moved to Sept. 21 because women are already being put at risk. But US District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin denied the request Thursday.“This case presents complex, important questions of law that merit a full opportunity for the parties to present their positions to the court,” Pitman, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said in a one-paragraph order.The law, which took effect Sept. 1, bans most abortions in Texas after six weeks of pregnancy, without exceptions for rape or incest. It also allows members of the public to sue abortion providers suspected of breaking the law and provides for bounties of $10,000 per illegal procedure.After Pitman scheduled the Oct. 1 hearing, the Justice Department filed a motion to expedite the arguments, saying women in Texas couldn’t wait that long to find out if the law would be put on hold during the litigation.“Providers in Texas confirmed that many patients have already been forced to travel hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles to obtain an abortion out of state,” the Justice Department said in its request. “This includes a minor who was raped by a family member and had to travel eight hours from Galveston to Oklahoma in order to obtain an abortion.”Texas lawmakers argue abortions should not be allowed after a fetal heartbeat is detected, while civil rights activist point out that most women do not know there are pregnant until weeks later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-judge-quashes-us-govt-bid-for-earlier-hearing-on-abortion-law-101631833615477.html
17-09-2021||World||IMF chief Georgieva says did not alter World Bank report to appease China||IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva on Thursday disputed an independent investigation which found that in her previous job at the World Bank, she pressed staff to alter a report to avoid angering China.Based on the findings, the World Bank announced that it was immediately discontinuing its Doing Business report after the investigation found irregularities in the 2018 and 2020 editions.Georgieva, a Bulgarian national who took the helm of the IMF in October 2019, rejected its conclusions regarding her role."I disagree fundamentally with the findings and interpretations of the Investigation of Data Irregularities as it relates to my role in the World Bank's Doing Business report of 2018," she said in a statement.The allegations could damage her reputation, and provide grist for long-time US critics of the multilateral organizations and their treatment of China."These are serious findings," the US Treasury said in a statement, noting that it is "analyzing the report.""Our primary responsibility is to uphold the integrity of international financial institutions," the statement said.Georgieva said she briefed the IMF board on the situation. The board is expected to meet to discuss the issue but it is unclear when.Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development, who has written extensively about the problems with the report's methodology, said, "We need to hear her side of the story, but it doesn't look great right now.""The IMF is in charge of monitoring the integrity of macroeconomic and financial data internationally, and for the head of the IMF to have been involved in data manipulation is pretty damning allegation," he told AFP. "That does seem like a real hit on on their credibility."Changing China's rankingThe flagship report ranks countries based on their business regulations and economic reforms, and has caused governments to jockey for a higher spot to attract investors.According to the investigation, Beijing complained about its ranking of 78th on the list in 2017, and the next year's report would have shown Beijing dropping even further.The Washington-based development lender's staff was preparing the 2018 edition while leadership engaged in sensitive negotiations to increase its lending capital, which hinged on an agreement with China and the United States.In the final weeks before the report was released at the end of October 2017, the World Bank's then-president Jim Kim and Georgieva, at the time the bank's CEO, asked staff to look into updating the methodology in regard to China, according to the investigation by law firm WilmerHale.Kim discussed the rankings with senior Chinese officials who were dismayed by the country's ranking, and his aides raised the issue of how to improve it, according to the summary of the probe, released by the World Bank.It is considered one of Kim's signature achievements that he shepherded a deal for a $13 billion increase in World Bank resources.The bargain required support from the US president at the time Donald Trump, who opposed concessional lending to China, and from Beijing, which agreed to pay more for loans.Amid the pressure from upper management, staff changed some of the input data, which boosted China's ranking in 2018 by seven places to 78 -- the same as it was the previous year, according to the investigation that analyzed 80,000 documents and interviewed more than three dozen current and former employees of the lender.'For multilateralism'Georgieva chastised a World Bank senior official for "mishandling the Bank's relationship with China and failing to appreciate the importance of the Doing Business report to the country," the report said.After the changes were made, she thanked him for "doing his part for multilateralism."Georgieva later visited the home of the manager in charge of the report to retrieve a copy, and thanked them for helping to "resolve the problem."Paul Romer, a Nobel Prize winner who served as the World Bank's chief economist at the time, resigned in January 2018 after telling a reporter that the methodology for the ranking had been changed in a way that could give the impression political considerations affected the results.At the time, the World Bank strenuously denied any political influence over the rankings.The investigation also found "improper changes" in the 2020 report affecting the rankings of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan.Nadia Daar, head of Oxfam International's Washington DC Office, applauded the decision to scrap the report, saying the index "encouraged governments to adopt destructive policies that worsen inequality."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-chief-georgieva-says-did-not-alter-world-bank-report-to-appease-china-101631833359700.html
17-09-2021||World||Gabby Petito's disappearance grips US; search intensifies||Police video shows a Florida woman who disappeared during a cross-country journey in a converted camper van had an emotional fight with her boyfriend in a Utah tourist town before she vanished.The video released by the Moab Police Department shows that an officer pulled over the van on Aug. 12 after it was seen speeding and hit a curb near the entrance to Arches National Park.Inside was Brian Laundrie, 23, and his 22-year-old girlfriend, Gabrielle “Gabby” Petito, who was reported missing by her family a month later and is now the subject of a nationwide search joined by the FBI.Police in North Port, Florida, where the couple lived, say Laundrie is a “person of interest" in her case. He's not been charged, but he's also not cooperating.North Port Police Chief Todd Garrison publicly vented his frustration over his lack of help on Wednesday, pleading for Laundrie's lawyer to arrange a conversation. “Two people left on a trip and one person returned!” the chief's tweet said.The body camera video shows Petito visibly upset when an officer approached them.“We’ve just been fighting this morning. Some personal issues,” she tells him, adding that she suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder that affects her behavior.“Some days, I have really bad OCD, and I was just cleaning and straightening up and I was apologizing to him saying that I’m so mean because sometimes I have OCD and get frustrated,” she said.Laundrie says on the video the couple got into a minor scuffle that began when he climbed into the van with dirty feet, and said he didn't want to pursue a domestic violence charge against Petito, who officers decided was the aggressor.“I’m not going to pursue anything because she is my fiancée and I love her. It was just a squabble. Sorry it had to get so public,” Laundrie says.Ultimately Moab police decided not file any charges and instead separated the couple for the night, with Laundrie checking into a motel and Petito remaining with the converted sleeper van.Petito and Laundrie started their drive across the US in July from New York's Long Island, where both grew up. They intended to reach Oregon by Halloween according to their social media accounts, but Petito vanished after her last known contact with family in late August from Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, authorities said.Laundrie drove the Ford Transit van back to Florida on Sept. 1 alone, police said. Petito's family filed a missing persons report last Saturday with police in Suffolk County, New York.Petito's parents released a letter through their attorney on Thursday to Laundrie's parents, asking them to help investigators locate Petito, despite their instinct to protect their son.“We believe you know the location of where Brian left Gabby,” the letter said. “We beg you to tell us. As a parent, how could you let us go through this pain and not help us? As a parent, how could you put Gabby’s younger brothers and sisters through this?”Laundrie's attorney, Steven Bertolino, said the Laundrie family is hoping for Petito's safe return, but he's asked them not to speak with investigators."I can’t speculate as to why he’s not talking, but he has the pieces to the puzzle that we need to find Gabby,” Garrison said Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”Garrison said at a news conference Thursday that the investigation remains a missing persons case, not a murder probe, and that no intensive searches have begun because it's unclear exactly where authorities might look.“We're still trying to nail down geographic areas,” the chief said. “There's a lot of information we are going through. Our focus is to find Gabby.”The missing woman's father, Joe Petito, also appeared at the news conference to urge anyone with knowledge about his daughter to come forward.“What I want from everybody here is help. Whatever you can do to make sure my daughter comes home, I’m asking you to help. Nothing else matters right now,” Joe Petito said.Authorities are also looking for any possible connection between Petito's disappearance and the still-unsolved slaying of two women who were fatally shot at a campsite near Moab.Their bodies were found Aug. 18, six days after the incident between Laundrie and Petito. The two women, Kylen Schulte, 24, and Crystal Turner, 38, had told friends they feared a “creepy man” they had seen nearby might harm them.“They're looking into that potential connection,” said Joshua Taylor, public information officer for North Port police. “I have not heard of any information that links these two cases together. I understand the timing is suspicious. You never know. I'm not going to say we've ruled it out.”Petito and Laundrie were childhood sweethearts on Long Island before moving in 2019 to live with his parents in North Port, about 34 miles (54 kilometers) south of Sarasota.An eight-minute YouTube video titled “Van Life: Beginning our Van Life Journey” features happy and romantic scenes from the couple’s trip.Petito is white, 5-foot-5 (1.6 meters) and about 110 pounds (50 kilograms), with blonde hair and blue eyes, police said. She has several tattoos including one on a forearm that reads, “let it be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gabby-petito-s-disappearance-grips-us-search-intensifies-101631832983878.html

After his one year in office, party members are keen for a fresh face the carry them to victory in general elections expected within two months.The popular Kono, whose resume is studded with jobs including the foreign and defence portfolios, faces off against former foreign minister Fumio Kishida https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-vaccines-minister-kono-favoured-next-pm-opinion-polls-2021-09-13, Sanae Takaichi, who held the internal affairs ministry post, and Seiko Noda, a former minister for gender equality.Unlike in last year's race, grassroots LDP members will join lawmakers in casting ballots.The media-savvy, US-educated Kono, at 58 on the younger side for a Japanese premier, is widely seen as the frontrunner due to his popularity with the public, who regularly choose him as their favourite for prime minister. Investors have also recently warmed to Kono at Kishida's expense.His chances were bolstered this week when LDP heavyweight Shigeru Ishiba, who is popular with the party rank and file and had been considering his own candidacy, threw his support behind Kono.But Kono has a reputation as a maverick, and elders in the faction-ridden LDP may favour the soft-spoken Kishida, 64, who hails from one of the party's move dovish factions, due to perceptions he may be better than Kono at building consensus.Takaichi, 60, who is aiming to become Japan's first female premier, is a disciple of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving premier, and a member of the LDP's most conservative wing.Noda, 60, who joined the race on Thursday after winning the support of the required 20 lawmakers to throw her hat in the ring, is seen as a long shot. But she but could have an outsized impact on the race by making it harder for one candidate to win a majority in the first round.On economic policy, where Japan is struggling to recover from successive waves of the coronavirus, Kono wants any further stimulus to prioritise renewable energy and expansion of 5G networks, while Kishida says Japan should strive for a new form of capitalism to reduce income disparity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taro-kono-seen-as-top-contender-as-japan-pm-race-set-to-begin-101631832448761.html

17-09-2021||India||In high court, Haryana Police blame farmers for Karnal violence||Chandigarh: Haryana Police blamed farmers for the violence that broke out during a protest against three central laws on August 28 in Karnal town and asked the Punjab and Haryana high court to direct cultivators to not block highways during their events. In an affidavit, the police also claimed that a controversial clip, where then Karnal sub-divisional magistrate Ayush Sinha could be heard telling police to “break the heads” of protesters, was shot 13km from the main protest site.“The petitioners talk about the right to protest but right cannot be enjoyed at the cost of right to freedom of movement and right to life and liberty,” the police said. The affidavit was filed by inspector general of police (IGP), Karnal range, Mamta Singh, in response to a plea seeking judicial inquiry and alleging that Sinha’s instructions violated fundamental rights. On August 28, around 10 protesters were hurt in clashes with police in Karnal as farmers tried to march towards the venue of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meeting, in which chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and other senior state leaders were present. Farm leaders claimed that a protester died later, an allegation rejected by the administration. At the time, farmers had blocked the Ambala-Delhi highway.Hours after the clashes, a video clip showed Sinha purportedly instructing a group of policemen: “Hit them hard…We shall not allow this cordon to be breached. We have enough force available. No one should break the cordon and reach me. If someone does, make sure he has a broken head.” The IAS officer alleged the video was edited and consisted only of selected portions of his overall instructions to the police.The controversy later sparked a tense standoff between farmers and the administration outside the mini secretariat in Karnal, which was only resolved on September 11 when the administration agreed to a judicial probe into the incident. In the affidavit, police say farmers were supposed to protest in Karnal city on August 28 but around 800 cultivators gathered at Bastara toll plaza, which is 13 km from the city and allegedly surrounded the vehicle of state Bharatiya Janata Party chief, Om Prakash Dhankar, and sat on a dharna.Police claimed that farmers were armed with sticks, iron rods and farm equipment, and attacked security forces with spades. Police said four farmers were injured against 24 policemen, and the lathi charge was done in response to stone pelting by farmers.Police also told the court that the video showing Sinha was filmed 13km from the toll plaza, where lathi charge occurred and that no policemen from there had joined the force at the plaza.The 2018-batch IAS officer has since been transferred out of Karnal and posted as additional secretary of Citizen Resources Information Department (CRID), as per a government order.Jagdip Singh Aulakh, BKU (Charuni) Karnal district president, who was leading the protest at Karnal’s Bastara toll plaza, said: “In the morning we held a meeting the officials of Karnal district administration and they allowed us to hold the protest peacefully but on the morning the SDM Ayush Sinha also reached at Bastara toll plaza and asked us not hold protest and told is that he has orders not to allow farmers to reach Karnal, where the BJP was going hold a meeting. Even, BJP’s state president’s vehicle left one hour before the lathicharge and it doesn’t not have any relevance with the lathicharge”He said the police was told to lathicharge even with out using water cannons or tear gas. Aulakh said the Gharaunda SDM, Pooja Bharti, was on duty at the toll plaza but there are videos that purportedly showed Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha also sent to the toll plaza despite he was duty magistrate of Karnal city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-high-court-haryana-police-blame-farmers-for-karnal-violence-101631903126991.html

17-09-2021||India||Essay writing competition on PM Narendra Modi in Gujarat schools||Ahmedabad: As part of the celebrations on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday on Friday, primary education officers of all districts in Gujarat issued identical circulars to government and aided schools to organize an essay writing competition on the theme, “My Favourite PM is Narendra Modi”.The circular was issued by district primary education officers September 14, a day after the new chief minister Bhupendra Patel took oath of office. HT has reviewed the circular.The circular asked all district primary schools to ensure that at least 10 students participate in the essay competition and required education officers to make a list of all participants and schools, and then rank the top three performers. The results will be declared on Saturday.It added that the decision to hold the essay competition was taken by the Gujarat Rajya Baal Adhikar Sanrakshan Aayog (Gujarat State Child Rights Protection Commission). The circular cited a meeting over video conference that took place earlier on Tuesday asking schools to conduct the essay competition. The competition was held for students of Classes 5 to 8.A similar circular was also issued by municipal corporations to municipal schools in cities.“We just followed the instructions from the child rights commission,” a senior government official said on conditions of anonymity.Gujarat Congress’ chief spokesperson Manish Doshi said holding such an essay competition for a living national leader was “too much”. “In this case, there is no space for opinion and the children have been asked to do write-ups praising the current prime minister. There are no choices at all,” he said.Political analyst Ghanshyam Shah said, “We must understand that Gujarat and now the country are ruled through bureaucracy. Narendra Modi introduced this, and so even before the politicians -- in this case the new chief minister -- figured out governance, the bureaucracy was already on the job.”Earlier on Monday morning, Gujarat Bharatiya Janata Party president CR Patil also unveiled a 71-foot cutout of PM Narendra Modi at Rajdhani Township, a residential colony, on the Mehsana-Radhanpur highway. The event was attended by newly appointed minister of state Manisha Vakil and members of parliament Shardaben Patel and Jugalji Thakore.The party also organised several events including planting 71,000 saplings and 71 open heart surgeries as part of the PM’s birthday celebrations, according to a party statement.Besides this, as many as 71 open heart surgeries were performed on needy children at the Shri Satya Sai Hospital on the Sarkhej-Dholka highway near Ahmedabad, In the evening, folk artist Sairam Dave performed under a Namotsav cultural event, the BJP statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/essay-writing-competition-on-pm-narendra-modi-in-gujarat-schools-101631900968249.html

"Every Indian would be proud of today's record vaccination numbers. I acknowledge our doctors, innovators, administrators, nurses, healthcare and all front-line workers who have toiled to make the vaccination drive a success. Let us keep boosting vaccination to defeat COVID-19," PM Modi tweeted hailing the achievement.

What we will see is local flare-ups where there are unprotected populations and where the virus has not been before," Kang said.The second wave of coronavirus in the country between March and May killed thousands and infected lakhs, overwhelming the health infrastructure. "Are we done with Covid? No we are not. Are we going to be done with Covid? Not anytime in the near future," she added. Kang, a professor with Christian Medical College, Vellore, was speaking in a virtual event at the CII Lifesciences Conclave.Last month, Manindra Agrawal, a scientist with IIT-Kanpur who is in the three-member team of experts tasked to project the surge in cases, had said the country may see a third wave peaking between October-November if a more virulent mutant of coronavirus emerges by SeptembeKang said the Indian vaccine industry has been absolutely phenomenal in dealing with the pandemic, but it still has a long way to go. "I can't say the same thing (about the regulatory system) as people know about our regulatory systems. But it is something we should use as a lesson for the future because we really really need informed, strong regulators that work with industries to show what is required," she said.Kang also stressed the need for a translational research ecosystem of clinical researchers that are willing to take risk, and are supported by the government and academia.She said new technologies carry risks and there is a need for a regulatory system that is prepared for clinical risks."We need the academic medical environments that work with the industry to make sure that we can safely test these interventions in people. We do not have this at this time so strengthening regulation is key."She said surveillance diagnostics is still dependent very heavily on imports. The routine PCR kits are being made by many companies in the country but the best laboratories are not yet using those tests, she observed.  "We have to recognise that we need to be thinking about the quality of what we use so that we use what we make in diagnostics just as we do in vaccines and in drugs and in terms of sequencing," she said. In another seminar during the conclave, Krishna Ella, Chairman & Managing Director of Bharat Biotech said Indian vaccine manufacturers have tremendously contributed globally as two of the three children across the world are jabbed by Indian vaccines. He said the Indian industry was more focused on children's vaccines, and the shift is happening towards adult vaccines. "We need clinical trial centers across the country and have partnerships with countries all over the world especially in South East Asia, Africa, and Latin America," he said."The access to supply chain for reusables, re-agents in biologics and manufacturing is imperative, and it is important that we indigenise a lot of these requirements, so we don't have any supply chain disruptions," Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Executive Chairperson & Founder Biocon said. She added, "The future belongs to biotech, bioscience and biopharma and we need to invest right now. We need to create a conducive environment to provide the necessary risk capital to scale up. This would require specialised venture funds."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-covid-wave-will-not-be-as-devastating-as-second-if-top-vaccinologist-101631899228793.html
17-09-2021||India||Misinformation by Oppn led to vaccine hesitancy in India: Union minister Puri||Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday continued to attack opposition parties over spreading misinformation which led to hesitancy in taking the vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India.Addressing reporters on Friday, Puri lauded the current ongoing vaccination drive and said, “The opposition parties were spreading misinformation that led to vaccine hesitancy. It is a matter of real happiness that we are manufacturing vaccines in large numbers. Vaccination drive has reached maturity.”On Thursday, the Union minister alleged that opposition parties resorted to false narratives and succeeded in creating vaccine hesitancy which the Centre had to face. He reminded them (opposition) that Covid-19 is the real enemy and not their political opponents. Puri also said vaccination was happening at record speed at present and the numbers would go up substantially in the coming months.Previously, several leaders of the opposition, including the likes of Congress’ Jairam Ramesh, Shashi Tharoor, Digvijaya Singh and Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav among others had questioned the Centre’s vaccination programme.In December 2020, Digvijaya Singh stated that India should not be made an experiment lab and the citizens should not be made guinea pigs for vaccine trials.After the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) gave emergency use approval to Serum Institute’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin on January 3, Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Shashi Tharoor doubted the approval given to Bharat Biotech vaccine.To this, Union minister Puri said in January that both leaders of the Congress were in-house cynics, adding they were unhappy that the two vaccines to get DCGI’s approval were made in India.Authorities have so far administered more than 770 million doses to eligible beneficiaries. On Friday, a record number of over 200 million doses were given on the occasion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 71st birthday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misinformation-by-oppn-led-to-vaccine-hesitancy-in-india-union-minister-puri-101631895943676.html

What is there in his channel?||Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday said that he earns ₹4 lakh per month from YouTube as his viewership skyrocketed during the pandemic. "Viewership of my YouTube channel increased and YouTube now pays me ₹4 lakh per month as royalty," the minister said laughing at an event where he was reviewing the progress of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway in Bharuch. He never imagined that his speeches will garner so many views and that they will be translated into money, the minister said.The minister said that during the lockdown he started cooking and giving lectures through video conferences. He was invited by international organisations, universities to deliver speeches virtually and all those videos were uploaded on his YouTube channel."I became a chef and started cooking at home and giving lectures through video conference. I delivered more than 950 lectures online, including lectures to foreign universities students, which were uploaded on YouTube," he said.Watch: Nitin Gadkari shares how much earns from YouTube and his lockdown lessonsA quick look at Nitin Gadkari's YouTube channel reveals that the channel is a compendium of all his speeches -- be it a press conference, or an interview with a channel, or a live address from a public meeting. And the channel goes back to six years before though at that time the Union minister's activity on YouTube was limited. Only a few videos of the minister inaugurating a project or replying to a question in Parliament used to be uploaded on his channel. The activity picked up a pace in the last two years and now he has 206K subscribers.In July this year, he also uploaded a video on himself titled 'Things to know about Nitin Gadkari' where he has been described as a visionary leader with an impressive track record. "When all industries were shut in the pandemic, Gadkari empathised with people by conducting over 800 webinars," the video said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-nitin-gadkari-earns-rs-4-lakh-from-youtube-what-is-there-in-his-channel-101631897633276.html

17-09-2021||India||Indian, Chinese officials to meet again soon to discuss remaining issues of LAC standoff||India and China have agreed that their military and diplomatic officials should meet again for discussions on speedily resolving remaining issues related to the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the external affairs ministry said on Friday after a meeting of foreign ministers of the two countries. A readout issued by China’s foreign ministry after the meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Dushanbe was silent on further meetings and only spoke of consolidating the “disengagement results of the frontline troops”. Jaishankar said in a set of tweets he had discussed disengagement in the border areas with Wang, and “underlined that progress in this regard is essential for restoration of peace and tranquillity, which is the basis for development of bilateral ties”. This was the first meeting between the two ministers since July 14, when they had held talks on the sidelines of a meeting of SCO foreign ministers in Dushanbe. After several rounds of military and diplomatic talks, India and China withdrew frontline troops and armoured units from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February. In August, the two sides ended forward deployments at Gogra and dismantled all temporary structures in this area. India has linked disengagement at other friction points on the LAC, including Hot Spring and Depsang, to the overall normalisation of bilateral relations. China, however, has said the LAC standoff should be delinked from other aspects of relations between the two sides. The external affairs ministry’s statement issued on Friday quoted Jaishankar as saying it “was necessary to ensure progress in resolution of remaining issues so as to restore peace and tranquillity along the LAC”. It added, “In this regard, the ministers agreed that military and diplomatic officials of the two sides should meet again and continue their discussions to resolve the remaining issues at the earliest.” Jaishankar also recalled Wang had said at their last meeting on July 14 that India-China relations “were at low ebb”, and that both sides had agreed a “prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of the either side as it was impacting the relationship in a negative manner”. The Chinese foreign ministry’s readout quoted Wang as saying that China has “always been positive” to seek a solution to the standoff and that the “overall situation in the border area was gradually de-escalated” because of recent communication between diplomatic and military officials. Wang hoped that “India will meet China halfway to move the situation towards stability and shift it from urgent dispute settlement to regular management and control”. The readout added that both sides “need to consolidate the disengagement results of the frontline troops, and strictly abide by the protocols and agreements and the consensus reached between the two countries” to safeguard peace and tranquillity and prevent “recurrence of border-related issues”. Wang also said China and India must continue to be “opportunities of development to each other rather than threats” and push cooperation onto a “healthy and stable track”. The external affairs ministry said the two ministers also exchanged views on recent global developments, and Jaishankar said India “had never subscribed to any clash of civilisations theory”. He said India and China “had to deal with each other on merits and establish a relationship based on mutual respect”. The statement added, “For this, it was necessary that China avoid viewing our bilateral relations from the perspective of its relations with third countries. Asian solidarity would depend on the example set by India-China relations.” Though the statement didn’t give details, Jaishankar’s remarks were an apparent reference to the situation in Afghanistan, where China has been working closely with its traditional ally Pakistan since the Taliban takeover in Kabul. China has provided aid worth millions of dollars to the Taliban setup and is among the handful of countries that have kept open their embassies in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-officials-to-meet-again-soon-to-discuss-remaining-issues-of-lac-standoff-101631897306124.html

17-09-2021||India||Global community must ensure Afghan soil is not used for terrorism: Modi at SCO-CSTO meet||The world community must decide collectively on recognising the new setup in Kabul in view of questions about its legitimacy because the change of power in Afghanistan was “not inclusive” and done “without negotiation”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday. In his virtual address to a joint meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) that was convened in Dushanbe to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, Modi said the international community must ensure Afghan soil is not used to spread terrorism. He called on SCO members to develop “strict and common norms” based on the principle of zero tolerance towards terror to counter any terrorism emanating from Afghanistan’s territory. The norms should include a code of conduct to prevent cross-border terror and terror financing and a system for their enforcement, he added. Earlier in the day, Modi said in a virtual address to the SCO Summit, Modi said the developments in Afghanistan had highlighted challenges faced by the region, including the impact of growing radicalisation on peace and security. India has watched warily since the Taliban took over Afghanistan on August 15 following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. The establishment of a hardline setup by the Taliban that includes several key members of the Haqqani Network and the presence in Afghanistan of thousands of fighters from Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are among India’s key security concerns. Along with its partners, India has called for the creation of an inclusive government in Afghanistan that protects the rights of women and minorities. India has also insisted Afghan soil must not be used to plan or carry out terror attacks against other countries. Modi reiterated these concerns in his address to the SCO-CSTO meeting. Modi listed four issues that he said should be the focus of regional cooperation on Afghanistan – the new system put in place in Kabul, the spread of terrorist and extremist ideologies if instability continues in Afghanistan, the possibility of the uncontrolled flow of drugs, illegal weapons and human trafficking, and the serious humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country. He said that the “change of power in Afghanistan was not inclusive and has taken place without negotiation”, and that this raises “questions about the acceptability of the new system”. The representation of all sections of Afghan society, including women and minorities, is important, he said. “Therefore, it is essential that the world community decides on the recognition of the new system in a thoughtful and collective manner. India supports the central role of the UN on this issue,” Modi said, speaking in Hindi. Modi warned that continued “instability and fundamentalism” in Afghanistan would lead to the spread of terrorist and extremist ideologies around the world, and that “other extremist groups may be encouraged to seek power through violence”. All countries must work together to ensure that Afghan soil isn’t used to spread terrorism in any country, and SCO members should develop “strict and common norms” on this issue based on zero tolerance for terrorism, he said. These norms, which should include a code of conduct to prevent cross-border terror and terror financing, could become a template for global anti-terror cooperation. SCO’s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) mechanism can help monitor any flow of drugs, illegal weapons and human trafficking from Afghanistan. “A large amount of advanced weapons remain in Afghanistan. Due to these, there will be a risk of instability in the entire region,” Modi said. “From this month, India is presiding over the council of [RATS]. We have developed proposals for practical cooperation on this topic,” he said. All countries must work together to ensure humanitarian aid reaches Afghanistan, which is facing a serious humanitarian crisis, Modi said. People have been hit by the interruption of financial and trade flows and the Covid-19 pandemic, and India stands ready to deliver food and medicines to “our Afghan friends”, he added. In his address to the SCO Summit, Modi also said the grouping should develop a joint approach to fight radicalisation and extremism, and called for developing a network between moderate, tolerant and inclusive Islamic institutions in the member states. “The 20th anniversary of SCO is a suitable occasion to think about the future of the SCO. I believe the biggest challenges in this region are related to peace, security and trust deficit and the root cause of these problems is increasing radicalisation,” Modi said, speaking in Hindi. “Recent developments in Afghanistan have made this challenge more apparent. The SCO should take an initiative on this issue,” he said, recalling Central Asia’s historic role as a “bastion of moderate and progressive cultures and values”. Modi also welcomed Iran as a new member state of SCO, and Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar as new dialogue partners, saying the expansion reflects the grouping’s growing influence. The current members of SCO are China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan. Afghanistan, Belarus and Mongolia have observer status with SCO, while dialogue partners include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Turkey. Modi addressed both the meetings in Dushanbe virtually while external affairs minister S Jaishankar participated in person and held meetings with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. Jaishankar also held talks with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Tajik President Emomali Rahmon and with his counterparts from Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-community-must-ensure-afghan-soil-is-not-used-for-terrorism-modi-at-sco-csto-meet-101631889445538.html

17-09-2021||India||SC permits Kerala to hold offline Class 11 exams||The Supreme Court on Friday gave its nod for the physical conduct of Class 11 examinations in Kerala as it said that the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic is not in the offing and trusted the authorities to follow all precautions.On September 3, the court had restrained Kerala from proceeding with its Class 11 examinations beginning September 6 on account of the “alarming” situation posed by surge in Covid-19 cases that posed a risk to health of students. More than 300,000 students in the state are supposed to appear for the examinations.The bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said, “We are convinced by the explanation offered by the state government. We hope and trust that the authorities will take all precautions to ensure no untoward incident is faced by students who are of tender age and are appearing for the examination.” With this direction, the court disposed a petition filed by advocate A Rasoolshan who argued that the decision of the state to conduct offline examinations for Class 11 was creating tremendous mental stress among students and posed a serious risk to children as cases in the state were rising at an alarming rate.Explaining why it had swiftly intervened in the matter on September 3 ordering stay of the examinations, the bench said, “Earlier we had intervened thinking that by September, the possibility of the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic was there. Now the third wave does not seem to be in the offing immediately.”Also Read | Kerala high court rejects plea questioning new regulations in Lakshadweep“The authorities are conscious of their responsibilities. Last time when the grievance of holding physical examination was made before us, we did not have a convincing answer. Now the explanation has been given in the counter affidavit of the state. More than 700,000 students appeared in JEE and NEET. Even for APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, the state conducted engineering entrance examination. So long as Covid protocols are followed, we have no objection,” the bench observed.The state convinced the court that separate rooms will be organised for those showing symptoms of illness, along with PPE kits for students and invigilators. Further, the state told the court that holding online examination will prejudice a large number of students who have no access to laptops, desktops or even mobile phones and in many areas, the internet connection or mobile data are not available. “These students will never be able to write online examinations,” the state said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-permits-kerala-to-hold-offline-class-11-exams-101631882364821.html

The Congress observed National Unemployment Day across India on Friday – Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday. While the BJP and the BJP-ruled states decided to celebrate PM Modi's birthday through record vaccination against Covid, the National Unemployment Day was also Congress's planned agenda for the day. #राष्ट्रीय_बेरोजगार_दिवस की ज़रूरत ही नहीं पड़ती अगर भाजपा जनता के लिए काम करती- मित्रों के लिए नहीं!The youth wing of the party spearheaded the programme and organised protests in many states against the increasing unemployment rate in the country. The Indian Youth Congress claimed that the unemployment rate in the country has increased from 2.4 per cent to 10.3 per cent in just one year.National president of Indian Youth Congress, Srinivas BV, said, "The youth of the country is roaming unemployed on the streets today. The Modi government came to power by making big promises of giving 2 crore jobs per year, but today the central government is completely silent on the issue of employment."As PM Modi received wishes from several politicians cutting across parties, throughout the day, teh Congress too wished him but underlined that the country is paying the price for his failures on several fronts and so the day is being observed as unemployment day, anti-farmer day and high prices day.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said birthdays of former prime ministers are celebrated as different days, with Jawaharlal Nehru's birthday as "Children's Day", Indira Gandhi's as "National Integration Day", Rajiv Gandhi's as "Sadbhavna Day" and Atal Bihari Vajpayee's as "Good Governance Day". But Modi's birthday is being observed as "unemployment day". "It is the prime minister's birthday and from this platform, we wish him a happy birthday. We pray for his well being, but we do believe that this day is being celebrated in many parts of the country as unemployment day, anti-farmer day, high prices day, crippled economy day, as winning over your crony capitalists friends day, as ED, IT, CBI raid day, and the corona mismanagement day," Shrinate said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also wished PM Modi on Twitter. "Happy birthday, Modi ji," Rahul Gandhi wrote.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/had-bjp-worked-not-only-for-mitron-rahul-gandhi-s-fresh-jibe-on-pm-modi-s-birthday-101631881453775.html
17-09-2021||India||Thackeray ‘future colleague’ remark sparks speculation about Sena-BJP alliance||Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief sparked a fresh speculation in political circles on Friday when he referred to Union minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Raosaheb Danve as a probable “future colleague”.Thackeray, while speaking at a government event in Aurangabad, referred to the dignitaries, including minister of state for Railways Danve, on the dais as “my former, current, and if we come together, my future colleagues”. He then turned and looked behind, where Danve was seated. The statement assumes significance in the wake of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) action against his close aide and minister Anil Parab even as it led to speculations of BJP and Sena joining hands. Both Sena and Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said there was no such possibility as of now. Thackeray later told reporters that “time will tell” what he meant by future colleagues. He said, “Leaving aside the lighter part of it, I feel that politics should not become perverse, as it has taken shape lately, and it should stop. There is a Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in the state and a BJP-led government at the Centre but in the end, we are from this land. Without having any arrogance about the positions we hold, we must use our posts to do good for the state.”Also Read | I-T department conducts search at Anil Deshmukh’s premisesHe added that he asked Danve to come to Mumbai for the Centre’s plan to connect Mumbai and Nagpur through a bullet train project. He said he only meant that all should come together for the development of the state.Reacting to the statement, Fadnavis said, “We are not eyeing power and we are carrying out the role of an effective Opposition. I think the chief minister has realised that the unnatural alliance is harming Maharashtra and so, he expressed his feelings. In politics, anything can happen but as of today, I do not see any such possibilities.”Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said, “Whoever wants to join MVA can come and change their status from future to current colleagues...When Danve was the BJP state president, everything was running smoothly. If CM has called him, then it is for bullet train project. There has to be good communication between state government and central ministers.”Thackeray’s statement gained momentum also because just a day ago, BJP state president Chandrakant Patil said he shouldn’t be called a ‘former’ minister and added that people will know soon why he said so. Reacting to that, Raut said, “Chandrakant Patil might be made governor of Nagaland, as per my information. Therefore, he said that he shouldn’t be called a ‘former minister’. If he wants to get rid of the ‘former’ title then either he must join MVA or accept the offer to become Nagaland governor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thackeray-future-collegue-remark-reignites-speculation-about-sena-bjp-alliance-101631881764716.html

17-09-2021||India||Kerala High Court rejects plea questioning new regulations in Lakshadweep||The Kerala High Court on Friday rejected a petition questioning the Lakshadweep administration’s decision to close dairy farms and remove meat from the mid-day meal in schools saying it can’t interfere in policy matters. Earlier, the court had stayed the operation of two controversial orders passed by the Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel. Hearing the plea filed by Ajmal Ahamad, a resident of the island, once again the administration contended that the court can’t interfere in such policy decisions. Counsel for administration S Manu also pointed out that dairy farm was running in losses and the island was losing ₹one crore every year. He also argued that nutrition needs of the children can be increased with an altered menu. The counsel listed out the nutritional value of the new menu and said it was well above the stipulated value. He argued that the petitioner, also an advocate, had filed a public interest litigation for raising unfounded and unverified allegations and for publicity. He also pointed out that the petitioner is a member of the Save Lakshadweep Forum which is leading the ongoing protests. But the counsel for petitioner, Peeyus Kottam, contended that such norms would infringe upon the ethnic culture, heritage, food habits and other rights of the residents under Article 19 of the Constitution. He said earlier food items like chicken, fish and eggs should be continued and sought re-opening of dairy farms. After considering the detailed reply justifying the policy decision, a division bench of Chief Justice S Mani Kumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly dismissed the public interest litigation. An archipelago in the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep was in the news for all the wrong reasons recently.A section of residents protested against three draft regulations brought in by new administrator Praful Khoda Patel, saying they would affect the unique culture and tradition of the island. They opposed the move to make the island a tourist destination, a ban on cattle slaughter, two-child norm for local body members, liquor licence, goonda law and other new rules. But BJP leaders from the island said some vested interests were stoking the fire and provoking local people to stall developmental projects on the island. On May 31, the Kerala assembly had passed an unusual resolution demanding the recall of the administrator. But the administration also maintained that some leaders from Kerala were provoking residents and they desperately needed development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-rejects-plea-questioning-new-regulations-in-lakshadweep-101631880504818.html

Haribhushan died of Covid-19 on June 21. Though Sammakka was also believed to have died of Covid-19, the Maoist party issued a statement denying any such idea.Sammakka, who was a Khammam district committee member operating from the bordering forests of Chhattisgarh, had a reward of ₹5 lakh on her head. Director General of Police M Mahendar Reddy, before whom she surrendered, handed over the cheque to her.Speaking to the media later, the DGP said several Maoist leaders were suffering from Covid-19 but were not getting proper treatment in the forests. “We have specific information that many senior Maoist leaders, including central committee members like Azad and Raji Reddy, are willing to surrender and join the mainstream. But the top leadership has not been giving them permission,” he said.Reddy said Sammakka was upset with the party for not providing proper treatment to her husband Haribhushan which led to his death. “The Maoists have lost the people’s support. If they surrender, we shall provide protection to them,” he said.Sammakka, who belongs to Gangaram village of Mahabubabad district, was attracted towards the Maoist party (then called CPI-ML People’s War) in 1994 and she married Haribhushan in 1995. She worked as a squad member between 1997-98 and later became North Telangana Special Zonal Committee member in 1999.She surrendered before the Warangal police in 2008, but returned to the Maoist party in 2011 and became a member of Sabari-Charla area committee in 2016, before being elevated to the Khammam district committee. She escaped from exchange of fire with the police at least six times.“After her husband’s death due to Covid-19 in June this year, Sammakka lost interest in the party and had been trying to surrender to the police,” the DGP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dead-maoist-leader-s-wife-sammakka-surrenders-totelangana-police-101631878764562.html

I’m really happy to share that 2 (two) products of Manipur viz Hathei Chilly & Tamenglong orange have been granted GI tag.”“This is a historic milestone in the history of Manipur which will increase the income of the farmers immensely,” he said.Also Read | In joint op with Assam Rifles, Manipur police kill self-styled SDFK commanderThe GI status is an indication that identifies goods as produced from a particular area which has special quality attributable to its geographical origin.Manipur Organic Mission Agency (MOMA) applied for GI tags for Tamenglong orange and Sirarakhong Hathei chilli in 2019.

17-09-2021||India||Leopards wreak havoc in Uttarakhand’s Kumaon||Leopards are creating terror in many parts of Kumaon, Uttarakhand, these days, underlining the need to take man-animal conflict more seriously. “Big cats, mostly leopards, find good hideouts near residential areas due to abundant growth of bushes. Their movements are more frequent from July to October,” said Tanuja Parihar, ranger, Bhakhra range of forest in Nainital. A leopard with two cubs was noticed here recently. In US Nagar’s Jaspur, a female leopard injured around six persons in a fortnight in Patrampur village. Camera traps and a cage have been installed there. Anil Chauhan, forest officer, Patrampur forest range, said, “The female leopard is moving in the area with her cubs. A few days ago, a biker hit her cub accidentally. Since then, it has become aggressive. We have installed a cage to trap the leopard.” Also Watch | Char Dham Yatra gets nod from Uttarakhand HC; How the pilgrimage will changeLeopards have been striking Kafaligair, Baset and Tunod villages in Bageshwar. According to Baset village head Devaki Devi, leopards stroll in broad daylight in the village, forcing people inside their homes. In Nainital, Pithoragarh and Almora, they are entering urban areas of the district headquarters for dogs as prey. Their movement has been caught on CCTV. In Pithoragarh, they are being spotted in pairs in more than five villages adjoining the district headquarters. “Our teams are patrolling leopard’s infested areas. Also, we are making aware people of rural as well as urban areas to take precautions to avoid attack.” A leopard was trapped in a cage installed by forest officials in Matena village under Hawalbag block in Almora on Tuesday. It had attacked and injured a minor girl last week. Mohan Ram Arya, ranger of the area, said, “The leopard is an 8-year-old male and healthy. It has been sent to a rescue centre in Almora and will be released in new habitat soon.” Over 400 people have been killed in leopard attacks in the state since it as formed in 2000. Human deaths in leopard attacks account for nearly half of the total deaths due to wild animals in the state, reveals the data of the state forest department. Wildlife experts say there are many factors due to which it has been difficult to check man-leopard conflict in the state, be it the hilly terrain which provides ample space to leopards to hide to human settlements scattered in hills overlapping leopard territories. In July this year, Uttarakhand forest department released instructions for checking and dealing with the man-leopard conflict in the Himalayan state. The directions issued stated that quick response teams be deployed in such areas by the officials concerned where leopard movement is spotted and leopard attacks are being reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopards-wreak-havoc-in-uttarakhand-s-kumaon-101631875764228.html
17-09-2021||India||Uddhav Thackeray refers to Union minister as future colleague, BJP plays safe||Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena supremo sparked a fresh speculation in political circles on Friday after he referred to Union minister Raosaheb Danve as a probable “future colleague”.Addressing an event in Aurangabad where he shared a platform with Danve, Thackeray said (loosely translated from Marathi), “Present here is also my former and if we (Sena and BJP) come together, a future colleague…”Thackeray later reportedly said he only made the remark on a lighter not as he had met his old friend after a long time, according to an NDTV report.He was further quoted as saying, “I like the railways for one reason. You cannot leave the tracks and change direction. Yes, but if there is a diversion you can come to our station. But the engine does not leave the tracks.” Danve, a Union minister of state for railways and BJP MP from Jalna, soon after said the two parties shared the same ideology and his party was always willing to renew ties with the Sena.The duo was attending the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Aurangabad zilla parishad building.Later, leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said anything can happen in politics but there was no scope of the possibility of a reunion between the two parties at present. “We are playing the role of an effective opposition party," Fadnavis added.State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said he had no idea what the chief minister was thinking while making the statement.The Sena severed ties with its decades-old partner in 2019 over power-sharing issues and joined hands with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) as a ruling alliance in the state. Ever since, there has been constant murmurs of dissent and open clashes among the three partners. Meanwhile, Congress leader Nana Patole, who earlier comments had led to rifts within the alliance, said the chief minister was only cracking a joke and the MVA government would complete its term. “The chief minister sometimes likes to crack a joke and that is exactly what he did. This government will run its full five year term. There is no problem with the government in Maharashtra,” Patole said. (With inputs from bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-thackeray-refers-to-union-minister-as-future-colleague-bjp-plays-safe-101631874176154.html

However, we hope that these decisions can be taken quickly because people who are receiving Covaxin have certain imperatives of travel. Most of us, who chose the concurrency, is important in terms of licensure. We are hoping for an early decision," ANI quoted Paul as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/awaiting-who-approval-for-covaxin-bharat-biotech-says-inappropriate-to-comment-on-process-101631874005376.html

"Arvind Kejriwal ji, you notified the Private Mandi's central black law! Has it been de-notified or the masquerading is still going on?" the Punjab Congress chief asked in the video. The Rakhi Sawant of Punjab politics -Navjot Singh Sidhu- has received a scolding from Congress high command for non stop rant against Capt. Therefore today,for a change, he went after Arvind Kejriwal. Wait till tomorrow for he shall resume his diatribe against Capt with vehemence https://t.co/9SDr8js8tARaghav Chadha presented an explanation of why Sidhu suddenly targeted Kejriwal at a time when Sidhu himself is knee-deep in controversies. "The Rakhi Sawant of Punjab politics -Navjot Singh Sidhu- has received a scolding from Congress high command for non-stop rant against Capt. Therefore today, for a change, he went after Arvind Kejriwal. Wait till tomorrow for he shall resume his diatribe against Capt with vehemence," the AAP leader said.The power tussle between Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu is going on as the party cadre are divided between Amarinder and Sidhu who have never been on the same page. While Sidhu's advisers drew flak for some of their comments and the CMO restrained them from commenting on issues beyond their role, Sidhu continued criticism of his government. Recently, he questioned the Congress government's inaction on the drugs issue.In the past few days, Sidhu has taken up the issue of farmers and wrote a letter to Amarinder Singh on Sunday seeking action on farmers' demanding cancellation of 'unfair' FIRs registered during their agitation. While Sidhu's Friday video comes in that regard, the AAP slammed Sidhu's letter to Captain as a 'stunt'. Aam Aadmi Party legislator Harpal Singh Cheema said Congress leaders especially Sidhu are acting as if they are in the opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-sidhu-is-rakhi-sawant-of-punjab-politics-aap-leader-says-as-sidhu-slams-kejriwal-101631871483115.html
17-09-2021||India||India jabs over 10 million against Covid on PM Modi's birthday||India on Friday administered more than 10 million vaccine doses against Covid-19 as part of the Centre’s vaccine sewa call to commemorate the 71st birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.This is the fourth time that the country has achieved the landmark of administering 10 million doses on a single day.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also made elaborate arrangements to celebrate the PM’s birthday with the launch of the ‘Seva or Samarpan Abhiyan’ campaign, a mega 20-day public outreach programme focusing on Modi's 20 years in public life.The campaign was launched by party chief JP Nadda at the BJP headquarter in Delhi and will come to an end October 7.As part of the campaign, the party has asked its workers to facilitate the Covid-19 vaccination drive as it eyes record-breaking numbers on Friday.India's cumulative Covid-19 vaccination coverage surpassed 77.24 crore of which, 63,97,972 vaccine doses, were administered in the last 24 hours.The inoculation drive in India was launched in January with health workers and frontline workers as priority. In the following phases, the government expanded the drive to other groups deemed as vulnerable by health experts.From June 21, the new phase of universalisation of Covid-19 vaccination commenced, under which the government ramped up the availability of more vaccines and streamlined the vaccine supply chain.The BJP has also planned to distribute 140 million ration bags with Modi’s pictures among the needy under the sewa campaign. About 50 million BJP booth workers will send the PM postcards highlighting their commitment to public service.Modi was born in 1950 at Vadnagar in Gujarat. He is currently in the third year of his second consecutive term after the BJP won the parliamentary elections in 2019 with a landslide majority. He was the longest-serving chief minister of Gujarat with his term spanning from October 2001 to May 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-birthday-india-vaccinates-over-10-million-against-covid19-101631870679042.html

In his virtual address to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Dushanbe, Modi said the eight-member grouping should develop a joint approach to fight radicalisation and extremism. He also called for developing a network between moderate, tolerant and inclusive Islamic institutions in the SCO states. The 20th anniversary of SCO is a suitable occasion to think about its future. I believe the biggest challenges in this region are related to peace, security and trust deficit and the root cause of these problems is increasing radicalisation,” Modi said, speaking in Hindi. “Recent developments in Afghanistan have made this challenge more apparent. The SCO should take an initiative on this issue,” he said. Also Read | India shares challenges that prompted us to join AUKUS: Australian envoyIndia has watched warily since the Taliban took over Afghanistan on August 15 following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. The establishment of a hardline governing setup by the Taliban that includes several key members of the Haqqani Network and the presence in Afghanistan of thousands of fighters from Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are among India’s main security concerns. Along with its partners, India has called for the creation of an inclusive government in Afghanistan that protects the rights of women and minorities. India has also said that Afghan soil must not be used to carry out terror attacks against other countries. Modi said in his address that Central Asia’s historic role as a “bastion of moderate and progressive cultures and values” should help inspire the fight against extremism. Traditions such as Sufism flourished in the area over the centuries and spread across the region and the world, he pointed out. “We can still see their influence in the cultural heritage of this region. On the basis of this historical heritage of Central Asia, SCO should develop a common template to fight radicalisation and extremism,” he said. “In India, and in almost all SCO countries, there are moderate, tolerant and inclusive institutions and traditions associated with Islam. SCO should work to develop a strong network between them,” he added. Modi appreciated the work being done by SCO’s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), and called on members of the grouping to actively participate in activities being organised during India’s presidency of RATS. The prime minister welcomed Iran as a new member state of SCO, and Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar as new dialogue partners, saying the expansion reflects the grouping’s growing influence. The current members of SCO are China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan. Afghanistan, Belarus and Mongolia have observer status with SCO, while dialogue partners include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Turkey. Modi said fighting radicalisation is also necessary for the future of the younger generations, who have to be encouraged towards science and rational thinking in order to make the region a key player in emerging technologies. “We can promote this kind of thinking and innovative spirit by connecting our young entrepreneurs and start-ups,” he said. The economic potential of the region has remained untapped due to radicalisation and insecurity, and SCO has to emphasise “mutual connectivity”, Modi said. India is committed to increasing connectivity with the landlocked Central Asian countries, which can benefit by accessing India’s vast market, he added. “Unfortunately, many connectivity options are not open to them today due to lack of mutual trust. Our investment in Iran’s Chabahar port and our efforts towards the International North-South Corridor are driven by this reality,” Modi said. Connectivity initiatives “cannot be a one-way street”, and such projects should be “consultative, transparent and participatory to ensure mutual trust”. Respect for territorial integrity of all countries “should be implicit”, and SCO should develop norms for connectivity projects based on these principles, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-joint-approach-to-fight-radicalisation-extremism-pm-modi-at-sco-summit-101631870714860.html
17-09-2021||India||A year after Hathras gangrape||In a four-part series, starting one year to the day of the Hathras gangrape, Hindustan Times returned to the scenes of crimes against women in rural India that have shaken the country over the past three decades, launched protests, and affected the course of law, to examine what has happened since, and if the social conditions that allowed for, and perpetuated these crimes, have changed at all.--Hathras rape: A year on, still living in fear, buried under social stigmaIn Hathras, exactly one year ago, on September 14, 2020, a 19-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly raped and assaulted. Days later, amid national outrage, her body was cremated in the dead of the night.--His phone was buzzing. It was two days after his sister, 19, allegedly raped, died, with her body being consigned to flames with the administration watching. The stream of visitors was constant, from neighbours, to politicians, to an intrusive press. Most had never stepped into his mud and brick home before. There had been no peace. He was used to the ping, almost as if it was now a dirge for his loss.Yet, this alert was different. Ominous.Read the story here.--Badaun twin tragedy: Sanitation, dignity in tussle with poverty, customsBadaun tragedy: Poverty, imbalance, sanitation — the horrors remain. The tragic deaths of 14-year-old and 16-year-old girls, who were found hanging from a mango tree in an orchard seven years ago in Uttar Pradesh’s Badaun, still haunts the family.--She wakes up at around 4.30am, before any other member of the household. She picks up a mug, adjusts the knots of her sari around her waist, and makes her way to the fields behind her house. Once she’s back, she starts her day – cooking for the six people in her family, sweeping the mud floors of her small house, cleaning the front courtyard, and laying out the charpoys for the men to sit.Her morning ritual has remained unchanged through the decades, through a punishing pandemic, numerous village chiefs, elections, and floods that force villagers to flee every few years in Uttar Pradesh’s Badaun district.She does not like going to the fields, but sums up her predicament in one word: “majboori” (helplessness).Read the story here.--Khairlanji episode: Caste divide cemented by brutality from 15 years agoKharlainji episode: In 2006, a group of villagers, mostly Kunbis – who consider themselves equivalent to the Marathas in western Maharashtra but are classified as OBC – attacked four members of the family of Bhaiyyalal Bhotmange, all Dalits. The victims were paraded naked in the village, the women sexually violated, and all four of them hacked to death. The massacre rocked the country and sparked protests by Dalit groups across the country. It was a rude reminder that despite stepping into the 21st century, caste attitudes continue to stagnate in primitivity, and Dalit people, especially women, were as vulnerable to the power of upper-caste structure as they were half a century ago. It belied the promise of modernity for India’s most marginal groups.--In September 2006, Khairlanji was just another village in Maharashtra’s Bhandara, its 700 strong populace fairly nondescript. 150km from Nagpur, there was nothing to separate the homes in its dingy lanes from each other. Most roads were kuccha. Most houses were kuccha too.Fifteen years later, there are signs of change. Some roads have gone from dirt to cement, some homes now have tap water. But what hasn’t changed is the distrust in the social fabric of the village, borne out of a heinous crime that sparked angry protests, brought ignominy to the village, and came to be known across the country as the “Kharlainji massacre”.Read the story here.--Bhanwari Devi: Justice eluded her, but she stands resolute for othersBhanwari Devi’s legal battle birthed India’s sexual harassment protection laws for women, and forms the backbone of the Supreme Court’s landmark 1997 Vishakha guidelines for workplaces. Yet, her case has not resulted in convictions.--Thin and frail and in her early sixties, Bhanwari Devi sits, an orange ghunghat covering her head, her forehead furrowed. The last year has not been kind to her. As her hands sprinkle water on a buffalo calf in the courtyard of her home in the village of Bhateri in Rajasthan, she talks of her husband who died last year.Her body is racked by diabetes, and the loss of her companion has brought the idea of mortality closer. And yet, Devi betrays no weakness, her movements quick and decisive.For the last three decades, she has fought a case against five local men for rape, assault and harassment. Her legal battle has birthed India’s sexual harassment protection laws for women, and forms the backbone of the landmark Vishakha guidelines for workplaces laid down by the Supreme Court in 1997.Read the story here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-after-hathras-gangrape-101631868736561.html
17-09-2021||India||I-T search at Sonu Sood properties for 3rd day, 'Once BJP's favourite,' says Sena||The income tax department search at the properties of Bollywood actor Sonu Sood continues for the third day as the department widens its probe into the alleged tax evasion charges against the actor. Reports said multiple premises in Mumbai, Nagpur and Jaipur are being searched. On Wednesday, when the department initiated action against the Bollywood actor, searches were conducted at around six properties linked to Sonu Sood in Mumbai and Lucknow. Now, people linked to him are also on the radar of the I-T department, a PTI report said.Sonu Sood has recently become an ambassador of AAP's mentorship programme meant for students. The AAP has slammed the action against the actor and said he is being targeted by the central government only because of being a 'messiah' for the downtrodden. AAP chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted in support of Sonu Sood and said the Bollywood actor has the prayers of lakhs of families that he supported in difficult times. Sonu Sood got national and international recognition for his humanitarian action taken during the pandemic, which started with arranging transport for migrant workers. Shiv Sena criticised the action and said that once BJP praised Sonu Sood, but now it thinks he is a tax evader after the Delhi and Punjab governments tried to join hands with him."Filing false cases against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers, pressuring the state governor to withhold 12 members for their nomination to the state Legislative Council and raiding actors like Sonu Sood were signs of a small and narrow mind. This is foul play and it is sure to boomerang one day," the Sena said in its mouthpiece Saamana.The editorial also said the BJP leaders used to be present at all events of Sonu Soon, like when he announced scholarship programmes, when he set up oxygen plants in 16 cities. Even Maharashtra Governor BS Koshyari called him to Raj Bhavan and praised his efforts. But when Delhi and Punjab governments tried to join hands with him in his social work, the actor became a tax evader, the Sena editorial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-search-at-sonu-sood-continues-for-3rd-day-sena-says-once-bjp-s-favourite-101631869026194.html
17-09-2021||India||In Chhattisgarh, the Congress leadership impasse refuses to end||Confusion continues to prevail over the Chhattisgarh government as even the Congress high command hasn’t really resolved the long-pending issues between chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and his colleague and party heavyweight TS Singhdeo.Almost a fortnight ago, Baghel seemed to have bought some time for himself when, on August 28, emerging from a long meeting with the high command in Delhi on suggestions that he should step down for Singhdeo as per a reported two-and-half-year power sharing agreement, the chief minister claimed that Rahul Gandhi would visit the state the next week to see all the work that had been done during his regime.The next day, when Singhdeo returned, he said he too had spoken to the leadership too and they had kept a “decision safe”. Thus, for both the camps, Gandhi’s proposed visit to the state was a metaphor to the resolution of the crisis. More than two weeks later, Gandhi is yet to visit and clarity is yet to prevail. On Wednesday, Baghel said on a TV interview that his office has sent to Delhi a three-day itinerary for Gandhi and is awaiting confirmation. Functionaries close to Baghel say “things are on hold” but decisions of the central leadership will be followed. “If Rahul ji (Gandhi) is not deciding the dates, it means it is not an urgent matter for the party and high command,” a leader said. Also Read | Maoist violence highest in Chhattisgarh in 2020, NCRB data revealsAnother leader close to Baghel said he was asked to continue in the meeting with the high command. Asked what Baghel would do if the party decided to remove him, the leader said, “It is clear that Baghel will not work under the chief ministership of Singhdeo.” Meanwhile, people close to Singh Deo say they were lying low, but that the leader was “waiting” for a decision and was “confident”. “Singhdeo is clear about his politics. Certain things have been conveyed to him by the high command which he keeps close to his chest. He is waiting for the high command’s decision,” said a close aide. This camp believes Baghel committed a “blunder” by orchestrating an ostensible show of strength in Delhi by asking MLAs to collect there. “He made a big mistake by seeming to challenge the high command. In Congress’s history, whoever has tried this has failed,” said a leader. Also Read | Man sentenced to death for rape, murder of 3-yr-oldWhile there have been reports of some attempts at garnering support, one MLA said, “Everyone is waiting for the high command’s decision. I can guarantee that most of MLAs will accept whatever high command decides.” The camps aside, confusion reigns supreme among the bureaucracy as well. A senior IAS officer in the state said, “Most bureaucrats are in confusion and fear. A group of civil servants who are close to the CM’s camp fear a change of guard, and others who are sidelined in this government are eagerly keeping an eye on every political development.” Even in Bastar, police officers have been instructed verbally to maintain status quo. “Bastar Police have been asked not to plan big anti-Maoist operations and maintain status quo for next few months. There could be many factors but one reason could be that since there is a political turmoil, the government does not want to give any ammunition to the opposition on tribal front. The Silger incident has caused enough damage for the present government as some leaders who met Rahul Gandhi told him that Congress is losing ground in Bastar,” said a senior police officer.The incident he was talking about was security forces opening fire on a protest on May 17, killing three people on the spot outside a newly established security camp in Sukma. Another villager who was injured in the firing died a few days later. Police claimed that Maoists were using the villagers as a shield. In the wake of the December 2018 assembly elections, where the Congress won 68 of 90 seats, Baghel and Singhdeo reportedly arrived at a power-sharing arrangement wherein they were to head the government for half the term each. Political observers believe that the CM is not willing to step down and hence it will be difficult for Congress to take any decision in near future. “Any politician would not want to step down after becoming the chief minister...look at Rajasthan and Punjab, other Congress-ruled states...It is only natural that the Chhattisgarh CM is not willing to step down even if a power-sharing formula was decided ,” said Sudeip Shrivastva, a political commentator based in Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-chhattisgarh-the-congress-leadership-impasse-refuses-to-end-101631869275078.html

Jain said on Friday that the work will be completed within two months.He said, “There has been a slight delay as high-voltage cables surfaced in the area where the ramp of the underpass is to be constructed. The cables are being shifted and that is likely to take around a month’s time.“We have expedited the process and are resolving all the issues. The entire work of the underpass will be completed in two months. We have also repaired the roads around the site. Further road repair work will be done after the monsoons,” he added.PWD officials say the project has been hit by multiple setbacks in the past two years but as the situation seems to be improving, the agency claims to be hopeful that they will complete the 750-metre Ashram underpass project by November-end, as against its December 2021 deadline.Also Read | Delhi hospital reports 5 cases of gall bladder gangrene after Covid recoveryAir pollution ban (starting 2019 September), assembly polls (March 8), pandemic-induced lockdowns (between March 2020 and June 5, 2021), labour shortage and financial crunch are some of the reasons this project’s deadline has repeatedly been missed.The initial deadline for the Ashram underpass project was December 2020, then it was shifted to April 2021, since most of the work was yet to be completed. That deadline too was, however, missed and the next deadline provided by the government officials was that of June 2021. After this, PWD missed the August 31 deadline too and now claims that the work will be done before the December 31 deadline.Delays not only result in increased costs but also hassle the commuters. PWD officials say they will open the stretch in two phases – one wherein the Ashram Chowk and the underpass will be made operational, and the other being the extension of Ashram flyover.Ashram intersection, which around 350,000 vehicles cross during peak traffic hours, is among the busiest and the most congested stretches in the Capital. It witnesses massive traffic snarls because of portions of Mathura Road being dug up by the construction agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiashram-underpass-work-may-be-completed-before-dec-31-says-satyendar-jain-101631865614489.html

It is like a parking area in space and is great for observing several phenomena without hindrances from eclipses.Xposat will be the other purely scientific mission that the space agency will undertake next year. It will be launched aboard a small satellite launch vehicle, which is currently in the development phase. The new launch vehicle is likely to have its first development flight by December this year. ISRO qualifies a launch vehicle to be mission-ready after two successful development flights.“Xposat will allow us to study the polarisation of celestial events. It will be launched by an SSLV which is under development. The first development flight will be by the end of this year. Academicians are looking forward to the data generated from this mission,” said Nair.The SSLV, which is being developed for the commercial launch of small satellites, costs only ₹30 crore as compared to ₹120 crore for a polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV). The SSLV can be assembled by a team of six scientists within seven days in comparison to a team of 600 that takes a couple of months to assemble a PSLV.The Covid-19 pandemic severely affected the number of launches ISRO could undertake in 2020 and 2021. There has been a total of just four launches in the two years, of which, one was a purely commercial launch with the main payload being an earth observation satellite from Brazil called Amazonia-1.Before the pandemic, the space agency had planned for 20 launches in the financial year 2020-21, including the first unmanned flight under the Gaganyaan mission. The Gaganyaan mission is also likely to be undertaken by the end of 2022 or in early 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-first-solar-mission-likely-to-launch-next-year-isro-101631860455183.html
17-09-2021||India||India shares challenges that prompted us to join AUKUS: Australian envoy||India shares the “challenging strategic environment” that prompted Australia’s move to forge a security alliance with the US and the UK, including territorial tensions across the Indo-Pacific and China’s massive military modernisation programme, Australian high commissioner Barry O’Farrell said on Friday. The new military partnership called AUKUS will help improve Australia’s defence capabilities in line with the country’s 2020 Defence Strategic Update and will not affect the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, which is more of a diplomatic forum, O’Farrell said during a virtual media briefing. AUKUS was unveiled by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden against the backdrop of China’s assertive actions across the Indo-Pacific, and its first initiative is aimed at equipping Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. Also Read | Jaishankar, Chinese counterpart meet in Dushanbe, discuss disengagement at LACIndia has chosen to maintain a studied silence on the new security alliance, apparently due to sensitivities related to the strategic situation in the region and ties with key partners. France, a key strategic ally for India, was angered by Australia’s decision to scrap a $90-billion programme to build 12 French-designed conventional submarines and instead opt for nuclear-powered vessels. Explaining the rationale behind the creation of AUKUS, O’Farrell said: “The decision reflects a much more challenging strategic environment, an environment we share with India, where great power competition is intensifying, where territorial tensions in the South China Sea, Taiwan and elsewhere are becoming more challenging.” He said, “Indo-Pacific investment in military capability is proceeding at an unprecedented rate and of course that latter point is being driven by China, which has the largest military modernisation programme underway in the world.” AUKUS is also about “ensuring we have capabilities that contribute, along with India and other countries, to deterring the types of behaviour that threatens the peace and security in the Indo-Pacific today and in the future”, he added. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to brief him about AUKUS before the formal announcement was made by the three countries. Similar calls were made by Australian defence minister Peter Dutton and foreign minister Marise Payne to their Indian counterparts. Amid reports that the new alliance was aimed at balancing China across the region, especially in light of Beijing’s aggressive and assertive actions in recent years, O’Farrell noted that AUKUS was not directed against any particular country or meant “to provoke any particular regional power”. It was, he said, based on a “sober assessment of the capability required to meet a more challenging strategic environment”. “As a three-ocean nation, nuclear-powered submarines will provide Australia with a capability it now believes it needs for its defence because they can travel faster, they can travel for a longer range and they have greater power and endurance,” he said. Strengthening Australia’s defence capabilities through nuclear-powered submarines will be part of the country’s “contribution to a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific”, and this capability will increase Canberra’s “strategic weight and allow us to more effectively shape our region’s future trajectory”, O’Farrell said. “Australia is striving to retain an inclusive regional order where the rights of all states are respected, whether they are big states or small states,” he said. Australia wants to “contribute to strategic reassurance measures that ensure no one country believes they can advance their strategic ambitions through conflict and it’s not about seeking to provoke any particular regional power”, he added. Asked specifically about the fallout of France’s anger over the cancellation of Australia’s conventional submarine deal, O’Farrell said his country wants to continue working with India, France and Indonesia to ensure the Indo-Pacific remains free and inclusive. He acknowledged that Australia’s decision to move towards acquitting nuclear-powered submarines had not “been welcomed by France”, but this should not affect engagement in terms of working for security across the Indo-Pacific. Australia’s decision will ensure the trade across the Indian and Pacific Oceans remains secure for all countries, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-shares-challenges-that-prompted-us-to-join-aukus-australian-envoy-101631859734070.html
17-09-2021||India||Delhi hospital reports 5 cases of gall bladder gangrene after Covid recovery||Doctors from Sir Ganga Ram hospital have reported cases of people who have recovered from Covid-19 returning with gall bladder gangrene (tissue death due to loss of blood supply). The doctors have treated five such patients over the past two months, with four of them reaching the hospital with a hole in their gall bladder. The patients needed urgent surgery to remove the gall bladder and have recovered. Inflammation of the gall bladder, which led to gangrene in the current cases, usually happens in those with gall stones. An acute inflammation without stones is usually seen only in 10% cases where the patient is either has a weakened immune system or has suffered an injury. “Gall bladder inflammation without stone is usually seen in patients with HIV, those who have received nutrition through IV, prolonged fasting, those who have been in the intensive care unit for long, and those who have had an accident or burns. The patients did not have these factors; they developed the acute inflammation nearly two months after recovering from Covid-19 and not during their hospital stay,” said Dr Anil Arora, chairman, Institute of Liver, Gastroenterology, Pancreaticobiliary Science at the hospital. Also Read | Did Covid-19 jump from animals to humans on multiple occasions?He also said that mortality is high – 30 to 60% – in patients who develop gall bladder inflammation in the absence of stones because of the conditions that led to the inflammation in the first place. “Surgery in people with compromised immune system or with burns increases the risk of mortality. But, we did not see that in Covid-19 patients. All of them recovered and are doing well,” he said. Doctors suggest that those looking at patients with a history of Covid-19 with pain in the right upper abdomen should suspect gall bladder inflammation and start treatment early to prevent gangrene and perforations. Dr Praveen Sharma, senior consultant of gastroenterology, said, “There should be a high degree of suspicion of this in patients with pain in the right upper quadrant and a history of Covid-19.” Dr Shashi Dhawan, senior consultant pathologist at the hospital, found severe inflammation and injury due to lack of blood supply along with damage to the vessels in the patient samples. This led the doctors to believe that Covid-19 might be causing the gall bladder inflammation with the stones. “The Sars-CoV-2 virus enters through the respiratory system and affects the lungs the most as it has high number of ACE-2 receptors that the virus uses to bind to human cells. After lungs, the gastrointestinal tract and the biliary system (bile duct, gall bladder and associated structures) have the highest ACE-2 receptors. We think the virus might be attaching to the gall bladder lining and dysregulating the immune system causing injury to the gall bladder,” said Dr Arora. He added, “The virus might also be causing tiny clots due that are not detected due to damage to the blood vessels. This is a known mechanism of Sars-CoV-2 which is why we are hearing of cases of stroke and heart attacks after Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hospital-reports-5-cases-of-gall-bladder-gangrene-after-covid-recovery-101631858234159.html

17-09-2021||India||Jaishankar, Chinese counterpart meet in Dushanbe, discuss disengagement at LAC||India and China have agreed that their military and diplomatic officials should meet again and continue discussions to speedily resolve the remaining issues related to the dragging military standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). This was decided when external affairs minister S Jaishankar met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on Thursday. Jaishankar said in a set of tweets that he had discussed disengagement in the border areas with Wang, and “underlined that progress in this regard is essential for restoration of peace and tranquillity, which is the basis for development of bilateral ties”. A statement issued by the external affairs ministry on Friday quoted Jaishankar as recalling that Wang had said at their last meeting on the sidelines of a meeting of SCO foreign ministers on July 14 that India-China relations “were at low ebb”, and that both sides had agreed a “prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of the either side as it was impacting the relationship in a negative manner”. Also Read | PM Modi to address plenary session of SCO summit in DushanbeJaishankar had “emphasised that the two sides should work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols”, the statement said. The minister underlined it “was necessary to ensure progress in resolution of remaining issues so as to restore peace and tranquillity along the LAC”. The statement added, “In this regard, the ministers agreed that military and diplomatic officials of the two sides should meet again and continue their discussions to resolve the remaining issues at the earliest.” Following several rounds of military and diplomatic talks, India and China withdrew their frontline troops and armoured units from the north south banks of Pangong Lake in February. In August, the two sides ended forward deployments at Gogra and dismantled all temporary structures and other infrastructure in this area. The disengagement at Gogra involved a relatively smaller number of troops on both sides. However, several friction points remain on the LAC, such as Hot Spring and Depsang. Both sides still have tens of thousands of troops deployed on the LAC as part of the standoff that began in May last year. The two ministers also exchanged views on recent global developments, and Jaishankar said India “had never subscribed to any clash of civilisations theory”. He said India and China “had to deal with each other on merits and establish a relationship based on mutual respect”. The statement added, “For this, it was necessary that China avoid viewing our bilateral relations from the perspective of its relations with third countries. Asian solidarity would depend on the example set by India-China relations.” Though the statement didn’t give any details, Jaishankar’s remarks were an apparent reference to the situation in Afghanistan, where China has been working closely with its traditional ally Pakistan since the Taliban takeover in Kabul last month. China has provided aid worth millions of dollars to the Taliban setup and is among the handful of countries that have kept open their embassies in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-chinese-counterpart-meet-in-dushanbe-discuss-disengagement-at-lac-101631846893657.html

Gadkari shared the incident in a humorous light while speaking at an event in Haryana, where he also reviewed the progress of the new Delhi-Mumbai expressway.“I was newly married,” Gadkari said, cracking up about the incident. “My father-in-law's house was in the middle of the road. Without telling my wife, I had ordered the demolition of my father-in-law's house.” The minister added that officials informed him that he, too, has a house there and that it needed to be razed for constructing the road.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Gurugram Lok Sabha member Rao Inderjit Singh and senior officials of the state government, district administration, and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) were also present at the event.The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, being built at the cost of around ₹95,000 crore, would be completed by March 2023 with a majority of the work having already been allotted to contractors, Gadkari said after reviewing the status of the ongoing project work at Lohtaki village in Gurugram. The union minister said that work on around 160 kilometres of the highway that falls in Haryana is expected to be completed by March 2022. A part of the road from Delhi to Dausa in Rajasthan and from Vadodara to Ankleshwar will be built by March 2022.The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will be the longest such highway in the country, cutting across 1,380km, according to the central government. It will also be the first such structure to have underpasses for animals, at wildlife sanctuaries along the route, with five structures planned to ensure their safe passage.Besides the expressway, Gadkari said that 14 road projects are underway in Delhi-NCR, at ₹53,000 crore, which will significantly reduce noise and air pollution, due to a reduction in traffic issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-says-he-once-razed-his-father-in-law-s-home-without-telling-wife-101631842647320.html

Dr Anil Arora, the chairperson at the Institute of Liver, Gastroenterology and Pancreatobiiliry Sciences, said they have successfully treated the five patients with gall bladder gangrene between June and August this year."They reported severe inflammation of gall bladder without gall stones (acalculous cholecystitis) resulting in gangrene of gall bladder requiring urgent surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time five cases have been reported from India in which the gall bladder gangrene had occurred in patients after recovery from COVID-19,” Dr Arora said.The five patients, including four men and a woman, were aged between 37 and 75 and all of them complained of fever, pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen and vomiting. While two of them have diabetes and one has heart disease and three received steroids for the management of Covid-19 symptoms.Also read | Did Covid-19 jump from animals to humans on multiple occasions?According to Dr Arora, the median duration between Covid-19 symptoms and diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis was two months, which was confirmed through ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen. “All these patients successfully underwent laparoscopic removal of necrotic perforated gallbladders," Dr Arora said.He added that acalculous cholecystitis with the gangrenous gallbladder is a serious condition associated with high morbidity—up to 30 to 60 per cent—and much higher mortality than "calculous cholecystitis".It is usually seen in patients suffering diabetes, HIV infection, vascular disease, total parenteral nutrition, those on prolonged fasting, in intensive care units and those with underlying history of trauma, burns and sepsis.“Gallbladder epithelial cells are very similar to bile duct cells, as they richly express receptors (ACE2), and could be a target for SARS-CoV-2 or body's dysregulated immunological response against the virus resulting in severe inflammation of the gallbladder,” the senior doctor said.Also read | Booster dose not the focus of vaccination drive: GovtA few case reports of similar illness have been described in the literature in its association with Covid-19 infection, he added.Dr Praveen Sharma, a senior consultant at the gastroenterology department of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said that timely diagnosis is the key to the prevention of the condition. "In this smouldering pandemic, a high index of suspicion of this entity in a patient with fever and right upper quadrant pain especially with a history of recent recovery from Covid-19 infection besides timely diagnosis and early intervention with broad-spectrum antibiotics may prevent the development of onerous complication of gangrene and perforation of the gall bladder," Dr Sharma was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Gall bladder stone disease is very common in north India (eight per cent of the general population) and is responsible for 90 per cent of cases of acute inflammation called cholecystitis. Only 10 per cent of the patients have acalculous cholecystitis.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-covid-19-recovery-5-patients-treated-for-gallbladder-gangrene-101631844161849.html

IAF has initialled a contract worth 27 million euros to buy the fighters, eight of which are in ready-to-fly condition, the people cited above added. That works out to a per-aircraft acquisition cost of 1.125 million euros. The people cited above said the aircraft will soon be shipped to India in containers.IAF’s 35-year old Mirage fleet, which performed exceptionally during the 2019 Balakot operation, is undergoing a mid-life upgrade, the people said – with the trigger for the acquisition of the second-hand aircraft being the immediate need for 300 critical spares. The aircraft is becoming obsolete in France, they added, and IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhaduaria decided to go in for the purchase.Out of the 24 fighters, 13 are in complete condition with engine and airframe intact with eight of them (nearly half a squadron) ready to fly after servicing. The remaining 11 fighters are partially complete but with fuel tanks and ejection seats, which will be scavenged to secure parts for IAF’s two existing squadrons of the fighter.IAF purchased around 50 fourth-generation Mirage 2000 C and B fighters way back in 1985 with a maintenance contract that expired in 2005. It signed another contract in 2015-2016 with the French original equipment manufacturer.The purchase highlights the importance of shifting spare parts and engine supply chains to India for future acquisitions as fighters abroad reach obsolescence much faster than in India. Until the Narendra Modi government took the decision of acquiring the 4.5 generation Rafale fighters (also from Dassault), the Mirage 2000 was India’s front-line fighter, a position it has held since the Kargil war. The new Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign should ensure that original equipment and spares are now manufactured in India so that there is no shortage of spares till the time the fighter is decommissioned, the people cited above said.The other issue that flows out of this last-minute acquisition is that the IAF and the Indian Navy should plan their fighter acquisition so that there is synergy between the two forces and coherence is maintained in the supply of spare parts, experts said. It also points to the need for the defence ministry to accelerate decisions on replenishing the country’s fighter fleet, especially because China has already moved to fifth-generation fighters and armed drones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-to-bolster-fighter-fleet-with-24-second-hand-mirages-101631836620386.html
17-09-2021||India||Booster dose not the focus of vaccination drive: Govt||As discussion around the administration of booster shots of Covid-19 vaccines gathers momentum across the world, India on Thursday said that, as things stand, offering third doses of the vaccine was not the central focus of any government discussion on the country’s inoculation programme.The priority, they said, was universal inoculation for the Indian population, which the government aims to achieve by the end of the year though it is running behind in terms of the daily jab rate despite an uptick in the past few weeks.“[Administering] booster doses is not the central theme at the moment in the government’s scientific and public health care discussions... getting fully vaccinated with two doses remains the major priority,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), during the Union health ministry briefing on Covid-19 on Thursday.A “booster dose” refers to an additional dose of the vaccine that is given to someone who has already built enough protection after being fully vaccinated. Since a majority of Covid-19 jabs are two-dose vaccines, booster dose in this context refers to a third shot. Health experts in countries such the US are currently engaged in a debate over whether booster doses are needed for healthy adults and whether they should be given out once the entire population is fully vaccinated. This is an important debate as it can mean that despite being fully vaccinated, rich countries may consume even more doses as several poorer nations of the world remain largely unvaccinated.Experts agreed that it crucial for India to first fully vaccinate all eligible population before considering booster shots for those who have already received both doses. “What is important is to vaccinate all adults first as per plan. Booster doses can be thought about later. That is not our immediate requirement; however, it may be needed eventually,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary and sleep medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.As for low antibody levels found in some people according to recent studies, Bharagava said that several agencies have recommended that antibody levels should not be the sole determinant of immunity against Covid-19. The study, published in the Research Square pre-print, of 614 fully vaccinated health workers in India found a significant drop in their Covid-fighting antibodies within four months of the first shot.During the briefing, health officials also called a recent article by the New York Times on India’s Covid response a “provocative, attention-seeking” piece that came at a time when the country is doing well in handling the pandemic.The NYT article said that ICMR tailored its findings to fit Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s optimistic narrative despite a looming crisis. “We greatly value journalistic and editorial freedom and at the same time we must also realise that all of us -- Union government as well as the state governments -- are fully emerged in fighting a pandemic and all our energies and time is devoted to that,” said Rajesh Bhushan, Union secretary for health and family welfare.The ICMR chief added: “This is a provocative, attention seeking article published at a time when India is doing good and our vaccination is excellent and it is diverting attention.”On the question of including children under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme, government officials said that the matter was still being deliberated upon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/booster-dose-not-the-focus-of-vaccination-drive-govt-101631824469678.html

However, two Maoists have been arrested and the combing operation has been intensified in the area.On Monday, Maoist leader Dubashi Shankar alias Mahender who was involved in at least 66 recorded incidents of Maoist violence in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, including an attack on an explosives’ warehouse of Nalco at Koraput’s Damanjodi in 2009 that led to the death of 10 jawans of CISF was arrested from Boipariguda in Koraput district by a joint team of DVF, SOG and BSF.Shankar, who was a special committee member of the Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee that operates on the borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, carried a reward of ₹20 lakh on his head. Shankar planned most Maoist ambushes on the Andhra-Odisha border and was involved in the 2009 attack on explosives’ warehouse of aluminium major Nalco at Koraput’s Damanjodi guarded by CISF jawans. The explosives stolen from the warehouse gave ample firepower to the Maoists for the next decades. He was also involved in the landmine blast at Govindpalli Ghat on the Koraput-Malkangiri border in April 2010 in which 11 policemen from Odisha were killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-from-andhra-escapes-during-police-encounter-at-odisha-s-malkangiri-101631819230334.html

Surendran, however, lost the election.Sundara had later revealed that a day after he filed the nomination papers, the BJP workers came to his place and asked him to withdraw the nomination.”They gave me the amount in cash,” Sundara had said. He had also alleged that he was threatened by the BJP workers.Following Sundara’s revelation, CPI(M) candidate V V Rameshan, who came third in the 2021 election, approached the Kasaragod district police chief seeking to register a case into the matters related to the revelation.The case was registered after recording Sundara’s statement. Later, the case was handed over to the Crime Branch.IUML’s A K M Ashraf won the seat with 65,758 votes while Surendran managed to bag 65,013 votes.

This is Bhagwat‘s first visit to Jammu and Kashmir since August 2019 when the state was bifurcated into two Union Territories; that of J&K, and Ladakh. According to the functionary, the visit had been planned for long. “This is a routine visit which is part of the sarsanghchalak’s (Bhagwat) itinerary. Earlier, because of the Covid restrictions he could not travel but now he’s going to Jammu for three days to take part in meetings related to organisational issues of the Sangh. He will also address a meeting of eminent personalities, which again is a routine outreach programme,” the functionary said. In March, Bhagwat was scheduled to address the members of the Kashmiri Pandit community through an online interaction that was part of a programme organised to pay tributes to 15th century physician Shreya Bhat and King LalitAditya of the Karkota Dynasty. The programme was eventually addressed by the general secretary of the Sangh Dattatreya Hosabale since Bhagwat was taken ill. The visit comes at a time when the Sangh has begun to gradually restart its Shakhas and in-person activities.

Moreover, it is the objective of the government to position the state as a preferred tourism destination nationally and globally,” the order, issued by Revenue-Endowments Principal Secretary G Vani Mohan, said.Tirupati attracts over 36 million worshippers annually and the TTD would vastly benefit with the addition of eminent personalities as special invitees, it added.Among the main members appointed to the Board are former minister of Puducherry Malladi Krishna Rao, YSR Congress MLA Katasani Ramabhupal Reddy, Tamil Nadu MLA A P Nanda Kumar, Karnataka MLA S R Viswanath Reddy, Shiv Sena secretary Milind Keshav Narvekar, former president of BCCI N Srinivasan and industrialist Jupalli Rameswara Rao.Tirupati MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy and AP Brahmin Welfare Corporation Chairman Sudhakar have been appointed as special invitees without any voting right.On August 8, the government appointed Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s uncle Y V Subba Reddy as TTD Chairman for a second consecutive term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ttd-gets-a-jumbo-board-52-special-invitees-included-101631818690499.html
17-09-2021||India||Bihar: Rs962 crore credited to two Class VI students’ bank accounts, probe ordered||Katihar: A day after the minor bank accounts of two Class VI students — which were opened to receive school scholarship and other government benefits — at a village in Bihar’s Katihar district were allegedly credited with a total of ₹962 crore, authorities at Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank (UBGB) on Thursday sprang into action to probe the matter. The incident came into light at Pastia village of Bhaghaura panchayat in Katihar on Wednesday when outgoing mukhiya (panchayat head), Lalan Vishwas, took some of the students to the local CSP (customers’ service point) to check whether their accounts were credited with money for books and school dress. “I was surprised when I was told about the money credited in the accounts of two Class VI students in Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank,” Vishwas said. The accounts of two students, identified as Ashish Kumar and Guruchand Vishwas, both with Belagunj branch of UBGB, showed ₹62,00,11,100 ( ₹62 crore) and ₹9,00,52,21,233 ( ₹900 crore) as balance, respectively, Vishwas said. Regional manager of UBGB, Ram Nath Mishra, on Thursday dismissed the reports, saying: “We have obtained the statement of these two accounts and found ₹100 and ₹128 in them.” “The account of Ashish Kumar has ₹100 in it while account of Guruchand Vishwas has ₹128. Both are the minor accounts,” Mishra said. “It could be a server error at the CSP. Since both are minor accounts, there is no question of any withdrawal,” he added. However, both the accounts were put on freeze after the matter was highlighted. “We are probing the matter,” Mishra said. A few days ago, a person named Ranjit Das of Khagaria district in Bihar was arrested after he refused to return ₹5.50 lakh credited in his UBGB account in April last year, claiming it was sent to him by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as help during the Covid-19 lockdown. He was arrested after bank officials lodged an FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-rs962-crore-credited-to-two-class-vi-students-bank-accounts-probe-ordered-101631818570393.html
17-09-2021||India||After row, Kannur University removes extracts from books of RSS ideologues Savarkar, Golwalkar||Thiruvananthapuram: After a two-week-long controversy, Kannur University (north Kerala) vice chancellor Gopinath Raveendran on Thursday said extracts of books of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologues VD Savarkar and MS Golwalkar would not be taught in the post-graduate course on governance and politics. The VC said the syllabus of last year will be continued this year and a decision on lessons of another ideologue Deendayal Upadhyaya will be taken soon. He said changes were made after the two-member committee appointed by the government submitted its report. Inclusion of their books invited widespread criticism in the state. Activists of the Kerala Students Union, student wing of the Congress and the Muslim Students Federation, youth wing of the Muslim League, burnt copies of their books and the Communist Party of India (CPI), an ally in the ruling Left Democratic Front, also criticised the move. But the Students Federation of India (SFI), the CP(M) student wing, and the VC maintained that these books were in a post graduate courses and let students realise their ideology too. Many others, including author and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and Governor Arif Mohammad Khan also said intellectual freedom should not be sacrificed in the name of politics. “I have quoted both, Savarkar and Golwalker, in my books and differed with their ideology. If you don’t read their books on what basis will you oppose their ideas,” asked Tharoor. “Students can learn all books and ideologies and arrive at their own conclusion. India is a free country. But banning books are not ideal,” the Governor had said while the issue raged. Extracts of VD Savarkar’s “Who is Hindu,” Golwarkar’s “We or Our Nationhood Defined”, Deendayal Upadhyaya’s “Integral Humanism” and Balraj Madhok’s “Indianisation, What, Why and How” were included in the syllabus among 30 other books.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-row-kannur-university-removes-extracts-from-books-of-rss-ideologues-savarkar-golwalkar-101631818450064.html
17-09-2021||India||Supreme Court allows immersion of Ganesh idols in Hyderabad lake||Hyderabad: As a one time measure, the Supreme Court on Thursday permitted immersion of Ganesha idols in the Hussain Sagar lake in Hyderabad city, after Vinayaka Chaturthi celebrations, on September 18. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana passed the order on a petition filed by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. The civic body had approached the top court against the September 9 order of the Telangana high court, banning the immersion of Ganesha idols made of Plaster of Paris (PoP) in the lake. While allowing the symbolic immersion, the bench emphasised that the state government ought to have taken steps to stop water pollution caused due to immersion of PoP idols on its own. “Once upon a time, the water in the lake was used for drinking. That time passed long ago. Now, I believe, a lot of money was spent on beautification... If the water is polluted again, won’t it be a waste of the money spent on the beautification?” the bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta. Mehta, appearing for the civic body and the state government, argued that the HC order was well-intentioned but was passed in the middle of the celebrations. He assured the bench that there would be symbolic immersion of the idols which will be removed by the government through cranes deployed at the site and will be transported to solid waste dumping sites within 24 hours. Granting the relaxation to the state government for “one last time,” the bench observed that it was not supporting the government by staying the high court order but was acting on an assurance that there would be no immersion of PoP idols from next year. The court also took note that the high court order was passed when the celebrations were on and it would not be possible for the state government to implement all the directions immediately. The bench then stayed the high court order while asking the civic body and the state government to file their affidavits with assurances on stopping the immersion from next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-allows-immersion-of-ganesh-idols-in-hyderabad-lake-101631818392628.html

In the complaint registered with police, the woman - Renuka Kambale - claimed that a nurse in the district hospital had convinced her to sell her child for ₹5,000 and on August 26, she had sold the baby. In her statement to police, the woman said she delivered the baby in the district hospital on August 19. During that time, Renuka told Kasturi, a nurse, about financial problems at her home and Kasturi told her that if she is unable to take care of the baby, there are people ready to buy the child. On August 26, Renuka handed over her baby to Kasturi’s husband Manjunath and received a payment of ₹5,000. A few days later, repenting of the decision, Renuka returned to the district hospital and asked the nurse to return her child.When Kasturi avoided, there was an altercation between them. Later, she filed a complaint with the childline and then police. Police said initially, she didn’t talk about the sales but later during the interrogation, she opened up. Subsequently, police registered a case against Kasturi, Manjunath, and another man. All three are under police custody. According to police, so far they haven’t been able to track the baby. Childline is an emergency phone service for children in need of aid and assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-woman-moves-police-to-get-back-child-she-sold-earlier-for-5000-101631818094952.html

His statement assumes much significance as the state is witnessing a raging debate over the controversial remark of the Pala Bishop on “narcotic jihad”. “Kerala is a state known for its secular credentials and amity. We have noticed that some forces are trying to disrupt this. Stringent action will be taken against them,” he said, while addressing top officials of the state. He asked police not to spare anyone trying to wedge a difference in the society. “We will not allow anyone to foil the communal amity. Such forces will be sternly dealt with,” he said, adding people who take to social media to spread hatred will not be spared. Last week, the CM came down heavily against the Bishop’s statement saying social evils have no religion and it is not proper to put everything into the account of a particular community. He also made it clear that the government will not book the senior religious leader. Bishop Mar Joseph Kallaranghatt, while addressing a religious congregation in one of the churches in Pala (Kottayam) on Sept 9, had said Catholic girls and youth were becoming victims of “narcotic jihad” and decried authorities for turning a blind eye towards it. Though the opposition Congress criticised the Bishop in strong terms initially, later it toned it down. Meanwhile, actor-turned politician Suresh Gopi, BJP Rajya Sabha MP, called on the Bishop and pledged support. “Our meeting was cordial and we discussed all issues,” he said in Pala. Though many religious leaders and intelligentsia asked the Bishop to clear the air saying he was only referring to the social evil (growing use of narcotics among youth) he’s yet to dilute his statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nobody-will-be-allowed-to-dent-communal-harmony-kerala-cm-101631818092501.html

This is the first time a political party is seeking caste-based census in the state. Talking to mediapersons in Kozhikode (north Kerala), party leader KP A Majeed said there is no point in deferring the social reality and the party will first raise this in the next UDF meeting and later take it up with the government. He said the present reservation system was based on an old census and there are complaints that only a section of the backward classes are enjoying the benefit of reservation. Recently, Bihar assembly had passed a unanimous resolution and later an all-party team had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention. Later, Bihar chief minister Nitish Yadav said he was optimistic and the Centre would take a speedy decision. “We feel in Kerala too it should be done. As long as reservation continues it is a natural process and we can’t postpone it like this. It will help some of the most backward classes which failed to get the benefits,” he said. When asked whether such an exercise will aggravate simmering social tension he said parties can’t run away from reality for long. He said the state government should talk to all parties and social organisation to reach a consensus. In Kerala, Muslims enjoy 10% reservation in government jobs and 12% in educational institutions. In the state, SC/ST communities get 10% and others backward section gets 40% reservation, including Muslims and a section of Christians. According to 2011 census, 54.73% population are Hindus, Muslims 26.56%, Christians 18.38% and 0.33% belong to other religions or have no religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-ally-muslim-league-calls-for-caste-based-census-in-kerala-101631818090071.html

I accept his expression of regret & am happy to put this unfortunate episode behind us.” “We must work together to strengthen @INCIndia in Telengana & across the country,” the MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.Tagging AICC in-charge for Telangana Manickam Tagore, Reddy also said that he knows Tharoor joins him in wanting the Congress to win the support of the public to form the next government in Telangana. Tharoor responded by saying, “Absolutely. Onward & upward!” Reddy asserted that every congress soldier will strive towards reaching this goal in Telangana.Following the media report which quoted Reddy as making a derogatory reference to Tharoor and criticising him and Telangana minister K T Rama Rao, the Congress’ state chief tweeted, “Born liar and looter @KTRTRS can’t get away with hiding behind @ShashiTharoor ji and Fake news.” “It’s clear that you are trying to mislead current issues of child molestation and corruption charges against your family,” Reddy said.Taking strong objection to Reddy’s reported remarks, senior Congress leader Manish Tewari addressed Reddy on Twitter and said Tharoor “is a valued colleague of yours & mine”.“It would have been better if you (Reddy) would have spoken to him if you had some misgivings about a purported statement of his. Grace & Propriety demands you withdraw your words,” Tewari said.Another Congress leader Salman Anees Soz agreed with Tewari’s remarks and tweeted, “Dear Mr @revanth_anumula I couldn’t agree more. @ShashiTharoor is a terrific leader who isn’t about to join a race to the bottom.” “He is one of the foremost critics of the RSS & BJP. He fights for India & INC everyday.

17-09-2021||India||Another former AIADMK minister booked in DA case||Chennai: Officials of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) on Thursday held searches at 35 locations, including two in Bengaluru and six in Chennai, of former Tamil Nadu minister and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader KC Veeramani in connection with a disproportionate assets case. From the raids, officials seized nine luxury cars including a Rolls Royce, 1.9 lakhs worth of cash in US dollars, 275 units of sand worth ₹30 lakhs, gold and diamond jewellery and five hard disks, the DVAC said in a statement.Veeramani is the third former AIADMK minister, besides MR Vijayabaskar and SP Velumani, to come under the DVAC net after MK Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government came to power in May this year. Veeramani hasn’t spoken on the corruption charges levelled against him, but his supporters promptly gathered outside his house to protest the raids. His party also issued a statement, complaining that the raids were prompted by “political vendetta”.A first information report (FIR) registered by the vigilance directorate on Wednesday said Veeramani was “involved in corrupt activities” and acquired assets disproportionate to his income by 654% between 2016 and 2021 when he was a minister of commercial taxes in the AIADMK government.“Searches are ongoing in 28 places across the state and including four in Chennai,” a senior DVAC official said on the condition of anonymity, as he is not authorised to speak to the media.The two-time legislator won the 2011 and 20116 assembly elections from the Jolarpet constituency in Tirupathur district, 200 km north of Chennai. Veeramani, however, lost the seat to his DMK rival by a little less than 1,100 votes in the assembly elections held earlier this year.Arappor Iyakkam, a non-profit that first filed a complaint against Veeramani, alleged that the AIADMK leader started indulging in corruption in 2011 when he first became a legislator and minister in the J Jayalalithaa government and oversaw departments of school education and Tamil culture apart from holding additional charge as health minister in his first term.In the FIR, the DVAC said investigators decided to focus on his second term since he held charge of the sensitive commercial taxes department. During this period, the FIR said, his assets increased from ₹25.9 crore to ₹56.6 crore while his income was estimated to be ₹4.3 crore and expenses were pegged at ₹2.56 crore.The FIR further said Veeramani acquired properties and pecuniary resources in his name and in the name of his mother, C Maniyamal.The FIR, which accused him of criminal misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act, said he was estimated to have acquired assets worth ₹28.7 crore, “which works out to be 654% more than his total income.”The AIADMK has already formed an internal legal committee to help party leaders fight cases registered against them by the DMK government.Former transport minister MR Vijayabhaskar was the first prominent AIADMK leader to be raided by the vigilance team in July this year. DVAC officials had then claimed to have seized ₹25.5 lakh in cash, sale deeds, and other documents.In August, DVAC went after AIADMK heavyweight and former municipal administration minister SP Velumani, who is known to be close to former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami.Last year, the DMK, while still in the opposition, submitted a list of corruption charges to outgoing Governor Banwarilal Purohit against half a dozen AIADMK ministers, and later in the run-up to the assembly elections, promised to establish a special court to try such graft cases.“The DMK hasn’t been able to fulfil its election promises so they are foisting false cases against our leaders,” the AIADMK said in a statement. A DMK leader without wishing to be named said that it was their election promise to bring corrupt former leaders to book. “They have to pay for their actions now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-former-aiadmk-minister-booked-in-dacase-101631817972897.html
17-09-2021||India||Synthetic drug manufacturing unit busted in Bengaluru||Bengaluru: The Central Crime Branch (CCB) raided a synthetic drug manufacturing unit and arrested a Nigerian national in Bengaluru on Wednesday. Following the raid, four kilograms of MDMA, a psychoactive drug worth approximately ₹2 crore was seized, said police. Sandeep Patil, the joint commissioner of police (crime), said the arrested man, identified as John, rented a house in Electronics City to manufacture the synthetic drugs. “He used to produce the drugs in the house using raw materials collected from medical stores in the city, and sold them with the help of a network of associates,” he said. The gang used to supply drugs in various parts of the city by storing them in a hidden compartment in a custom-made shoe. “Apart from selling it in Bengaluru, they sent it to New Zealand as well,” Patil added. The officer added that during the raid, documents related to the couriers sent abroad were found. “Since the tracking number was available, we have asked for these packages to be returned. We will use this as evidence in the court,” the officer said. Patil said that raw materials used by the suspects were easily available in the market. It still remains unclear how John learned to make the synthetic drug. “The quantity found at the house, which is around 4 kg, is a large quantity. The drug is sold in grams and he had enough stock to last a while. But this is a rare incident of drugs being manufactured in the city, we don’t have any information about any such manufacturing units,” he said. Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said that John came to Bengaluru around a month back, before which he was living in New Delhi since 2018. “The interrogation of the suspect is underway. We have found leftover raw materials at the house, which clearly indicates that he was manufacturing the substance there. Following the interrogation and arrest of his associates, we will be able to get more information about the racket,” Pant said. Officers in the CCB said that police raided the house based on a tip-off. Following the raid, large quantities of raw materials such as acetone, hypophosphorous acid, plain acid, sodium hydroxide among others were found. The police have also seized measuring cylinder plastic, heating mantle, flask boiling, face mask, PH measure stick, hose pipe, panel, and shoes used to transport the crystals. This is the first time such a manufacturing unit has been located by the police, who are on the lookout for other suspects in the case. As per the data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Bengaluru recorded the second-highest number of cases under the (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985). In 2020, Bengaluru booked 2,766 cases under NDPS, second to Mumbai which recorded 3,509 cases. This was a considerable increase in comparison to 768 cases registered in 2019. Pant said that the increase in the number of cases is the result of an ongoing campaign against drugs in the city. “In 2020, the number of cases registered under NDPS has gone up. These numbers will be much higher in 2021 since our teams have been relentlessly chasing drug traffickers in the city. We have reported some of the biggest drug busts in the state this year,” Pant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/synthetic-drug-manufacturing-unit-busted-in-bengaluru-101631817791349.html
17-09-2021||India||Climate Action Tracker rates India’s climate action ‘highly insufficient’||India’s nationally determined contribution (NDC), which was rated as 2 degrees compatible or “almost sufficient” by the Climate Action Tracker until last month, has now rated India as “highly insufficient” in its action and policies on climate change.This is because Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis that tracks government climate action and measures it against Paris Agreement goals, has updated its rating system on Wednesday.Only Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, Nepal and United Kingdom have been rated as “almost sufficient” and only Gambia is “sufficient” or 1.5 degree compatible. USA, which used to be rated as “critically insufficient”, is now “insufficient” as per the new rating system, after incorporating US President Joe Biden administration’s new climate policies.Describing CAT’s new rating system, its website states that according to many fair share assessments, it would be considered fair that some countries continue emitting at high levels. “We are now in a situation where these countries can no longer follow a high emissions path, but other, richer countries do need to help them to rapidly decarbonise. We’ve also seen that it’s not only targets that matter, but the policies that governments put in place to meet those targets. The CAT not only evaluates government targets, but we also provide an estimate of countries’ emissions given implemented action,” adding that the new rating system takes a more granular look at domestic policies of countries.Under India’s current targets and policies, emissions will continue to rise and are consistent with 4 degree C or more of warming shows a modelled domestic emissions pathway according to CAT. India’s NDC has three main elements--an economy-wide emissions intensity target of 33%–35% below 2005 levels; electric power capacity target of 40% installed capacity from non-fossil-based energy resources by 2030 (conditional to international support); and creating a carbon sink expansion target of creating an additional (cumulative) carbon sink of 2.5–3 GtCO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. CAT has rated the 40% non-fossil energy as “Critically insufficient” and the emissions intensity target as “Highly insufficient.”If all countries were to follow India’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C according to CAT. The rating is based on what global least cost modelled domestic pathways say India needs to be doing, with international support, to achieve the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree C limit. As of July 2021, India had 39% non-fossil installed capacity based on Central Electricity Authority’s data.India is poised to achieve its 40% non-fossil capacity target a decade early. India is on track to achieve around 60-65% of non-fossil installed capacity by 2030 states CAT. “If India were to achieve the top of that range - 65% non-fossil installed capacity in 2030 - instead, our rating would improve, but only by one category to ‘Highly insufficient’. Even if India is not responsible for paying for all reductions, it should plan on how fast it could reduce its emissions if there were sufficient international support available, and not to lock into a high carbon future. This would mean to begin phasing out coal use and adopt emission reduction plans across the economy, and to clearly specify what international support it requires to achieve this goal,” CAT states. India’s current policies also indicate rising, rather than falling of emissions and is not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree C temperature limit. India also doesn’t have net -zero emissions target by 2050, flags CAT which is supported by several foundations and governments including the European Climate Foundation and the German Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) etc.Among various other policies, CAT has highlighted that while India has been reducing its share of global coal power, it continues to be the second largest coal pipeline globally, behind China and has over 200 GW of coal-fired capacity in operation. The Central Electricity Authority projects this will increase to almost 266 GW over the next few years. There is a significant risk that India’s coal assets will be stranded, especially when considering that two thirds of India’s coal-fired power plants were built in the last 10 years, CAT states.Interestingly, India has used CAT’s analysis several times in the past to showcase that it was among few countries globally to have a 2 degree C compliant NDC.“Countries should be assessed on the promises delivered not just words but deeds,” said a senior environment ministry official who did not wish to be named, responding to the analysis.“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has given the world a ‘code red’ warning on the dangers of climate change reinforcing the urgent need for the world to halve emissions by 2030. An increasing number of people around the world are suffering from ever more severe and frequent impacts of climate change, yet government action continues to lag behind what is needed. While many governments have committed to net zero, without near-term action achieving net zero is virtually impossible,” said Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, a CAT partner on the CAT website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-action-tracker-rates-india-s-climate-action-highly-insufficient-101631817670113.html
17-09-2021||India||Murder of man inside Bengaluru football stadium result of fight over playground: Police||Bengaluru: The murder of Aravind, 27, inside the Bengaluru football stadium was a result of a conflict over a playground and it was in the planning for weeks, Bengaluru police said on Thursday, a day after four suspects were arrested. On September 12, Aravind, a rowdy-sheeter in the city, was chased and killed in the football stadium before an A-division women’s league match. “The gang of four people was waiting for Aravind at a smaller ground adjacent to the stadium. They had information about Aravind coming there to meet his friend, who was playing in the tournament. The plan was to murder during the match. But Aravind managed to escape and ran into the stadium, where was hacked to death,” said Kamal Pant, Bengaluru police commissioner. The arrested men have been identified as Stalin, who is also a rowdy-sheeter with KG Halli police station, Louis Jack, Arun Kumar, and Vijay Kumar. One suspect is still at large. According to Pant, the murder was a retaliatory attack. “The rivalry had started some time ago, over a public ground. Arvind, who is a rowdy sheeter, used to organize games, and the domination over the ground was a contested issue. Sometime last year, there was an altercation between Aravind and Stalin’s brother. Aravind assaulted him during this. A case was registered and the Aravind was let off on station bail,” the officer said. A senior officer said this incident had led to bad blood between both parties. However, in November 2020, Prashant was sent to jail for around 40 days after the Goonda act was slapped against him. “When he came out of jail there was another altercation with Stalin’s brother. This time, they assaulted him, stripped his clothes, and took some photos. When this news reached Stalin he planned for the murder of the Prashant,” said the official. Incidentally, it was believed that Prashant was involved in a plan to kidnap Vinay, then personal assistant to BJP leader and now minister KS Eshwarappa, in 2017. But police confirmed that he was not involved in the case. “We have interrogated the suspects, who have explained motive behind the murder. We were able to verify details given by them,” Pant said. The motive was control over a playground. Meanwhile, Bengaluru police said following the lockdowns there has been an increase in gang-related crimes in the city. Pant said since June since the lockdown was relaxed, there have been 41 murders in the city. Out of these 13 were related to family disputes, the reasons being five feuds between friends, five were over relationships and 5 were over gang wars. A crime branch officer said while it will be difficult to track murders related to family issues and personal matters, police are keeping a tab on the gang-related activities in the city. “The lockdown had put a lid on such incident it is possible that the instances may increase in the coming days. Our networks are looking out for any planned gang attacks,” said the official, who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/murder-of-man-inside-bengaluru-football-stadium-result-of-fight-over-playground-police-101631817610106.html
17-09-2021||India||Karnataka’s new bill seeks to collect samples of prisoners for surveillance||The Basavaraj Bommai-led government has tabled the Identification of Prisoners (Karnataka Amendment) Bill, 2021 for authorities to collect blood, DNA, voice, and retina samples in addition to fingerprints, footprints and photographs of persons imprisoned for over one month. The amendment reduces the earlier prison term of one year to one month to monitor repeat offenders and contain the growing rate of crime in the state.The bill was tabled in the ongoing monsoon session in Karnataka assembly on Tuesday. The amended bill seeks to include collection of blood, DNA, voice, and iris scan samples under the definition of the word “measurements” of offender for effective surveillance and prevention of breach of peace and crime.According to the amendment from the original bill in 1920, the words “rigorous imprisonment for a term of one year”, will be substituted with “imprisonment for a term of one month”, according to the newly tabled bill. The amendment also includes giving powers to superintendents of police and deputy commissioners of police to order the collection of samples which was earlier only with the magistrates. Data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Wednesday shows that the Karnataka police recorded a conviction rate of 51.2% in cases registered under the Indian Penal Code while their counterparts have registered a far higher number, Hindustan Times reported.ST Ramesh, the former Director and Inspector General of Police (DG & IGP) of Karnataka said that the existing act allows for collection and storage of photographs, finger and footprints.“I don’t see any problem because Iris (collection technology) did not exist earlier. It has come 20-25 years back and it is settled and we have access to this technology. DNA was a nascent kind of forensic science and it has been established and in Karnataka also we have a DNA centre and it is a very important forensic tool,” Ramesh said. He added that voice identification assumes importance since we live in the digital age and voice happens through phone and other online mediums. He said that the colonial acts including the Indian Penal Code and evidence act “assumes a certain distrust of the police” as confessions made before such officials are not admissible in court. However, he said that the SP and DCPs have already been empowered with significant powers and there is no reason that they should not be trusted on this one as well.“You do not have to give extra weightage to a police officer’s statement but don’t undermine it also,” he said. The bill also has a provision of destruction of photographs and records on measures of acquittal.“Where any person who, not having been previously convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of one month or more has has his measurements taken or has been photographed in accordance with the provisions of this Act is released without trial or discharged or acquitted by any court, all measurements and all photographs (both negatives and copies) so taken shall, unless the Court or or the District Magistrate or the Superintendent of Police or the Sub-Divisional magistrate or in any area for a which a Commissioner of Police has been appointed, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, for reason to be recorded in writing, otherwise directs, be destroyed or made over to him after a lapse of ten years from the date of such acquittal or after the said person attains the age of Sixty, whichever is later,” according to the amendment.However, experts voiced concerns over the specification of the prisoner who will be subject to this collection of such evidence, storage and issues regarding privacy and right to life.The bill adds to apprehensions of the technology and its use to solve crimes or create a database.“The state has to impress upon us (public, courts and society at large) as to how the security aspect will be taken care of. If it does not match the standard operating procedure, then this will be a most dangerous exercise,” Dr Dinesh Rao, a forensics expert said.Though there is consensus that scientific evidence would help to solve crimes and rate of conviction, Rao said that it was important to categorise the offences.He said that a technology that should be used for terror, mafia and drug-related or other heinous crimes of such intensity should be subject to this law and not all offences and sought to know if a sophisticated process like DNA will be used even for crimes like theft, civil or marital cases.Though such scientific evidence is crucial for solving crimes, the proposal comes at a time when investigation authorities continue to revert to old school techniques like fingerprint and photographs.Even though Bengaluru is known as the technology capital of the country, the city police were using the archaic method of using ink for taking fingerprints until two months ago. It was only in January this year that the state police launched a digital database of fingerprints and introduced software from Japan to record and compare fingerprints from a central database, Hindustan Times reported in February.The DNA Technology Bill is pending before the parliament. However, DNA tests are performed at a very low and limited rate in India, according to a PTI report in August.There are approximately just 30-40 DNA experts in 15-18 forensic labs who conduct less than 3000 tests per year, the report said.But experts who did side with the creation of a national DNA database also highlighted the importance of handling sensitive biological data and a strong regulatory framework among other requirements to prevent any misuse.Rao also pointed out that law enforcement authorities have still not been given access to Aadhar database as yet which makes the system redundant to identify suspected persons or worse, unclaimed and unidentified dead bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnatakas-new-bill-seeks-to-collect-samples-of-prisoners-for-surveillance-101631817550140.html
17-09-2021||India||Karnataka assembly clears bill to limit poll panel’s powers||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in Karnataka on Thursday managed to get the contentious Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat (Amendment) Bill passed in the lower house amid heated exchanges between the ruling and opposition parties with the latter choosing to walkout after at least three and half hours of discussion.The bill was tabled on Tuesday at the ongoing monsoon session of the state legislature. The proposed law will in effect take away the powers from the state election commission and give the government the powers to set up the commission who will be tasked with the duties.The bill, discussed amidst heated exchange on political history and reservation, proposes to take away delimitation and powers of allocation of reservations of wards and other segments or rural panchayats and done by a commission set up by the government, which the opposition said, was a ploy by the BJP and “an assault on the constitution.”KR Ramesh Kumar, senior Congress leader and former assembly speaker, said the bill was a “manipulation to stall progress, bring down the importance of local self parties and an assault on the constitution of the country”.The opposition accused the BJP of trying to use the bill to further stall the yet-to-be announced zilla and taluka panchayat elections.In August, the Karnataka high court declined to interfere in delimitation of wards in zilla and taluka panchayat that were carried out by the state election authorities.Priyank Kharge, a Congress legislator and former minister, said the government has filed a writ petition before the court challenging the delimitation and reservations made by the state election commission as “arbitrary, illegal and ultra vires.”The tabling of the bill comes at a time when all three political parties are gearing up to face the zilla and taluka panchayat polls, expected to be held later this year or early next year, which would be a good indicator to gauge the mood of the grassroots ahead of the 2023 assembly elections.The Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) set aside their bitter rivalry to oppose the bill against an adamant ruling party who had made it clear that the proposal had to be passed on Thursday and be sent to the upper house before submitting it to the court on Monday.JC Madhuswamy, Karnataka’s minister for law, parliamentary affairs and minor irrigation, said delimitation should not be under the state election commission as there is no connection between the two and the only job of poll authorities is to “supervise, monitor and conduct elections”.“We are not against reservation,” Madhuswamy said, fending off accusations that the BJP was trying to impose reservations that would be beneficial to the saffron party in the upcoming polls.HD Revanna, a senior JD(S) leader, said the BJP was eyeing Hassan and Mandya, two JD(S) stronghold districts with the passage of this bill. “Both national parties (Congress and BJP) have an eye on Hassan and Mandya. Even if you make the reservation as ST (scheduled tribe), you wont be able to shake us (JD(S)).”The BJP is trying to expand its support base beyond Lingayats and to communities like Vokkaligas and the backward classes to help the saffron party come back to power on its own in 2023.Caste plays an important role in Karnataka’s social and political life.The BJP is known to have the backing of the Lingayats while the Congress largely enjoys the support of the minorities and backward classes. The JD(S) has been backed firmly by the Vokkaligas, another dominant community found in large numbers in the Old Mysuru region, where the BJP has been trying hard to penetrate to accomplish its goal of returning to power with a full majority.“They are trying to make a very significant change to this bill. If it was done with good intent it was fine, but this is being done with bad intent,” Siddaramaiah, the Congress’s leader of the opposition said. He added that the ruling party can take another date from the court and do not have to pass the bill in haste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-assembly-clears-bill-to-limit-poll-panel-s-powers-101631817490122.html
17-09-2021||India||Union minister Bhupender Yadav to attend closed-door meeting on climate targets on UNGA sidelines||New Delhi: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav will likely participate in an informal meeting called by UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, and UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson ahead of the UN climate change negotiations (COP 26) in Glasgow, to discuss how nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of major emitters can be enhanced to meet the 1.5 degree warming goal.The meeting will be held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, on Monday September 20. The Informal Climate Leaders Roundtable on Climate Action follows the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and comes less than six weeks before the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. According to senior officials in the UN, the agenda of the meeting will be a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels and climate mitigation and adaptation finance, particularly the commitment to mobilise 100 billion dollars per year by 2020 by developed countries.IPCC’s report last month flagged that the world may have lost the opportunity to keep global warming under 1.5 degree C over pre-industrial levels. The 1.5 degree C global warming threshold is likely to be breached in the next 10 to 20 years by 2040 even if carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decline rapidly to net zero around 2050, it said.“Environment minister Bhupender Yadav has been nominated to represent India. It is a closed-door meeting on climate change with UN secretary general,” said a senior environment ministry official who asked not to be named. Yadav recently said that the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 is not enough to deal with the climate crisis. The need of the hour is “deeds: and not “plain words” to deal with climate change and reaching “net zero” alone is not enough, a statement from the environment ministry said on Tuesday. It stressed that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report published recently is a clarion call for developed countries to undertake immediate deep emission cuts and decarbonize their economies,  Guterres said on Thursday that he expects COP 26 to be a turning point and all countries to commit to a target of net zero emissions by 2050. “COP26 this November must mark that turning point. By then we need all countries to commit to achieve net zero emissions by the middle of this century and to present clear, credible long-term strategies to get there. We need all countries to present more ambitious and achievable Nationally Determined Contributions that will together cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. Nothing less will do.”Achieving a net zero emission target implies that all remaining human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are balanced out by removing GHGs from the atmosphere in a process known as carbon removal. For this human-caused emissions from industries, vehicles etc should be reduced to near zero.Guterres released a new report by multiple international scientific agencies titled “United in Science” on Thursday which flagged that fossil fuel emissions from coal, gas, cement etc are back at 2019 levels or even higher in 2021. Fossil CO2 emissions from coal, oil, gas and cement peaked at 36.64 GtCO2 in 2019, followed by a significant drop of 1.98 GtCO2 (5.6%) in 2020 due to the Covid 19 pandemic. Based on preliminary estimates, global emissions in the power and industry sectors were already at the same level or higher in January-July 2021 than in the same period in 2019, before the pandemic, the United in Science report said. It cited data from the Global Carbon Project which indicates that between January and May 2021 the reduction in CO2 emissions was around 1% vis a vis 2019 compared to a 9% reduction in 2020. China has recorded a substantial increase in CO2 emissions in 2021 compared to 2019. India’s CO2 emissions have increased compared to peak of the pandemic period in 2020 but are still about 4% lower compared to 2019 in the January- May 2021 period.United in Science is coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with inputs from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the Global Carbon Project (GCP).Concentrations of all major greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (NO) continued to increase in 2020 and the first half of 2021, the report said adding that overall emissions reductions in 2020 likely reduced the annual increase of the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases “but this effect was too small to be distinguished from natural variability.”The report has also flagged that there still remains a large gap between NDCs and the emission reduction needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals of keeping global warming under 2 degrees, and preferably under 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.NDCs in mid-November 2020 remained largely inadequate to achieve the climate goals of the Paris Agreement and would lead to a temperature increase of at least 3 degree C by the end of the century, it added. Countries must collectively increase their NDC ambitions threefold to get on track to a 2 degree C goal and more than fivefold to get on track to the 1.5 degree C goal, it said. Preliminary estimates of the impact of NDC target updates in 2021 by the US, the EU and the United Kingdom, and announcements of Canada, China and Japan, indicate that emissions projections could be reduced by 12%–15% compared with the projection in 2020. “This is still far from sufficient to bridge the emissions gap in 2030,” the report said.“We need an NDC+ strategy now because we need climate action as a co-benefit agenda. We need to articulate what we will do to mitigate local and global emissions. The driver will be reducing local emissions but will also help reduce global emissions. We need a plan now because it’s important for the people of India,” said Sunita Narain, director general of Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-bhupender-yadav-to-attend-closed-door-meeting-on-climate-targets-on-unga-sidelines-101631817190465.html
17-09-2021||India||‘Agenda of spreading lies’: PM Modi hits out at critics of Central Vista revamp||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday took a dig at critics of the ambitious Central Vista revamp plan, saying that they are likely to ignore the good coming out of the project because their agenda is only to spread lies about what the government is doing. Modi’s comments came during the inauguration of defence office complexes at Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue that will together accommodate more than 7,000 defence officials. These officials are moving into the new offices from their decades-old workplaces in a clutch of pre-Independence era hutments in the vicinity of the North and South Blocks to make way for the Central Vista revamp. Some of these hutments served as barracks and as stables for British Army horses more than 75 years ago. “Those people who are forcefully opposing the Central Vista project will very cleverly stay quiet on this aspect of project that offices have been created for 7,000 defence officials, because they know that their agenda of spreading lies will be exposed. But today the country is seeing what we are doing under the project,” the PM said. The total cost of the Central Vista revamp is estimated to be around ₹20,000 crore. The redevelopment has been criticised by the Opposition as wasteful expenditure at a time when the country is battling the Covid-19 pandemic. Addressing a gathering of defence officials at the Africa Avenue complex, the PM said that with the inauguration of the two complexes, India has taken another step in developing the nation’s capital according to the needs and aspirations of a new India in the country’s 75th year of India’s independence. He said that for decades, defence-related work was being carried out from hutments constructed during the Second World War to serve as stables and barracks. “This new defence office complex will strengthen the efforts of making the working of our defence forces convenient and effective,” he said. He said work on the two complexes has been completed way ahead of time --- it was to be completed in 24 months but took only 12 months. “When policies and intentions are clear, willpower is strong and efforts honest, everything is possible,” the PM said, adding that modern infrastructure played an important role in ease of living and ease of doing business. “The ongoing construction work of Central Vista is going on with this thought only,” he said. Optimal use of available land with various departments of the government was a priority, he said. The complex at Africa Avenue is spread across four blocks and offers a space of 5.08 lakh square feet while the KG Marg facility has three blocks and an office area of 4.52 lakh square feet. The new office complexes have been constructed at a cost of ₹775 crore provided by the defence ministry, with the work carried out by the ministry of housing and urban affairs as part of the Central Vista project. The two complexes together have parking space for 1,500 cars. According to the Central Vista plan approved by the Centre, the North and South Block office complexes will be turned into national museums, the Indira Gandhi National Centre will be relocated, and the National Archives will be remodelled. The Prime Minister’s residence will be shifted behind the existing South Block complex while the residence of the Vice President is proposed to be relocated behind North Block. HT on June 30 reported the vice president’s enclave and the new Parliament House will be the first buildings to be completed, and work on shifting the national museum to the North and South Block will commence last, in the elaborate plan for the Central Vista revamp that requires moving people and offices over the course of the next six years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agenda-of-spreading-lies-pm-modi-hits-out-at-critics-of-central-vista-revamp-101631817010156.html
17-09-2021||India||Roads institutions in J-K to be named after poets, academics, slain cops||An award-winning Dogri littérateur, a policeman lynched by a mob, and a former Doordarshan director gunned down by militants will have roads, schools and government-owned institutions named after them in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, people familiar with the matter said. A senior government functionary said a long list of names has been drawn up for this, which will be the state’s tribute to academic and literary stalwarts and also to those who laid down their lives in the line of duty. The proposed list includes poet Padma Sachdev who passed away in August; deputy superintendent of Jammu and Kashmir Police Mohammed Ayub Pandith, who was lynched by a mob outside a mosque in Kashmir in 2017; and Lassa Kaul, who, as Doordarshan director in 1990, was gunned down by militants outside his house. Also on the list are Makbool Sherwani, a National Conference worker who played a key role in holding off Pakistani intruders in 1947 and bought time for the Indian military to arrive; celebrated poet Dina Nath Nadim, who played a stellar role in Kashmir’s progressive movement; noted poet, broadcaster and freedom fighter Sarwanand Koul Premi, who was gunned down along with his son Virendra in 1990; J&K Police inspector Arshad Ahmed Khan who died in a fidayeen attack in Anantnag in 2019; and Brigadier Rajendra Singh who died fighting Pakistani raiders in Kashmir in 1947. The list was drawn up after consultation with local people in each district of Jammu and Kashmir; also surveyed were members of the panchayat and district development councils, the police and the paramilitary. “The renaming drive is being undertaken to acknowledge distinguished citizens. The divisional commissioners of Jammu and Kashmir have been asked to come up with more names and the places that can be named after them. To ensure proper representation from each of the 20 districts, the deputy commissioners have also been asked to send in suggestions,” said the functionary quoted above. To pick the roads, areas, or institutions that will be renamed, the administration is looking at those whose names have no historical relevance. For instance, it hasn’t found the name Bhatindi (an area in Jammu) in any of the old gazette notifications. “There are many places with names that have no relevance or historical detail. For example, the Zero Bridge in Kashmir. It could be named after any of the eminent people,” the functionary said. Last week, the Srinagar district administration recommended the renaming of a college in Hyderpora after playwright Padma Shri Moti Lal Keemu, and a street in downtown Kashmir after Kashmiri poet Zinda Koul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-roads-and-institutions-to-be-named-after-poets-academics-slain-cops-101631816709395.html
17-09-2021||India||India maintains silence as China fumes over AUKUS||India on Thursday opted to maintain a studied silence on the creation of a new security partnership by Australia, the UK and the US, apparently due to sensitivities related to the strategic situation in the region and ties with key partners. The new alliance called AUKUS was unveiled by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden against the backdrop of China’s assertive actions across the Indo-Pacific, and its first initiative is aimed at equipping Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. China strongly criticised the trilateral partnership, saying it would severely damage regional security and spark an arms race. France was angered by Australia’s decision to scrap a $90-billion programme to build 12 French-designed submarines and instead opt for nuclear-powered vessels. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India did not want to be seen as embracing a new security alliance that is a counter to China’s assertive actions, especially at a time when New Delhi and Beijing are engaged in a dragging military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that is not close to being fully resolved. At the same time, India is sensitive to the concerns of France, a key strategic and defence partner that has supplied advanced military hardware such as the Rafale combat jets, the people said. Asked about the launch of AUKUS at a regular media briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “I do not have anything to share on this at this moment, on AUKUS or related stuff.” The new partnership was launched days ahead of the first in-person summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad in Washington on September 24. The meeting, being held six months after the maiden virtual Quad Summit, will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, Australian Prime Minister Morrison and US President Biden. On Wednesday, Australia’s top leadership spoke to their Indian counterparts to brief them about the launch of AUKUS. Modi said in a tweet he and Morrison had “exchanged perspectives on regional developments” and the upcoming Quad Summit. Australian foreign minister Marise Payne made a phone call to her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, while defence minister Peter Dutton spoke to his counterpart Rajnath Singh. Responding to another question at the briefing on whether the launch of AUKUS could dilute the impact of the in-person Quad Summit, Bagchi said the upcoming meeting of the four leaders in Washington stands on its own. “I think the Quad summit stands on its own. It is extremely important as I mentioned. Clearly, the Quad partners attach a lot of importance to it. You can see that in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, an in-person summit is happening. I would not like to comment or speculate on the implications (of AUKUS). As I said, I don’t have much to say on the AUKUS initiative for the moment,” he said. Bagchi noted that Jaishankar had highlighted the importance of Quad as a platform where four countries had come together for their own benefit and the benefit of the world. The Quad is tackling the immediate issues of the day, including vaccine supply chains, education, maritime security, climate change, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and connectivity infrastructure, and its four members have a shared vision for a free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific based on respect for international law, he added. However, France’s foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and defence minister Florence Parly said in a joint statement that Australia’s decision to scrap the submarine deal was contrary to the letter and the spirit of cooperation between the two countries, based on a relationship of political trust. Australia’s decision to go with the American choice leads to the removal of an ally and a European partner from a relationship at a time of “unprecedented challenges in the Indo-Pacific region”, and “marks an absence of coherence that France can only...regret”, the two ministers said. The cooperation between the US and Australia through AUKUS is expected to build on the initiatives the two countries are engaged in under the framework of the Quad. AUKUS also dovetails with the Boris Johnson government’s tilt towards the Indo-Pacific under a comprehensive revamp of foreign and security policies in order to unlock new opportunities across the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-maintains-silence-as-china-fumes-over-aukus-101631816592451.html
17-09-2021||India||Ten DCPs paid ₹40 cr each to Deshmukh, Parab: Sachin Vaze tells ED||Mumbai: Dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze in his statement to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has claimed that ₹40 crore was collected from ten deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) and “paid to former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and transport minister Anil Parab” for “letting the order of then city police commissioner Param Bir Singh to transfer them go through”. In the statement recorded by ED on June 19 at Taloja jail, 52-year-old Vaze claimed that Deshmukh and Parab were not happy with Singh’s order regarding transfer and postings of the 10 DCPs and had got the order reversed. “After 3-4 days, I came to know that after some adjustments and consideration of money, the said order was issued,” Vaze told ED in the statement. The statements are part of the ED charge sheet filed last month against Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde in a money laundering case, in which the former minister is the main accused. HT accessed the ED charge sheet on Thursday. “I came to know that a total sum of Rs. 40 crore was collected from the police officers listed in the said order and out of which ₹20 crore each was given to Shri. Anil Deshmukh, through Shri Sanjeev Palande, PS to Home Minister and Shri Anil Parab through one Shri. Bajrang Karmate, RTO Officer,” the statement read. The money laundering case against Deshmukh and his aides was registered after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21. In another statement recorded on June 21, also part of the ED charge sheet, Vaze claimed: “Shri Sanjeev Palande, PS to the Home Minister and Shri. Bajrang Karmate, RTO officer used to handle the dealings in connection with transfers and postings of police officers for Shri. Anil Deshmukh and Shri. Anil Parab, respectively.” Vaze is lodged in Taloja jail in connection with cases pertaining to Antilia explosives scare and the subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran. According to the charge sheet, Vaze also corroborated the allegations of corruption against Deshmukh, stating that in October 2020, the NCP leader called him at his official bungalow, Dnyaneshwari, where one Karunakar Shetty gave him a list of 1,750 bars and restaurants, on alleged instructions of the minister and “asked me to collect ₹3 lakh from each of the bars in lieu of favouring them for operating beyond restricted time and without any restrictions for occupancy”. Vaze further said that after having meetings with the bar owners between December 2020 and February 2021, he collected a total of ₹4.7 crore from orchestra bar owners. He added that on instructions of Deshmukh, in January 2021, he handed over ₹1.60 crore in cash in five bags to Kundan Shinde outside Sahyadri guest house. Remaining ₹3 crore was handed over to Shinde in February, said the statement, adding that in a later meeting held at Dnyaneshwari in the same month, it was decided that a system for collection from hookah bars be developed on the lines of orchestra bars. NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said, “Vaze himself has been arrested for a serious offence like murder by the NIA. He is tainted; he carried out a murder just to save himself. He is unnecessarily blaming an innocent and workaholic NCP leader Anil Deshmukh. We are hopeful Deshmukh will come out of this case innocent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ten-dcps-paid-rs-20-cr-each-to-anil-deshmukh-anil-parab-sachin-vaze-in-his-statement-to-ed-101631816591334.html

17-09-2021||India||Speculation over Kanhaiya Kumar’s entry into Cong grows; CPI's D Raja meets him||The Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary D Raja met party leader Kanhaiya Kumar in Delhi on Thursday amid intense speculations that the former JNU students’ union president is in talks with Congress leaders to join the party.“I did ask him about the speculations. And after our conversation, I want to condemn these ongoing speculations. He is the youngest member of our national executive and as an asset for the party,” Raja told HT.But a section of the party is sceptical, as Kumar, arguably the most popular CPI leader among the young people, has remained silent about the rumours on public platforms. Kumar recently met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi—a step widely seen as a precursor to his joining of the Congress.Raja, however, defended Kumar and said, “he is a member of our national executive (equivalent to CPIM politburo). He is free to meet any political leader. Would you speculate if he meets Sitaram Yechury? Earlier, he has met other political leaders too.”Raja and Kumar met at the Ajoy Bhawan, the CPI headquarters in New Delhi.Kumar had fought the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 on a CPI ticket from Begusarai but lost to BJP stalwart Giriraj Singh. Kumar’s popularity soared during his tenure as the president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University’s students’ union, even as he courted major controversies.CPI leaders claimed that Kumar has refuted the speculations in his personal meetings with CPI leaders. He has been appointed as the central executive of the party and is currently its youngest member of the top executive body.But, some Congress leaders are hopeful that Kumar will join the party at some point. The Congress also requires a young, dynamic leader in Bihar, where its political fortunes have plummeted over the years.Meanwhile, CPI MP Binoy Viswam claimed that the news on Kanhaiya Kumar is nothing but fake. “He just called me from Ajoy Bhavan. He is the NEC member of the party, deeply committed to the communist cause,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speculation-over-kanhaiya-kumar-s-entry-into-congress-grows-cpi-gen-secy-d-raja-meets-him-101631816530081.html
17-09-2021||India||Bad bank to help monetise chronic NPAs worth ₹2 lakh crore||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday announced ₹30,600 in government guarantees that will back the securities issued by the National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL) to acquire bad loans worth ₹2 lakh crore.NARCL, effectively a bad bank, will buy these loans that are fully provided for by banks; the move will reduce bad loans on the books of banks, Sitharaman said. Of the ₹2 lakh crore, around ₹90,000 crore of bad loans will be transferred to NARCL in the first phase of the exercise.While the bad bank (NARCL) will pay up to 15% of the agreed discounted value of the loans from banks in cash, the remaining 85% will be government-guaranteed security receipts (SRs), which could be invoked if realisation is less than the agreed threshold value. The guarantee will cover these receipts. The discounted value will be arrived after a valuation process. Financial services secretary Debasish Panda said that the valuation of all ₹2 lakh crore of bad loans is complete and that there is a “18% weighted average accorded”. This means the ₹2 lakh crore of bad loans has been valued at ₹36,000 crore.Of this, 15%, or ₹5,400 crore, will have to be paid in cash. It wasn’t immediately clear how NARCL will raise that money.NARCL and the Indian Debt Resolution Company Ltd, or IDRCL, are both part of the plans of the government to address the issue of bad loans on the books of banks. The latter will manage the assets and help resolve the debt. The creation of the two, an asset reconstruction company (NARCL) and an asset management company (IDRCL) was announced by the finance minister in her budget speech this year.NARCL will be liable to pay an annual guarantee fee, Sitharaman said, giving details of Wednesday’s Cabinet decision that approved the ₹30,600 crore government guarantee. According to finance ministry officials who requested anonymity, the guarantee fee will initially be 0.25% of the amount in the first year and would progressively increase in subsequent years.It is expected that the asset management company – India Debt Resolution Company Ltd (IDRCL) – will resolve stressed assets worth ₹2 lakh crore in five years.The bad bank structure will assist in consolidation of debt, currently fragmented across various lenders, thus leading to faster, single-point decision making, including through Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) processes, Sitharaman said. “It will incentivise quicker action on resolving stressed assets, thereby helping in better value realisation,” she added.This approach will also permit freeing up the management bandwidth of banks to focus on increasing business and credit growth, she said. As the holders of these stressed assets and SRs, banks will receive the gains. The government’s guarantee will also enhance liquidity of SRs as these are tradable, officials said. This basically means banks can sell these down to the market.Sitharaman said the decision is in keeping with the government’s commitment to reduce non-performing assets (NPAs) of public sector banks (PSBs) through the four “R” strategy -- Recognition, Resolution, Recapitalisation and Reform. Giving the background of the strategy, she said it was a result of an asset quality review of banks that took place for cleaning up their balance sheets in 2015, which revealed very high incidence of NPAs. “Everybody is aware of the story,” she added.Sitharaman said the strategy worked. “In the last six financial years, banks have recovered ₹501,479 crore... of this ₹3.1 lakh crore has been recovered since March 2018,” she said, adding that recoveries also included “written-off” assets worth ₹99,996 crore from Bhushan Steel and Essar Steel.The government has also recapitalised PSBs, the finance minister said. In 2017-18, the government infused ₹90,000 crore; ₹1.06 lakh crore was infused in 2018-19. In 2019-20, it infused ₹70,000 crore and in 2020-21, ₹20,000 crore. “In the current budget, we said the government would infuse ₹20,000 crore in this financial year,” she said.Giving details of reforms in the banking sector, she said several structural and procedural reforms took place in the last six years. These include bank mergers, managerial reforms, bringing cooperative banks under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), creation of the Bank Board Bureau, setting up a framework for key performance indicators for banks, strengthening of risk management practices, setting up of new Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) for faster recovery, and action taken against wilful defaulters such as debarring them from accessing the capital market, she said.“In 2018, only two of the 21 PSBs were profitable, in 2020-21 only two reported loss,” she said. Now banks are so strong that they are also raising money from the market. “Union Bank of India (UBI) raised ₹1,447 crore through a QIP in July 2021. Canara Bank has raised ₹2,500 crore in August 2021. Bank of India announced a QIP for ₹3,000 crore. And State Bank of India’s (SBI) board has approved raising Basel-3 compliant debt of ₹14,000 crore. So, banks are not looking at the government to infuse equity but going to the market for capitalisation,” she said.Underscoring the need for a bad bank, Sitharaman said one of the reasons why NPAs existed was because bank personnel did not have adequate specialisation in dealing with NPA disposal. “Bank professionals, however, good they are in their professionalism about banking-related matters, cannot deal with asset reconstruction. And, therefore, many banks are sitting wondering how to dispose these [stressed] assets. So, banks themselves will feel that it is no more their headache to find the best buyers, negotiate with them and so on... That job is going out to professionals, so banks’ staff will be free to do their basic, original core competence jobs,” she said.Uday Bhansali, president, financial advisory at consulting firm Deloitte India said establishment of the NARCL and Debt Resolution firm were long awaited and in line with global practices. “A government guarantee for the SRs is vital to support the necessary liquidity for the banks,” he said.Sanjay Aggarwal, president at PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, “This will unclog the capital locked in the form of bad assets that can be further leveraged for lending and spending on other priority areas. Since the guarantee is in a form of contingent liability, it will not lead to immediate cash outflow and therefore is unlikely to impact the fiscal position in near future. This initiative will boost investments and unleash the ‘animal spirits’ to strengthen high economic growth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bad-bank-to-help-monetise-chronic-npas-worth-2-lakh-crore-101631816471483.html
17-09-2021||India||Book on Kashmir by R&AW officer’s daughter fans furore||A book on Kashmir written by an Indian anthropologist from the University of California is at the centre of a major controversy after it came to light on Thursday that the author’s father was an officer with India’s external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) who was posted in the Valley in the 90s.Saiba Varma’s book The Occupied Clinic: Militarism and Care in Kashmir has been published by Duke University in the US and Yoda Press in India. However, a series of tweets by a pseudonymous twitter handle, @Settler_Scholar accusing the author of writing a book on trauma in the Valley while her father “create(d) the trauma’’, has led to Yoda now distancing itself from the book. A group of anthropologists are also planning to write a letter of protest to the American publishers regarding the book.“Just found out something about an author and a book we value deeply that puts all her work in question. These are terrible moments for a small independent publisher like ourselves,’’ tweeted Arpita Das of Yoda Press, adding, “and this is also why scholars MUST locate themselves clearly and transparently in their research writing -- full disclosure or nothing!.’’Varma did not immediately respond to HT’s queries.Yoda’s Das claimed Verma has not responded to her queries too.The incident has become a major talking point with some arguing that her father’s work should have no bearing on Varma’s, while others have called out her failure to declare her antecedents, and that she accompanied her father during his posting in Jammu and Kashmir. Yet others, see it as another example of the cancel culture.Krishan Varma retired from R&AW eight years ago, and according to two retired officers that HT spoke to, was not completely identified with his work in Kashmir. He retired as special secretary and used to head the Aviation Research Centre or ARC in the agency. “ He is a China expert and was also staff officer to two chiefs, Vikram Sood and CD Sahay,’’ said one of the officers, who didn’t wish to be quoted.While Das describes the book as “brilliantly written” and “powerful”, she now feels that it is problematic. “It’s the sort the thing you do declare if you are writing a book on Kashmir-- how can you not declare it?” said Das.But others disagree. Especially former RAW secretary AS Dulat, who has also written on Kashmir. “It’s a lot of bunkum. Krishan is a good friend. I have seen her book, and my only grouse and my complaint was that my book wasn’t in the bibliography. He was there ages ago and she has done her thesis there. Krishan doesn’t know half of what his daughter knows about Kashmir.’’The Twitter handle which went public with this said that they were a group of intellectuals and activists in the Valley who didn’t want to go public, fearing a backlash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/book-on-kashmir-by-r-aw-officer-s-daughter-fans-furore-101631816410161.html
17-09-2021||India||India raises concerns over pro-Khalistan groups in US ahead of Modi visit||India on Thursday expressed concern over a reported increase in activities by Pakistan-backed Khalistani separatist groups from US soil ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington for several crucial meetings next week. Ensuring security for the Prime Minister and his delegation is an important issue, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly news briefing, in response to questions on reports that a banned Khalistani group plans to organise protests in Washington and New York during Modi’s visit. “I do not know about the specific call given by the banned outfit. I am not going to comment on that. But we certainly take a lot of interest in ensuring the security of the Prime Minister and his delegation,” he said. Pointing to a new report by the think tank Hudson Institute about the spike in activities of Khalistani groups with apparent backing from Islamabad, Bagchi said this reflects Pakistan’s efforts to undertake activities against India from US soil. “We convey and share (this) with the host country – in this case, the US. If the organisation is banned, it should not be undertaking these kinds of activities,” he added. The issue was less about protests and more about security, Bagchi said. The organisations behind the protests had “problems in the past in terms of terrorist activities”, he said, without going into details. The Hudson Institute’s report makes it clear that Pakistan was continuing with its efforts to carry out anti-India activities, including terrorism. “I do hope authorities in the US will see that and understand the risks that this kind of activity poses for countries that have a shared vision against terrorism and violence,” Bagchi said. The think tank’s report said Pakistan-backed Khalistani groups, which are proscribed by India, are quietly gaining ground in the US and the American administration has been indifferent to appeals made by New Delhi to curb their operations. US-based Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) was banned by India in 2019 for its alleged anti-national activities. Modi will be in the US next week to participate in the maiden in-person summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad in Washington on September 24 and to address the UN General Assembly the following day. He is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with the leaders of Quad states – Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and US President Joe Biden. The Quad Summit is expected to focus on the situation in Afghanistan, measures to boost the grouping’s ambitious vaccine partnership that seeks to distribute one billion doses of anti-Covid-19 shots across the Indo-Pacific and China’s assertive actions across the region. The Biden administration is hosting the Quad Summit to send a signal that it remains a key player on the global stage, especially after widespread criticism of its handling of the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-raises-concerns-over-pro-khalistan-groups-in-us-ahead-of-modi-visit-101631816356279.html
17-09-2021||India||IT rules rob press of its freedom: HC||The Centre’s new Information Technology (IT) Rules could rob the media of its independence and the fourth pillar of the democracy may cease to exist, judges of the Madras high court said as they ordered on Thursday a stay on parts of the government’s new regulations, and restrained it from taking action against social media companies for now. The IT Rules, notified in February, contain a host of new directions and liabilities for social media companies (also known as intermediaries), news websites and streaming content providers (also known as OTT services) such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. On Thursday, the Madras high court became the third appellate court in the country to stall operations of rules pertaining to the last two – particularly two clauses contained under Rule 9 – subclauses 1 and 3. It also said action under Rule 3 and Rule 7, which deals with social media companies and their safe harbour status, cannot be taken until it decides on the petitions.The court was hearing two petitions – one filed by Carnatic music vocalist TM Krishna and another by a set of 13 news websites as part of the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA). “Prima facie, there is substance to the petitioner’s grievance that the oversight mechanism to control the media by (the) government may rob the media of its independence, and the fourth pillar, so to say, of democracy may not at all be there,” the court of first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice PD Audikesavalu said, while staying the sub rules.Sub rule 1 requires digital publishers to adhere to a code of ethics while sub rule 3 provides for a three-tier regulatory mechanism that is ultimately headed by the government. On July 9, the Kerala high court said the new rules appear to give “excessive powers” to “unreasonably and impermissibly” restrict the freedom of speech and expression of the media, and on August 15, a Bombay high court bench said these particular provisions were an intrusion into the rights to free speech and beyond the scope of the main law under which the rules have been framed, the Information Technology Act, 2000.While the operation of these sections virtually amounted to have been put into suspension with the second order – the one by the Bombay high court on August 15 – the new order now covers more ground as it restrains the Centre from taking action by invoking either Rule 3 or Rule 7. Rule 3 relates to the due diligence that social media intermediaries will need to carry out by ensuring certain types of content, such as those that are defamatory or false, do not stay on their platforms, while Rule 7 lays down the government’s power to remove what is known as safe harbour provisions. Safe harbour provisions essentially mean social media companies will not be liable for what users post on their platform.On this, the court referred to the 2015 Supreme Court order (in the Shreya Singhal vs Union of India) and drew on the top court’s observation that “it would be very difficult for intermediaries like Google, Facebook etc. to act when millions of requests are made and the intermediary is then to judge as to which of such requests are legitimate and which are not”. The Madras high court agreed with the present petitions that even though the petitions have not been brought by hosts of website platforms, social media platforms “are used by one and sundry and there is a genuine apprehension that a wink or a nod from appropriate quarters may result in the platform being inaccessible to a citizen”.According to the court, action invoking either of these rules will be “subject to the results of writ petitions”.The judges in their order also note a second reason for passing a fresh order after the Bombay high court stay: “...there may have been no need to pass an independent order. However, it is submitted on behalf of the petitioners that notwithstanding the order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, which ought to have a pan-India effect, notices have been issued to the petitioners subsequently requiring the petitioners to adhere to, inter alia, the said Rules and Rule 9 thereof.” The additional solicitor general, R Sankaranarayanan, representing the Union government agreed during the hearing that it would have a pan-India effect. Presently, there are a total of 19 writ petitions pending across high courts and each emanate out of a unique set of circumstances, the Union ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) told the Madras high court on August 25. On Thursday, Meity spokesperson did not respond to requests for a comment.The ministry has separately moved the Supreme Court asking for all these petitions to be transferred to the top court. On September 3, the Supreme Court ordered for the government’s petition to be listed six weeks later.Experts welcomed Thursday’s order. “This is the right legal and constitutional position taken by both courts,” said Gurshabad Grover, senior researcher at Centre for Internet Society. “If you look at the intermediary guidelines, and the digital media code were notified under sections 69A and 79 of the IT Act, 2000, both of them were applicable to what the IT Act called intermediaries. Whereas if we look at Rule 9, we will see that it is applicable to digital news publishers and online curated content platforms. The parent provisions were never meant to regulate these entities. Therefore, it is clearly a violation of both the power of delegated legislation given to the central government and the separation of powers. Because without a parent law that authorises this, the executive should not be regulating these entities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-rules-rob-press-of-its-freedom-hc-101631816349937.html
17-09-2021||India||Blood donation camp to free ration: BJP’s mega plans for PM’s birthday||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is planning a mega public outreach to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 71st birthday on Friday, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The 20-day mega campaign, titled ‘Seva aur Samarpan Abhiyan’, will be held between September 17 and October 7.To mark the special occasion, the party high command has instructed the cadre to achieve the milestone of delivering 15 million vaccines in a single day, organise health and blood donation camps, distribute rations to the poor and e-auction the gifts and mementoes received by the PM. On Friday, BJP president JP Nadda will also inaugurate a photo exhibition to mark the completion of 20 years of Modi’s political journey.Since PM Modi assumed office in 2014, the BJP has been celebrating his birthday as ‘Seva Diwas’ (Service Day) and organises welfare activities across the country for a week, but this time it has been extended to 20 days as he is completing his two decades in public office.On Thursday, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya called for a major push to the vaccination drive on Friday, saying it would be the perfect gift for Modi on his birthday. “Tomorrow is the birthday of our beloved prime minister, let’s do #VaccineSeva by helping all unvaccinated people including their loved ones, family members and all sections of the society by getting them vaccinated. This would be a birthday gift for the prime minister,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.According to news agency PTI, as part of the campaign, over 140 million ration bags with Modi’s pictures will be distributed among the needy and about 50 million BJP booth workers will send Modi postcards highlighting their commitment to public service.The cadre has also been tasked with encouraging at least 10 people to take the vaccine. “The workers have been asked to address vaccine hesitancy and ensure people in their respective areas are vaccinated,” a  BJP functionary, who asked not to be named, told HT.As part of the campaign, the ministry of culture has organised an e-auction of gifts and mementoes received by the PM. “The memorabilia includes sports gear and equipment of the medal-winning Olympians and Paralympians, a replica of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir, Char Dham, Rudraksh Convention Centre, models, sculptures, paintings, angavastras among others,” the ministry said in a statement.All proceeds from the e-auction will go to the Namami Gange Mission, which aims to conserve and rejuvenate Ganga.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blood-donation-camp-to-free-ration-bjp-s-mega-plans-for-pm-s-birthday-101631816291623.html

Briefing reporters, Warangal commissioner of police Tarun Joshi said the mutilated body of the accused was found on tracks near Pamunuru village around 8.45am, minutes after the Bhubaneswar-Secunderabad Konark Express passed through the route. He said it appeared to be a case of suicide. “Some railway workers found the man walking on the track and tried to alert him but he did not listen. By the time they reached out to him, the speeding train had run over him, killing him on the spot,” Joshi said.Railway workers informed the police who rushed to the spot. “The face was badly mutilated but we could identify him as the man who was accused in the rape and murder of the girl in Hyderabad last week, with the help of the tattoos on his hands,” the police commissioner said.A search for the accused was on since September 9 when Hyderabad Police found the body of the minor girl in his room at Saidabad following a missing complaint by her parents. The postmortem report later revealed that the girl was brutally raped and strangled to death. On Wednesday, Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar announced a cash reward of ₹10 lakh for information related to the accused, amid protests by locals and an “encounter” threat by Telangana labour minister Ch Malla Reddy. Reddy said on Tuesday the accused in the case would be caught and that there should be an “encounter”, a euphemism for extrajudicial killing. “There is no question of leaving him,” Reddy said at a party meeting last week.Local residents demanded that the accused be killed in an encounter. In 2019, a huge uproar had erupted over the encounter killing of four accused in the gang-rape and murder of a veterinarian in Hyderabad. In August this year, the Supreme Court gave another six months to a three-member inquiry commission set up to probe the circumstances leading to the encounter.On Thursday, even though police called it a case of suicide, the deceased’s family claimed that the man was killed in an encounter. His mother told reporters in her village in Nalgonda district that her son was caught by police three days ago and after subjecting him to torture, they forced him to jump in front of a running train. “The police had detained me and my daughter-in-law for three days but nobody came to us for questioning. On Wednesday, suddenly, senior officials came to us and asked us some questions. They told us that my son had not been traced yet. But I overheard police officials saying that they had orders from higher-ups to kill him in an encounter. They let us off at around 10pm last night and this morning, we were told that he had died by suicide,” she alleged. Making similar allegations, the accused’s wife said: “The police took my signature on a blank paper but refused to tell me the reason for the same.” The accused was booked for rape and murder, besides under sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. As many as 15 special teams were constituted to track him, police said. Based on inputs from colony residents, police had widely circulated the identification marks of the accused, particularly the tattoos on his hand. The deceased was known to frequently sleep in bus stands and pavements, police said. According to Hyderabad Police, the girl belonged to Nalgonda district and was staying at Saidabad for the past few years. Her father is an auto driver. Warangal town assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Giri Kumar said the body was shifted to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) government hospital for a postmortem examination in the presence of railway police. “We have brought the brothers-in-law of the deceased from his native village in Suryapet district who identified him based on the tattoos on his hand, his height and the clothes he was wearing. We shall shift the body to his village soon and cooperate with Hyderabad Police in further investigation,” the ACP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-rape-murder-accused-found-dead-on-train-tracks-101631816049901.html
17-09-2021||India||SC raps Centre, NCLAT chief to be reinstated||The Supreme Court on Thursday forced the Union government to reinstate the acting chairperson of the national company law appellate tribunal (NCLAT) for another four days while sending the man currently holding this position on leave till September 20.In a dramatic turn of events, the government was nudged to issue a fresh appointment letter to justice Ashok Iqbal Singh Cheema, who was sent off hurriedly on September 11 instead of September 20, when he would have reached the retirement age of 67. The top court rejected the government’s suggestion that Cheema be retained as NCLAT’s acting chairperson “only on paper”.At the core of the matter is a legal battle surrounding a recent legislation on appointments to tribunals that overwrites several judgments of the apex court.Justice M Venugopal, who was appointed the acting chairperson of NCLAT by the government after unseating justice Cheema, will be sent on leave till September 20, and he will come back as the acting chairperson once again on September 21.A bench, led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, observed that it is the government that is responsible for such an “awkward situation” and that any more insistence on its authority to pass such orders by citing the 2021 Tribunal Reforms Act would compel the court to suo motu (on its own motion) stay the new legislation.“Your (government’s) officers cannot wake up at seven in the morning and decide to throw out anyone from the tribunal...if the government thinks it can do whatever it likes then we will also have to do something...we will suo motu stay your legislation,” the bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli told attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal.The court was hearing justice Cheema’s petition in which the retired judge questioned the manner in which he was removed on September 11 by issuing a letter when he was due to retire on September 20.On Wednesday, too, the top court reproached the Centre while hearing a bunch of cases relating to vacancies across the tribunals and a challenge to the Tribunal Reforms Bill, which was passed by both the Houses in the recent monsoon session of Parliament. Observing that it is “very, very unhappy”, the court on Wednesday said that in a democratic country governed by the rule of law, the government cannot assert its authority to reject the names recommended by selection committees, headed by the judges of the top court, for appointments to various tribunals.When the hearing on Justice Cheema’s petition commenced on Thursday, Venugopal, representing the Centre, said that the government is willing to consider justice Cheema’s “deemed continuance” till September 20 and he will be treated to have retired on September 20 but that this would only be “on paper”.“He will be given all the benefits but he cannot continue since we have already appointed another acting chairperson. How can we remove that person? This gentleman (Cheema) will be deemed to continue on his post only on paper. We cannot put him back. It will be very awkward,” the AG told the bench.But the bench was unimpressed with this submission. “The way you removed him was also very awkward. And what do you mean by ‘only on paper’. Once he is allowed to continue, all consequential benefits will have to follow. This gentleman has five judgments to deliver and you suddenly removed him,” it told Venugopal.This made the AG assert that the letter to remove justice Cheema was written under the 2021 Act which has overwritten the previous judgments of the Supreme Court. “The new Act gives such authority to the government,” added the law officer.“Then, we will suo motu stay your 2021 legislation,” retorted the bench while giving AG some time to consult the officers in the government and revert.Around 15 minutes later, when Venugopal returned, he conceded. “I have taken instructions in the matter that he (Cheema) can be reinstated for delivering judgments and the other gentleman can go on leave.”The court then commended Venugopal’s efforts and recorded his undertaking in its order that justice Cheema will be reinstated till September 20 with all consequential benefits and the incumbent acting chairperson shall go on leave during this period.On Wednesday, the apex court took an adverse view of the government’s argument that it had the authority to select only a few names or even reject all the names recommended by the selection committees, which are headed by the judges of the top court.“If the government has the last laugh, what is the sanctity of the selections made by us after conducting interviews?... We are very, very unhappy with the way in which things are going on and how the government has been acting,” a special bench, comprising CJI Ramana, justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, told the AG on Wednesday.“You cannot deny access to justice. How can people be left in the lurch? This is the problem everywhere. We are waiting very patiently. You have to make appointments to the tribunals...tell your government,” said the bench, giving the government two weeks to make appointments to the tribunals and specify wherever appointments cannot be made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-raps-centre-nclat-chief-to-be-reinstated-101631815809903.html
17-09-2021||India||No ministers from ex-CM Rupani’s term part of Gujarat cabinet||Gandhinagar: Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel inducted 24 ministers, of which 21 were new faces, on Thursday, dropping all ministers from the previous Vijay Rupani-led administration, three days after taking charge in a surprise change of guard.At a low-key ceremony at Raj Bhavan in Gandhinagar, governor Acharya Devvrat administered oath to 24 ministers -- 10 cabinet members and 14 ministers of state. Of this, three legislators held portfolios in previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments, and the rest are first-time ministers.“Congratulations to all p[arty colleagues who have taken oath as ministers in the Gujarat government,” tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Patel, who is a first-time MLA, retained key portfolios and didn’t name a deputy. Rupani’s deputy, Nitin Patel, was also dropped. “It is unprecedented in the country’s history that the entire Cabinet was dropped, but if the party leadership has decided they will have their logic,” Nitin Patel told reporters after the ceremony.The 59-year-old chief minister, a lawmaker from Ahmedabad hailing from the influential Patidar community, was named as the new chief minister on Monday after Rupani resigned a little over a year before assemble elections are to be held. This was the fourth chief minister changed by the BJP this year, and experts blamed Rupani’s handling of the pandemic and the lack of a strong base for his resignation. Patel took oath on Sunday but no other ministers were named. A senior BJP leader said on condition of anonymity that Patel faced problems while implementing the no-repeat theory envisaged by Prime Minister Modi and home minister Amit Shah for Gujarat. On Wednesday, the swearing-in ceremony had to be postponed after protests and internal dissent.The new CM inducted legislators from all the regions and key castes, and balanced young leaders with experienced MLAs. There are three women on the list. Equal representation has been given to central and south Gujarat -- two regions that earlier got overshadowed by Saurashtra and North Gujarat, which dominate the state’s politics.Saurashtra and Kutch, which send the maximum 54 MLAs got seven ministers; south Gujarat, represented by state BJP president CR Paatil and comprising 20 seats, also got seven. Patel kept crucial departments, including home, with himself. He will also oversee the general administration department, information, industries, mines and minerals, capital projects, urban development, urban housing and Narmada and ports departments.Harsh Sanghvi, the 36-year-old lawmaker from Majura constituency, was named minister of state for home. Kanu Desai, the 70-year-old MLA from Pardi, was given the finance portfolio. Purnesh Modi from Surat West will handle road transport and building, apart from tourism and pilgrimage development. Former state BJP president, Jitubhai Vaghani, is the new education minister, and Rishikesh Patel will handle health and water resources. Raghavji Patel, who was a minister in the Anandiben Patel cabinet, will handle agriculture and animal husbandry.The council comprises six ministers from the Patidar community and other backward classes each, four from the scheduled tribes, three from the scheduled castes, two each from the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas, and one from the Jain community.Political expert Ghanshyam Shah said, “Changing faces irrespective of experience and competence is Narendra Modi’s old style. He started this in 2007 with a message that it is he who counts at the end of the day.” Political analyst Vidyut Joshi said the BJP was trying to create a balancing act by strengthening central and south Gujarat, “Charismatic personalities disrupt organisational structures and system. This is what Modi has done. The new batch of ministers are young for sure but there is no guarantee of their competence vis-a-vis those who have gone out,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-ministers-from-ex-cm-rupani-s-term-part-of-gujarat-cabinet-101631815575567.html

17-09-2021||India||Adults can choose their partner irrespective of religion: Allahabad HC||The Allahabad high court on Thursday reiterated that two adults have the right to choose their matrimonial partner irrespective of the religion professed by them while granting protection to an interfaith couple.The bench, comprising justice Manoj Kumar Gupta and justice Deepak Verma, passed the order while hearing a petition filed by a Muslim woman, and her Hindu partner.The two approached the high court claiming that there is a threat to their lives. The court took note of the fact that both the petitioners are major, aged 19 and 24 years. The court granted protection to the interfaith couple and said that not even their parents can object to their relationship.The bench said, “It cannot be disputed that two adults have the right of choice of their matrimonial partner irrespective of the religion professed by them. As the present petition is a joint petition by the two individuals who claim to be in love with each other and are major, therefore, in our considered opinion, nobody, not even their parents, could object to their relationship.”The court directed the police authorities to ensure that the petitioners are not subjected to any harassment by the father of the girl or by any other person in connection with their relationship with each other.The court proceeded to grant them protection while clarifying that the order is not any final opinion regarding the age of the petitioners as the findings are only prima facie in nature for the purposes of deciding the issue regarding protection of the life of the petitioners.The petitioner submitted that she had also filed an application for conversion from Islam to Hinduism.On the said application, the district magistrate had called for a report from the police station concerned. As per the report, the boy’s father is opposed to the marriage though his mother is ready for the same. Both parents of Hasan are opposed to the marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adults-can-choose-their-partner-irrespective-of-religion-allahabad-hc-101631814309062.html
17-09-2021||India||Bhanwari Devi: Justice eluded her, but she stands resolute for others||Thin and frail and in her early sixties, Bhanwari Devi sits, an orange ghunghat covering her head, her forehead furrowed. The last year has not been kind to her. As her hands sprinkle water on a buffalo calf in the courtyard of her home in the village of Bhateri in Rajasthan, she talks of her husband who died last year.Her body is racked by diabetes, and the loss of her companion has brought the idea of mortality closer. And yet, Devi betrays no weakness, her movements quick and decisive.For the last three decades, she has fought a case against five local men for rape, assault and harassment. Her legal battle has birthed India’s sexual harassment protection laws for women, and forms the backbone of the landmark Vishakha guidelines for workplaces laid down by the Supreme Court in 1997.Yet, her case has not resulted in convictions, underlining the problems underprivileged women face in legal battles, deeply entrenched patriarchal attitudes in the countryside, and the dangers faced by female activists in trying to change those mind sets.But her refusal to bow has given sustenance to women’s movements, mitigated child marriages in rural Rajasthan and changed the course of Indian law.Her voice is still fierce, a steely determination in her eyes. “Akeli ke liye ladi thi kya? Pure desh ke liye ladi thi. Mujhe to nyay nahi mila magar meri bahan betiyo ko to milega. (Did I fight for myself? I fought for the entire country. I did not get justice but my sisters and daughters will get),” said Devi.The incident In May 1992, Devi was a “saathin”, an employee of the Rajasthan government’s women and child department, mandated to spread awareness about hygiene and family planning, education for girls, and campaign against female foeticide, infanticide, dowry and child marriages in the villages. So, when Devi got wind that a nine-month-old girl was being married off to an infant, a practice rampant at the time, all she did was her job. She tried to talk the families out of it.They refused to relent. Devi is a Kumhar, a caste listed as other backward class (OBC) in Rajasthan, largely engaged in pottery. The families were Gujjar, also OBC, but the divide and hostility in the village was stark. Having failed to make an impression on the families, Devi’s seniors handed over a list of such “bal vivaahs”(child marriages) taking place on the auspicious Akha Teej festival on May 5, 1992 to the district collector of Jaipur. On the day, the local police and the sub divisional magistrate arrived in Bhateri, 45km from the state capital, to stop the marriage. Despite this intervention, the infants were married -- just on the terrace of another home, instead of the one it was originally planned on.The Gujjars were livid that Devi had spoken out of turn. They began a boycott. People were asked not to buy the pots that she made, or the milk that she sold. Her husband was attacked, and Devi and her four children were threatened. On September 22, when Devi and her husband had gone to the fields to get fresh fodder for their cattle, they were allegedly accosted by five men. Two caught held on to her husband, and three others allegedly gang raped her. The act was meant to strike fear into Devi’s heart, and send a message to the village that such insubordination was unacceptable.But Devi did the unthinkable – especially in a village with clear power hierarchies. She fought. She filed a case.The fightThe FIR took more than a day, the medical examination 52 hours. As women’s organisations coalesced around her cause, the case was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). In September 1993, a charge sheet was filed, and by October 1994, the five men had been arrested and charged with harassment, assault, conspiracy and gang rape.For a time, there seemed to be some hope for justice. In December 1993, while denying the five bail, the Rajasthan high court said that it was “convinced” Devi was gang raped for attempting to “stop the marriage” of the daughter of one of the accused.But in November 1995 when the Jaipurtrial court issued its order, it acquitted the five accused on the grounds that men from different castes could not be involved in rape, that two of the accused, over 60 years old, were too old to be involved in the act, and that it was impossible for rape to happen if her husband was present.The acquittal set off another round of protests in Rajasthan, spreading as far as Delhi. As women rights activists made their way to Bhateri, worried for her safety, Devi shooed them away, asking them to focus on justice. She filed an appeal against the judgment in the Rajasthan high court in 1995. Twenty-six years since, the case has yet to be taken up in earnest.Simultaneously though, four NGOs working on women’s rights, Vishakha, Women’s Rehabilitation Group from Rajasthan, and Jagori and Kali for Women from Delhi, petitioned the Supreme Court. Their argument was that Devi was an employee of the Rajasthan government discharging her duties, and suffered the assault in the workplace, with laws wholly inadequate in dealing with the crime.In 1997, in a historic judgment, the Supreme Court detailed the country’s first guidelines for sexual harassment in the workplace, becoming part of common parlance as the “Vishakha guidelines”, the precursor to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. Devi may have lost her own battle. But she had struck a blow for all of India’s working women.The falloutForty-five kilometres from Jaipur, and 10km off the Agra-Delhi National Highway, Bhateri is a cluster of 1,200 residents. The Bairwas, a Dalit community, have a considerable population, but Gujjars and Meenas live here too, and exert considerable influence. The Kumhars are a small minority. Everyone either farms, or works in Jaipur. The nearest health centre is in Lawan, 5km away, or at Banskho, 15km away.The village has been home all of Devi’s life but there was a time she contemplated leaving. In the years after the gang rape, Devi became a national icon. She was awarded a sum of ₹25,000 for her bravery by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, travelled to Beijing in 1994 to be part of the UN’s Fourth World Conference for Women, and won the Neerja Bhanot Memorial Award for her “extraordinary courage, conviction and commitment”. In 2002, chief minister Ashok Gehlot announced a grant of ₹40,000 for the construction of a house for her.And yet, Devi’s acceptance within her own community and village, despite being a victim, was hard to come by. The money she received from Rao, she gave to her brothers, who arranged a Kumhar Mahapanchayat, designed to end her boycott. Twenty-nine years later, in the courtyard of her government aid funded home, Devi has not an ounce of regret at the act that started it all. Her voice incredulous, she asked, “Should I not have intervened? The child was nine months old. Nine months. It was my job,” she said.There is perhaps another reason that Devi has kept going, despite personal tribulations. She has seen Bhateri, particularly in its attitudes towards caste and women, change before her eyes. Even until eight months ago, Devi continued to work as a “saathin” in Bhateri, and now lives off a government pension. “In all, I myself must have stopped twelve to fifteen child marriages. Even now, despite no longer working as a saathin, I will continue to keep an eye out, and intervene wherever possible,” Devi said.The changeIt’s 8am, and in front of Devi’s courtyard, a gaggle of young girls in school uniforms chatter together as they make their way to the senior secondary school in the village. There is no higher education in Bhateri yet, the closest institutions in Dausa or Jaipur, but one battle at a time. Pointing at the group of girls, Devi said, “A huge change has come for girls. Not a single girl used to go to school in my days but today you can see for yourself how things have changed.”Devi believes her struggle has found slow acceptance within the community, the outrage and attention sparked by her case putting a spotlight on the issue of caste and child marriage in Rajasthan, prompting government intervention and a focus on education.“Certainly, the mind sets of people have changed, because of my struggle, education and the spread of awareness. Now, even intercaste marriages are taking place as youngsters are educated and are able to take their own decisions,” Devi said.In his home close by, sarpanch Vedraj Bairwa says the village administration now actively looks out to prevent any child marriages. Like many others, he says he was not in the village 29 years ago, and was in Delhi for work. “In 1992, after the incident, Devi raised these issues, and that too curbed these practices. People began to fear the administration. Awareness has spread, and if parents want to force them, they resist. Moreover, I, and other officials, all keep an eye out when marriages take place to check if child marriages are taking place.”Additional director general of police, Ravi Prakash Meharda, says that much progress has been made since 1992, particularly on two fronts, the position of women and their representation. “Initially, when women were elected in panchayat polls, it was said that their fathers, brothers or husbands were running the show. Now there is much greater independence, and women are coming into their own as public representatives,” Meharda said.Activist and co-founder of Vishakha, Kavita Srivastava, says Devi’s case was a turning point in the anti-rape movement in India, and an example of how a non violent struggle can continue over three decades.“She grew out of the victim hood and became an inspiration. We broke the silence on rape and the denial of rape, and ignited an anti-rape struggle in Rajasthan and all over the country. For the first time, there was rehabilitation and relief money. She went abroad and represented India,” she said.Srivastava however still believes that the system has completely denied Devi her personal justice. “Her husband died waiting. The question should be asked of the judicial system. It’s not about winning or losing a case …It’s about how a system completely denies you justice,” Srivastava said.Back in Bhateri, Devi’s concern for the future, and her continuing quest for justice, is less about herself, and more about her four children. But the fear will not debilitate her. “I will not sit silently and will continue to fight till my last breath,” she said. Nearly three decades have passed, and four of the five accused have breathed their last. “Yaha nyaya nahi mila, Bhagwan ki adalat mein toh milega.(I may not have got justice here, but they will be tried in God’s court),” Devi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhanwari-devi-justice-eluded-her-but-she-stands-resolute-for-others-101631811309362.html
17-09-2021||India||Himachal Pradesh leads the country, as vax pace maintains momentum||On September 16, India’s grand vaccination drive completed eight months. Till Thursday evening, the country administered over 771 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, with six out of every 10 adults (61.9%) in the country having received at least one jab, and a little over two out of 10 (20.2%) having been fully vaccinated.Three states (Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Goa) and four Union territories (Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Chandigarh, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu) have announced in the past two weeks that they have administered first doses to their entire populations.A look at how different states are performing, and the road ahead for the country’s vaccination drive.1. National vaccination drive off peak levels, but pace remains highIndia’s pace of vaccination, which has been extremely patchy in the past, is currently going through one of its finest phases. In the past week, an average of 7 million daily doses has been administered across the country every day, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. While this is a dip from the peak vaccination rate (for the week ended September 1, the seven-day average of daily doses touched a peak of 8.5 million doses), it is still better than anything seen till late August. One concern is that over the past week this number has been steadily dropping.2. Himachal Pradesh leads in all metrics, with Kerala and Uttarakhand not far behindHimachal Pradesh, which was India’s first state to cover its entire adult population with single doses on August 29, continues to lead the country in key vaccination metrics – population covered with at least one dose, and proportion of adults fully vaccinated. Around 63.7% of all adults in the state are partially vaccinated, while another 37.8% fully vaccinated. This translates into nearly 100% of the state’s estimated adult population (according to the Census of India’s National Commission on Population) having received at least one dose. To be sure, the coverage appears to exceed 100% because the adult population figures are projected estimates, and may be off by small margins in some regions.In overall coverage, Uttarakhand is at the second spot with nearly 57.1% of the state’s adults partially vaccinated and 31.1% having received both doses of the vaccine – translating to around 88.2% of adults receiving at least one jab. Kerala, with 87.2% of adults receiving jabs, has the third highest overall coverage of population among states for which adult population projections were available. Interestingly, the state ranks second only to Himachal Pradesh in proportion of adults fully vaccinated – 35.4%. The numbers from the southern state are significant especially because it has been a hotspot over the past few months, accounting for, on some days, in excess of 60% of the country’s daily case total. However, the seven-day average of new infections in the state has now been consistently dropping over the past 10 days.Gujarat, another large state, has covered 79.2% of its adults with at least a single dose and 30% are fully vaccinated. With 78% of adults having been jabbed, Madhya Pradesh wraps up the country’s Top 5 by overall coverage. The state, however, lags behind the national average in terms of second dose coverage (only 19.2% of MP’s adults are fully vaccinated), data shows. To be sure, disaggregated population projections are not available for the north-eastern states other than Assam, so they have been grouped together under a single category – “North-east excluding Assam”. This group is marginally ahead of the national average in overall coverage (64.6%), but fares among the best regions in the country in proportion of population fully vaccinated (27.7%).At the other end of the spectrum, West Bengal has the lowest proportion of adults covered by a single dose in the country at 47.7%. It is followed by Jharkhand (49.3%), Uttar Pradesh (50.9%), Bihar (51.8%) and Telangana (53%), rounding off the bottom five. When the proportion of people fully vaccinated in taken into account, West Bengal (19.5% adults having received both jabs) drops out of the bottom five. Uttar Pradesh (10.5% adults fully vaccinated) is the lowest in the country, followed by Bihar (11.3%), Jharkhand (13.4%), Tamil Nadu (14.6%) and Assam (16.8%).3. The states still maintaining an impressive paceAnother key statistic to monitor is the rate of vaccinations at the state-level. For this too, daily dose administration data is seen against a region’s population to give states of varying population a common comparison base. This is particularly interesting statistic to map for regions that have high overall coverage, because if there is vaccine hesitancy among some sections of the population, then it should reflect in a drop in numbers here.In the past month, among India’s 10 states with best overall coverage, Kerala is again performing well – on average the state (despite its third highest overall coverage) has administered 9,861 doses per million adults every day, the highest in India. In second spot is Haryana (10th highest overall coverage) with 9,736 new doses administered per million adults per day. It is followed by Madhya Pradesh (fifth highest coverage; 9,144 doses per million) and Uttarakhand (third place overall, 9,086 doses).This analysis shows that Kerala in particular, and Uttarakhand to some extent are states where the pace continues to be high despite a large proportion of adults already jabbed. For context, Himachal Pradesh is on the last spot in this metric (6,320 daily doses per million in the past month), but that is to be expected as the state is only giving second shots.4. What's needed to cover all adults by end-DecemberWhile the pace of the drive has seen improvement, particularly from the low rates seen in previous months, data shows that there is still room for progress if India wants to achieve its stated target of vaccinating its entire adult population of 940 million by the end of 2021, a commitment the government has made in a submission to the Supreme Court. In total, India needed to administer around 1.88 billion doses by the end of the year to meet this target. Since 765 million of these have already been administered, that leaves around 1.115 billion doses to be administered in the remaining 107 days in the year, or 10.4 million doses every single day till December 31. While the country has come close to matching (even exceeding) this required rate on a few days it has not been able to do so on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachal-pradesh-leads-the-country-as-vax-pace-maintains-momentum-101631801708176.html
17-09-2021||India||Assam to destroy nearly 2,500 rhino horns; to preserve few as exhibits||The Assam cabinet on Thursday decided to destroy over 2,000 rhino horns which have been preserved in government treasuries across the state during the past four decades. The horns, which were seized from poachers and traders of animal parts or recovered from dead rhinos in the state’s national parks and wildlife sanctuaries from 1979 till now, are stored in 12 district treasuries at present. “At present, we have 2,623 such horns. Of these, 50 are associated with pending court cases (and can’t be destroyed). Of the rest, 94 others will be preserved for exhibition or educational purposes. The cabinet today decided that the remaining 2,479 horns will be destroyed,” forest and environment minister Parimal Suklabaidya said in Guwahati. Also Read | Assam teen missing since Sunday found dead; family says she was gang-raped by 6“In past weeks, experts have been verifying the horns using scientific methods. Ninety-four horns will be kept at a natural history museum to be set up near Kaziranga National Park, the cabinet decided. The museum will also have other wildlife exhibits from Assam,” he said. HT had reported last month that the forest and environment department is planning to destroy nearly 2,500 rhino horns. Though no date for destroying the horns have been announced yet, a formal event is expected on September 22, which is celebrated as World Rhino Day. Though there is no scientific basis, rhino horns are part of traditional medicine in some Asian countries such as China and Vietnam. Each horn, which is made up keratin (found in hair, nails), is valued over thousands of US dollars, leading to rampant killing of rhinos in Asia and Africa. Assam is home to the world’s largest population of one-horned rhinos. According to a 2018 census, there are nearly 2,650 rhinos in the state with around 2,400 of them concentrated in Kaziranga National Park. Rhinos are listed in Schedule 1 of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 as an endangered animal and there is an international ban on trade of rhino horns under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna). Wildlife experts have welcomed the government’s move to destroy the horns as they believe preserving them might send the message that they are indeed very valuable, which in turn could lead to more poaching of rhinos. “Scientifically, rhino horns don’t have any value, but it has a price in some markets based on superstitions about its medicinal properties. If we preserve them, it will convey the message that we believe in such superstitions. The horns stored in Assam should be destroyed,” Rathin Barman, joint director, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-to-destroy-nearly-2-500-rhino-horns-to-preserve-few-as-exhibits-101631785567576.html
17-09-2021||India||Uttarakhand HC lifts stay on Char Dham yatra; caps number of daily pilgrims||The Uttarakhand high court on Thursday lifted its June 28 stay on the Char Dham yatra and directed the state government to conduct the annual pilgrimage with strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines. The yatra will be open to all. Allowing the resumption of the yatra, a division bench of the court comprising chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma limited the daily number of devotees to the temples, and said they would have to carry negative Covid test reports and vaccination certificates.Putting a cap on the number of devotees visiting the Himalayan shrines, the high court said that only 800 pilgrims for Kedarnath, 1,000 for Badrinath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri will be allowed per day. Pilgrims will also not be allowed to take a bath in any of the springs around the temples, it added. According to advocate general SN Babulkar, Char Dham yatra will be open to all with Covid-19 curbs. On June 20, the state government had announced the opening of Char Dham yatra in two phases- from July 1, for locals from three districts and from July 11 for people across the state, as at that time, the state was still reporting significant Covid-19 cases dailyThe bench was hearing the state government’s petition seeking resumption of the yatra which was stayed by the court on June 28. The state sought to begin the pilgrimage for locals of Chamoli, Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi districts where the temples are located from July 1. Besides the state, several local businessmen and traders also moved the court with the same request. Shiv Bhatt, counsel of one of the petitioners said the bench directed the state government to station helicopters and ambulances at all shrines. “The court has directed the government to provide various facilities on the route to Char Dham from Haridwar. The court also said medical facilities such as beds with medical oxygen will be enhanced” Bhatt said. After the high court’s June 28 decision, the state government approached the Supreme Court with a special leave petition (SLP) to vacate the former’s stay on the yatra. As the matter was pending in the apex court, the high court was not in a position to hear the state government’s plea seeking lifting of the ban. However, the state recently withdrew its SLP in the top court, paving the way for the high court to hear its petition.Meanwhile, the high court is also hearing a bunch of public interest litigations filed by lawyers and activists Sachdanand Dabral, Dushyant Mainali, Anu Pant and Rajendra Arya related to various issues pertaining to the Covid-19 situation in the state.Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri, and Gangotri are collectively called Char Dham and millions visit them annually. The pilgrimage begins from Yamunotri in the west. It then proceeds to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east.Last year, the pilgrimage could not be held as per schedule on April 26 with the opening of portals of Yamunotri and Gangotri, the first two shrines that are opened after winter, because of the lockdown imposed to check the pandemic spread in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-hc-lifts-stay-on-char-dham-yatra-caps-number-of-daily-pilgrims-101631784907504.html
