22-09-2021||News||With its ear to the ground, how the BJP is sharpening its poll strategy||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s decision to change leaders in three states (including, most recently, in Gujarat where it has also replaced the entire council of ministers), and introduce major changes in the Union council of ministers, is a sign of the party preparing for both, the upcoming assembly elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. The decisions appear driven by two major factors: Caste and anti-incumbency. The party is revisiting its social engineering formula to ensure that it can leverage caste equations in light of new demands and movements; and it has made sweeping changes at the top to nip intensifying anti-incumbency in the poll-bound states of Gujarat and Uttarakhand — which go to polls in 2022, and Karnataka — where the next assembly election will be in 2023.Party leaders and political commentators concur that these changes go beyond the realm of the 2022 assembly elections, and have been crafted with an eye on the 2024 general elections and the party’s growth over the next two decades. Out with the old, in with the new The realisation that the next set of elections, including the 2024 polls, will need more than just Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s appeal has pushed the party to revisit its organisational edifice. This includes promoting newer leaders, refining its pitch of Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas to the new churn in caste equations in the polity, and taking decisions that may be seen as unorthodox. “Not many parties would change chief ministers [CMs] closer to the elections. It can backfire, but the BJP does not fear what the change can bring. The party leadership has shown gumption whether it was changing the CMs in Uttarakhand twice within four months or letting go of the person in Gujarat who was believed to have the backing of the top leaders,” said a senior party functionary.

The changes in the BJP, however, are dubbed as a natural progression of allowing younger, newer faces a platform for growth, and effected without rancour. “I believe that Gujarat’s development journey needs to be led under the new energy and enthusiasm with the guidance from PM Narendra Modi. Considering this, I have resigned from the post of chief minister of Gujarat,” 65-year-old Vijay Rupani said last Saturday while stepping down from his position. Earlier in July, the 78-year-old Karnataka strongman, BS Yediyurappa also stuck to the congeniality script. “I am not resigning in grief. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, [home minister] Amit Shah and [BJP president] JP Nadda have given me a two-year term as CM, and I can’t thank them enough,” he said after stepping down two years after being sworn in. There is more to these changes than just an opportunity for the newer leaders. Several party leaders agree that political expediency in switching to the traditional outreach towards dominant castes was a key consideration. Maharashtra-based political commentator, Abhay Deshpande, said that the changes are an attempt to moderate the growing sentiment against the government at the Centre and in the states on various issues — from the reluctance for caste-based enumeration to governance issues. “The cabinet reshuffle for instance has a long-term imprint. The BJP is trying to build leadership for the next 20 years,” he said. In picking leaders, the party also ensures that they do not emerge as larger than the party. “Even if Bhupendra Patel is from the numerically and economically stronger Patidar community and Pushkar Dhami a Thakur, these are leaders who have been chosen to ensure they retain their hold over castes without overshadowing the party,” he said. The caste question The rejig is also an indicator that the BJP is not entirely impervious to caste factors, even though the party had initially opted to create an alternative to the community-dominance construct in the polity. After the expansion of the council of ministers, the BJP said that 47 of the 77-member council representing Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Scheduled Castes (SC) categories are an indication of the party walking the talk on inclusivity and equality. There are 27 ministers from 19 OBC categories spread across 15 states, eight from the Scheduled Tribes (ST) community from across seven communities and eight states, and 12 from SC community from across 12 communities and eight states in the Union council of ministers.

The leaders would work for all castes and all sections. The move to appoint a CM who was not from the politically and economically dominant Jat community was seen as a political masterstroke,” said the senior party functionary. The appointment of a non-Maratha, Devendra Fadnavis, as CM in Maharashtra, and a non-Tribal, Raghubar Das, in Jharkhand came to be known as the BJP’s model of social engineering wherein the party wooed the non-dominant castes and built itself a support base similar to that of other regional satraps, much like the support that the Samajwadi Party draws from the Yadavs or the Bahujan Samaj Party’s dependence on the Dalit votes. A political commentator requesting anonymity said that, like all other parties, the BJP too experimented with their leadership. “Earlier the BJP followed the model of appointing the senior-most; there was Bhairon Singh Shekhawat in Rajasthan, Ram Prakash Gupta in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Virendra Kumar Khatik in Madhya Pradesh. Later, after the Mandal era of politics, when caste became an overriding factor, there was Kalyan Singh in UP; Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan, and Shivraj Singh Chauhan in MP; even PM Modi alluded to his caste,” the commentator said. Commenting on the recent round of changes, the commentator said, “The third step was appointing non-dominant CMs in line with Hindu Samarasta; but now since the party has lost elections in several states including Delhi, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, they feel the need to revisit the caste factors so that they can prevent politically empowered groups from moving away.Not all in the BJP agree that the changes are a sign that the party has changed its strategy of wooing the non-dominant castes to coalesce these into a broader support group. “Most of the time these decisions are based on dominant local considerations. Sometimes, the leaders were picked from a group that did not threaten the others. No thumb rule was being followed in giving the non-dominant leaders the top job. However, in doing so the party could negate the implicit caste rivalries and the shortcomings of the power matrix,” said a second party functionary. The impact of the second wave Political commentator Manisha Priyam attributes the changes to remedial action being taken by the party. “The changes show the BJP’s hard nosed ear-to-the-ground politics. In Gujarat, for instance, what could they do to counter the anger against Covid-19 mismanagement so close to elections? So, they returned to the dominant caste issue,” she said. The change in leadership, she said, has been deftly executed to counter resentment after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in the rural areas. “Hardships (post-Covid) have acutely been felt in rural areas. The BJP’s narrative of this emerging urban vote-bank is a charade. For instance, in Karnataka, the BJP has kept the dominant Lingayat vote-bank untouched, but also tried to consolidate its vote-bank by bringing in a leader with a socialist background. Similarly, in Uttarakhand, the tragedy was immense after the second wave. To change things, [Pushkar Singh] Dhami was brought in. He is considered closer to Rajanth Singh, so the Rajput factor is also kept intact,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/with-its-ear-to-the-ground-how-the-bjp-is-sharpening-its-poll-strategy-101632315997365.html

Although the suicide note is still being examined by a forensic team to establish its authenticity, a copy of it went viral on social media platforms on Tuesday evening. IG of Prayagraj Range KP Singh said that the eight-page suicide note expressed the feelings of Mahant Narendra Giri and contained his will for the Akhada and his disciples. However, he said that the suicide note would be examined by forensic and handwriting experts to establish if it was actually written by Mahant Narendra Giri himself. The suicide note written on Mahant Narendra Giri’s letter pad also mentions the date of suicide which was September 20. At the starting of the note, Mahant Narendra Giri said that he was writing the letter of his own will, without any pressure. The Mahant said that he was living under immense mental pressure since his disciple Anand Giri had levelled baseless and fake allegations against him. “Whenever I am alone, I feel I should not live anymore. Anand Giri, Aadya Tiwari and his son Sandeep Tiwari betrayed me and tried to kill me. Anand Giri defamed me through social media platforms and other sources by making false allegations against me. I will not lie as I am going to commit suicide—I have no relations with my family and have not given money to my kin. Instead, I have used the money for development of the temple and ‘Math’. All my devotees are aware that since I took charge in 2004, I have worked for development of the Math and temple. Anand Giri’s allegations have disgraced me, the Math and the temple. I am deeply hurt and have decided to end my life for which Anand Giri, Aadya Tiwari and his son Sandeep are responsible,” the letter said. In the purported suicide note, Mahant Narendra Giri admitted that he had planned to commit suicide on September 13 but changed his mind at the last moment as he could not muster enough courage. “However, today I have received information from Haridwar that Anand Giri may release a tampered photograph in a day or two, showing me in a compromising state with a girl. I cannot give clarifications everywhere and I will surely be disgraced if any such photograph is made viral. The post on which I am is a respected one and although people will learn about the reality later, at present I will be defamed. Anand Giri says how much and to whom Mahant Narendra Giri will give clarifications. It is better to die than live with disgrace in society. Anand Giri has also released an audio to defame me earlier,” the suicide note said. In the suicide note Narendra Giri also requested the police and administrative officials to take action against Anand Giri, Aadya Tiwari and Sandeep Tiwari so that his soul may get peace. In his will mentioned in the suicide note, Mahant Narendra Giri expressed his wish to make Balbeer Puri the Mahant of Bade Hanuman Temple and Baghambari Gaddi Math. Addressing Balbeer Puri, Mahant Narendra Giri said in the note that “You will succeed me as the Mahant of Bade Hanuman Temple and Baghambari Gaddi Math. Take care of the temple and Math as I have done in my lifetime and also be good towards my disciples Mithilesh Pandey, Ramkrishna Pandey, Manish Shukla, Shivek Kumar Mishra, Abhishek Kumar Mishra, Ujjawal Dwivedi, Prajjawal Dwivedi, Abhay Dwivedi, Nirbhay Dwivedi and Sumit Tiwari. All my disciples are favourites but Manish Shukla, Abhishek Mishra, Shivank Mishra are special. Moreover, Sumit Tiwari took good care of me when I was infected with Covid. I have registered the flower shop’s rent agreement in Sumit’s name while Hanurupa Emporium has been given on rent to Mithilesh Pandey while the sweet shop has been given to Manish, Shivesh and Abhishek Mishra.” Moreover, in his suicide note, Mahant Narendra Giri asked seers Ashutosh Giri, Nitesh Giri and others to cooperate with Balbeer Puri and requested Mahant Hargovind Puri to appoint him ( Balbeeer) as the Mahant of the Math and the temple. “Mahant Ravindra Puriji you have always supported me and now you should support Balbeer Puri after my death,” the note said. Finally, in the letter Mahant Narendra Giri requested his disciples and Panch Parmeshwar to make his ‘samadhi’ near the lemon tree in the Math besides his Guruji.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/before-suicide-mahant-narendra-giri-s-last-thoughts-were-about-math-temple-101632335198511.html

Complicated, multi-organ involvement dengue cases reported in Pune||Pune: With more complicated and multiple organ involvement dengue cases coming up among confirmed Dengue patients, city doctors believe that this could be because of the Sero type 2 dengue which is a more serious strain than the other variants of the virus. In the past two months, city hospitals are seeing more dengue patients who present serious symptoms including multiple organ involvement, longer hospitalisation and also severity in the symptoms. Earlier, the state had warned the district administration to prepare for Sero type 2 dengue cases which are on the rise. This type of dengue leads to serious cases as compared to Sero type 1 and 3 dengue cases, which is affecting kids and adults alike. Dr Parikshit Prayag, intensivist at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital said, “We are now seeing more serious dengue patients being reported in the city. In the past two months, I have had more than 10 serious dengue patients admitted in the ICU and are reporting severe dengue with brain involvement, shock syndrome, low platelet count and bone marrow suppression. Although we do not type the variant, the symptoms look like Sero type 2 variant. The severity of symptoms could also be likely in other types as well, but they are more likely in Sero type 2.” Dr Reema Kashiva, general physician at Noble Hospital said, “There is a definite surge in the numbers and that too with varied presentations. Initially dengue used to present with only fever and rashes, but now the presentations are much severe and include convulsions, paralysis and bleeding. The severity of the symptoms are equal in kids and adults, we recently had a 17-year-old kid with right upper limb and left lower limb paralysis along with dengue. The presentation is not like classic Sero type 1 so it looks like it is Sero type 2 dengue cases. The symptoms now include vomiting, very high fever, dehydration and the hospital stay has also increased and also multiple organ involvement.” Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad said, “Last Saturday, the governments of India and Maharashtra had issued a warning across the state for Sero type 2 dengue and instructed us to undertake intensive activities. Since carrier mosquito is the same for dengue, zika and chikungunya, we are redoubling our efforts and reissuing orders that has been appreciated by several authorities.” Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said, “Sero type 2 dengue causes more severe and complicated symptoms in patients compared to other variants and we have instructed officials to undertake the necessary steps to control the surge in cases. Up to September 7, 2021, we have collected 56,075 serum samples from suspect cases for dengue testing and total cases reported from the state include 6,374. For Sero sampling, the samples are sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune.” Among kids also there has been a surge in the number and the complications related to dengue cases. Dr Sagar Lad, paediatrician and consultant working with three city hospitals said, “There has been a surge in the numbers this year and we are getting more complicated cases as well. Dengue with multiorgan involvement like involvement of the heart, liver and brain. In a week we are getting at least 2-3 cases in the past two months. In the last one month I have seen at least 20-25 serious dengue patients in the three hospitals that I work with.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sero-type-2-dengue-on-the-rise-complicated-multi-organ-involvement-dengue-cases-reported-in-pune-101632334778725.html

Shopkeepers said that the issue has not been fixed despite complaints and they have had to take to social media to raise the issue. Pointing out that a stray dog was electrocuted a few days ago due to one of these corroded old cable panels that have exposed wires, traders said that many of these open wires, transformer covers and feeder boxes are located right outside shops or in the proximity of pathways that can lead to accidents during the rain.“There are a number of feeder boxes, cable and connection which are exposed and open across the Sector 18 market area. The boxes are unlocked and open. A few days ago, a dog was electrocuted. The market is usually busy--who would be responsible if any untoward incident takes place? There are so many exposed wires and feeder boxes, including one in a park. In case of waterlogging, the threat of a mishap increases. Officials should look into it,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association.He added that the issue had been raised multiple time but to no avail.“We did raise the issue with officials, but nothing has been done,” added Jain.Pallavi Dar, a resident who feeds stray dogs in Sector 18 and found one electrocuted last week, said that she has been raising the issue on social media.“It is so shocking that there are so many high voltage cables in the boxes and they are all open. That too in one of the most posh markets of the city in front famous food joints. I understand that many people don’t care about animals but what if a child touches it? It’s such a dangerous thing and officials seem least bothered,” said Dar.Officials said that they will inspect the entire area, adding that a lot of old cable feeders and chambers are being replaced in different sectors.“We will inspect the entire area and get the issue fixed. There are many panels and feeder boxes in the city which have become old. The work is already underway to change the old setups and install new ones. Till then, we will get the issue fixed at Sector 18 soon,” said VN Singh, chief engineer, Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd (PVVNL), Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traders-complain-of-open-electric-cables-feeder-pillars-in-noida-market-101632334421312.html

Trumpets of joy echoed throughout the Centre, as Wildlife SOS veterinarians and caregivers put together a special feast for the elephants under their care. As the elephants departed for their morning walks, the dedicated staff set up a grand buffet of green fodder, corn, watermelons, bananas, pumpkins and papayas. Every year the Wildlife SOS staff puts in a lot of effort to come up with innovative ideas to make the feast more enjoyable for the pachyderms. This year the fruits were stacked one on top of another to allow the elephants to topple over the fruits as they dived headfirst into the feast! On returning from their walk, the elephants rushed towards the mouth-watering meal, gobbling up all the delicious fruits. This annual jumbo feast was the first-ever for newly rescued elephants Nina and Emma, who thoroughly enjoyed the preparations done for them. Nina and Emma had been reduced to mere commodities, being worked to a breaking point in spite of suffering from a host of serious diseases. Earlier this year, they were rescued by Wildlife SOS and the Uttar Pradesh forest department and are currently undergoing specialised medical care and treatment at India’s only elephant hospital. India is home to over 50% of the population of Asian elephants in the world, making it the last strong-hold of Asian elephants. Yet, elephant populations continue to face various threats like habitat encroachment, poaching, and captivity in tourism and begging industries. Wildlife SOS established Elephant Conservation and Care Centre, Mathura in 2010 and the Elephant Hospital in 2018 in collaboration with the Uttar Pradesh forest department. With state-of-the-art veterinary facilities, the hospital cares for geriatric or injured elephants. Presently the centre is treating over 25 elephants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wildlife-sos-holds-fruit-feast-for-rescued-elephants-in-mathura-101632334179074.html

22-09-2021||Noida||Gurjars protest against Dadri MLA for dropping caste name from plaque||As Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath finished his speech and left the degree college in Dadri after unveiling a statue of the ninth-century king Mihir Bhoj, some members of the Gurjar community started shouting slogans against Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar for “dishonouring” their community. However, a heavy deployment of policemen at the venue prevented the protesters from entering the area housing the statue.Later, several men from the community gheraoed the MLA’a residence. Several members of the Rajput and the Gurjar communities have been protesting over the past few days, each claiming that the king belonged to their caste. Organisers said they removed the name of the caste on the plaque installed below the statue after they realised that including either of the castes would lead to protests.However, some members of the Gurjar community, who were also part of the group responsible for organising the event, added the name of their caste to the plaque on Wednesday morning before the chief minister arrived at the venue. But the organisers again removed the name of the caste.At the event, the chief minister unveiled the statue, inaugurated a higher secondary school and a road, a drain and other projects in Dadri before addressing the audience. As he left the venue, members of the Gurjar community realised the word “Gurjar” had been removed from the plaque. They then started shouting slogans against MLA Nagar.“They are doing politics and vitiating the atmosphere,” said Nagar before leaving the venue.Later, Dadri police station house officer Pradip Tripathi tried to calm the protesters down, but failed. He then deployed several policemen in the area.“Tejpal Nagar fears the government so much that he removed the Gurjar name just before the CM arrived. He has insulted our pride. We will teach him a lesson in the upcoming 2022 assembly elections. Why can’t we write Gurjar on the plaque when he was our king?” said Praveen Gujar, one of the protesters.Meanwhile, Rajput community members said Gurjars were wrongly interpreting history. “Pratihar Samrat Mihir Bhoj was a Rajput king and the word Gurjar refers to a place, not caste. They should understand this fact. We are happy that the CM made it clear that great people do not belong to any particular caste. We will continue to fight for our history to preserve it and we will not let anyone write the name of a caste before Mihir Bhoj,” said Rishipal Parmar, national president of Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha Trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gurjars-protest-against-dadri-mla-for-dropping-caste-name-from-plaque-101632333518755.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||Four North MCD officials get clean chit in Sabzi Mandi building collapse probe||The report on the inquiry into the Malkaganj building collapse near Sabzi Mandi area has provided a clean chit to the four supervising officials, including the deputy commissioner and the three engineers. The collapse on September 13 led to the death of two children, aged 7 and 12 years, and caused injuries to a 72-year-old shop owner. According to the report, which was submitted to the municipal commissioner on Tuesday, the inquiry found that the collapsed building was not in a dangerous state and no complaint was filed about it to the corporation’s control room. Locals informed the inquiry committee that some kind of demolition work was being undertaken at the site on the night of September 12, 2021. Jogi Ram Jain, standing committee chairman of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said he has not studied the report as yet. “The clean chit has been given to the officials concerned but I will go through the report and we will explore the possibility of re-examining it,” Jain said. North Delhi mayor Raja Iqbal Singh said he had visited the collapse site and preliminary findings show that it was a fault of the owner’s that led to the collapse.Meanwhile, a resurvey of the area in the wake of the collapse has identified at least 18 high-risk structures, which are 50 to 60 years old, in Malkaganj municipal ward. Mayor Singh said all dangerous buildings identified in the resurvey will be evacuated to protect human lives. Building collapses during the monsoon season have become an annual phenomenon in Delhi. In the past too, municipal corporations have failed to fix accountability in such cases. In the capital’s biggest such case, a five-storeyed building collapsed in east Delhi’s Lalita Park area in November 2010, killing at least 67 people and injuring 77 others. Almost eight years after that tragedy, a paltry fine of ₹21,000 was imposed on the junior engineer concerned.The issue of Sabzi Mandi collapse and dangerous buildings was also raised in the north corporation house meeting on Wednesday. Vikas Goya, leader of the opposition, demanded that a dedicated engineering wing for identifying dangerous buildings be set up and compensation be provided by the civic body to parents of the deceased children. KS Mehra, former municipal commissioner of erstwhile unified MCD, said in the Walled City, areas around Malkaganj, and in special areas, a door-to-door exercise is needed to scientifically examine the structural strength of buildings. “We had initiated a programme in this direction. The cost of examining the building strength can be levied from owners. People may resist it but it should be done since so many lives are involved,” he said. Mehra added that as a long -term solution, corporations should focus on ensuring the compliance of completion certificates. “Compliance is still low and this is the only point of intervention which can lead to long-term safety of buildings,” he said. As of now, the dangerous building survey comprises visual surveys by the junior engineer of the area and if the engineer notices structures that are bent or show signs of cracks, then (s)he inspects the structure from the inside. “A notice to get the building repaired is issued to the owner if the building can be retrofitted,” a municipal official said, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-north-mcd-officials-get-clean-chit-in-sabzi-mandi-building-collapse-probe-101632333398506.html
22-09-2021||Noida||No riot in 4.5 years, women are safe in UP, says CM Yogi Adityanath||Amid a row between the Rajput and Gurjar communities over the caste of king Mihir Bhoj, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday unveiled a 15-foot statue of the ninth-century ruler at Mihir Bhoj Degree College in Dadri.Addressing a crowd at the college, Adityanath said that king Mihir Bhoj fought bravely against “Arab invaders” for many years to protect his motherland. “Similarly, our government has ended lawlessness that earlier prevailed in the state and provided a safe environment to all, particularly to our daughters, in the last four-and-a-half years of our rule. Also, no riot took place in our rule,” the CM said. Adityanath first visited Greater Noida’s Expo Mart at 10am to attend an event and then reached Dadri. He also inaugurated a higher secondary school and a “sadbhav mandap” (community centre) before leaving for Dhaulana in Hapur to inaugurate multiple development projects there.In his 24-minute speech, the CM tried to woo Gurjars by praising their leaders. He claimed that king Mihir Bhoj won Kabul in the ninth century. “He (king Bhoj) was so brave that invaders did not dare to attack our land during his reign. And today there is a complete lawlessness in Afghanistan. Similarly, some elements want to create lawlessness in our state. They want to divide our society on caste, language or region’s lines to rule over us,” said the CM.He also appealed to the people to rise above the barriers of caste or region that divide the society. “All communities and organisations need to join hands and work together,” said the CM, in a veiled reference to the dispute between Rajput and Gurjar communities over the caste of king Mihir Bhoj. “This generation should be presented with correct facts about freedom fighters and great personalities. They did not fight for caste, village or a region but for the country,” said Adityanath.The two communities -- Rajput and Gurjar -- are fighting over the roots of king Mihir Bhoj. Rajputs have maintained that he was a ‘Pratihar Rajput king’ while Gurjars claim he was a Gurjar king. On Monday, some members of the Rajput community announced that they would protest against Adityanath during his visit to Greater Noida’s Dadri. But the event took place peacefully due to heavy police presence on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/no-riot-in-4-5-years-women-are-safe-in-up-says-cm-yogi-adityanath-101632333278468.html
22-09-2021||Noida||Man held for abducting minor girl in UP’s Greater Noida||A man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly abducting a 14-year-old girl in Dankaur on Saturday. The suspect and the girl live in the same neighbourhood, said police. The suspect appears to be 18 or 19 years old and police are yet to establish his age.The girl’s father, in his complaint, said that on September 18, the suspect and his two accomplices abducted his minor daughter from their home. “We chased them but they managed to escape,” he said. The girl is a student of Class 9.The complainant said that the suspect would intercept the girl on her way to school and threaten her with a countrymade gun. Arvind Pathak, SHO, Dankaur police station, said based on the complaint, a case was registered against the suspect and two unknown accomplices under Section 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code. “We found the girl and arrested the main suspect from Delhi. They will be sent for medical examination. We will take action based on the medical report. The suspect’s age has not been ascertained yet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-held-for-abducting-minor-girl-in-up-s-greater-noida-101632333158431.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Mega PTM increased parent participation in child’s learning, finds SCERT survey||The Delhi government’s mega parent-teacher meeting (PTM) initiative helped sensitise parents towards their children’s education and increased their participation in learning, found a survey conducted by State Council of Educational Research And Training (SCERT) Delhi.According to the survey, whose research report was handed over to deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday, during the mega PTM, almost 70% of parents discussed the regularity of their children attending school, academic activities at school and home, improvement in the child’s learning level, children’s health and hygiene, home environment, and activities of children.The survey also found that 97% of parents agreed that the mega PTM should be organised more frequently to improve participation of children in the class, the government said in a press release on Wednesday.While appreciating the efforts of the SCERT, Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said the mega PTM was launched by the government in 2016 and has led to increased engagement of parents with teachers. “In the last several years, the role of SCERT has been more prominent in the field of training and the field of research could not receive due attention. However, now SCERT Delhi has demonstrated that it is prepared to work in the field of research,” said Sisodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-mega-ptm-increased-parent-participation-in-child-s-learning-finds-scert-survey-101632333039725.html
22-09-2021||Noida||New master plan promises 4% increase in urban area in Ghaziabad, activists demand more green cover||The Master Plan 2031 of Ghaziabad aims to increase urban cover in the city from 36% to 40%--an increase of about 20 square kilometres (sqkm)--while the corresponding growth in green cover will be about 15%, which is 3.02sqkm. Worried environmentalists said more spaces should be brought under the green cover given the high pollution levels in the city. The increase in urban area in Ghaziabad means that its share will increase from 187.92sqkm to 208.8sqkm while the corresponding green area will increase from 28.18 sqkm to 31.2sqkm. The preparation of the GIS-based Master Plan 2031 is in full swing and is likely to be finalised in a month. Officials of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) said of the 522sqkm land in the city, around 40% will be urbanised once the master plan rolls out. “The geographical area remains the same but the proportion of urban area has been increased from 36% to 40%. This will pave way for more housing and civic infrastructure, among other facilities. According to norms, 15% of the land will have to be reserved for green cover,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, GDAs’ chief architect and town planner (CATP). A master plan is a broad layout of a city and clearly defines different areas according to different land-use such as residential, commercial and industrial, among others. “The Master Plan 2031 includes plans for Modinagar (including Muradnagar), Loni and Ghaziabad city. The plan will be finalised within a month and will be taken to the GDA board for approval,” said Shivpuri. However, environmentalists said the city should have more areas under green cover in the new plan, which will come into effect from next year. The current master plan will be in place till this year. “There is an urgent need to increase the green cover in the city, which is already reeling under high pollution levels. A separate plan, like the master plan, should be prepared for the entire city rather than developing green areas randomly,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer. “Moreover, efforts should be taken to find out how much of the 15% green area chalked out in the previous master plan was utilised. Considering the encroachment and vacant land, it is very likely that the green cover may not have been utilised fully,” said Vashishtha. “If it is found out the previous 15% limit was not achieved, the area should be compensated for in the new master plan,” he added. In terms of pollution, Ghaziabad city is listed among 16 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh with high pollution levels. Cities are declared non-attainment if over a five-year period, they consistently do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for PM 10 (particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter) or NO2 (nitrogen dioxide). According to Forest Survey of India’s State of Forest Report, 2019, Ghaziabad district witnessed a decline of 0.78% in forest area in 2019 compared to 2017. The total forest cover in 2019 stood at 25.22% of the district’s total geographical area of 1,179 sqkm as compared to 26% in the previous forest report released in 2017. “Developing dense forestry on areas marked as green is the need of the hour. Encroachment is rampant and there has to be strict enforcement; otherwise the city will continue to experience high levels of pollution as it comprises major industrial areas,” said Rajendra Tyagi, councillor from Raj Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/master-plan-2031-new-plan-promises-4-increase-in-urban-area-in-ghaziabad-activists-demand-more-green-cover-101632333038559.html
22-09-2021||Gurugram||Faridabad: Govt officials will not use vehicles on Wednesday, says DC||Officials of the Faridabad district administration cycled to their office on the occasion of World Car-Free Day on Wednesday, with deputy commissioner Jitender Yadav saying that all government officials will be asked not to use vehicles on Wednesday.Yadav said that officials have been asked to use public transport, cycles or walk to offices every Wednesday, and that the move may gradually be expanded to cover private companies and institutions. “There are around 1,000 vehicles arriving at the Mini Secretariat daily and a majority of these belong to government officials. We have decided that every Wednesday, officials will come by cycle, public transport or on foot,” Yadav said. To make the initiative a success, government officials will not hold any meetings on Wednesday, except in emergency cases, and officials will be allowed to leave offices at 4.50pm. “This day can be used to focus on clearing pending files and other works that need to be attended to. Officials can also meet people and attend to public grievances. Work can be completed efficiently and people also need not spend extra time in the offices,” Yadav said. Officials of Faridabad district administration said that since the entire building will be empty and free of cars, it would be easier to complete repair works and undertake maintenance of the office premises. “We will later expand the reach of this initiative to public, as it will help in cutting pollution and reduce expenditure on fuel,” Yadav said. On Wednesday, Yadav said that government officials fully supported this movement and there were few vehicles at the Mini Secretariat. “Directions in this regard have been issued to all department heads and hopefully, the compliance will remain high,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-govt-officials-will-not-use-vehicles-on-wednesday-says-dc-101632332978390.html

However, no resistance by locals or any untoward action was reported in any of them. All the structures were demolished with earthmovers and the MCG’s anti-encroachment drive will continue throughout this week in various corners of the city,” SS Rohilla, the public relations officer (PRO) of MCG, said.On Monday, the MCG conducted an anti-encroachment drive in Nathupur village, near DLF Phase-3, and reclaimed 70 square yards of civic land by demolishing illegal temporary structures, slums, and junk and building material shops. MCG officials said that while the drive in Nathupur was in response to a complaint lodged with the CM Window, the other drives were based on tip-offs. They said that a building plan has to be approved for any new construction within MCG limits, and if the same is not procured, the civic body will either seal or demolish the structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-demolishes-illegal-structures-in-areas-under-900-metre-radius-of-iaf-depot-101632332805463.html
22-09-2021||Gurugram||Banquet halls: MCG committee to conduct survey, issues notices for regularisation||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) constituted a four-member committee for surveying the total number of banquet halls in the city and subsequently, issuing notices to regularise them.According to the MCG records, there are at least 76 banquet halls in the city, of which only one banquet hall is registered with the authorities. MCG officials said that the committee was formed on the directions of the MCG commissioner, Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, on Monday.After a survey, MCG will issue notices to banquet hall owners, giving them a month to regularise their building, failing which the civic body will start sealing their properties from November, which is usually the peak wedding season.“Preparations for the survey have been started. I have set a month’s deadline for officials to compile a report on the findings from the survey and submit it. After that, notices will be issued to banquet hall owners to regularise their buildings as per the policy, failure of which will lead to sealing of their structure,” Ahuja said.Ahuja said that the survey was initiated based on the observations of the Haryana Lokayukta that banquet halls need to be regularised. He said that regularising such properties will ensure that banquet halls adhere to safety norms, crowd capacity, adequate parking space, and other such measures, besides providing an increase in the revenue collection of the MCG for the issuance of licences.Non-adherence to safety norms has been a matter of concern for the MCG, especially in regards to fire safety, since an incident in November 2018 wherein a banquet hall in Sector 9 caught fire. Although the intensity of the blaze was small, it took fire tenders nearly 25 minutes to access the site of fire as the entry of the banquet hall was narrow.Regularisation of banquet halls was first initiated in 2014, when a solitary banquet hall was regularised. Since then, the MCG has regularly conducted drives, sealing 10 banquet halls in March 2018 in the latest one, for operating without licences. In March, the MCG House also approved the regularisation of banquet halls in the city.Anil Rao, the president of the Haryana Party Lawns’ Association, said that banquet hall owners will approach the MCG with their concerns about the existing policy.“The main issue with the current policy is that it asks one-time payment of nearly ₹1 crore for regularising a banquet hall. Instead, the MCG should adopt the policy on the lines of Rajasthan, where the policy is renewed on an annual basis through the payment of ₹2-3 lakh, depending on the size of the banquet hall. This is far more economically viable and the preferred option for most banquet hall owners,” Rao said.Rao said that representatives of the association will meet MCG officials to reach an agreement on the matter so that there are no hurdles during the peak wedding season in November and December, which accounts for around 70% of their annual income.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/banquet-halls-mcg-committee-to-conduct-survey-issues-notices-for-regularisation-101632332804028.html
22-09-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 vaccination: Health workers to contact people who are due to take second dose||The Gurugram health department on Wednesday identified 54,000 people in the district who have missed their 84-112 day deadline to take their second dose of the Covishield vaccine and asked workers concerned to contact each beneficiary individually, officials familiar with the developments said.The exercise is being undertaken to ensure total vaccination for every eligible person in the district, officials said.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said that a list of such people has been shared with all health centres for contacting them and ensuring the completion of the vaccination schedule.“We have found that there are 54,000 people in the district who have taken the first dose of Covishield and their second dose is due. We have made a list of such people and it has been given to the 36 institutions in the district that are managing vaccination process. From these lists, ASHA and ANM workers will contact the beneficiaries individually to follow up on their vaccination status,” Yadav said.Officials also said that they are working to find out why people are not coming forward to take the second dose of vaccination despite reaching the due date. While contacting these beneficiaries, health workers will also take feedback on why they are yet to take their second vaccine dose. After reviewing the reasons, possible changes will be made in the system, if required, they said.On Wednesday, 25,645 people were given the Covid-19 vaccine in the district, according to the health department data, with 11,761 doses were administered as the first shot and 13,884 as the second shot. Almost 75% (19,284 doses) of the total inoculations took place at government vaccination centres and the remaining at private hospitals.Gurugram has now vaccinated over 2.95 million people in the district since January 16, when the vaccination process started.On Tuesday, the district task force also decided that vaccinations will be undertaken at religious places, markets, post offices and banks from next month to cover the maximum number of people. The health department will also be coordinating with 1,221 residents’ welfare associations in the city to conduct vaccination camps.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, five new Covid-19 cases and six recoveries were also reported from the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-vaccination-health-workers-to-contact-people-who-are-due-to-take-second-dose-101632332802738.html
22-09-2021||Gurugram||Dwarka Expressway: Contractor pulled up over concrete span collapses in March 2021||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) issued a show-cause notice to the contractor of phases three and four of Dwarka Expressway in connection with the collapse of two concrete spans on March 28 this year. The notice, issued on the basis of two committees’ findings, cited lack of coordination, lack of workmanship and substandard quality concrete in some segments of both the spans for the incident.“Accordingly without prejudice to rights and remedies as are available to authority under the said contract agreement dated 23/10/2018, this notice is served to Larsen and Toubro Limited to show cause as to why you should not be debarred for an appropriate period to be decided by NHAI from further participation in future projects apart from levying penalty, owing to omissions and commissions on the part of the contractor,” the notice, issued on September 16, stated.On March 28, two spans between pillars 107, 108 and 109 under the third phase of the under-construction project collapsed. Following the incident, both the NHAI and the ministry of road transport and highways formed individual committees that submitted their reports recently. The notice (a copy of which is with HT) stated that the contractor had made haphazard use of precast segments already used for three spans for the affected two spans, which was “tantamount to non-adherence/non-compliance of standard procedure.” “It also appears that destressing of cables and lowering of segments were done in a ‘hush hush’ manner without analysing the root cause of the failure,” the notice stated. RK Mishra, project director, L&T, Dwarka Expressway, did not respond for comment despite repeated calls and messages. A senior NHAI official, who is not authorised to speak to the media, said, “The notice was issued on the basis of findings of the committees, and the contractor will now have to submit a detailed reply after which necessary action would be taken.”NHAI officials, however, said that it was the first time that an eight-lane elevated road on a single pillar was being erected in this project, and such incidents can happen as construction is a dynamic process. The 29-kilometre Dwarka Expressway is being constructed in four phases, of which the first two phases are in Delhi.The ₹10,000-crore project will connect Kherki Daula and Mahipalpur in New Delhi on NH-48 and also provide access to the IGI Airport. This road is among the first ones in the country to have eight lanes on a single-pier flyover.The notice also stated faults in compressive strength value, as core tests were found unsatisfactory. “There have been some important issues concerning lack of workmanship, which has been admitted by contractor during casting, compaction of concrete mix, shuttering reinforcement congestion leading to failure,” the notice stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dwarka-expressway-contractor-pulled-up-over-concrete-span-collapses-in-march-2021-101632332801469.html
22-09-2021||Pune||Pune hospitals report a surge; PMC confirms 242 dengue cases in three months||Pune: Since the past three months city hospitals have witnessed a surge in the number of confirmed dengue positive cases, as each hospital is attending to at least 2-3 confirmed cases in a week since July. However, as per the PMC health department records, the city has reported only 242 confirmed dengue cases from May to September 18. The rural administration is also fighting this vector-borne virus as in the past three months 174 confirmed cases have been reported As per the PMC records, the city had reported 22 confirmed dengue cases in January after which the numbers fell to single digits between February and April and zero cases in May and June. However, a sudden surge was reported in the number of confirmed cases since July (86), August (86) and until September 18, 70 cases have been confirmed with dengue infection. Also, over 1,853 suspected dengue cases have been reported. However, this might be a far lower number than what city hospitals are reporting. Dr Rohidas Borse, professor of medicine at the state-run BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital said, “In August we saw a drastic surge in the number of dengue cases. We had reported almost 9-10 new cases everyday for three weeks which means we had seen more than 150 dengue cases in our hospitals. The surge in dengue cases had also led to a much higher demand for platelets. Now the situation is much better than what it was during the final weeks of August.” Dr Reema Kashiva, general physician at a private hospital said, “We have reported over 50 confirmed dengue cases in the past one month alone. There is a big surge in the numbers and with much severe complications. On an average, we have had 2-3 dengue cases every week and so in the past three months more than 50 patients have been treated at our hospital alone.” A doctor from Bharati Hospital requesting anonymity said, “In the past 2-3 month, we are getting a lot of dengue cases in adults and kids. Adults who are getting complicated and getting admitted in the ICU, they have a lot of organ involvement and some bleeding tendencies as well. Usually this could also be due to reinfection of dengue and some patients do tell us that they had a history of dengue infection.” Another doctor from Deenanath Mangeshkar also said that the hospital has reported over 50-60 dengue cases in the past three months. Multiple city hospitals have reported a surge in the number of confirmed dengue cases in the past three months. As per the PMC data, the city saw its highest number of dengue cases being reported in July and August, 86 each, and 70 as on September 18. A case is considered as confirmed only if the test results are conducted through IgM and not NS1 which is as per the government protocols. The NS1 is an antigen test and are included as suspected dengue cases. As of September 18, the city has reported 1853 suspected dengue cases. In the city, Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward has reported the highest spike with 46 confirmed cases of the 273 cases of dengue reported in Pune followed by Dhole Patil ward which has reported 42 such cases. The maximum number of suspected dengue cases, 141 were reported from Ghole Road-Shivajinagar wards, followed by Dhankawadi-Sahakarnagar wards with 140 suspected cases and Aundh-Baner with 139 suspected cases. Along with dengue, 111 confirmed cases of chikungunya have been reported in Pune city. In rural areas too there has been a rise in the number of cases as 174 confirmed cases of dengue have been reported and 295 suspected cases. Also, 257 confirmed cases and 363 suspected cases of chikungunya were reported from the rural areas and the Cantonment Board areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-hospitals-report-a-surge-pmc-confirms-242-dengue-cases-in-three-months-101632332738530.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||Indian cities may struggle to meet new WHO pollution standards, experts say||The revised pollution guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO), tightening the acceptable levels of pollutants might be a difficult feat to achieve for Indian cities, considering geographical and meteorological factors, but it draws attention to the high level of exposure to hazardous particles and gases that residents in Delhi face,environment and health experts said on Wednesday. They added that with Covid-19 pandemic posing a public health hazard, the agencies should intensify action to combat air pollution. The World Health Organization has tightened its air quality guidelines bringing down the annual PM 2.5 (respirable pollution particles) guideline from 10 micrograms per cubic metres to 5 micrograms per cubic metres and the 24-hour PM 2.5 limit from 25 micrograms per cubic metres to 15 micrograms per cubic metres. It has also tightened norms for five other pollutants based on recent evidence of health impacts associated with them, a WHO report released on Wednesday, said.Experts said the new levels show how even the slightest increase in pollution levels in a city can impact the health of its residents, especially the vulnerable sections. “By reducing the ambient levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) under the new air quality guidelines, WHO has re-emphasised the need for putting in more efforts to control particulate matter concentration in air. Though it would be a huge challenge to achieve those levels, but it should be taken as a wake-up call. Efforts by all stakeholders needs to be intensified in order to control pollution levels,” said Dr Arun Sharma, director, National Institute for Implementation Research of Non-Communicable Diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Releasing its revised air quality guidelines, the WHO in a statement highlighted that in recent years several studies have established how even a slight increase in pollution levels in a region can adversely impact the health of its residents. A 2013 assessment by WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) highlighted that outdoor air pollution is carcinogenic to humans, with the particulate matter component of air pollution most closely associated with increased cancer incidence, especially lung cancer. An association also has been observed between outdoor air pollution and an increase in cancer of the urinary tract, the 2013 report said. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said that while it might be tough to conform to the new WHO guidelines for a city like Delhi, where even the baseline pollution levels are just short of meeting the national annual standards of 40ug/m3, it is important to scale up action to reduce pollution levels as much as possible. “What we saw during the Covid-19 lockdown, when all pollution sources in the city were shut, there was a reduction of 40-45% in pollution levels. This was a little close to our own pollution standards. While the WHO standards are tough to meet but we need to come up with tighter and stricter action plans for pollution management. Action should not just be localised, we need regional action plans as well,” Roychowdhury said. Delhi, because of its landlocked geography and its weather conditions, faces a year-long pollution problem that reaches emergency levels every winter. Delhi’s baseline pollution study, the minimum pollution when major polluting sources are shut, which was conducted by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) during the Covid-19 pandemic last year shows that the baseline levels of PM10 and PM2.5 were found to be 38ug/m3 (+/- 8) and 22ug/m3 (+/- 6) respectively. The baseline value of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) was found to be 8 parts per billion (+/- 3), which is also considered to be very high. Dr Arvind Kumar, founder, Lung Care Foundation and chairperson of Institute of Chest Surgery (chest onco-surgery and lung transplantation), said all possible efforts should be made to resolve the crisis. “As doctors, we see the effects of air pollution on people every day. This is a public health emergency, impacting the lives of people but its worst impacts are seen in South Asian countries like India. For the sake of our future generations, we need to commit to doing anything and everything it takes to solve this crisis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/indian-cities-may-struggle-to-meet-new-who-pollution-standards-experts-say-101632332318339.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||DoE to hold orientation session for teachers to prepare them for Virtual School||In preparation for the Delhi Model Virtual School (DMVS), the Directorate of Education (DoE) will on Thursday begin conducting orientation sessions for computer science teachers of government schools. The two-day orientation will mainly cover discussing the teaching modules and patterns of the virtual school with the teachers.“We plan to start admissions for the virtual model school this month. We are still in the planning stage and will release detailed information on the mode of assessment, academic cycle, and admission process by next week. For now, we have just started the process of getting our teachers acquainted with the learning model,” said a senior official in the education department.The virtual school is one of the flagship projects of the Delhi government which aims to facilitate easy learning for students who want to benefit from the “Delhi model of education”. The setting up of the school was announced in March this year during the annual budget.The model virtual school will be governed by the Delhi Schools of Specialized Excellence Society and will be affiliated to the newly formed Delhi Board of Secondary Education (DBSE), which has collaborated with the International Baccalaureate as a knowledge partner for its curriculum framework.“It will function for classes 9-12. For the year 2021-22, the school shall offer admission to students in Class 9 and 11,” said a DoE circular signed by deputy director education (schools).In August, HT had first reported that DMVS will cater to students interested in studying from home, such as sportspersons, artists or school dropouts,and will admit students in classes 9 and 11 within Delhi. DMVS plans to expand to other parts of the country later.On Tuesday, DoE released a circular saying that an orientation session will be conducted for computer science teachers in 10 batches between Thursday and Friday. The Core Academic Unit, which helped conduct online classes during the pandemic, will also play a key role in developing content and working on its delivery across schools.“In these sessions, participants will be briefed about the modalities of the virtual school and various aspects of teacher and student selection. This will be followed by answering their queries and collecting their feedback,” DoE said.The department has also asked mentor teachers and computer teachers in these schools to conduct an outreach event on DMVS for other teachers of their schools. “They [computer teachers] will also identify and reach out to potential students (and their parents, if possible) who could be part of DMVS, especially those who have dropped out of Directorate of Education schools and are eligible for studying in Class 9 or 11,” the circular stated.Mentor teachers said that computer science teachers were picked for the training first due to their technical skills and the readiness to replicate the learning modules among other teachers. Under DVMS, the evaluation of learning goals will be conducted through “technology-assisted assessments” via a unique learning management system or designated assessment centres. “Modes of assessment will vary from quizzes, assignments, live assessments, and proctored examinations,” stated a document on the planning of the school.The learning management system will host several functions, including live streaming of sessions, act as a virtual library, assign and evaluate paperless assignments, maintain class calendars, conduct virtual conversations, and set up an artificial intelligence-based interface to create a personalised learning flow according to the level of each student.Reflecting on the plans, mentor teacher Poonam (who goes by her first name) said, “Though online classes have been going on for over a year now, not all our teachers are 100% tech-savvy. So we decided to start with computer teachers because the virtual model school will involve more tech-based activities such as creating quizzes or polls according to a student’s learning level. The computer teachers can adopt these practices and later train other teachers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/doe-to-hold-orientation-session-for-teachers-to-prepare-them-for-virtual-school-101632332198853.html
22-09-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow saw 150 dengue cases in Sept; next 15 days crucial: Experts||LUCKNOW With over 150 cases of dengue reported in September, the total number of cases this year crossed the 230-mark in Lucknow with experts saying that the next 15 days were crucial. Uttar Pradesh had reported at least 4,500 cases of dengue this year and patients with fever were continuing to throng OPDs of different hospitals. “This year dengue has struck earlier than usual and the period till October 15 is crucial. Hence, we need to continue preventive activities,” said Dr Awadhesh Kumar Yadav, joint director (malaria), in the state health department. Dengue and viral fever showed symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, malaise and throat problem. These were almost common and hard to differentiate, said Prof Kauser Usman, HoD, geriatric medicine at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU). “September has been crucial with majority of the dengue cases reported in this month. As extended rains continue in the region, the threat of mosquito breeding remains with stagnant water in unused items such as old tyres, broken cups and empty cans,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association on International Doctors. “We have intensified preventive measures and door-to-door checking is being carried out to check if conditions favourable for mosquito breeding exist in homes. In September till now, over 150 notices have been served to owners of houses where stagnant water or other favourable conditions were found,” said Dr Manoj Agrawal, CMO, Lucknow. Doctors advised that one should not go for self-medication in case of fever. “Antibiotics should never be started without doctor’s advice as diagnosis might become difficult once antibiotics are started,” said Prof Usman. BOXWHAT RESIDENTS CAN DO # Ensure there is no stagnant water inside the room, balcony or on the rooftop. # Wear full sleeves shirt and trousers, particularly when going out of the house. # Make children wear socks when they go out or even while playing in the open area. # Look for broken cups, unused bottles and bottle caps in the corners of the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-saw-150-dengue-cases-in-sept-next-15-days-crucial-experts-101632332019587.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi simplifies rules for surviving spouses to avail of coronavirus financial assistance||The Delhi government on Wednesday said a surviving member certificate will no longer be needed to claim financial assistance under a scheme concerning the death of a spouse due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The financial assistance scheme for Covid-19 deaths was notified on June 23 this year, after the second wave of the pandemic took a heavy toll in Delhi. It covers a one time assistance of ₹50,000 for each Covid-19 death in the family and a monthly assistance of ₹2,500 for families that lost their primary breadwinner and also for children orphaned by the viral disease.The government has so far received around 11,000 applications for financial assistance, of which around 8,500 applications pertain to the one-time assistance of ₹50,000. The remaining are for monthly assistance of ₹2,500 over the death of the breadwinner of the family. Of the total applications received, around 7,800 have been approved, said a senior official in the government.Delhi has recorded around 25,100 Covid-19 deaths so far, according to the state health bulletin figures.Earlier, for applying under the death of a spouse scheme, one had to approach the offices of the revenue department concerned and obtain a document called the surviving member certificate, and the whole process took around a week or more, what with applications piling up at the offices of tehsildars and subdivisional magistrates. “This certificate requirement has now been done away with in cases in which the claimant is a spouse. The move is expected to reduce the paperwork burden significantly,” said the official mentioned above, asking not to be named.For all other claimants, such as mother/father or children, a surviving member certificate is necessary, the official clarified.Also, of the total applications received for financial assistance so far, the government did not share a break-up of how many of these were from married persons.“Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot chaired a high level meeting (on Wednesday) with department officials to review the ‘Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Parivar Arthik Sahayata Yojna ( the chief minister’s Covid-19 financial aid for families scheme)’... During the meeting, it has been decided that under this yojna there will no longer be a need for obtaining a surviving member certificate (SMC) from the applicant in cases where one of the spouses is alive,” the government said in a statement on Wednesday.It further said, “However, the requirement of a surviving member certificate will remain in force for the grant of ex gratia for other applicants. In cases where the deceased was a single parent, the surviving children are entitled to the ex gratia, equally distributed among all children. But for that, the name of the applicant should be reflected in the SMC. Similarly, if the deceased is unmarried or is a minor son/daughter, the father or mother of the deceased will get relief under the scheme subject to their name appearing in the SMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-simplifies-rules-for-surviving-spouses-to-avail-of-coronavirus-financial-assistance-101632332018492.html

Largely similar, the three action plans to curb pollution from waste burning and dust focus on intensive patrolling, increased mechanical sweeping, targeted operation of GPS monitored water sprinkling tankers and a new portal, being developed with the help of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to monitor large construction sites. Shyam Sunder Agarwal, mayor of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) said the civic body will once again focus on deploying water sprinklers and mechanical sweepers and is likely to broadly replicate last year’s plan.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) action plan said it will procure four new electrical road sweepers that can cover inner colony roads, and added that a dashboard has been set up to monitor in real-time the operations of 24 mechanical road sweepers and 83 water sprinklers that will be pressed into action. A senior official from the north corporation overseeing the formulation of the plan said the municipal corporations will, with DPCC, develop a common portal, on which it will be mandatory to register all construction sites above 20,000 sqm area. The civic body will also deploy 48 patrolling teams to check instances of waste burning in the city. “Earlier, the patrolling teams operated at night, but we have decided that they will now function round-the-clock over the coming months. We have kept the target of planting 20,000 trees and 30,000 shrubs, of which 17,098 trees and 25,493 shrubs have been planted till August 31,” the official said.The north MCD has also set up a separate dust control and management cell headed by its chief engineer. “We have also separately asked for ₹224.18 crore for dust pollution mitigation, under the National Clean Air Programme,” the official added.SDMC has informed that they are using dust suppressants at the Okhla landfill as a pilot project, and added that an anti-smog gun has been permanently deployed on the garbage mound. However, data from the civic body shows that SDMC is currently processing only 50% of the municipal waste being produced in its areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pollution-action-plan-delhi-civic-bodies-suggest-24x7-patrolling-for-waste-burning-portal-for-dust-management-101632331658441.html

In a statement released on Wednesday, the CAQM said Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh among other states have prepared detailed action plans for controlling stubble burning this year, based on the framework made by the commission. The commission said governments have been directed to implement these individual plans based on framework, such as in-situ and ex-situ crop residue management, prohibition of stubble burning, effective monitoring and enforcement and plans to reduce the generation of paddy straw. “Directions have been issued for adopting a standard protocol developed by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) for recording and monitoring fire counts owing to stubble burning. With regard to promotion of the use of bio-decomposer technology developed by IARI (Indian Agricultural Research Institute), as part of in-situ crop residue management, the commission has been informed that the Pusa bio-decomposer has been planned for application of 6 lakh acres in U.P, 1 Lakh acres in Haryana, 7,413 acres in Punjab and 4,000 acres in Delhi respectively,” the statement released by the CAQM said. The statement also said the state governments have also been informed to take measures for the abatement of road dust through a “dust control and management cell’’. “Activities identified for effective road dust management include optimum utilisation of mechanized sweeping of roads, scientific disposal of dust collected in designated sites or landfills, sprinkling of dust suppressants and water on roads and open areas, proper maintenance of roads, paving and greening of non-paved roadsides, greening of central verges, preference to cemented roads over bituminous roads, especially in industrial areas, monitoring and compliance of dust control measures and plantation of trees/greening on a large scale,” said the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/caqm-to-strictly-monitor-winter-action-plans-prepared-by-states-101632331298262.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||DTU’s Yogesh Singh appointed 23rd Vice Chancellor of Delhi University||New Delhi: President Ram Nath Kovind appointed Yogesh Singh, head of the state-run Delhi Technological University (DTU), as the 23rd vice-chancellor (VC) of the Delhi University (DU) on Wednesday. Singh succeeds Yogesh Tyagi who was suspended by the union education ministry in October last year over the charges of “non-performance”. The Centre pointed out several shortcomings in the functioning of the university under Tyagi’s tenure. PC Joshi, who was the pro-vice chancellor, had been serving as the acting vice-chancellor till now.Singh, 55, is considered close to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-backed teachers’ group Bharatiya Shikshan Mandal. Officials at the education ministry confirmed to HT that although five candidates were shortlisted by the search-cum-selection committee, only Singh’s name was sent for the final nod from the President-- who is also the Visitor to all central universities.The Union education ministry, in a letter, on Wednesday informed the DU Registrar about the new appointment. “The President of India, in his capacity as the Visitor of the University of Delhi, has been pleased to appoint professor Yogesh Singh, Vice Chancellor of Delhi Technological University, Delhi, as the Vice Chancellor of Delhi University for the period of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office,” the letter signed by PK Singh, under secretary, education ministry, said. Prior to joining DTU in 2015, Singh served as the director of Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (now known as Netaji Subhas University of Technology) between 2014 and 2017. Between 2015 and 2017, he handled the charges of both DTU and NSIT. He also served as the vice-chancellor of Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in Gujarat, between 2011 and 2014. Officials in the ministry said the Gujarat government under then chief minister Narendra Modi had extended his tenure for the second term. “But he moved to Delhi due to some reasons in 2014, and joined NSIT,” an official said.Singh, who hails from Uttar Pradesh’s (UP) Aligarh, did his M Tech in electronics and communication engineering from National Institute of Technology (NIT) Kurukshetra, Haryana. He also completed his PhD in computer engineering from the same institution. Calling it a “privilege” to be selected as the vice-chancellor of DU, Singh said, “It’s a great opportunity and a matter of pride for me. DU is one of the best institutions in the country and it will be my privilege to serve as the VC of this institution. It becomes even more special that I have been selected as the VC of DU in its centenary year.”“I am a team player. I will work taking all stakeholders together and take all necessary steps for the further growth and development of the institution,” he added.When asked about his purported association with the RSS-backed teachers’ body, he said, “It doesn’t make any difference. I have been given a responsibility to serve an institution, and I will do my best to fulfil that.”Meanwhile, the President also appointed Neelima Gupta as the Vice Chancellor of Dr Hari Singh Gaur Vishwavidyalaya in Madhya Pradesh. She is currently serving as the VC of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University in Bihar.The appointment process of vice chancellors is still pending in at least eight other central universities, including the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dtus-yogesh-singh-appointed-23rd-vice-chancellor-of-delhi-university-101632331058482.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 8 districts report Covid positivity rate higher than state average||Maharashtra has witnessed a drop in daily Covid-19 case load, test positivity and growth rates in the past few days. However, eight districts have reported positivity rate higher than the state average. As per data, none of the districts have a test positivity rate over 5% mark, which has happened after a long time. The state on Wednesday recorded 3,608 new Covid cases and 48 deaths, taking tally to 6,531,237 and toll to 138,664. Mumbai reported 486 new cases and four deaths, pushing tally to 739,361 and toll to 16,063. The day also saw 168,317 tests while the number of recoveries clocked 4,285.The weekly positivity rate of Maharashtra is 2.28%, though eight districts have a higher positivity rate. Positivity rate is the percentage of positive cases against tests conducted. The districts with high positivity rates are Ahmednagar (4.78%), Pune (4.62%), Sangli (3.97%), Sindhudurg (3.46%), Osmanabad (3.40%), Nashik (2.94%), Palghar (2.56%) and Satara (2.37%),According to Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force and director of critical care, Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said the situation was under control. “We are in a much better situation compared to previous weeks. We have stepped up surveillance in areas where cases are high and are concentrating on bringing the numbers down,” said Dr Pandit. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed district administrations to ramp up vaccination. “The state has a stock of around 3.6 million doses available for inoculation. The districts with the poor rate of vaccination should ramp it up. Vaccines tend to blunt the severity of Covid-19 and death rate among fully vaccinated people is less. Though Covid cases have dropped in the state, authorities should not lower their guard,” he said. Meanwhile, 10 districts in the state have weekly Covid-19 growth rate higher than the state average of 0.052%. These include Ahmednagar (0.202%) Solapur (0.116%), Satara (0.094%), Sangli (0.082%), Ratnagiri (0.080%), Osmanabad (0.078%), Raigad (0.073%), Pune (0.066%), Mumbai (0.060%) and Sindhudurg (0.058%).Weekly data of the state government has revealed that 10 districts have reported 73.3% of the total active cases in the state. These include Pune, Thane, Ahmednagar, Mumbai and Satara. Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general of Organised Medicine Academic Guild, said both authorities and citizens are responsible for this impasse. “Districts like Ahmednagar, Pune and Sangli have been witnessing surge from the very beginning and the authorities are unable to rein in the virus. Citizens, too, flout Covid-19 norms,” said Dr Gilada.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 39,984, of which Pune tops with 11,344 patients followed by Thane with 5,507 active patients and Ahmednagar with 5,100.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-8-districts-report-covid-positivity-rate-higher-than-state-average-101632330398219.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra cabinet clears plan for multi-member wards in urban civic bodies, excluding Mumbai||The state cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal reverting to the system of electing multiple councillors or corporators from every ward in all municipal corporations and municipal councils in the state, excluding Mumbai. The state government will promulgate an ordinance to make the amendment. Through the decision, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is expected to gain in the local body polls to be held later this year and early next year.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is governed by an independent Act — the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, will continue to elect one councillor in every ward in the city, which is scheduled to go to polls in February 2022.In the new system, voters will elect a three-member panel in each of the wards in municipal corporation areas. In municipal council areas, voters will elect a panel of two members. In a single-member ward system, a voter votes for one candidate, like it is done in Mumbai civic body.Once formalised by way of an ordinance, the decision will come into effect for municipal corporations of Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Thane, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Panvel, Mira-Bhayander, Solapur, Nashik, Malegaon, Parbhani, Nanded-Waghala, Latur, Amravati, Akola, Nagpur and Chandrapur, which go to polls in February-March 2022. Over 50 municipal councils including Baramati, Digras, Kandhar, Indapur, Kannad, Lonavala, Buldhana, Udgir, Paithan, Alibag, Beed, among others, are scheduled to go for polls between January and March 2022.A month after coming to power, the MVA government, in December 2019, had reverted the decision on the four-member councillor ward which was brought in by the erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in May 2016. Then the state had contended that the amendment was necessary to bring accountability to each councillor as well as avoid conflicts among councillors elected from a single ward.However, the decision on Wednesday was made stating that civic issues can be resolved appropriately with collective representation in the wards. “The chief minister and deputy chief minister have finalised a three-member panel in municipal corporation areas. In municipal councils, there will be two members. This will make the development work in the wards easier and faster. The nagar panchayat, which is smaller in area, will have one member. The decision will be beneficial for citizens,” State urban development department minister Eknath Shinde said after the cabinet meeting.Politically, the multi-member ward is beneficial to the ruling party. Shinde added, “The government has kept the welfare of the citizens before them while making this amendment... It will be beneficial for MVA in the upcoming local body polls. It will be helpful in accomodating everybody, besides that, the new system will help in getting development work faster.”Each of the three parties will be able to field candidates in each electoral ward since multiple councillors will have to be elected. This would avoid dispute between the three allies if they contest the coming elections as a coalition. State minority affairs and skill development minister, Nawab Malik, added that the decision will help field a woman candidate, one candidate from Other Backward Classes (OBC), and a candidate from the open category in the pane. “With this decision, one woman, one OBC and one open category candidate can be [in the panel] so that there will be no injustice to anybody, and nobody will be impacted due to reservation in any particular ward. All sections will get justice through the decision to form a three-member panel,” he said.According to a cabinet minister, there was division in the number of panel members during the cabinet meeting. The urban development department headed by Sena minister Eknath Shinde had put a proposal to have a four-member panel, similar to what was done in 2016. “Some cabinet ministers said that the four-member panel will be huge and the three-member panel will be useful for the development of the wards,” the minister later said.The chief minister’s office, in a statement, said, that the decision was made also considering the issues observed while handling the health situation due to the pandemic. “Considering the issues observed while handling the health situation due to Covid-19 and the facts pointed out by the elected representatives, it was felt that to address the civic issues and to fulfil the responsibilities, the collective leadership (multi-member ward system) will be more appropriate. Hence, it was decided to reintroduce the multi-member ward system for the municipal corporations and municipal councils,” said the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-clears-plan-for-multi-member-wards-in-urban-civic-bodies-excluding-mumbai-101632330098464.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||In a year, Delhi to get eco park to manage e-waste||In about a year, Delhi will have an e-waste management eco park, which will be the first of its kind in the country, lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal’s office said on Wednesday. The idea to build such a park was finalised in a meeting chaired by the L-G on Wednesday, even as its location and model is yet to be decided. The meeting was attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, urban development minister Satyendar Jain and environment minister Gopal Rai, apart from top officials of the Delhi government, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the municipal corporations. “Such a park is needed for scientific and environmentally safe dismantling, refurbishing, recycling and disposal of electronic waste in the city. It is estimated that Delhi generates about 200,000 tonnes of e-waste annually that comprises electrical appliances, electronic items, computers, accessories and mobile phones, among others. This waste is potentially hazardous to not only the environment but also to human health,” the L-G’s office said in a statement issued after the meeting. Baijal directed officials to devise a system at the earliest for the sustainable disposal of e-waste. “Setting up of the e-waste management park, which will be a first of its kind in the country, will serve this purpose and also provide an example for the rest of the country. After detailed discussions, it was decided that the park will be set up in a timebound manner with various committees looking into identification of suitable land in conjunction with the DDA,” the L-G’s office said.Chief secretary Vijay Dev was directed by Baijal to constitute a steering committee at the earliest for the selection of a consultant to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) of the e-waste park and to oversee the entire process till the park is made operational. “Latest technology and integration of the unorganised sector comprising waste collectors should be thought of. Also, a suitable model for maintenance and viability of the park should be kept in mind. The committees will have representation from the ministry of electronics and information technology and the office of the Prime Minister’s scientific advisor, apart from other stakeholders from the Delhi government, DDA, pollution control agencies and the urban local bodies. The L-G reiterated the need for integrating the informal sector and making the common citizens of the city stakeholders in the project for it to succeed,” the office statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-a-year-delhi-to-get-eco-park-to-manage-ewaste-101632329921917.html
22-09-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh power engineers’ body warns of strike against harassment by UPPCL management||UP Rajya Vidyut Parishad Abhiyanta Sangh on Wednesday warned of a statewide strike against the alleged harassment of engineers by the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) management. The threat came amid the ongoing work boycott by power engineers under the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd (PVVNL) against transfer of 23 junior engineers, many of them from Noida and Greater Noida, to Purvanchal without serving any notice to them. “State’s power engineers will be resorted to go on the statewide strike if UPPCL management does not roll back the transfer of 23 engineers,” UPRVPAS general secretary Prabhat Singh said. Singh said that if 23 transferred engineers committed any irregularities in giving temporary power connections, the management should get the issue probed and then act accordingly. “But it is not fair to punish and harass them without a probe,” he said. He claimed that the ongoing boycott by engineers had started affecting maintenance of power supply in cities and villages under the MVVNL. UPPCL director, personnel and appointment, AK Purvar, however, dismissed the Abhiyanta Sangh’s charges terming these as bogus. “All the 23 engineers were transferred after a probe committee under a UPPCL chief engineer found massive irregularities in issuing temporary power connections in the Gautam Buddh Nagar district. “Now, a charge sheet will be served to all the accused who will be given an opportunity to be heard before a penal takes action against them,” he said. Meanwhile, a six-member delegation of the UP Power Officers’ Association on Wednesday met energy minister Shrikant Sharma and supported department’s policy of zero tolerance against corruption. The delegation led by the association working president Awadhesh Kumar Verma said that Dalit and backward caste engineers that the association represented would work one hour extra every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-power-engineers-body-warns-of-strike-against-harassment-by-uppcl-management-101632329918187.html
22-09-2021||Other||ED inquiry against Pankaj Gupta part of BJP conspiracy: AAP MLA Raghav Chadha||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday said the enforcement directorate (ED) inquiry against party national secretary Pankaj Gupta was part of a BJP conspiracy in view of the growing popularity of AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal in states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party. “Today, I stand in front of the enforcement directorate office with the national secretary of AAP. We will most certainly cooperate with these agencies and let me tell you that all these agencies, for the last eight years, have looked into every book of accounts of the AAP. Not even a single year has passed by when we have not received these assessment notices. CBI has raided the chief minister, deputy chief minister, health minister and AAP’s 21 MLAs were booked under fabricated cases and arrested. About 20 of our MLAs were disqualified from the assembly and the Shunglu committee was incorporated to look into 450 administrative files of the Delhi government. In each of these enquiries, the AAP has received a clean chit. This is because we are upright and committed to the betterment of the people of this country,” AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said while talking to reporters outside the ED office. The AAP leader, who is also an MLA from Rajendra Nagar in Delhi, said the party will not be deterred by these “threats” by the BJP. “AAP enters the political scene in Uttarakhand and the BJP is compelled to replace its chief minister on more than one occasion. The AAP wins 27 seats in the Surat municipality in the BJP fortress of Gujarat, subsequently, the BJP is compelled to remove its chief minister there as well. AAP goes to Goa, decimates Congress and emerges as the principal opposition to the BJP and now the BJP stands rattled. AAP goes to Punjab and every opinion poll in the country is showing that AAP is likely to form a government in Punjab with a thumping majority. It’s the growing popularity of AAP that has made these love letters being sent to us,” Chadha said. The Delhi BJP said Kejriwal should first focus on providing employment to the youth in Delhi before making “tall promises” in poll-bound states such as Uttarakhand, Punjab and Goa. “Kejriwal is busy touring these states and doing election stunts. He should first tell people how much allowance he has given in the past seven years to the 1.4 million unemployed people in Delhi who are registered on the government’s portal. In the last two years, only 28 and in the last seven years of AAP’s rule, only 404 people were given jobs,” said Adesh Gupta, Delhi BJP president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ed-inquiry-against-pankaj-gupta-part-of-bjp-conspiracy-aap-mla-raghav-chadha-101632329678175.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||BJP-ruled states see more crimes against women than Maha: Congress||A day after Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari asked the state government to hold a two-day session to discuss atrocities against women, the Maharashtra Congress has hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), pointing at the high number of such cases in the BJP-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. Citing the National Crime Records Bureau data released recently, the Congress has also said that the number of cases of crime against women was more during the five-year rule of Fadnavis government until October 2019. Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary Sachin Sawant said the BJP-ruled Assam is at the forefront of atrocities against women with 154 cases per lakh population. He said that UP has been at the top in 2020 in murders and gangrape, while the state registered 59,445, 59,853 and 49,385 cases of atrocities against women in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Maharashtra has reported 35,497; 37,144 ad 31954 cases in three years respectively, Sawant stated. Sawant also pointed at the Fadnavis government claiming between 2015 and 2019 the number of cases were more in those five years against the MVA rule since November 2019. “The Fadnavis government’s stint was a dark era for women. In the five years of the BJP-led government’s rule, 31,216, 31,388, 31,978, 35,497 and 37,144 cases of women atrocities were reported in five years from 2014 to 2019. The number rose from just 26,818 cases in 2014, when the Congress-led government was in power. In 2020, after the MVA took over, 31,954 cases of crimes against women were registered. In 2019, the last year of Fadnavis government saw as many as 47 cases of gangrapes, which were the highest in the country,” he said. On Tuesday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wrote back to governor BS Koshyari pressing for a special four-day session of parliament to discuss atrocities against women in the country. He also said the BJP-ruled states like UP, Gujarat were witnessing more atrocities than in Maharashtra. It was a reply to the governor, who had directed the CM to hold a 2-day session to discuss the atrocities against women in the wake of the Sakinaka rape and attack case. BJP’s vice-president Chitra Wagh said that instead of pointing fingers at Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the state government should concentrate on the law and order in Maharashtra. “The cases of atrocities in Maharashtra have gone up after the MVA government came to power. We have demanded a special law on the lines of the existing Act for atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,” Wagh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjpruled-states-see-more-crimes-against-women-than-maha-congress-101632329319974.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Smog tower in to be made fully functional by October 1, says Gopal Rai||New Delhi: The state government’s first smog tower, in central Delhi’s Connaught Place, will be completely operational from October 1, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said on Wednesday. He said that the trial of the tower, at Baba Kharak Singh Marg in Connaught Place, has been completed and added that a team of experts from the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) in Mumbai and Delhi as well as the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has also been constituted to monitor its functioning. “The trial for the smog tower has been completed. This will start functioning in its complete capacity from October 1. For its monitoring a team of scientists from IIT-Bombay, IIT-Delhi and DPCC is ready,” Rai tweeted on Wednesday. Rai said that the structure will help filter air and help Delhi in its fight to reduce the pollution levels. This is part of a slew of measures taken by the Delhi government to manage the city’s deteriorating air quality, which tends to worsen every year during the winters. The government has also announced the formulation of a detailed winter action plan for Delhi this season, for which they have roped in all state agencies in the city, with an aim to check local pollution sources. The CP smog tower, which is a 24-metre-high structure, was inaugurated by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on August 23 this year. It has 40 fans and 10,000 filters developed by experts from the University of Minnesota in the United States which also helped design a 100-metre-high smog tower in Xian, China. The tower cost the government ₹20 crore and has been designed to purify air in a 1km radius around it at a rate of 1,000 cubic metres of air per second. Earlier this month, another smog tower was also inaugurated at Delhi’s Anand Vihar, which was installed under the supervision of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-smog-tower-in-to-be-made-fully-functional-by-october-1-says-gopal-rai-101632329138690.html

We have lodged a case of theft and initiated investigation.” According to police sources, the temple is built on the private property of one Anand Kumar Singh, who is a descendent of a royal family. The temple was under a private trust named Ram Janki Trust. The temple was built by Singh’s ancestors over a century ago. The temple has several idols kept inside. The priest of the temple, on Wednesday morning, found the lock on the inner gate of the temple broken and idols’ missing. “The missing idols were made of metal and were three to nine inches tall and were over a century old. We have formed two teams to track the thieves. We are taking help from the dog squad, forensic unit and local intelligence,” said Satyendra Bhushan Tiwari, Circle Officer, of the area. “The temple has no CCTV camera or security guard. A priest takes care of the temple and locks it in the night,” he added. As per residents, some idols were stolen from the same temple over 15 years ago. A case regarding that matter was lodged but the idols were never recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ayodhya-eight-idols-stolen-from-century-old-temple-101632328958334.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||CR to hold 10-hour mega block between Kalwa and Mumbra on Sunday||The Central Railway (CR) has announced a mega block of 10 hours between Kalwa and Mumbra railway stations on the mainline from 8am to 6pm on Sunday. The block is being undertaken for construction work of the fifth and sixth railway line between Diva and Thane stations. The block will result in cancellation of nearly 90 suburban local train services. CR will also undertake more blocks of five hours in October and 10 hours in November, December and January to complete the construction of railway lines and connection works with Thane and Diva railway stations.Once completed, the new railway lines will enable segregation of outstation and local trains on Central Railway till Kalyan. After completion of the railway line and segregation of outstation trains at Kalyan yard, 100 new local train services are likely to be introduced on CR mainline between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kalyan railway stations. “Up slow and semi-fast services leaving Kalyan from 7.27am to 5.40pm will be diverted on up fast railway line between Diva and Mulund stations. All local trains leaving CSMT between 8am and 5pm and arriving at CSMT between 9am and 7pm will arrive at the destination 10 minutes behind schedule,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway. Central Railway has written to the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) asking them to provide 100 additional buses during the period of the block on Sunday. Passenger associations have asked the Maharashtra government to operate additional buses between Thane and Diva railway stations to reduce passenger inconvenience. “The state government should operate buses between railway stations that would help passengers to commute during the block,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cr-to-hold-10-hour-mega-block-between-kalwa-and-mumbra-on-sunday-101632328838742.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||Chandiwal commission re-issues bailable warrant against Param Bir Singh||The inquiry commission headed by retired Bombay high court (HC) judge, justice (retired) Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal has re-issued a bailable warrant against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh for not appearing before it on Wednesday. The commission earlier this month had the first time issued a bailable warrant against Singh. Singh’s was not available for comment as his phone was switched off.“The state crime investigation department (CID) team that went to three of his (Singh’s) known residences in Chandigarh and Mumbai did not find him there and could not serve the warrant. And as he also failed to appear before the commission, the commission re-issued the bailable warrant against him,” said commission’s lawyer Shirish Hiray. Earlier during the hearing, Anil Deshmukh’s lawyer had demanded before the commission that a non-bailable warrant be issued against Singh and his properties be confiscated. However, Hiray opposed the same saying that Singh should be given fair opportunities to present his side before the commission and even after that, if he fails to show up before the probe commission, then the commission may think of taking stern action. “The commission felt that Singh is a senior police officer and should be given another chance to appear before the commission, hence re-issued a bailable warrant (and not a non-bailable warrant). The next hearing of the matter is on October 6,” Hiray said. The justice Chandiwal committee was constituted by the Maharashtra government to look into the allegations of corruption levelled by Singh against the state’s ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh. The commission earlier had imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on Singh twice for not appearing before the commission. In past, Singh had opposed the very formation of the commission through his lawyer saying that it is doing the same thing that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is already doing in Deshmukh’s matter. The commission had then observed that the commission’s work is different from that of CBI, and it would make recommendations to the government after completing the inquiry. Singh is already facing five FIRs in Maharashtra and a look-out circular (LOC) has also been issued against him. Apart from this, two open inquiries have also been initiated against him by the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) pertaining to corruption allegations made against him by two serving police inspectors. Complaints started piling up against Singh after he wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray this year alleging that former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh asked Mumbai Police officers to collect ₹100 crore every month from the bars and restaurants. The letter prompted a CBI probe against Deshmukh and forced the former minister to resign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/chandiwal-commission-re-issues-bailable-warrant-against-param-bir-singh-101632328659769.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||OBC quota: Maharashtra govt to resend ordinance to governor Koshyari for approval||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has decided to resend its ordinance, for providing reservations to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the rural local bodies’ elections, to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. The state cabinet on Wednesday decided that there is no need to take prior permission from the Supreme Court (SC) for promulgating the ordinance as OBC reservation will not exceed 27% and the total reservation quota in any of the districts will not breach the 50% cap determined by the Apex court.The decision was taken in response to the query raised by the Governor, who refused to clear the ordinance saying that the state government should inform the Apex court in advance, as the reservation of the OBC community was scrapped by it.The state government has also decided to provide up to 27% reservation to the OBC community in the urban local bodies (ULBs) such as municipal corporations, municipal councils and nagar panchayats. The state urban development department will promulgate another ordinance to this effect. With the ordinance, it will make amendments in three legislations — Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act and Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial Townships Act.The hearing on a petition filed by the state government for OBC reservation is also scheduled for September 23 (Thursday). The state government has filed a writ petition in the Apex Court seeking Socio-Economic Caste Census, 2011 data from the Centre for providing reservation to the OBC community.The state government has recently sent the ordinance to provide reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the rural local bodies elections to the governor seeking his approval. The ordinance can be promulgated only after the governor’s approval.“The OBC reservation in local bodies was scrapped following the SC verdict. As an interim provision, the state government has decided to provide up to 27% reservation to the OBC community and the total reservation quota (combined quota of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and OBC will also not violate the 50% quota set by the Supreme Court. The ordinance will be issued following the SC judgement thus there is no need to take its permission once again,” stated a release issued by the chief minister office (CMO).“We have decided to resend the ordinance back to the Governor (Bhagat Singh Koshyari) with a decision that the state will inform the Supreme Court once it is issued. The Governor is of the view that the SC should be informed before issuing the ordinance as it is an Apex court’s decision. I am confused about the stand taken by him as he would have directed us to inform SC soon after the ordinance is promulgated,” said Hasan Mushrif, rural development minister.“Instead of supporting the move taken by the state government, he (Bhagat Singh Koshyari) is creating fresh issues. As an alternative to the problem of OBC reservation, the state cabinet decided to bring an ordinance. It will help in providing reservation to the community in the local bodies’ elections except for four-five districts, which is far better than depriving the entire community of reservation benefits in the local bodies polls,” he commented.Last week, the state government decided to promulgate an ordinance to make amendments in the legislation to provide reservation to the OBC community in rural local bodies without breaching the 50% reservation cap mandated by the SC.The decision was taken after the state election commission declared bypolls in six district councils (zilla parishads) on October 5.An ordinance is a temporary law approved by the governor (on the advice of the state government) when the state legislature is not in session. An ordinance becomes a permanent Act (the law of the land) on being approved by state legislature within six weeks, if not then it is bound to lapse.On March 4, the SC ruled that the reservation in favour of the OBC in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% cap in reservation quota mandated by it. It has directed the state government to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which, the reservation quota of the community be fixed and also allowed the state election commission to hold local bodies polls without having reservations for OBCs.This could prove politically damaging for the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government and hence it was decided to take the ordinance route to save the OBC reservation.“If the governor did not sign the ordinance, then it will send a wrong signal in the OBC community. If the governor did not approve the ordinance, then the state government will be left with no other option but to wait for the empirical data to be collected, which will take some time,” the rural development minister said.According to the cabinet decision, the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities will continue to get the reservation quota based on their population but the OBC community will get the remaining percent within the 50% ceiling. With the ordinance, the state rural development department will make amendments in two legislations — Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for zilla parishads, panchayat samiti and gram panchayats.After the amendments, the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities will continue to get the reservation quota based on their population in the local bodies but the OBC community will get the remaining per cent within the 50% ceiling and that too not more than 27%.The state government believes that they will be able to secure around 90% seats of the OBC community with the ordinance.Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis defended the governor and claimed he returned the ordinance in the interest of the state and OBC community. “The law and judiciary department opined that the matter is pending before the SC and before its permission ordinance should not be promulgated. The opinion can be set aside by seeking the views of the advocate general (AG) else it can be stayed immediately in the court of law. But the state government decided to overlook the law and judiciary department’s opinion and sent the file to the governor for final approval. The governor pointed out the opinion of the law and judiciary department and sought clarification,” Fadnavis told reporters.Ulhas Bapat, a constitutional expert said that the provisions of the ordinance cannot be implemented in the bypolls declared by the state election commission and even the court cannot interfere during the election process. “In my view, the state election commission will not accept it as they have already announced bypolls. It has all the rights and the state government can’t interfere. Even the court cannot interfere in the election process once it is declared. After the bypolls, its validity can be challenged in the court of law,” Bapat said.“Due process such as empirical data, approval of the state backward classes commission etc. is expected to be followed before providing reservation to a community. In its absence, the ordinance can easily be challenged in the court of law and hence I don’t see its future,” Bapat opined when asked if the amendment can be implemented for the local bodies’ election due early next year.More than 15 municipal corporations (including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane), 29 of 36 district councils and over 90 municipal councils will go for polls over the next one year. The election bandwagon to these local bodies in such a huge number is considered as the ‘mini assembly polls’.Koshyari and the MVA government have been locked in a bitter tussle for quite some time. The governor is yet to clear the 12 names approved by the state cabinet in November last year to be appointed as the members of the legislative council. Every six years, 12 members are nominated to the Upper House of the state legislature by the governor on the recommendation of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/obc-quota-maharashtra-govt-may-resend-ordinance-to-governor-koshyari-for-approval-101632328538188.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||PMLA court grants bail to MIAL MD Sanjay Reddy, six others||The special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court on Wednesday granted bail to GV Sanjay Reddy, managing director (MD) of Mumbai International Airport Pvt Ltd (MIAL), and six others named by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case, on provisional cash security of ₹5 lakh each. ED had filed a detailed charge sheet in the matter in the last week of August naming seven accused and 14 companies.Special PMLA judge MG Deshpande, who had taken cognisance of the ED charge sheet, had issued process against all the accused and asked them to be present before it on September 22. The accused were represented by advocates Vijay Aggarwal and Rahul Aggarwal who sought bail for the accused and pointed out that ED has not arrested them in the case.The court then granted bail to Reddy along with Raghuram Kesaram, Sudhindra Kumar, Krishnam Raju, Jagan Mohan Rao, Anicattulssac George and Chandra Mouli Yarra — officials of MIAL and GVK Airports Developers Ltd.The court asked them to deposit their passports with the agency and asked to attend trial. It has also asked the accused to not tamper with evidence.Apart from the seven individuals, ED has named 14 companies including MIAL, GVK Airport Developers Ltd, GVK Developers Project Pvt Ltd, and GVK Energy Ltd.The Airports Authority of India (AAI), which managed the city airport, had entered into an agreement with MIAL in 2006, allowing them to operate, manage and develop Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA). Accordingly, MIAL was to share 38.7% earnings with AAI and keep the rest for modernisation and extension of the airport.ED had alleged that MIAL inflated expenditure by paying GVK employees’ salary from its revenues. IT allegedly also rented out premium retail areas in Mumbai airport to family members, relatives and employees of GVK at very low rates, thereby reducing revenues. In this way, ₹705 crore were fraudulently siphoned off from MIAL, resulting loss to AAI and corresponding wrongful gain to GVK Airports Holding Ltd.The agency has alleged MIAL had allegedly entered into bogus contract of ₹310 crore during 2017-2018 with nine firms/companies, but against the same, no work was executed.In addition, overdraft facility against surplus funds totalling ₹395 crore were remaining with MIAL after sharing revenue with AAl and deducting expenses kept as fixed deposit receipts (FDR) with public sector undertaking (PSU) banks, which it diverted to other group of companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pmla-court-grants-bail-to-mial-md-sanjay-reddy-six-others-101632328478234.html

HR College in Churchgate, NM College in Vile Parle had no seats left to offer in the third merit list. Similarly, St Xavier’s College had no seats left to offer in the arts stream for the special round. Surprisingly, RA Podar College in Matunga, which had no seats left to offer in the third merit list, witnessed a few withdrawals, making way for few more students to get through the institute in the special round.Other colleges witnessed a nearly 10-15% drop in cut-offs across streams.

22-09-2021||Mumbai||No material to suggest Pankaj, Sameer Bhujbal intended to cheat flat buyers, says Mumbai court||The sessions court, while discharging food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal’s son Pankaj and nephew Sameer, observed that from the material available on record it cannot be inferred that the accused wanted to cheat flat buyers. The hearing took place on September 8 but the order was made public on Wednesday.A case was registered against the Bhujbals and others in 2015 on a complaint of a Chembur resident who claimed that the company had planned to sell 2,344 flats and had collected ₹44 crores but had not developed the project. Navi Mumbai police booked the accused for cheating, breach of trust and under the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act (MOFA).Additional Sessions judge HS Satbhai allowed the discharge application of Pankaj, Sameer, Rajesh Dharap and Satyen Kesarkar — directors of Devisha Infrastructure Private Limited. Bhujbals and the other two applicants were represented by advocate Sajal Yadav and Sudarshan Khawase, who argued that Alibag magistrate court, after going through the documents, had said there is no prima facie evidence to infer that since the date when the accused’s company started receiving booking amount, there was an intention on the part of the accused to cheat the informants and witnesses. They also argued that to charge a person for cheating there has to be any intent, but in this case the directors had no fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise. The inability of fulfilling contractual obligations due to reasons beyond the control without culpable intent is not an offence.The lawyers argued there was no intent to cheat the flat buyers and added that the project slowed as the MMRDA had cut its road and later the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had attached the land. They further informed the court that money of more than 200 flat buyers was returned.After taking account of the materials made available on record and hearing the submissions, the court observed, “From the material of the charge sheet, prima facie it cannot be inferred that there was an intention of directors of Devisha Infrastructure Pvt Ltd to cheat the informant or any other flat purchasers the.” Judge Satbhai further observed that there is no material to satisfy the offence of criminal conspiracy, since there was no misrepresentation to flat buyers.“The provisions of criminal law cannot be invoked for breach of contract, when there has been a culpable intention absent on the part of the defaulting person. The lodging of FIR by the informant prima facie appears to be an attempt to resolve the civil dispute by giving it colour of criminal offence. No fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of accepting the booking amount from the customer is seen,” the court noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-material-to-suggest-pankaj-sameer-bhujbal-intended-to-cheat-flat-buyers-says-mumbai-court-101632328118088.html
22-09-2021||Lucknow||Akhada to take final call on Mahant Giri’s successor||PRAYAGRAJ A decision on who would head the Baghambari Gaddi Math is eagerly awaited even as a probe is on into the death of Akhada Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri. Though Giri, in his purported suicide note, named his disciple Balbeer Puri as his successor, many top seers raised doubts over the authenticity of the letter while maintaining that the Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani, to which Narendra Giri belonged and was its secretary, would take a final call in this regard 16 days after Giri’s death. Whoever heads the Baghamabri Gaddi Math automatically gains control over property of the math worth crores. “The math was earlier part of Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani and its funds were used in upkeep of the Bade Hanuman Temple near Sangam. Later, Narendra Giri fought a legal battle following which the math was separated from Niranjani Akhada and it evolved as a separate entity. He later became the Pithadhishvar of the math and Bada Hanuman temple,” informed a senior seer of the akhada. He said the math owns huge plots (around 30 acres) in Manda tehsil besides around 25 acres in Shankargarh in Prayagraj. “It is said that land at Shankargarh produces silica sand, which is used in manufacturing of glass,” he added. The math, located in Allahpur locality of the city, is spread over an area of around 10 acres. It also has Mahant Vicharanand Sanskrit Mahavidyalay, a gaushala, open field and a fleet of vehicles. It is said that a few years back, Giri had sold some 20 bigha land of Bhardwaj Puram and developed the math, said another saint of the monastic order. The math has a long history of controversies and some of the Pithadhishvars and office bearers had also died under mysterious circumstances earlier. These include Mahant Vicharanand, who had played a crucial role in protecting the land of Bade Hanuman temple and had purchased the land for Baghambari Gaddi through contributions and donations. He was found dead while travelling on a train to Haridwar in 1980.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhada-to-take-final-call-on-mahant-giri-s-successor-101632327818168.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC may re-tender 30 road projects in Mumbai that were flagged over concerns of quality||After doubts were raised over the quality of work in the wake of the contractors bidding up to 30% less than the estimated cost, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is likely to re-tender 30 road repair projects worth over ₹ 1,000 crore in the city. The re-tendering may lead to delay in starting road repair works. The final decision in this regard is expected in a day or two after consultation with municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal.On September 13, additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu had sought justification from the deputy municipal commissioner of infrastructure on how the quality will be maintained amid the contractors quoting around 30% less than the estimated cost. “I have received 30 tender files on the road works in city, eastern and western suburbs. It is surprising to see most of the tenders are quoted very much on the lower side. The department needs to explain how it intends to maintain the quality under control. When road supervision of 100% is not possible during execution at senior level, how will the quality of execution be ensured by the road department,” his letter read. Following this, the road department was asked to submit a reply to the additional municipal commissioner who, in consultation with Chahal, is likely to take a final call.A senior BMC official requesting anonymity said, “We had submitted the proposal after taking justification for quoting below the estimation and there is no question of going back to the contractors. We have now submitted our response and the final decision on whether to re-tender will be taken by the BMC chief.”The deadlock over whether to re-tender or go ahead with the same tenders is expected to delay the starting of road repair works, which usually start in October, by a month.Corporators have demanded that the road projects be re-tendered to ensure quality of the roads. Congress corporator and BMC’s leader of opposition Ravi Raja said, “Roads in the city are very important for citizens considering it also involves taxpayers’ money. If the contractors have quoted below the estimation and there is suspicion about the quality, there should be re-tendering. We need to understand that ultimately timely completion is only worth it if the quality of the road is good. We do not want a scenario where there will be potholes on the road within six months.’BMC maintains around 2,055km of roads in the city. All major and minor roads are to be improved by way of resurfacing or repairing them using asphalt or concrete cement from the existing paver blocks.BMC in the ongoing fiscal had curtailed its road improvement and repair targets by almost 45% compared to the last fiscal. According to estimates presented in budget 2021-22, BMC proposed to improve 157-km road network in the city and suburbs during 2021-22, which is less than the target of 289-km in 2020-21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-may-re-tender-30-road-projects-in-mumbai-that-were-flagged-over-concerns-of-quality-101632327698193.html
22-09-2021||Lucknow||BJP’s Uttar Pradesh poll team holds discussions with Yogi, others||The new election panel appointed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership for poll-bound Uttar Pradesh arrived in Lucknow and straightaway got down to business, holding meetings with top party leaders, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath at the party’s state unit office here on Wednesday evening. The Uttar Pradesh assembly election is due early next year.The election panel comprising Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur, along with other leaders, held the meetings in which top ministers and deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma were also present. “Now, we will also see regular visits by top leaders. Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be in USA, but the party has begun giving finishing touches to Modiji’s visits as well as that of Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda (to the state). Defence minister Rajnath Singh is an MP from Lucknow and hence an integral part of the party’s UP campaign. So, from chief ministers of BJP ruled states to others, we would see regular visits by top leaders now,” said a BJP leader. While Pradhan’s choice makes it obvious that the BJP would focus on non-Yadav OBCs, the BJP has only recently appointed Baby Rani Maurya, a Dalit woman leader from Agra, as the party’s national vice-president. Maurya was till recently the Uttarakhand governor until her surprise decision to quit her post, two years before the formal close of her five-year gubernatorial term, indicating that the party would use her in 2022 UP polls. “The BJP is all set for Mission UP. We are confident that our government’s various welfare activities, our top leadership’s appeal and concern for the common man and our party’s micro, booth level planning would lead us to win. The misinformation campaign against us by the Opposition parties would be exposed and we would win with an even better margin than before,” said a UP minister who was part of the meeting at the party office. While Pradhan, a prominent OBC face of the party who has been the party’s election in-charge of other states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh, is heading the election panel for UP, the seven co-in-charges include minister for information and broadcasting Anurag Thakur, minister of state for parliamentary affairs Arjun Meghwal, minister of state for agriculture and farmers’ welfare Shobha Karandlaje, minister of state for education Annpurna Devi, former national general secretary Saroj Pandey; MP Vivek Thakur and former Haryana minister Captain Abhimanyu. After this meeting, the election panel would travel to Gorakhpur on Thursday and return again to hold another round of meetings in the state capital before leaving for Delhi. “Before arriving in Lucknow, BJP’s UP in-charge Radha Mohan Singh and election in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan had held discussions in Delhi. So, in a sense, the election panel has arrived in UP after doing its homework,” party leaders said. “Let’s see. It should be clear in a day or two,” a party leader said when asked if the election panel’s deliberations and several rounds of meetings would also lead to the much-delayed announcement about four MLCs and some clarity on whether Adityanath government’s much speculated expansion of the ministry would happen. The BJP has also appointed six regional in-charges to shore up the organisational strength and help with the campaign. They are Lok Sabha MP Sanjay Bhatia (west UP), Bihar MLA Sanjeev Chaurasia (Braj), BJP national secretary Y Satya Kumar (Awadh), national co-treasurer (Kanpur-Bundelkhand), national secretary Arvind Menon (Gorakhpur) and Sunil Ojha (Kashi).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjps-up-poll-team-holds-discussions-with-yogi-others-101632327580838.html
22-09-2021||Ranchi||J’khand: After its discontinuation in 2014, CM relaunches dhoti-saree scheme||Jharkhand chief minister (CM) Hemant Soren on Wednesday relaunched an ambitious scheme to provide dhoti and saree, a part of traditional Indian clothing, to the poor for just ₹10. The scheme will benefit over 57 lakh families covered under the Food Security Act in the state. The scheme was first launched in 2014 when Soren was in power. However, it was soon discontinued when BJP’s Raghubar Das became the CM the same year.Under the scheme, each ration card-holding family would be given a set of dhoti/lungi and saree for ₹10 twice a year. The scheme will be implemented by the civil and food supplies department, that also overseas the implementation of Food Security Act. “In 2014, we had launched this scheme when I became the CM. However, the subsequent government discontinued it (scheme), which was basically aimed at helping the poor. Besides filling the belly of the poor (through the public distribution system), we are now also providing clothing to them. We have made a provision of ₹500 crore for the scheme,” said the CM, while launching the scheme from Dumka in the tribal-dominated Santhal Parganas, the traditional stronghold of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM). The political significance of the ambitious scheme was viable with the presence of political heavyweights of the state at the event. Those in attendance included JMM patriarch and Rajya Sabha member Shibu Soren, his younger son and Dumka legislator Basant Soren, finance minister Rameshwar Oraon, agriculture minister Badal Patralekh, besides other elected representatives.Similar events were held in other districts for distribution of the entitlement to beneficiaries.To begin with, 57.17 lakh ration card holders in the state would be benefitted under the scheme. Finance minister Oraon, who also holds the charge of the civil and supplies department, said more people would be brought under the scheme eventually. “We are adding 15 lakh more people, who were left out of the public distribution system in the state, and providing them green cards.

He has been instrumental behind setting up several reputed institutions in the state, which had none prior to 2005, and the rural development and management institute will be another extension to it to and will a quality opportunity for Bihar students,” he said.Though Bihar has Rural Institute of Higher Education, at Birauli in Samastipur, which was founded in 1955 on a sprawling 30-acre campus with the purpose of providing opportunities in rural development and management, it has ended up being yet another general college struggling with faculty shortage and erratic studies. It is affiliated with the Lalit Narayan Mithila University and has over 6,000 students, but only three teachers.The minister said he was highly disappointed about the present status of the college in his home district, as it had completely deviated from the objective it was set up with.“Chairing the governing board meeting of the college, I shared my concerns about the college, which was set up nearly 65 years ago with some clear objectives. However, it seems to have nothing in order despite having a big campus. The institute was meant for studies on rural development and management,” Choudhary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-mulls-rural-development-institute-on-lines-of-nirdpr-irma-101632327458153.html
22-09-2021||Patna||Bihar: Oppn cries foul as Dy CM’s kin, aides get contract of schemes worth ₹53 crore||The opposition parties on Wednesday cornered the Nitish Kumar-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government on the corruption issue, alleging that the kins and aides of deputy chief minister and BJP leader Tarkishore Prasad were offered contracts for tap water supply schemes worth ₹53 crores in violation of the set norms. Demanding a high-level inquiry into the role of the deputy CM, opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav alleged that those in the power were indulging in looting the government’s treasuries and thereby depriving the poor of their right in the government schemes. “There is corruption from top to the bottom,” alleged Yadav. Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra too lashed out at the state government for large-scale irregularities in the execution of the various schemes. “It is a matter of inquiry as to how the contract of a majority of schemes are given to the relatives or close aides of the ministers and ruling party legislators,” he said. Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) spokesman Asit Nath Tiwari alleged that Prasad used his influence to award a Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal scheme worth ₹1.60 crore to his daughter-in-law Puja Kumari, who is a registered contractor of the PHED. Prasad’s brothers-in-law Pradip Kumar Bhagat and Sajal Kiran Bhagat’s company Deep Kiran Infrastructure Private Limited managed to get the work of ₹3.60 crore from the PHED. Tiwari further alleged that the Jivanshree Infrastructure Private Limited, a firm of personal aides of the deputy CM Prashant Chandra Jaiswawal, Lalit Kishore Prasad and Santosh Kumar, was given the contract for the biggest tap water supply scheme in Katihar worth ₹48 crore. Katihar is the home constituency of the deputy CM Prasad. Yadav, who is also a former deputy CM, taunted Nitish Kumar, his former boss, over his alleged inability to act against the current deputy. “He (Nitish) will not dare speak or act against Tarkishor Prasad. He cannot run the risk of Srijan scam files being reopened,” remarked the RJD leader. Prasad could not be reached out for his comments despite repeated tries. Leaders close to him, however, rubbished the allegations of corruption and claimed that the firms of the deputy CM’s relatives got the contract based on their qualifications..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-oppn-cries-foul-as-dy-cm-s-kin-aides-get-contract-of-schemes-worth-53-crore-101632327218147.html
22-09-2021||Patna||Bihar cabinet meeting: No attendance bar for financial incentives this year in view of Covid||Students of government schools or studying in the aided and affiliated institutions of the state would get financial benefits of the education department’s schemes like scholarships, cycle, uniform and other schemes without complying with the mandatory 75% attendance, the state cabinet decided on Wednesday. The cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar has done away with the compulsory provision for 75% attendance for financial incentives in view of the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. All the schools, from primary to high schools, remained closed to curb spread of the pandemic. This was among the 21 proposals approved by the state cabinet. An official of the education department said this was one-time arrangement for the current fiscal and the mandatory provision for attendance would be restored once the normal school classes are resumed. Nearly 1.50 crore students, enrolled in the government’s primary, middle and high schools, government aided schools of the same grades and recognised schools, would qualify for the financial incentives given through the direct benefit transfer schemes. In another important decision to improve the quality of education, the cabinet approved the education department’s proposal to recruit at least one physical training instructor in all 8,386 primary schools. The teachers would get ₹8000 as monthly remuneration with ₹200 annual increment. Education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary said it was a major decision to get the students of primary schools exposure to physical training. “Those physical instructors, who had qualified for recruitment in 2019, would be accommodated against the vacancies forthwith,” said Chaudhary, while thanking the CM for approving the proposal in the light of the department’s assurance in the state legislature. An official said nearly 3,700 physical training instructors, who were declared qualified in 2019, would be absorbed in the job soon, while recruitment for the rest of instructors would be done in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cabinet-meeting-no-attendance-bar-for-financial-incentives-this-year-in-view-of-covid-101632326978280.html
22-09-2021||Patna||Lalu hints at EVM rigging, asks RJD workers to be alert||Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad on Wednesday said his party could have lost the 2020 Bihar assembly elections due to manipulation of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and asked party workers, especially polling agents, to be alert. “Our polling agents wake up at 8 am, after the polling starts, whereas polling personnel start putting the EVMs from 4 am. There is a mock poll done before the actual polling and EVM. If we are not alert, there is always a possibility that some EVMs could be ‘loaded’ with votes before polling. So, one should first check the EVMs and count if there are any votes already registered in the ballot machines. These are technical things but we all should understand this and be alert,” Prasad, who has been recuperating from his long illness in New Delhi, told his party’s block presidents at the concluding day of the two-day training programme for party workers through video conferencing. In the 2020 polls for the the 243-member Bihar Assembly, the RJD-led grand alliance had won 110 seats, just 12 less than the simple majority figure of 122.During his 20-minute speech, Prasad also spoke about economic contraction in the country after the Covid pandemic, galloping inflation, unemployment and reiterated his demand for caste census. Prasad favoured “breaking” the 50 per cent ceiling on reservations if the population of SCs, STs and OBCs was found to be more than half the total. “Quotas have been decided taking into account the Census conducted before Independence. We must have a fresh estimation of the population of different social segments,” the RJD chief said.He said his health had improved and that he would soon be coming to Patna. “I will be visiting all districts and meet you all soon,” he said. The former Bihar chief minister was full of praise for his younger son and leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav for having organised the training programme. “Tejashwi has become an acceptable leader in Bihar and everybody says he will go far. Such training sessions should be held more regularly as it gives opportunity to young leaders to hone their skills,” he said. The RJD chief said his party workers must learn from the disciplined and committed cadre based organizational structure in left parties. He also suggested that party workers should wear a gamcha and green topi (small cap) for their identity as an RJD worker, as is prevalent in parties like Samajwadi Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lalu-hints-at-evm-rigging-asks-rjd-workers-to-be-alert-101632326858193.html

The incident came to light on Tuesday when professor BN Singh, travelling in Sampark Kranti Express, was asked by a travel ticket examiner (TTE) to vacate his seat as his ticket was cancelled on Tuesday. An embarrassed professor had to get down at Muzaffarpur railway station, after which he reported the incident to LNMU authorities.An LNMU staff member made enquiries and managed some leads, after which the Government Railway Police (GRP) searched the CCTV footage that showed computer operator Krishna Kanhaiya Choudhary at the ticket booking counter on Tuesday evening. Further investigations revealed that earlier on the same day, the professor, who was invited by the LNMU to conduct viva of a PhD researcher, had submitted his ticket to the university for reimbursement. Kanhaiya allegedly stole the ticket and handed him a copy instead, a source said. Kanhaiya, who gave a written confession to the university that he received ₹1100 as refund, later denied his involvement on camera saying he had gone to the railway station’s booking counter to enquire about a rail ticket.LNMU spokesperson Chandrabhanu Singh, in a press release on Wednesday, said Kanhaiya has been removed from his job as his misdeed has put university administration to shame.Vijay Kumar Yadav, head of the post graduate department of economics at the LNMU, meanwhile, submitted a written complaint against the accused at the LNMU police station. “He stole a confirmed rail ticket of external examiner Professor B N Singh, who was here to conduct viva of a PhD researcher,” the complaint states.Police said they are probing the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/redfaced-lnmu-sacks-staffer-who-stole-rail-ticket-of-guest-professor-for-refund-101632326798102.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees 360 cases of dengue, up from 129 last year||The city has recorded 360 cases of dengue this year, a rise from 129 cases recorded last year. The death toll of the mosquito-borne stands at three. Doctors across the city are also seeing an acute surge in cases, with many patients requiring hospitalisation.Doctors said patients are reaching hospitals with extremely low platelet counts and require anywhere between five to 15 days of hospitalisation. “There definitely seems to be more awareness and patients are coming in early,” said Dr Nitin Karnik, head of medicine at the civic-run LTMG Hospital in Sion. In his practice alone, Karnik estimated about 10 to 15 dengue-related hospitalisations every day. “Most patients have extremely low platelet count, however, not many have required platelet transfusion,” he said. LTMG hospital’s paediatric department has also recorded a spike in dengue-related hospitalisations. Compared to 47 hospitalisations in 2020, the department has recorded 102 admissions this year as of September 22. “We have had children coming in with dengue shock syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction, but we have managed to pull them out of the complications,” said Dr Radha Gulati Ghildiyal, head of paediatrics at LTMG Hospital. Dengue is spread by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito that breeds in clean water and is known to be a day-biter. Often known as breakbone fever, dengue leads to fever, sometimes in two phases, joint pain, severe body ache, rashes, persistent vomiting, nasal bleeding, among other symptoms. There is no direct treatment for dengue and most interventions are for symptom relief. “It’s hard to pinpoint what is causing the surge,” said physician Dr Hemant Gupta, who practices in south Mumbai. During his daily consultations, Gupta has been seeing six to seven confirmed cases of dengue every day and about two to three require hospitalisation. “I have seen more dengue cases and hardly any Covid-19 cases this month,” he said. The dengue spreading mosquito is known as a ‘shy mosquito’ which flies away easily, and therefore may bite 20 to 25 people for feeding. Dengue cases are therefore often seen in clusters. “With many people working from home and schools yet to open, the spread of dengue becomes easier if there is an infected mosquito,” said Gupta, adding the dengue-spreading mosquito mostly breeds indoors and people should thus take precautions to avoid breeding in their homes. Some of the measures could be to removing stagnated water from windows, flower pots, changing water from decorative plants and covering water containers. A civic official said that most cases in September have been recorded from E (Byculla), G South (Lower Parel) and G North (Dadar) wards. The pest control department has inspected over 400,000 houses and destroyed more than 4,100 dengue breeding spots this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-360-cases-of-dengue-up-from-129-last-year-101632325718004.html

22-09-2021||Mumbai||India’s indigenous air quality forecasting model gets international peer-review||The first official, indigenous framework to forecast air quality in four Indian metro cities, namely Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Delhi by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), was published in the international peer-reviewed Elsevier Journal of Environmental Modelling and Software on Tuesday, September 22. Experts say this could give a significant boost for installing this framework other non-attainment cities under the Centre’s National Clean Air Program (NCAP), which itself mandates that cities have a pre-emptive air quality forecasting mechanism.Dr Gufran Beig, founding project director at SAFAR, described this framework as a single-window solution for forecasting bad air days, to inform mitigation measures and develop “micro-specific air action plans”. “SAFAR’s forecasting model is comparable to the framework by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA),” he said.SAFAR’s methods were presented as part of a study titled ‘India’s maiden air quality forecasting framework for megacities of divergent environments: The SAFAR-project’ and was led by researchers at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune, in collaboration with the India Meteorological Department and Bhubaneshwar’s Utkal University.The forecasting model consists of six different verticals, which include the Observational Network for Air Pollution and Weather Parameters, Quality Control and Quality Assurance, Inventory of Emissions (to monitor the source of emissions), SAFAR’s own Air Quality and Weather Forecasting Model, followed by “data-to-information translation” in the form of the air quality index (AQI) component which can be used by researchers, policymakers and citizens. Finally, there is a sixth component under the banner of ‘Technology and Outreach for Product Development and Dissemination’.“SAFAR uses round-the-clock air quality and weather parameter measurements, scientific analysis to improve forecasting capabilities with basic research, which can be disseminated to as many stakeholders as possible, including government agencies, educational institutes, and the general public, to ensure maximum,” said Dr Beig, adding that this model may well be scaled up to all other 128 non-attainment cities listed under the NCAP, which do not meet Centrally prescribed standards of air pollution.India currently has 132 non-attainment cities under its NCAP program, which aims to reduce particulate matter (PM) pollution by 20 to 30% by 2024 (the base year 2017).Using this forecasting model, Urban Local Bodies (ULB) will also be able to issue timely health advisories publicly, to alert citizens on days when the regional AQI touches hazardous level, thereby helping vulnerable groups to minimize exposure to air pollution and attendant severe health impacts. The recent Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) 2019, published by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), had estimated that around 40% of Indians’ life expectancy will reduce by as much as nine years due to exposure to PM, which are fine respirable particles that remain suspended in ambient air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indias-indigenous-air-quality-forecasting-model-gets-international-peerreview-101632323138086.html

One of the accused works as an automobile agent for the Canteen Stores Department (CSD) under the Ministry of Defence. The man allegedly took help from the other accused to pose as customers wearing masks, face shields and created false identities for taking delivery of the cars. The deliveries were taken between July 1 and September 15 from the showroom. The five cars collectively cost ₹52,96,854, according to the complaint. “When the showroom officials went to the Army canteen to submit the purchase order, the canteen officials said none of their members placed these orders. Later, it was found that the man had made fake identities through forged documents and taken deliveries. The showroom has four purchase orders and the purchase order for one car is missing. It is possible that they have taken money from genuine customers and duped them too. The showroom officials ignored physical verification protocol by blindly trusting him,” said sub-inspector SA Jadhav of Vimantal police station who is investigating the case. The police are on a lookout for these men. A case was registered under Sections 420 (cheating), 467, 468, 471 (forgery), 408, and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Vimantal police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/defence-canteen-automobile-agent-booked-for-duping-car-showroom-of-rs-53-lakh-in-pune-101632318517662.html

22-09-2021||Pune||300 bodies found on Pune railway tracks in past three years remain unidentified||Pune: The railway police have recorded around 300 unidentified bodies found on the tracks in the past three years. In 2021, 132 cases of accidental deaths have been reported and of that 30 bodies are yet to be identified. The figure of unidentified bodies in 2020 was 79 in the 250 accidental death cases and it was 191 unidentified bodies of 206 accidental cases in 2019. “It is a major challenge to identify mangled bodies. Most of the cases are related to suicides. Sometimes the victims’ personal belongings that could help in identification are stolen by the time the police are alerted. Hence, it becomes difficult to term the death as suicide or accident or murder in case of such cases,” said railway police station incharge Maula Shaikh. During the investigation, the police gather clues like birthmark, scar, tattoo, tailor mark on the clothing of the body. According to the railway police, the number of accidental deaths has dropped due to the Covid lockdown period wherein there was no rail travel. Amongst the reasons for accidental deaths include crossing the tracks, losing balance, and falling on tracks after losing balance from a running train. The police are also following the court directives of taking immediate efforts for the collection of viscera samples from unidentified bodies for DNA test as and when required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/300-bodies-found-on-pune-railway-tracks-in-past-three-years-remain-unidentified-101632315697555.html

Begum had approached the HC challenging the 2018 decision of the state to remove the then SPP Dhiraj Mirajkar who represented the state in the lower court without assigning a reason. The division bench of justice Prasanna Varale and justice Nitin Borkar, while hearing the petition by the mother of Khwaja Yunus, a suspect in the 2002 Ghatkopar blast, who died in police custody in 2003, was informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai that the petition challenged the government’s decision to remove SPP Dhiraj Mirajkar from the trial. Desai also informed the bench that the petition also sought action against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, as he had defied an earlier HC order to conduct an inquiry against the officers who were accused in the custodial death of Yunus by reinstating them without conducting the inquiry. The four suspended policemen accused of the custodial death of Yunus included Sachin Vaze as well. While referring to the hearing of the trial in the sessions court, Desai submitted that after the sessions court rapped the state and crime investigation department (CID) for the slow progress in the trial, the government lawyer had informed the sessions court that a proposal to appoint a new prosecutor has been approved by the additional chief secretary (Home) and was now placed before the law and judiciary department.Desai referred to and submitted that during a hearing of Begum’s petition challenging the removal of Mirajkar in HC in July 2018, advocate general (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni had made an oral statement that the state would not appoint a new SPP till the petition was heard. However, the state was in the process of appointing a new SPP thus going back on its statement. Mirajkar was appointed on September 2, 2015, and then removed in 2018. Additional public prosecutor (APP) Sangeeta Shinde informed the bench that the AG wanted to address the court and hence sought an adjournment. After hearing the request, the bench asked, “Can you tell us that till we hear AG Kumbhakoni, you will not make any hurry in appointing SPP? This is what the court wants so that we will not permit a sudden change.” On instructions from the AG and the law and judiciary department, APP Shinde stated that no new SPP would be appointed till the next hearing, which was accepted by the HC. The next hearing will be held on October 14. Khwaja Yunus, a 27-year-old software engineer, was arrested in December 2002 for his alleged role in the Ghatkopar bomb blast case and was last seen alive by his fellow accused on January 6, 2003. Though the police claimed that Yunus had died after he tried to escape while being ferried by a team led by Vaze, one of the accused had stated that Yunus was brutally assaulted in custody. Thereafter, the CID had booked the four policemen including Vaze for Yunus custodial death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wont-appoint-new-spp-in-khwaja-yunus-case-till-oct-14-maharashtra-govt-tells-bombay-hc-101632315457494.html
22-09-2021||Chandigarh||Friends for lifetime: Ming, Singh and dumb charades||Have you ever met with a stranger and connected with him/her instantly? Human bonding is a continuous process that starts right from childhood when we connect with playmates in the neighbourhood, moving on to schoolmates, college friends, co-workers, friends’ friends; and the chain keeps on growing. There is always a thread of mutual connectivity that runs through all these relationships. But the most beautiful bond is the one we can form with a stranger instantly. At times you come across a person while travelling, or waiting in the airport lounge, looking for a book in a book shop, trying to pick up the same book at the same time, or meeting during a buffet breakfast in a hotel; and after a little conversation, you hit it off and become friends for life. A very special one has been that of my husband’s connection with a Taiwanese young man, Ming Tsai, whom he met while travelling to New Delhi on the Shatabdi Express a few years ago. Sitting in the middle seat, he found this young man across the table who, with a broad smile on his face and curious flitting eyes, was trying to observe and absorb the glimpses of Indian life around. A casual conversation that started with “I am Ming” and “I am Singh” moved on to Indian food, religion, and whatnot, concluding with an exchange of emails on paper napkins. About four years later, Ming announced that he was visiting India with some of his relatives and would like to visit Patiala. Anxiety and nervousness kept me on my toes for days together, as I made arrangements for a comfortable stay for these unknown guests without knowing much about their culture as well as their personal choices. On top of that we found on their arrival that of our guests, comprising Ming, his maternal aunt, her son, and daughter, only our friend could speak and understand English. For the next two days, all I did was wear a broad smile on my face and bow to them every five minutes as they did. When the two ladies came to the kitchen to help me, I was completely at a loss for words and did not know how to explain things to them. Then started a full-fledged show of dumb charades, with all three of us trying to communicate through gestures amid guffaws. We could understand each other only partially, though at times Ming, with whom we had long discussions about our diverse cultures, played the interpreter. Ming and his relatives enjoyed vegetarian Indian food, as well as a visit to the tourist landmarks around. While leaving, they bowed repeatedly, expressing their gratitude, and I am sure they carried a pleasant impression about Indians and Indian hospitality. Even today, I get so overwhelmed reminiscing those two days when a piece of sunshine from a distant land descended on my heart! njkaur1953@gmail.com The writer is a Patiala-based retired associate professor in English||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/friends-for-lifetime-ming-singh-and-dumb-charades-101632315397346.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court temporarily restrains new Sai Baba Sansthan committee from functioning||Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday restrained the state-appointed committee for management of the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan, Shirdi, from taking any policy decisions, sanctioning expenditures, making appointments or inducting new members till the HC heard the civil application filed in public interest litigation (PIL), which challenged the appointment of the committee. The division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Sanjay Mehere, while hearing the civil application filed by Uttamrao Shelke in the PIL through advocate Pradnya Talekar, was informed that the state government had appointed a new committee which is chaired by the Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) member of legislative assembly (MLA) Ashutosh Kale and the committee had taken charge on September 17. Talekar further informed the bench that the new committee had scheduled a meeting on September 26, the agenda of which pertained to huge financial transactions. She also submitted that as the HC had appointed a managing committee in 2019, based on an order of 2012, to oversee the day-to-day working and financial affairs of the Sansthan, the state government could not have appointed a new committee without prior permission or approval of the HC. The committee comprised of a principal district judge, collector of Ahmednagar, CEO of the Sansthan, and a delegate not below the rank of the assistant charity commissioner, Nashik. The civil application challenged the constitution of the committee on the ground that it violated the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust Act by inducting political personalities without following any transparent procedure. The application also stated that the appointment of members from socially and economically backward classes, as well as specialised backgrounds like public health and business management, were also flouted to allow politically motivated appointments. Additional government pleader SG Karlekar for the state and advocate AS Bajaj for the trust sought time to file replies to the civil application. After hearing the application the bench observed, “We have no doubts that the state government is empowered to appoint the managing committee for Shri Sai Baba Sansthan, Shirdi. However, the peculiar circumstances in which we had passed an order on October 9, 2019, we had thus empowered the Committee to administer the Sansthan and the committee was performing its functions under the orders of this court passed in the PIL from time to time.” The bench also noted in its order, “...Prima facie, no other managing committee could have dislodged the committee that we had constituted, on the plea of the government has declared the formation of the new committee. In short, the new committee could not have taken charge without obtaining orders from this court as we would then be required to discharge the committee that we had constituted.” The court while posting hearing of the application to September 23 said, “Until then, the new committee, which is alleged to have taken charge by dislodging the committee that we had constituted, shall refrain from taking any policy decision, sanction expenditure and shall also refrain from making any appointments or inducting any new members, if any, until further orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-temporarily-restrains-new-sai-baba-sansthan-committee-from-functioning-101632312697107.html
22-09-2021||Chandigarh||To counter mining mafia, Punjab to cap sand price at ₹9/cubic ft||Swinging into action to check the soaring prices of sand, the Punjab government will cap sand and gravel prices at ₹9 per cubic feet, including loading charges at mining sites. This will be done by implementing a provision of the existing mining policy passed by the Captain Amarinder Singh cabinet in 2018 but never implemented. The decision will help the government check the mining mafia. A proposal in this regard has been finalised and will be announced after the next cabinet meeting, an official source said, requesting anonymity. This is one of 18 points on the agenda set by the Congress high command. Also read: ‘What is the problem if a poor man takes a jet ride?’: Channi after backlash“It’s not a new proposal. The mining policy of 2018 has a provision to cap the mining of sand and gravel at ₹9 per cubic feet. However, it was not implemented since the mining auction of 2019. Everyone knows who’s the culprit as the mining mafia was operating like in the previous regime. Except the increase in the government revenue from ₹30 crore to ₹270 crore, nothing changed. There was no relief for consumers,” said the official, who made the proposal. What the 2018 mining policy says The mining policy approved in 2018 by the cabinet states that both sand and gravel shall not be sold by the concessionaire at the mining site at more than ₹9 per cubic feet and this includes the cost of loading the vehicle. The maximum rates linked to the distance that can be charged per cubic feet for transportation of sand and gravel will be notified. The maximum rate of sand and gravel chargeable from the customer will not exceed the sum of the above stated two rates. The concessionaire will despatch sand and gravel through only those transporters who agree to transport it at the notified or less rates. Any violation will result in the cancellation of the agreement and forfeiture of the security amount, the policy says. Price capping provision However, government officials in league with mining contractors never implemented these provisions. After assuming charge, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and his deputy Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa asked for a survey of the prices of sand; and how to provide the sand at cheaper rates. “When the policy was studied, we found the price capping provision. The survey found the prices of sand is anywhere between ₹25 to ₹35 per cubic feet for consumers, which defeats the purpose of the policy. If prices are capped, there will be no mafia, as it mints money by increasing prices,” said an official dealing with issue. He said that to provide relief to consumers, Channi, during the first cabinet meet, decided to allow landowners to do mining in their respective areas. “A draft has been prepared and it will be sent to the chief minister to put it before the cabinet. It has decided to strictly cap the prices according to the policy to provide relief to the common man,” said the official. Principal secretary, mining, Sarvajit Singh didn’t respond to phone calls to answer why the price capping was not implemented since 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/to-counter-mining-mafia-punjab-to-cap-sand-price-at-9-cubic-ft-101632311976955.html
22-09-2021||Patna||Arsenic from irrigation water entering food chain in Bihar: Study||Arsenic from irrigation water is entering the food chain in the arsenic-affected villages of Bihar. This has resulted in food with higher arsenic content than drinking water, a study by British Council and Union science ministry has found. It is the first time a study has found arsenic in locally grown food items – rice, wheat and potato – even though the presence of the chemical in groundwater was known for years. As many as 22 of the 38 districts in the state have an arsenic level above the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s permissible limit of 10 micrograms/ litre.Bihar is the second most affected Indian state with arsenic contamination after West Bengal. Arsenic is naturally present in groundwater. In all, nine states in India are affected by arsenic groundwater contamination.“The findings are alarming,” said Ashok Kumar Ghosh, chairman of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) and a member of a 12-member team that conducted the study.Also Read | Two more beaches in India awarded prestigious ‘Blue Flag’ tag, details hereHe said for the first time, they have evidence that there is arsenic in food and its quantity was higher than that found in drinking water. Such is the vicious circle that water used to cook food adds to arsenic content resulting in cooked rice having higher arsenic than in raw paddy.“We all have been focusing on the presence of arsenic in groundwater. Irrigation water was hitherto untouched. But our study has confirmed the presence of arsenic in the food chain in Bihar through irrigation water,” he said.The reason for arsenic in food is that irrigation is dependent on shallow tube wells hardly 30-70 feet deep. Arsenic is present more in shallow water. Arsenic in water used by Shivshankar Prasad, a farmer of Bichoo Ka Dera village of Buxar district, is 336.2 micrograms/litre. In the case of fellow villager Kamlesh Yadav, it is 574.6 micrograms/ litre. The reason for this difference is that Yadav’s handpump is shallower than Prasad’s. And that is the reason Ghosh said that the only solution to the problem is deeper tube wells.Quoting the study, he said, rice, wheat and potato have elevated levels of arsenic that can increase the disease burden of the exposed persons.The study was conducted in 19 villages of arsenic affected districts. Ghosh said the study was exhaustive and is based on the detailed dietary assessment and estimation of arsenic in drinking water, cooked rice, wheat flour and potato collected from 91 households covering 19 villages. If the study is implied to all arsenic impact areas, around 10% of the state’s population may be consuming arsenic-contaminated food.The study was funded by British Council and was recently published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.Ghosh said that the study found that the presence of arsenic in the food chain was more pronounced in districts situated on the southern bank of Ganga such as Buxar, Bhojpur, Patna and Bhagalpur than those situated on the northern bank such as Vaishali, Naugachia, etc.According to the study, the effects of high arsenic content is an increase in lifetime cancer risk, skin diseases like Keratosis, Melanosis and Bowen’s disease, etc.“We focused on rice, wheat and potato because cereals, followed by vegetables and milk, form a staple diet of the rural Bihar. This is the first study where a detailed dietary assessment was conducted on arsenic exposed populations of Bihar to estimate the arsenic exposure from the three major staple foods,” he said.The study also found that at least 77% of the surveyed households had an arsenic concentration in drinking water below the WHO guideline value of 10 micrograms/ litre. At least 37% of households reported some form of improved water for drinking, indicating that a significant proportion of drinking water in the studied population may have had arsenic levels lower than 10 micrograms/ litre, the study said.In the homes, where arsenic in drinking water was within the WHO limit, the study found that the overall arsenic exposure was 36%, showing that the source of the chemical was water used for irrigation. The study concluded that arsenic in food was higher than in drinking water.Ghosh said that although there is no fixed WHO guideline on the normal value of arsenic in food, the food had more arsenic content than drinking water. He said this was even when arsenic levels in drinking water were above the WHO provisional guide value of 10 micrograms/ litre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/arsenic-from-irrigation-water-entering-food-chain-in-bihar-study-101632311857153.html

We are conducting a feasibility test for the same,” Bansal was quoted as saying by ANI.He also noted that the Western Railway is in talks with the Indian Coach Factory (IFC) for the technical elements associated with connecting AC and non-AC coaches, besides others.Mumbai local trains – which is the lifeline of the financial capital of India — was reopened for the public amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic on August 15, given that commuters are fully-vaccinated. While announcing, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray clarified that there must mandatorily be a gap of 14 days between the date of availing of the local train services and the administration of the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine.Following the resumption of the services, passenger footfall witnessed an increase with nearly 1.3 million passengers travelling on the Western Railway in September as opposed to 1.1 million in August. The same rise was noticed on Central Railway as well with nearly 2.2 million people commuters this month as against 1.5 million in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-locals-to-have-more-ac-coaches-after-survey-shows-commuters-prefer-them-101632307591173.html

Additional director general (law and order) Prashant Kumar said Maulana Kaleem Siddique was allegedly linked to an “illegal religious conversion network” spread across the country. “He has claimed to have converted thousands of people to Islam. We have found he ran a foundation that took foreign funding. The funding was used to support illegal conversion activities.”Police said they came to know about Siddique’s alleged role in the conversions during the investigation that followed the arrest of Umar Gautam and Jahangir Alam, both residents of New Delhi’s Jamia Nagar, in June for their alleged involvement in “illegal conversions”. “Siddique was in contact with Gautam who was involved in religious conversions. Siddique ran Jamia Imam Waliullah Trust which collected donations from the country and abroad to fund their illegal conversion racket which was the largest such racket in the country,” said Kumar. He added there was an unaccounted transaction of ₹3 crore involving the trust. “The money was used to fund conversion activities... 1.5 crore of this money was sent from Bahrain in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act.”Also Read | Couple found dead in Meerut home; police suspect relativeKumar said Siddique also secured a funding of ₹57 crore from UK-based organisation Al Falah and that the accused were unable to share details about the expenditure of this fund.Kumar said Siddique, 53, who is from Muzaffarnagar, appears to have been attracted towards fundamentalist Islam during his college days. “...he started practising hard-line Islam and began converting non-Muslims to Islam.”The ATS has over the last two months arrested 10 people in connection with alleged “illegal conversion” and has booked them under Indian Penal Code’s Sections 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion) 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship). They have been also slapped with charges under Uttar Pradesh’s Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act.ATS officials have claimed that the arrested accused were involved in the conversion of over 1,000 people including specially-abled children. They have refused to provide details about those converted. “Considering the safety of people who have been converted to Islam by the accused and to maintain the sanctity of the ongoing investigation, we are not divulging the details of those converted,” said ATS chief GK Goswami.The ATS has formed six teams to investigate the conversions. “We have managed to collect strong evidence against the accused in the conversion racket. This is proved by the fact that none of the 10 arrested accused have been able to secure bail,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ats-arrests-cleric-from-meerut-over-conversions-to-islam-101632307656451.html

I would like to tell the people of Bhabanipur that they've received a big opportunity, they should come forward and make history,” Tibrewal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.On Tuesday, the BJP leader entered into a squabble with police as she was denied door-to-door campaigning by security forces. “The police stopped me from interacting with voters. I will move the Election Commission soon against this conduct of the police,” Tibrewal said and also requested the election panel to not keep the officer-in-charge of the Bhabanipur police station on the day of the by-election.The police, meanwhile, said on Tuesday that Tibrewal was not told to be accompanied by a large number of people due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, but “she kept on arguing with the personnel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/clear-support-for-bjp-s-priyanka-tibrewal-in-bhabanipur-union-minister-puri-101632302542082.html
22-09-2021||Patna||Madhubani to return rapid antigen kits that gave false Covid positive results||Authorities in Bihar’s Madhubani district have decided to junk the entire batch of the rapid antigen detection (RAD) kits that falsely detected 25 swab samples of train passengers as positive, triggering concern about a possible wave of fresh infections.A total of 76 passengers on long-distance trains arriving at Madhubani railway station were found to be Covid-19 positive in tests conducted by RAD kits in the last few days. Suspicious of the high number of positive results, authorities sent fresh samples of 148 passengers including the 25 who had tested positive for retesting using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests late Tuesday evening. To everyone’s relief, all the samples have tested negative.“The result of all the 148 samples sent for (RT-PCR) test yesterday (Tuesday) has come. I spoke to the Madhubani district magistrate, and he said that all reports are negative. After cross-checking, there is no positive case there,” Mangal Pandey, Bihar’s health minister said in Patna on Wednesday. The district health authorities have decided to probe possible lapses, leading to the erroneous result and return the entire batch of allegedly faulty RAD kits to the Bihar Medical Services Infrastructure Corporation Limited, which had purchased them through empanelled private vendors. “I am recommending a probe, not to penalise anyone but to correct lapses, if any, in our system of testing and reporting Covid-19 cases at the district level. The probe committee will include two senior doctors, two laboratory technicians and an officer from the administrative side,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Jha, Madhubani’s civil surgeon. Efforts to reach Madhubani district magistrate Amit Kumar proved futile as he did not respond to calls or text messages. “The medical officers ought to be more responsible in reporting such cases, especially when the prevalence of the disease has come down. They need to be careful of false positive cases before reporting them. Similarly, laboratory technicians, who collect swab samples, should also keep two separate batches of rapid antigen detection kits to check for inconsistency in results,” said another official, who did not wish to be named. As many as 76 samples collected from among 148 train passengers from Delhi and Mumbai were found positive in testing by RAD kits at the Madhubani railway station between September 17 and 20.Dr Jha said that about 22 passengers, who had tested positive in the rapid antigen test, are still untraceable as they had given incorrect addresses and mobile numbers. Their samples can be retested only after they are located. Fresh samples of the remaining 29 people who had returned positive results in RAD testing will be sent for confirmatory RT-PCR tests today, he said.The prevalence of coronavirus has dropped significantly with Bihar reporting 59 active cases on Tuesday evening. Madhubani and Patna, at 15 each, have the highest number of active cases. Bihar has reported 725,907 Covid cases and 9,659 related deaths so far ever since the first case was reported in the state on March 21, 2020. With 716,188 people having recovered, the state has a recovery rate of 98.65%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/madhubani-to-return-rapid-antigen-kits-that-gave-false-covid-positive-results-101632305556262.html

22-09-2021||Bhopal||Sharp rise in leopard deaths in MP, many being poached for occult practices||56 leopards have been found dead in Madhya Pradesh in the first eight months of this year, already past the average number of big cats killed in the past five years. Of these, carcasses of at least 26 leopards were found without whiskers, teeth and nails, a clear sign of poaching for use in occult practices, a forest department official claimed. Activists in the state also said that the growing number of leopard deaths was a consequence of lack of conservation efforts for other wildlife with the system focussed solely on tiger conservation. Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of leopards in the country and a report called “Status of Leopards in India” 2018, putting the number at 3,421, close to double of its nearest rival Karnataka, which has 1,783. Official data shows that in the past five years until 2021, 255 leopards were found dead in Madhya Pradesh, an average of 51 deaths a year. Of these, 53 were killed in accidents, 29 in territorial fights, and 75 due to natural causes. However, in 2021, until August 31, 56 leopards have already been found killed. Of the 56 leopards found dead this year, 26, or 46% have been found without body parts indicative of poaching or use in “occult practices”. Over the past five years, the corresponding number was 98 from a total 255 deaths, just over 38%. Senior officials said the Special Task Force of the forest department has arrested more than 45 people in the past eight months, accused of killing leopards by electrocution. The past five years saw 110 arrests for the same offence. Investigations have revealed that villagers and poachers along the forested tracks have been involved in selling leopard body parts as those of young tigers’, a senior officer of the STF said. The deaths are largely caused by the use of electrified live wire. “These occultists then sell the body parts to people that believe in these customs for anywhere between ten thousand rupees to two lakh rupees, depending on the rituals being conducted,” the officer said.However, wildlife activists have accused the forest department of focusing solely on the conservation of tigers, and therefore putting other animals at risk. Ashu Agrawal, an environmental activist, said, “Leopards are being killed in large numbers in MP but the forest department is not paying any attention as their focus is on tiger conservation only. That’s why they are not organising any special programmes for saving leopards.” Another wildlife activist Ajay Dubey said he had written many times appraising the forest department of the situation. “I even met forest officials and the department said leopard deaths were not a matter of concern because MP has almost 40% of the total population of leopards in India. But they should understand that such a high percentage was being killed for occult practices and in accidents. If this continues, commercial poachers will head towards Madhya Pradesh soon,” said Ajay Dubey, wildlife activist. A Jabalpur-based activist Manish Sharma has also filed a petition in Jabalpur bench of the state high court on rampant poaching of leopards, after which the court on July 26, asked the petitioner to provide additional details and supporting evidence. However, forest officials said they were indeed monitoring the deaths of leopards. “Most of the deaths are happening due to electrocution. Many times, villagers lay traps for wild boar and spotted deer but leopards and tigers get trapped in the wire. After the death, they took their claws, whiskers, teeth and nails. We are arresting them and also creating awareness among villagers,” said Alok Kumar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife). The PCCF also dismissed claims that there was laxity in the conservation of leopards, compared to the tigers. “We are not holding any separate campaigns for conservation of leopards because the population is not under threat. They are in large numbers in MP but as a department we are taking care of every animal in the forest and that is why poachers have been arrested by STF for killing leopards,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/sharp-rise-in-leopard-deaths-in-mp-many-being-poached-for-occult-practices-101632301895911.html

22-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: ‘Chef’ snatched gold chains to pay off debts, arrested||New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Wednesday said they have arrested a 35-year-old man, who used to cook in a kitchen maintained by a five-star hotel that supplied flight meals, for allegedly snatching gold chains of morning walkers in south Delhi, a police officer said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the accused, Harish Chauhan, worked in the kitchen that is maintained by the Oberoi and is located near the Aerocity. He told the police that he cooked meals in the Oberoi flight services kitchen, near Indira Gandhi International Airport, the DCP said. “After graduating from Delhi University in 2006, Harish did a three-year hotel management course and started working as a ‘chef’ at the kitchen two years ago. He started gambling through online apps and lost money leading to a huge debt,” Thakur said.Based on a tip off, Chauhan was arrested from Neb Sarai area on Tuesday evening where he had allegedly gone for snatching gold chains, he said.A police officer said the jeweller, who would allegedly buy the stolen items from the chef has also been arrested. Police identified the jeweller as Rajender Aggarwal, 60.An official from the Oberoi Hotel clarified on Wednesday that Chauhan was not a hotel employee. He said that Chauhan was not even a chef, as he was claimed to be in some news reports. Chauhan worked at the Flight Catering Unit, the official said. “As mentioned by the police, Harish Chauhan does not work for the Oberoi Hotels, but at the flight catering unit. We have a kitchen near Aerocity, where Chauhan worked as a cleaner, and did cleaning and mopping. We have been in touch with the police on why they have made such claims, and legal action will be taken in this regard,” the Oberoi official said. DCP Thakur said it was not the police, but Chauhan, who claimed that he was a chef. Police said most of the alleged snatchings were reported from near Saket Metro station, an adjoining park, and a bus stand. “He mostly targeted women on morning or evening walks or those heading office during the morning and evening hours.”Also Read | Man involved in over 100 cases of robbery in Delhi held after evading arrest for 10 yearsTo repay his debts incurred during gambling, Chauhan chose soft targets to snatch valuables. “He runs like an athlete, and is an extremely fast runner.

He added Chauhan was arrested following a month of relentless search and scrutiny of CCTV footage.The police were on Tuesday tipped off about Chauhan’s plan of snatching. The informers told the police that he always carries a gun with him. “We laid a trap on the MB Road and arrested him from there. He tried to take out his countrymade pistol, but we overpowered him,” Thakur said. A pistol with live cartridge, four snatched mobile phones, and four gold chains were recovered from his possession.Thakur added that Chauhan told them that he sold three snatched gold chains to Aggarwal, who runs a jewellery shop in Neb Sarai. “We have solved 15 cases so far after arresting him and further investigations are on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-5-star-hotel-chef-held-for-resorting-to-snatching-to-pay-off-debts-101632297515266.html

These members would then withdraw the money and get a share for their work,” the officer said. Hussain, who is primarily a Zari worker, had got ₹35.85 lakh for his role in helping withdraw the money earned through the fraud, he said. Of the total amount, ₹27 lakh has been seized while Hussain said he has spent the remaining sum, he added. SSP Sajwan said the Bareilly police had earlier got ₹30 lakh of the duped money frozen in a bank account and arrested some other members of the gang.

22-09-2021||Kolkata||For the first time, West Bengal to count big herbivores during tiger census||West Bengal for the first time will count big herbivores such as deer and elephants while undertaking the tiger census this year, a senior forest official said on Wednesday.Earlier, the tiger census was done solely focussing on the big cats but from this year, the population of big herbivores will be included in the count as stipulated by the All India Coordinated Tiger Census, Chief Wildlife Warden Debal Roy told PTI."Herbivores are important to the ecosystem inhabited by tigers. Thus, it is imperative to know how many herbivores are co-existing with tigers in a forest area," he explained.Deer, antelopes, gaurs, rhinoceroses and elephants will be counted depending on the region, Roy said.While the 2019-2020 census put the number of tigers in Sunderbans at 95, the Forest Department is hopeful the upcoming census that will begin in December and continue till January will throw up higher figures."Apart from camera trapping technique, other statistical models will be used to arrive at the most probable figure and minimum probable figure," Roy said.The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) will analyse the data, following the census, he said.Sundarbans National Park, Buxa Tiger Reserve, Gorumara National Park, Jaldapara National Park and Chapramari National Park will be covered during the exercise, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/for-the-first-time-west-bengal-to-count-big-herbivores-during-tiger-census-101632292732556.html

At present 60%-70% of the daily doses are being given in peri-urban and rural areas, while only around 30%-40% are being given in urban areas,” said an official of the state health department.Between April 1 and September 18, around 20.3 million doses were given in rural areas while 10.8 million in urban areas. Nearly 85%- 90% of the urban population has received the first dose. People in peri-urban and rural areas are now flocking to the city hospitals to receive the first jab.“While on one hand, the infrastructure is more in the cities compared to the rural and peri-urban areas, these people usually come to the city for health check-ups in state-run hospitals,” the official said.Also Read | More rainfall in West Bengal ahead of Durga Puja? Here’s what IMD saysTo date, around 50.2 million people have received doses in West Bengal. While 30.7 million have received their first dose, 15.2 million have got their second.“Since September 1, on three days at least, we have been able to cross the one-million mark. On September 18, we gave 130,28,64 doses which is the highest given in one day in the state till date,” said another official.Even though the five-day Durga Puja starts from October 11, the festival extends for over a week every year. Mahalaya this year would be held on October 6 and the immersion process would continue till 17.Thousands of people would be flocking to Kolkata and Salt Lake from the peri-urban and rural areas for pandal hopping. The shopping spree ahead of the festive season has started.According to a study commissioned by the state government in 2018, the value of the creative industries that crop up around the Durga Puja – the biggest festival in West Bengal – is worth ₹32,377 crore.At least 36,000 community pujas are held across the state. This includes 2,500 in Kolkata alone. Pujas are held in housing societies and residences as well. Around 1,500 pujas are organised by women only.In 2020, the Calcutta high court banned the entry of visitors into puja pandals. A cap was put on the number of committee members, local residents, and drummers who could enter a pandal as part of the celebrations. Last year, the puja was celebrated in a muted manner which prevented a major spike in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-ramps-up-vaccine-drive-in-rural-areas-ahead-of-festive-season-101632291214841.html
22-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC to beautify all bridges, flyovers with theme-based artwork||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to give a makeover to all the bridges and flyovers in Mumbai with theme-based paintings, murals, and 3-D images on their girders, slabs, parapet walls, and anti-crash barriers. The civic body has recently floated tenders for the 18-month project with an estimated cost of ₹8 crore. All work will be done on weekends, holidays, and at night to ensure that traffic movement is not hampered. A senior civic official of the bridges department said, “Themes for this art work on bridges will be based on the uniqueness of the bridge’s location. For example, if it is close to a heritage structure, we can paint that on it. If it is close to a business district, or a local market, we can have designs depicting those.”The contractor selected for the project will appoint an architect for the design and conceptualisation of the art work. The theme for each artwork will first be approved by the BMC, either via the bridges department, or through a committee set up for approval.The officer said, “The contractor will have to ensure that the safety and structural stability of the bridge is not hampered by the work. All existing traffic signages, signboards, blinkers, warnings, and signals for traffic will have to be maintained in their original spots, and should be visible as per the specifications of the traffic police; the art work should not camouflage the safety signs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmcto-beautify-all-bridges-flyovers-with-theme-based-artwork-101632290914600.html
22-09-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies | Detailing the wonders of fermented pickles, drinks||How many times have you shelled out ₹300 for a bottle of kombucha and wondered why there was no Indian equivalent? Where were all the gut-friendly, probiotic fermented drinks (and foods) in Indian cuisine?Of course, there are. As with anything in India, every state has its own variations. In Kerala and Tamil Nadu, soaking day-old rice overnight, letting it ferment and then drinking it like porridge the following day with pickles is a common practice. Not only does it taste delicious and refreshing, it also fills you up without making you feel bloated or heavy.North Indian kanji too, is a delicious winter drink. Made from black carrots (kaala gajar), which sadly are not to be found here in Bengaluru, this drink too involves natural fermentation for a few days. Nisha Madhulika’s popular Youtube channel has the exact recipe. My version here in Bengaluru comes from my friends, Kavita Gupta and Raj Himatsingka. It was in Raj’s house that I had my first taste of beetroot kanji. Made with sliced beetroots instead of the dark carrots, the kanji is made with yellow mustard seeds powdered with some black salt, asafoetida, pepper and mixed with the beets or carrot. You then pour water and allow it to ferment for 3-5 days. By then, the water is infused with a beet red colour and the sour flavour of the yellow mustard seeds, all of which warm you up for the winter.A more local version is the karindi chutney. I had it first in Sirsi district in the Uttara Karnataka, one of the most beautiful and verdant places in the state. Cleaved by rivers with poetic names such as the Aghanashini and framed by the Western Ghats, Sirsi is where new frog species, flora and fauna are found. It is where school girls with twinkling eyes use giant colocasia leaves as umbrellas as they walk home from school. In this budding blossoming generous land, medicinal herbs sprout from the red red under the pouring rain every few steps. Some tender touch-me-nots shrink as you step on them.Modest homes cook up nourishing simple healthy dishes. Karindi is one of them. The base is flaxseeds, called agase in this state. High in Omega 3 fatty acids, these seeds are left out in the sun or gently roasted. There are several recipes online for karindi. The one I make has equal quantities of the following ingredients: flax seeds, green chilies and garlic. I grind these three together along with 1 teaspoon of salt, fenugreek seeds, cumin/jeera, black mustard seeds. In the end, throw in a handful of fresh coriander leaves and curry leaves. The paste will end up in a rich green colour. Empty into a pickle jar. Separately, cut one cucumber and carrot in small pieces. Fold the vegetables into the paste. Add a bit of water so that it becomes like a porridge. Cover with a piece of cloth, cover the pickle bottle and leave out in the sun for 5 days so that it ferments nicely. The heat of the green chilies goes down as it ferments. So depending on your spice tolerance you can adjust the number and size of the green chilies. Remember, the fatter the green chilly, the less hot it is.Karindi is used a lot by the Veerashaiva community who often eat it with jolada-rotti or jowar rotis. It is kept outside in the kitchen shelf-- not the refrigerator-- and served with everything including hot rice. If you pour a little ghee or coconut oil over it while serving, this adds to the taste. I store it in a earthen pot and have it everyday with pretty much everything. You can smear it over bread for a taste that is akin to English mustard but more nuanced. It can fare really well in a panini because it has girth from the green paste and crunch from the cucumber and carrots.Recently, I found a win-win recipe which incorporates two of the culinary world’s current darlings: millets and fermented foods. The fermented food in this combination is the karindi. The other part of this handshake comes from my neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. Go to Madurai in the summer and many homes will begin their day with Samai-arisi-kanji. Made from cooked little millets, this too is mildly fermented. What you do is cook a tablespoon of little millet or samai and mash till it is soft. To this add buttermilk and stir in a glass till it become like a porridge. Finally, make a seasoning to sprinkle on top. Heat oil on a pan, add black mustard seeds, cumin, salt, asafoetida, and curry leaves-- also diced garlic if you want to amp up the immune-boosting properties. Add this to the porridge, stir and leave overnight. The heat of Madurai makes this dish ferment nightly. In Bangalore, particularly in September, when the temperature is cool, fermentation is more gentle. In the morning, drink the little millet kanji with a teaspoon of karindi like a pickle.

This time, the SEC has adopted the biometric system for verifying the identity of voters.Biometric devices, along with a tab and authentication machines, will be installed at all booths for voters to first give their thumb impression and get a photograph clicked. ₹28 crore is likely to be spent for the project being handled by a public sector enterprise.The SEC has already issued guidelines to all district election officers and polling personnel to ensure strict compliance to the biometric authenticity process for voters.On Tuesday, the SEC held a review meeting with officials and police personnel on the election preparedness and security arrangements. Officials aware of the developments said each booth will be manned by three constables and one officer, while in highly sensitive booths and extremist hit areas, the strength will be doubled at every alternate booth. District armed police (DAP) will mainly man the booths while home guard jawans will also be used for election duty, officials said.The campaign for the first phase of panchayat election is ending today. Total 15,300 candidates are in the fray for the six posts in the three-tier local bodies and gram kutcheries for the first phase of polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/reserve-evms-to-stay-closer-for-faster-replacement-in-bihar-panchayat-polls-101632284376044.html
22-09-2021||Patna||Non-teaching staff appointment in Bihar varsities through commission: Minister||Bihar education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary on Tuesday said that recruitment of non-teaching staff in state universities will be done through staff selection commission or a separate commission.“There are vacancies in universities both in teaching and non-teaching positions. While the Bihar state university service commission will carry out appointments of assistant professors, the recruitment of non-teaching staff will be done through another commission. Now, there is a separate portal for non-teaching employees, providing a clear picture of vacancies and the number of sanctioned posts,” Choudhary said.The minister was speaking at the launch of portals for aided-affiliated colleges and also non-teaching staff in the state universities. Later, a training session was also organised for the university officials to smoothly run the portal.All universities in Bihar have huge vacancies for teaching and non-teaching staff. Even Patna University is working at less than 50% of the sanctioned strength due to delayed appointment processes, which run for years. Since 2005, the appointment of teachers in the universities has been done only once by the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC), and the process took nearly four years, while the second round of appointments is presently being done by the Bihar state university service commission.“By the time one round of appointment is completed and fresh inductions are made, even more teachers retire, making the universities perennially short of teaching staff. There is no mechanism to fill the vacancies as and when they occur. For the non-teaching employees and lab technicians, mostly the appointments have not been carried out, leaving it to the universities to manage things on an ad hoc basis. In many universities huge sums are spent on outsourcing of staff and private security guards every month,” said an official, who didn’t wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nonteaching-staff-appointment-in-bihar-varsities-through-commission-minister-101632281493802.html

Accompanied by Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, the chief minister arrived at 4am and shouldered the Palki Sahib (palanquin carrying Guru Granth Sahib) and attended the kirtan at the sanctum sanctorum in Darbar Sahib for an hour before speaking to the media briefly. Also read: Punjab CM Channi takes chartered flight to Delhi to meet bosses, kicks up row“I assure you that there will be justice in the sacrilege cases,” Channi said, referring to the series of desecration incidents of ‘birs’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib after the incident at Bargari in Faridkot district in June 2015 and subsequent protests that left two followers dead in police firing at Behbal Kalan in October 2015 during the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP rule. Six years after the incidents, the delay in action was one of the reasons for the rebellion within the Congress against former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. Five months to go for the assembly elections, the Congress leadership, at the instance of Sidhu, had asked Capt Amarinder to fulfil the pre-poll promise of bringing the perpetrators of the sacrilege and police firing cases to justice. Seconding Channi’s resolve, Sidhu said: “Sacha Sikh woh hota hai jo haq aur sach ki baat karta ho (A true Sikh is one who talks of rights and the truth).” Deputy chief ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni were also present. They did the parikarma (circumambulation) of Darbar Sahib with Channi and Sidhu amid tight security as devotees watched from a distance. After paying obeisance at Golden Temple, the chief minister and his deputies along with the state Congress chief went to Durgiana Temple and Ram Tirath Temple. Later, they took a stopover at a local tea stall and interacted with local residents.Channi, his two deputies and Sidhu reached Amritsar on Tuesday night from Delhi where they had gone to discuss the expansion of the new state cabinet with the party’s central leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-sacrilege-cases-will-ensure-justice-says-channi-at-golden-temple-101632279513225.html

Here's what IMD says||West Bengal has been experiencing heavy rainfall since the beginning of the week; however, the MeT department in its latest forecasts indicated that a respite from the downpour may not be on its way anytime soon despite the state preparing to hold the much-awaited Durga Puja festival in the upcoming month. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted more rainfall till Wednesday morning, which may well extend into later in the day throughout south Bengal, including in Kolkata, where several low-lying localities and metropolitan streets still lay waterlogged on account of the incessant showers over the past couple of days.Also Read | Trains delayed, roads submerged as heavy rain pounds Kolkata; commuters stuckThunderstorms with lightning, along with heavy rain, may lash all districts of south Bengal today, with coastal South 24 Parganas, Purba Medinipur, and its neighbouring Paschim Medinipur likely to receive heavier downpour. According to the weatherman, there is also a possibility of a cyclonic formation intensifying over the area on Saturday, which may bring torrential rainfall on the weekend. Coastal areas of the state, including the districts of South 24 Parganas and Midnapore, may experience an increase in the downpour on Sunday.The storm circulation, with its associated low-pressure area, still persists, the IMD said; the formation had originally accumulated over the southern parts of Gangetic Bengal and adjoining Odisha, and extended up to 5.8km above mean sea level. However, there is also the possibility of the cyclonic formation changing its direction from Odisha, which might spare Bengal any further rainfall, according to reports citing the weather forecasters at the Alipore MeT department.Also Read | Rain, floods killed 6,800 people in India in last 3 yrs; Bengal tops listNotably, Kolkata had logged 142mm of rainfall in a span of 24 hours till 8.30am on Monday, the highest in a single day in September since 2007, according to the MeT department.

However, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association and different political parties in J&K extended their support to the ‘Jammu Bandh’ call for Wednesday. Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industry had given the bandh call to protest against government’s move of opening 100 Reliance retail stores in Jammu and other “anti-trade decisions” of the BJP government. It will be the first ever bandh by the traders since the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A on August 5, 2019. “The Jammu Chamber of Commerce of Industry along with other business and trade organisations has given a call for Jammu bandh on Wednesday to draw the UT administration’s attention towards the hardships faced by them on account of some faulty policies,” read an official statement issued here. “It is hoped that L-G Manoj Sinha and his administration will take note of the problems being faced by Jammu region, in particular by the lawyers, traders, businessmen, farmers, unemployed youth, and also the civic and infrastructure deficiencies, and address the same to make life easier for the people,” it added. The National Conference, the Congress, the Panthers Party, the CPIM, the AAP, and the Apni Party have supported the bandh call. Federation of Retailers Association Jammu, Dogra Front and Shiv Sena, J&K, All J&K Banquet Halls Association and Jammu Muslim Front (JMF) have also extended their support. J&K Congress Committee has announced its support to the bandh call of Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said its chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma. “The Congress had been opposing the anti-people policies of the Modi government and now each and every section of the society feels the pain of the wrong economic policies of the BJP. The BJP is only encouraging and promoting crony capitalism,” he said. “The NC has all along stood for safeguarding the interests of Jammu and Kashmir and will continue so with a sense of commitment,” said a party spokesperson in a statement issued here. Panthers Party president Bhim Singh said the entire Jammu province will protest against the government decision to open 100 Reliance stores.

She also accused the BJP government of communalising the atmosphere in Jammu and Kashmir, along with the country, to further its agenda. “Jammu and Kashmir has been put on sale by the government for the people from outside. They want us to become so poor that we become totally dependent on other states,” she said at a press conference here. “Jammu was a meeting point for different religions and ethnicities. Secularism was our identity and Jammu was the only place in India where one can see people from every religion, but it is being attacked. If the people of Jammu do not unite with Kashmir, then we will be wiped out,” she said. The PDP chief added, “The biggest problem of J&K is unemployment, which has shot up to 18%, highest in the country.” ‘For them, Sikhs are Khalistanis and we are Pakistanis’She also accused the BJP government of being bereft of any vision for Jammu and Kashmir. “Those in Delhi are using Jammu as a laboratory. Nehru and Vajpayee had a vision for Jammu and Kashmir, but the BJP is bereft of it. BJP’s vision is only to divide and rule, how to make people fight against each other and how to sell our resources to outsiders. For them, Sikhs are Khalistanis and we are Pakistanis,” she added. She also criticised the BJP-led government at the Centre for renaming roads and schools in J&K after soldiers killed in action. “They (BJP) don’t have anything to do. Will changing names generate employment for the youth? They are doing so because they have nothing to show. In the past seven years, they have sold big assets of the nation to corporate houses,” Mehbooba said. In August 2021, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had announced that the government schools would be renamed after bravehearts. Jammu divisional commissioner had sent letters to the DCs of Doda, Jammu, Reasi, Poonch, Rajouri, Samba, Kathua, Kishtwar and Udhampur districts to identify government schools in villages and municipal wards that can be renamed. The PDP chief also lashed out at the Centre’s delimitation exercise. “The delimitation exercise is being done haphazardly and hurriedly,” she said. Mehbooba claimed that the BJP government had no plans to bring the nation out of the “morasses of economic crisis” and said that “they talk about Taliban, Afghanistan but not about farmers and unemployment”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-has-put-j-k-on-sale-made-jammu-a-lab-mehbooba-101632267211517.html

His parents --KS Arya, a former commercial pilot and now an advocate, and mother, Usha, a government school teacher – have left for Udhampur. Capt DK Uppal, one of the neighbours of the family, said, “Anuj was a very polite, obedient and loveable young fellow. We had never seen a child like him. Perfect is word for him.”Coming from a family of pilots, Major Rajput had been passionate about flying since a young age. “He was only 18 when he joined the NDA and became a commissioned officer. He was promoted to the rank of major only a month-and-a-half ago. His received many awards during his service. Visit his house and you’ll see the walls filled with awards and accolades,” said Capt Uppal.An alumnus of St John’s Chandigarh, the officer had got engaged to a teacher this July and the families were in process of finalising the wedding date when tragedy struck.Capt Uppal revealed that Major Rajput had survived another accident about a year ago. “A Cheetah helicopter had got stuck in a high-voltage wire. Anuj was lucky as the power had been switched off at the time due to repair works. Sadly, he could not survive this crash,” said Capt Uppal.As per information, Major Rajput and his partner Major Rohit Kumar of Ace City, Noida West in the NCR, were on a training sortie when their Cheetah helicopter crash landed in Shiv Garh Dhar area near Patnitop tourist resort in Udhampur district. The two pilots were injured in the mishap and evacuated to a hospital, but could not survive.

22-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh has no plans to extend lal dora limits in its villages||Laying to rest all speculations about the extension of lal dora — the red line that separates village habitation from adjacent agricultural land—in UT villages, adviser Dharam Pal said there are no such plans and illegal constructions outside the limit will have to be demolished, “preferably” by the violators themselves as the administration prepares to roll out a land pooling policy and village development plan.The adviser clarified, “At the moment there is no plan to extend the lal dora. It is not under consideration.” The speculation had gained momentum in the past few months after the administration started working to formulate a policy for regularisation of illegal constructions outside lal dora. In January this year, former UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had directed UT officials to bring a comprehensive policy on the issue. The administration has roped in the Indian Institute of Human Settlement (IISH), Bengaluru, to formulate a land pooling and aggregation policy. In a recent meeting with the IISH representatives, the first draft of the policy was discussed. During the meeting, the adviser directed the UT urban planning department to devise a plan for village development. In addition to it, to bring more clarity on lal dora, the deputy commissioner’s office was directed to provide demarcated lal dora areas to the planning department.Political parties and village residents have been consistently asking for the extension of lal dora and regularisation of constructions outside it. Architects and city’s heritage conservationists are demanding that these illegal constructions should be removed to protect the city’s character. Hundreds of cases are pending in the high court and SDM courts on the issue. With municipal corporation elections a little over two months away, the lal dora extension will be a key issue as villages’ votes are likely to make difference for a party to cross the winning seat marks in the MC House. Regularising illegal constructions The Punjab New Capital Periphery Control Act restricts constructions in the periphery of around 16km (controlled area) of the city, which covers the areas outside the lal dora. Punjab and Haryana high court has also imposed restrictions on construction for protection of Sukhna Catchment Area. The planning department has consistently flagged large-scale illegal construction and colonisation in villages of Chandigarh. Administration recently authorised three sub divisional magistrates (SDM) to demolish any new construction outside lal dora. But constructions continue to crop up in most villages such as Kishangarh-Manimajra, Hallomajra, Maloya, areas around Bapu Dham near Sukhna Choe, Khuda Ali Sher and Kaimbwala etc. For instance, in Khuda Ali Sher village, even advertisement boards can be spotted offering land for sale. Walled bifurcated plots are available with internal roads, drinking water supply, sewerage, and electricity connections. Most of these advertisements are for farmhouses. But overtime, land is bifurcated multiple times to form smaller plots. Also, small hutments get converted into bigger houses gradually, say local residents. On the regularisation of large-scale illegal constructions outside the lal dora, the adviser, said, “After the administration finalises the village development plan and land pooling policy, the violators will have to go as per that plan. They will have to first demolish their unauthorised constructions, and get their new constructions, if permitted, as per the plan.” “Once land pooling policy comes into force, people may pool their resources and demolish unauthorised buildings and go for authorised ones. After leaving space for parks, roads, etc, people will be allowed to create residential and commercial spaces. That will be a huge incentive for people to go for legal structures and demolish illegal ones,” said Pal. The draft land pooling policy is expected to be ready in a month’s time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-has-no-plans-to-extend-lal-dora-limits-in-its-villages-101632259035843.html

22-09-2021||Chandigarh||In Ludhiana, it’s risky ride on bumpy roads||Commuting in torrential rainfall on flooded roads can be brutal. However, the pothole-riddled roads are adding to commuters’ woes as they are being subjected to a rather bumpy ride. The state of the roads remains deplorable, despite municipal corporation officials’ extravagant claims and promises. Recently, in response to an RTI (Right To Information Act) petition, the civic body had claimed that ₹212 crore had been spent on repairing roads between 2015 to 2020.However, as matters stand at present, deep craters pockmark the roads on Gill Road, Ferozepur Road, Jagraon Bridge, BRS Nagar, Model Town-Jawaddi Road, Haibowal, and Model Town Extension among other areas. Streets in residential areas such as Sarabha Nagar, Model House, Field Ganj, and the Dugri area are also in a bad state.With the civic body reluctant to carry out repairs in the monsoon season, councillors and residents have sought an alternative to the problem.Oppn slams MC Lok Insaaf Party councillor Swarandeep Chahal said he had taken up the matter with mayor Balkar Sandhu on Tuesday and had demanded that the MC start the repair work with ready-mix concrete or other alternative material. “The roads are in bad shape and the commuters are a harried lot. Rather than waiting for the end of monsoon season, we need to chalk out a solution,” he said. Slamming the ruling party, MC leader of Opposition Harbhajan Singh Dang said, “Not a single road in the city is in good condition and the MC is turning a blind eye to the plight of the people.” Meanwhile, mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “Patchwork cannot be done during the rainy season as the hotmix plant cannot function in the rain. Experts say that it will stop raining after Friday,and we will start repair work soon after that.” Residents decry ‘double standards’ Pointing out that come rain or shine, the civic body had repaired roads ahead of housing and urban affairs secretary Durga Shaker Mishra’s visit to the city, residents slammed the MC for not showing similar initiative when it came to the residents’ issues. MC teams were seen repairing roads in Sarabha Nagar, and the Civil Lines among other areas, ahead of Mishra’s visit on September 17. Repair work was again put on a halt after his visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-ludhiana-it-s-risky-ride-on-bumpy-roads-101632258678100.html

22-09-2021||Chandigarh||September brings 100% surplus rain to Ludhiana||Making up for the deficit rainfall in August, the city has so far received 100% surplus rain in September, and still more downpours are expected in the course of the month. On Tuesday, the city received 16.4mm rainfall, taking the gross rainfall this month to 199.4 mm, which is 97.6mm more than the average rainfall of 101.8mm. As has been the trend for the last three years, monsoon withdrawal has been delayed and is now expected to commence in October. Around 250mm rainfall was witnessed in September 2019. As per experts at Punjab Agricultural University’s department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, monsoon withdrawal normally begins in mid-September. However, since 2018, the withdrawal has had a delayed start in October, due to a change in the pattern of monsoon. For the last few years, Ludhiana has been reporting deficit rainfall. However, excess rainfall was witnessed this year. PAU principal agrometeorologist KK Gill said, “In August, Ludhiana only received 108mm rainfall, against the normal of 190mm. Earlier, at 271mm, excess rainfall was recorded in July against the normal of 217mm.” However, the showers were much needed. PAU department of climate change and agricultural meteorology Dr Prabhjyot Kaur said the rainfall being witnessed in the city nowadays is good for recharging groundwater. “There are run-off losses during heavy rainfall. However, light rainfall allows water to percolate and recharges the groundwater reserves,” said Sidhu. The PAU experts also said that light to moderate rainfall being witnessed at most parts of the state was good for the paddy crop.The maximum temperature in Ludhiana was 27.4°C, while the minimum was 24.4°C on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/september-brings-100-surplus-rain-to-ludhiana-101632257657523.html

22-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi takes chartered flight to Delhi to meet bosses, kicks up row||Chandigarh  Barely hours after he profusely thanked the Congress high command for picking an “aam aadmi” (common man) for the top post, new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and other Congress leaders on Tuesday drew flak from the opposition parties for taking a chartered flight to Delhi. Channi, his two deputies Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu travelled from Chandigarh to Delhi in the chartered plane to meet the central leaders for a discussion on cabinet expansion. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) questioned the use of the chartered flight by the CM and his deputies. “After saying that they stand with the common man, INC leaders take private jets to travel just 250km from Chandigarh to Delhi. Are there no normal flights or cars that can be use? Or is this chest thumping aimed at propagation of Gandhi family’s Delhi Darbar culture?” the SAD said in a tweet, taking a dig at the Congress leaders. AAP MLA and leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said the Congress leaders cannot give up their royal habits. “No one becomes a common man just by saying. Their real faces have been exposed,” he said, asking Channi, Sidhu and Randhawa whether the chartered plane was rented from the state exchequer or the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee would bear the cost. The controversy started after Sidhu tweeted a photo in which he was seen with Channi and Randhawa beside the chartered plane in which they travelled to Delhi. Capt Amarinder Singh’s former media adviser Raveen Thukral also took digs at them, questioning their decision to rent a 16-seater to ferry four people to Delhi. “Wow…what a ‘gareeban di sarkar’! A 16-seater Learjet to ferry four people when a 5-seater official chopper was available,” he posted on Twitter. In another post, he said: “Wonder who’s paying for such luxury – the state govt or @INCPunjab? Can’t be @sherryontopp or @CHARANJITCHANNI or @Sukhjinder_INC or #OPsoni for sure. Though eventually I guess it’s the common man who’ll end up footing the bill for their pleasures!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-takes-chartered-flight-to-delhi-to-meet-bosses-kicks-up-row-101632255795158.html

22-09-2021||Chandigarh||Race for new Punjab DGP: Of caste angle, dark horse and more||Caste angle and differences between key players in the state’s new dispensation have surfaced amid suspense over the appointment of a new director general of police (DGP) in Punjab. According to some senior government officers, the issue came up for discussion during an informal meeting of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, his deputies and officials on Monday evening, in which the names of IPS officers Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota (1988 batch), S Chattopadhyaya (1986) and BK Bhawra (1987) were discussed. A senior officer privy to the developments said Sahota appears to have the backing of the CM’s office, whereas a group in the new Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) team headed by Navjot Singh Sidhu is strongly pushing for Chattopadhyaya for the post of the top cop. However, according to highly placed sources in the Congress’ national leadership, BK Bhawra can be the dark horse in the race, as the group supporting Chattopadhyaya has made him the alternative candidate.Amid Sahota emerging as the strongest contender with the CMO’s apparent backing, a WhatsApp message was widely circulated in the media and inner circles of the Congress, claiming that the seniority principle is being ignored again (as was done in the case of DGP Dinkar Gupta) and also gave it a caste twist.“If Sahota is appointed (as the DGP) when the chief minister (belongs to the SC community) and his principal secretary (Hussan Lal) is also from the same caste, it will send a wrong signal,” reads the message. Both Sahota and Chattopadhyaya were not available for comment. However, a former Punjab DGP said it was unfortunate that the caste angle was coming into play. “It is the state government’s prerogative to select the new DGP who suits it the most. There have been various examples when Jat Sikhs were chosen as DGPs when a Jat Sikh was the chief minister and had another Jat Sikh as the principal secretary. All these considerations in appointments are unfortunate,” he said, while requesting anonymity. Legal aspects being looked intoIt is also learnt that Channi has tasked his confidants to discuss legal aspects of removing Gupta from the post, in view of the Supreme Court judgment (of 2018, amended in 2019) for appointment and removal of DGPs. A senior home department functionary said Gupta can be removed from the post as he has completed two years of service (one of the conditions laid in the apex court ruling). The legal wing of the government is also taking into consideration the procedure followed by Haryana in the appointment of a new DGP. When the previous DGP, Manoj Yadav, wanted to return to the Intelligence Bureau, he had to wait till his successor was selected through a panel received from the Union Public Service Commission. Giving heed to the apex court ruling, Haryana did not appoint a caretaker DGP till the regular appointment.Meanwhile, commenting on Bhawra’s chances, a senior Congress leader at the helm of affairs said: “Chattopadhyaya’s candidature was rejected by the UPSC when Dinkar Gupta was appointed the DGP. Keeping in mind various factors and the Supreme Court guidelines to appoint the DGP, the new Punjab Police force head can be a surprise pick.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/race-for-new-punjab-dgp-of-caste-angle-dark-horse-and-more-101632254596134.html

While seven of the assailants remain unidentified, three of them have been identified as Sahil of Lohara village, Lakha of Daba Colony and one Gaurav. In his complaint, Ashok Kumar, the father of the victim, said that his son, Abhishek, 25, of Harkrishan Nagar, who works as a contractual sanitary worker, had gone to Dugri on September 15 to take part in a rally, where his motorcycle had accidentally brushed past, Sahil, after which the two had a heated spat. “Sahil had threatened my son with dire consequences and even followed him home, where he had issued the same threats to us.

Kaur said the nomenclature “Dalit” does not find mention in the Constitution of India or any statute and moreover, the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment has already directed all chief secretaries of the state governments and Union Territory administrations regarding the same. She said that the high court of Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior bench, passed an order on January 15, 2018, “that the Central government/state government and its functionaries would refrain from using the nomenclature ‘Dalit’ for the members belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as the same does not find mention in the Constitution of India or any statute”. She further said that following the direction of the high court, the ministry of social justice and empowerment of India directed all the state governments/Union Territory administrations to use the word “Scheduled Caste” instead of “Dalit” for the persons belonging to the community. Acting on the reports of violations being made by the various media groups, the information and broadcasting ministry also issued a notice to private satellite TV channels by asking them to comply with an order passed earlier by the Bombay high court to not use the word “Dalit” in reports, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-use-word-dalit-to-identify-a-person-punjab-sc-panel-101632254235094.html

Whoever deserves the post should get it, but the Congress high command has played a game, which has exposed the real face of the party. The Congress has attempted to divide people on communal lines again,” he alleged, addressing a press conference. Joshi, a former senior leader of the BJP, has only recently joined the SAD.“Across the country, Punjab has always been an exception as communal riots have never happened here. The state is the biggest instance of communal harmony and brotherhood which has withstood the worst. The Congress, however, has not desisted from damaging it,” he claimed. “It is this communal politics of the Congress, which meant that former PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar could not become the CM. The Congress party has a history of ruling, after dividing people on communal lines. The party’s communal face has been exposed by this drama,” Joshi alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/drama-over-punjab-cm-name-exposed-cong-s-communal-face-anil-joshi-101632254054846.html

22-09-2021||Chandigarh||Jagmeet, 15 other Punjab-origin candidates win Canada elections||Caption:Canada’s New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, accompanied by his wife Gurkiran Kaur Sidhu, delivers remarks on election night in Vancouver, British Columbia REUTERSBlurb:TorontoThere will be a sizeable contingent of Indo-Canadians in the House of Commons as 17 candidates, 16 of them Punjabis, secured victories in the Canada elections held on Monday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s gamble to seek a majority by calling a snap election has not paid off as his ruling Liberal Party again ended up 14 seats short of the 170-mark in the 338-member House of Commons.The Jagmeet Singh-led New Democratic Party (NDP) will again hold the balance of power as it increased its tally from 24 to 27.All three Indo-Canadian ministers in the dissolved cabinet emerged victorious as did Jagmeet Singh of the NDP. Defence minister Harjit Sajjan was re-elected from Vancouver South, with nearly 49% of the vote share, despite facing headwinds over issues such as a major sexual harassment crisis in the Canadian Armed Forces under his watch and a much criticised evacuation mission in Afghanistan. Among Indo-Canadians, another high-profile minister Anita Anand, who handled the public services and procurement portfolio and was described by Trudeau as his minister for vaccines, retained her seat from the riding of Oakville, Ontario. Also winning comfortably in the Canada elections from Waterloo in Ontario was Bardish Chagger, minister of diversity, inclusion and youth.NDP leader Jagmeet Singh - a popular figure among Indo-Canadians - was re-elected from Burnaby South, with approximately 38% of the votes cast. However, his focus may well have been on the national performance of the party he leads, as the NDP increased its vote share to 17.7% from 15.98% in 2019 but could only gain one more seat in the House of Commons, rising from 24 to 25. It will again be the fourth-largest group there, behind Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party, the principal opposition Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois, which was on course to capture 34 seats in the Canada elections.Focus will also be on another Indo-Canadian Liberal Party winner, George Chahal, who edged out incumbent Conservative MP Jag Sahota from Calgary Skyview in Alberta. While Justin Trudeau’s ruling party was blanked in the province in 2019, this seat may well see the city councillor-turned-first-time MP possibly finding a place in the next cabinet.Several sitting MPs from the Greater Toronto Area were re-elected, and the most prominent among them are former parliamentary secretary Kamal Khera from Brampton West, Ruby Sahota from Brampton North, Sonia Sidhu from Brampton South and Arif Virani from Parkdale-High Park. In Metro Vancouver, veteran Sukh Dhaliwal retained his Surrey-Newton seat while Randeep Sarai won again from Surrey. Making it a hat-trick of victories from Dorval-Lachine-LaSalle in Quebec was Anju Dhillon, while emulating her feat was Chandra Arya from Nepean, near Ottawa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jagmeet-15-other-punjab-origin-candidates-win-canada-elections-101632253214930.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||Seventh sero survey likely to begin in the Capital this week||After delays going back to the second wave of the pandemic, the seventh serological survey is likely to begin this week in Delhi, when 28,000 people will be tested for exposure to Sars-CoV-2. A portion of the samples will be, for the first time, also tested to calculate the levels of neutralising antibodies that directly target the virus.“In a subset of the samples collected, we will check the levels of neutralising antibodies. This will also help us in co-relating the level of antibodies with the IgG levels found in the semi-quantitative test, thereby giving us an understanding of how much of the population is actually protected,” said a researcher working on the surveys conducted by the Delhi government.Serological surveys are used by epidemiologists to determine the prevalence of a disease in a population. The testing kits currently in use reveal whether a sample has IgG antibodies against one of the proteins of the virus. They just indicate whether the antibody level is high or low, and are called semi-quantitative. The seventh survey will conduct a more expensive test to determine the exact levels of the antibodies in a subset of the samples.“The survey should ideally have been conducted eight weeks after the infection peak we saw in April-end. That was the time we would have seen the highest level of antibodies in those who were exposed to the virus during the second wave,” another researcher involved in the survey said. “However, the good thing is that the neutralising antibodies will be measured in a proportion of the people.” Both the researchers declined to be named.The seventh survey will be conducted when nearly three out of four of Delhi’s adult population have received at least one dose of a vaccine against Covid-19, and one in three have been fully vaccinated. The survey will include questions about vaccination history, similar to the survey conducted in April, which was aborted due to the surge in infections.Delhi has been conducting serological surveys since June-July last year. The last complete round, conducted in January, had found the serological prevalence to be 56.13%, almost double the prevalence in the previous survey conducted in October, showing high levels of exposure during the November surge in infections in the city. The result from the April survey showed a similar exposure level detected during the January survey.“This time, however, we are expecting to find antibodies in 80% to 90% of the population, either through a previous infection or because of vaccination,” said the first researcher quoted in the story. The researchers in the report of the truncated April survey had said that another round of survey must be conducted in June-end or July.The seventh survey was initially planned to be conducted between August 1 and 10. “The survey will begin in another two days,” the researcher said.At the end of June 2020, when the first survey was conducted, 22.6% of the 21,000 people sampled had antibodies. This shot up to 29.1% of the 15,000 people sampled in August. It dropped to 25.1% among the 17,000 people sampled in September due to a change in methodology and dropping antibody levels in the population, the researchers said. In October, it went up to 25.5% in a sample size of 15,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/seventh-sero-survey-likely-to-begin-in-the-capital-this-week-101632253029199.html

Channi and Sidhu are keen to expand the council of ministers and allocate them portfolios to get cracking on the 18-point agenda and accommodate some of those who were part of the group that took on Capt Amarinder Singh. “The new cabinet will see the induction of a few new faces by keeping out some of those who were part of the Amarinder cabinet and involved in controversies, to give it a fresh look and make a clean break from the previous setup,” a person familiar with the developments said. Names doing the roundsThe names doing the rounds for inclusion in the state cabinet include Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Pargat Singh, Gurkirat Kotli, Sangat Singh Gilizian and Raj Kumar Verka. Gilzian, who has been seeking due representation for backward classes in the cabinet, had made a personal request to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi when he was in Chandigarh to attend the oath-taking ceremony of the new chief minister and his two deputies on Monday, said sources. There is speculation that Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi and Sunder Sham Arora may not find a place in the new team. All three were embroiled in controversies during the Amarinder Singh government. A number of legislators, including former ministers Balbir Singh Sidhu and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and MLA Parminder Singh Pinky, were also camping in Delhi. Another person said that Venugopal and the state team connected with Rahul through video-conferencing for a discussion on the expansion. Channi and Sidhu, however, did not talk to the media or respond to calls. The chief minister, his deputies and the state chief will fly from Delhi to Amritsar where they will pay obeisance at the Golden Temple and visit the Durgiana Mandir early in the morning. On their way to Chandigarh, they are likely to visit Dera Sachkhand Ballan. Meanwhile, the AlCC made more appointments in the state Congress. Pargat Singh and Yoginder Pal Dhingra have been appointed general secretaries while Gulzar Inder Chahal is the new treasurer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cabinet-expansion-channi-sidhu-hold-talks-with-congress-leaders-in-delhi-101632253036336.html
22-09-2021||Chandigarh||Runaway couples: Undertaking on marital status, age by petitioners a must, says HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has ordered that in protection matters by runaway couples, the petition be put up before judges only after affidavits are filed from both the petitioners. The direction has been issued in a matter in which it came to light that the male petitioner had not filed an affidavit and the petition concealed details about his marital status stating that it was first marriage of both the petitioners. During the hearing, it had come to light that the male petitioner was married. Photos and other documents of the marriage were supplied to the court and marriage certificate too. It was also stated that the person was involved in a gang-rape case and was facing trial. Taking note of facts on September 9, the high court bench of justice Arvind Sangwan sought explanation from the registry as to how the petition was passed without there being the affidavits of both the petitioners. In response, the registry told court that since the affidavit of one of the petitioner was annexed, the case was passed. The registry had referred to the Criminal Procedure Code stating that there is no provision regarding filing of affidavit. It also submitted that under the high court rules, this category of cases, there is no requirement of affidavits accompanying a petition. The bench observed that since a large number of such or similar petitions praying for protection to the life and liberty are filed on the basis of a claim that the marriage performed by the petitioners is against the wishes of their parents or in cases where the parties claim to be in a live-in-relationship or in cases where one of the petitioners is a minor and has not attained the marriageable age as per The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, the lawyers intentionally file the affidavit only of the petitioner, who is legally competent to file the same, in order to avoid deposing the correct description of the marital status as well as the age of another petitioner. Now, the court has ordered that from November 1, all cases seeking issuance of a direction to protect the life and liberty of the petitioners at the hands of private respondents, who are the parents or relatives of the petitioners, should be passed only when both have filed their respective affidavits mentioning their date of birth as well as marital status, irrespective of the fact that they are claiming to be in a live-in-relationship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/runaway-couples-undertaking-on-marital-status-age-by-petitioners-a-must-says-hc-101632253034854.html

22-09-2021||Pune||ARAI successfully develops indigenous chargers for electric vehicles||Pune: The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) has indigenously developed charger for electric vehicles considering the need to boost the charging mechanism of electric vehicles in the country, said Reji Mathai, director, ARAI. Speaking during a press conference on Tuesday, Mathai said that to promote electric vehicles, infrastructure for charging is important and since the mobility chargers are imported, the focus of ARAI is to develop chargers indigenously, which will be cost-effective and boost local economy. “Many components of EV like motors and controllers are imported and even chargers are being brought from abroad. ARAI has developed an indigenous technology for EV charger AC001, which has been taken up for manufacturing and promotion by Bharat Electronics. The charging points will be set up by Bharat Electronics and parts for EV charger systems- Type 1, Type 2, CCS and CHAdeMO will be manufactured locally,” said Mathai. He said that the charger has been designed considering the safety aspects and power surge in India with other aspects like environmental conditions and it will also be cost-competitive. ARAI has recently signed MoU with Bharat Electronics Limited where ARAI will provide the knowhow of the charges and Bharat Electronics will manufacture the chargers. The cost of the charger is expected to be in the range of ₹50,000-60,000. In addition, as ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistant System) vehicles and cylinder testing centres need dedicated space, ARAI is setting up a new centre in Takwe. Investments to the tune of ₹500 crore shall be made in phased manner in the next 3-4 years in setting up this centre. “One of the areas would be ‘Testing Tracks’ which could be useful for carrying out development of ADAS vehicles. Additional facilities related with the cylinder testing and Transmission Gearbox Testing Center (TGTC) have been planned along with a Hydro-fuel cell and Rapid Prototyping centre at Takwe,” said Mathai. Nitin Dhande, senior deputy director, ARAI, said that the organisation is planning to set up dedicated skill development centres that will impart necessary knowledge and shall undertake skilling for engineering students in the electric vehicles segment. The course content is ready and some part of it could be available in the form of e-content. These centres would also have research and test labs, which could also be utilised to nurture startups in the e-mobility sector. ARAI is currently in talks with Telangana and Kerala Government to set up such centers. 17th edition of SIAT will be online The 17th edition of Symposium on International Automotive Technology (SIAT) 2021 organised by The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) in association with SAEINDIA and SAE International (USA) will be held from September 29 to October 1, 2021.

22-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A reluctant balloon hawker||It’s a secret. Nobody in the village knows that he is selling balloons in the big city. “My family believes I’m here as a house carpenter,” says Anil Kumar, sitting by a central Delhi roadside. This afternoon he is holding a huge yellow balloon in one hand, while the other hand is busy with a wad of unblown balloons.In his mid-30s, Mr Kumar arrived in the city a week ago from Katni in Madhya Pradesh, but couldn’t find any carpentry work. “The other evening I was sitting idle in a chai stall in Sadar Bazaar when a man suggested I should sell balloons until I find suitable work” He promptly acquired a stack of balloons from a market trader and hit the streets.It’s painful to be alone in an unfamiliar place, especially when you are unable to get a job you desire, Mr Kumar observes. It becomes worse because “you cannot share your disappointments with your family.” He feels that his folks at home would be distressed to know of his pain, “which wouldn’t help the situation.” Not that there are many people left in his family to worry for him. His wife died during the childbirth last year, and he’s left only with his baby daughter and his mother. Mr Kumar has worked off and on in the city in the past and didn’t find it tough to get assignments, he says, “but it’s my first trip during the corona kaal (era) and I think jobs are fewer because of the times.” He does own agricultural land in the village in which he recently planted the rice crop. “But how much can a mere 1.5 acres yield.” The land is so small he says, that his elderly mother easily substitutes him as a farmer in his absence.Mr Kumar hopes to find the work he prefers sooner or later. Meanwhile, he sleeps in a ren basera for the homeless in Sadar Bazaar, and dines in an eatery “where you get a complete meal for ₹20.” The balloons help him earn ₹300 daily. Despite the current hard luck, he is trying to remain optimistic. “Setbacks happen in everyone’s life.” He now poses for a photograph but “please no face, I don’t want my gharwale (family) to know of my present condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-reluctant-balloon-hawker-101632252046024.html

22-09-2021||Pune||BJP on back foot over amenity spaces proposal||PUNE: With citizens and some of the Bharatiya Janta Party’s (BJP’s) elected members unhappy over the proposal to rent out amenity spaces to private parties, the party went on the back foot and decided to postpone the proposal instead of pushing it for the general body’s approval. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said that the BJP will first put out all the facts in the public domain to clear the air among critics of the proposal, including civic activists, environmentalists and opposition parties. “The proposal is before the general body meeting. Though it is a good proposal, citizens have some doubts about it. Considering this, we have decided to clear the doubts among citizens and political parties. We will put all the facts in front of citizens and try to get approval for this proposal by convincing other parties as well. This process cannot be completed in a day,” Mohol said on Tuesday after the general body meeting which will continue on Wednesday. He said given that clearing doubts may take time, the BJP will not try and get the proposal approved on Wednesday itself although the party has enough numbers to push it.The proposal was originally put forward by the BJP and cleared in the standing committee. The BJP planned to rent out as many as 185 amenity spaces on long lease. At the time, the BJP was firm on the proposal while announcing that it was in favour of passing it immediately. The opposition parties however managed to push BJP on the back foot by campaigning against it. Deviating from the party line, NCP leader Vandana Chavan earlier supported the proposal. However elected members of the NCP strongly opposed it, forcing the party to unanimously oppose it. The Congress and Shiv Sena had already opposed the proposal.“The BJP had to finally give in to pressure from the citizens and the NCP. It is a win for the citizens and a slap for the BJP,” said NCP spokesperson Pradeep Deshmukh. Meanwhile, BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil supported the proposal and claimed that the renting out process would be transparent and that anyone could hire these places by taking part in an auction. However, several NGOs and citizens’ groups too opposed the proposal and even filed PILs (Public Interest Litigations). Sources said that many BJP elected members were unhappy over this proposal ahead of the civic polls and even threatened the party leadership that if the party tried and gave its nod to the proposal in the general body meeting, they would raise their voice against it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-on-back-foot-over-amenity-spaces-proposal-101632251896126.html

22-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab gets relief, SC clears decks to run Pachhwara coal mine||In a big relief to the power sector in Punjab, the Supreme Court has cleared all hurdles for operating the Pachhwara central coal mine, which will eventually save around ₹600 crore annually and reduce tariff by 20 to 30 paisa per unit.Quashing a Punjab and Haryana high court judgment, a three-member bench of Justice L Nageswara Rao, Justice BR Gavai and Justice BV Nagarathna on Tuesday allowed Punjab’s plea to hire a new contractor to maintain and operate the mine.The coal mine located in Jharkhand, with reserves for 50 years, was allocated to the state-owned Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) in 2001 for generating electricity at state-owned power plants. However, its operation has been stuck in legal tangles after the Supreme Court in 2014 cancelled its allocation along with that of 212 other coal mines in India. On March 31, 2015, the coal mine was reallocated to the PSPCL, but its operations were again delayed due to legal issues.In 2018, the PSPCL floated a tender and hired the firm DBL to develop and operate the mine. However, in 2019, the high court allowed the appeal of the previous mine operator, EMTA, to operate the mine, which led to a political slugfest, including criticism of the then advocate general Atul Nanda, and stalled the process further.SC upholds hiring of new contractorOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court quashed this order and upheld the procedure followed by the PSPCL for hiring a new contractor through reverse bidding, which has saved the state government crores of rupees.Former advocate general Atul Nanda, who appeared for state in the Supreme Court, said: “I have been vindicated. I am very happy as several hundred crores of rupees of consumers will be saved annually with the operation of the coal mine. It’s a benchmark judgment as the state had selected the vendor by reverse bidding to protect the interest of the consumers, which should be the priority of every corporation.” PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said the coal from Pachhwara mine has a high calorific value. Spread over 1,051 hectare, the mine will produce 7 million tonnes of coal every year.“Its operation will not only save us from coal crisis, but also save ₹600 crores annually. Now, we will try to divert this coal to private plants to further bring this benefit to ₹1,000 crore, which will reduce tariff,” he said.The PSPCL has two coal-fired power generating units — Guru Hargobind Thermal Plant at Lehra Mohabbat in Bathinda and Guru Gobind Singh Super Thermal Power Plant at Rupnagar. Now, the Centre has also allowed the use of state-owned coal at private plants. “Hopefully, mining operations at the coal mine shall commence in the next three to five months, as we have taken all other necessary permissions from the Jharkhand government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-gets-relief-sc-clears-decks-to-run-pachhwara-coal-mine-101632251595667.html
22-09-2021||Pune||Fewer Covid cases in Pune city during festival compared to previous week||PUNE During the 11 days of Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in Pune city from September 9 to 20, the district reported over 9,000 new Covid cases while for the same duration prior to the festivities, the number of new cases was higher at over 10,000. The positivity rate of the district too fell down during Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. However, it was found that the number of tests conducted by the administration fell from 3.17 lakh in the week before the festival as compared to 2.78 lakh during the festival.From September 9 to 20, the district reported a total 9,223 new Covid-19 cases out of the 278,108 Covid-19 tests conducted, taking the positivity rate to 3.31%. Also, 85 deaths were reported in the district by the district health department. However in the week before Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations from August 28 to September 8, the district reported 10,980 new Covid-19 cases out of the 317,435 Covid-19 tests conducted. The positivity rate for this period was 3.4% and 123 deaths were reported by the district health department.By comparison, the week of Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations and the week after these celebrations in 2020 saw the beginning of the surge in the first wave of Covid-19 which peaked in September. As per figures released by the state health department, the district reported 37,968 new Covid-19 cases during the Ganesh festival between August 22 and September 2, 2020 while 31,110 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the week after the festival between August 10 and 21, 2020. So in 2020, a spike of 6,800 new Covid-19 cases was seen post Ganesh celebrations.This year, a number of factors contributed to the dip in new Covid-19 cases vis-a-vis last year, including a large number of vaccination drives and availability of the vaccine apart from the decision by major Ganapati mandals to organise only online darshan as opposed to physical aartis and darshan which helped avoid crowding.While the coming few months are being considered very important in terms of Covid-19 especially since multiple festivals are lined up, experts are of the view that it might be a bit too early to comment if the situation gets better or worse. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Covid-19 advisor to the state government said, “It is a good sign that the numbers have not increased as much as last year or even that major mandals took the step to ensure online aartis and darshan so that there was no crowding at popular immersion spots and famous mandals. However we could still see crowds at popular places. The incubation period for the virus is about 14 days and so, if in the next 14 days there is a major spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases, we can then say that the situation is better than it was thought of. However we have many festivals lined up and we must not let down our guard until everyone is vaccinated and there are no serious active cases remaining.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fewer-covid-cases-in-pune-city-during-festival-compared-to-previous-week-101632251534807.html

Additional chief secretary (ACS, health) Rajeev Arora said last week’s vaccination was the highest ever in a week in Haryana.“We intend to continue this momentum and hope to achieve the first dose target quickly. The fast-paced vaccination in state is also due to the increased supply of vaccine from the central government,” Arora said.The tempo seems to be continuing this week as more than 5.53 lakh doses including 3.80 lakh first dose were administered on the first two days of this week.Data showed that vaccinators across state inoculated 6.05 lakh persons on September 15, 5.12 lakh on September 13, 3.69 lakh on September 14, 3.63 lakh on September 17, 3.17 lakh on September 17, 3.07 lakh on September 18, and 1.50 lakh on September 19.The state also crossed the two-crore inoculation mark last week, vaccinating more than 1.50 crore persons with the first dose.Meanwhile, the virus infection trajectory in Haryana continued its downward journey for the 19th consecutive week. The deadly second wave of the virus transmission during a six-week period in April and May had resulted in over 4.21 lakh infections and over 4,200 fatalities.The decline in infection spread which started in the second week of May has continued since then.Health department statistics show that the state has registered a record low of 88 cases in each of the last two weeks (September 6-12 and September 13-19).

The incident happened close to the Delhi Police headquarters.Five alleged members of the outfit were arrested and a case under the relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 2007, was registered, said deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav.Later in the evening, Hindu Sena chief Vishnu Gupta released a press statement and took the responsibility of the incident by saying that “Hindu Sena workers staged a protest at Owaisi’s house as they were offended by his anti-Hindu statement.”The Hyderabad MP, who was in Lucknow at the time of the alleged vandalism, criticised the incident by saying that similar incidents at his house had taken place during 2015-16 and despite many police complaints nothing has been done to prevent such acts. Owaisi also alleged that the caretaker of the house, Raju, was assaulted by the people involved in the vandalism on Tuesday.“This is not the first time that such vandalism had taken place at my house. During 2015-16, when Rajnath Singh (senior BJP leader and Union defence minister) was my neighbor, such incidents had happened. Several complaints were given but I don’t know why this keeps on happening. We have given another complaint following today’s (Tuesday’s) incident,” said Owaisi over the phone.According to the police, six to seven alleged members of the Hindu Sena reached outside Owaisi’s residence at Ashoka Road and involved in vandalism during their protest. They allegedly broke the MP’s name plate, a tubelight and a window glass. A police team arrived after being informed about the vandalism and they caught five men.In a video released by the Hindu Sena, Lalit Kumar, state president of the group, is seen saying that they have come at the residence of Owaisi to teach him a lesson as he always gives speech against Hindus in his raillies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aimim-chief-asaduddin-owaisi-s-house-in-delhi-vandalised-by-hindu-sena-members-101632251176760.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||Be realistic, more accurate in preparing budget estimates and fund requirements, govt tells depts||New Delhi: Pointing to discrepancies between estimates and actual expenses in previous years, the Delhi government has asked its departments to be more accurate and “realistic” in drawing up their estimates for the annual budget and said inaccurate assessments are often flagged with “adverse comments” during financial audits.In budget circulars issued to departments between August 12 and September 12, the government sought revised estimates for 2021-22 and budget estimates for 2022-23. In the same circular, copies of which HT has seen, the government has sought details on budget estimates, revised estimates and actual expenses for all financial years since 2017-18. They have been asked to specifically classify expenses under “establishment and other committed expenditure”, “government scheme and projects”, and “centrally sponsored schemes”.“Revised estimates and budget estimates should be formulated taking a realistic assessment of the requirement of funds which are to be utilised by the department during the financial year. Some of the discrepancies which have continued to occur in framing budget estimates by the department are given below and it is requested that departments should take utmost care to avoid such recurring discrepancies,” said the official document.The government identified a few areas which recorded discrepancies between estimates and actual expenses. These included salaries, supplementary demand for grants, and centrally sponsored schemes.“There are also cases where the actual expenditure was found either in excess or short of budget provisions. To avoid such situations, it is for the department to have a realistic view of its requirement. The wide variations between the original budget estimates and actual expenditure incurred lead to an obvious conclusion that the departments have not been able to properly anticipate, assess and project a realistic requirement of funds,” said the document.It further said, “Revised estimates and budget estimates of a department means that projections are inclusive of all subordinate offices under their administrative control including the autonomous bodies and grantee institutions... Budget proposals issued directly by any such subordinate offices or grantee institutions will not be entertained.”The Delhi government has around 200 departments in total which include finance, revenue, general administration, services, education, health, excise, water, power, urban department, agriculture, labour, local bodies, transport, environment, art and culture, food and civil supplies, technical institutes, agriculture, irrigation and flood, fire services and home.The Delhi government proposed a budget outlay of ₹ ₹69,000 crore for 2021-22, the highest so far. Of this, around ₹32,000 crore was allocated on revenue expenditure and nearly ₹37, 000 crore on schemes and projects. The highest allocation, of ₹16,377 crore, was on education, followed by ₹9,934 crore on health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/be-realistic-more-accurate-in-preparing-budget-estimates-and-fund-requirements-govt-tells-depts-101632251175744.html
22-09-2021||Other||In show of strength, Rao Inderjit Singh to hold rally in Jhajjar on September 23||Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh, who nurses a dream of becoming Haryana chief minister, will show his strength by organising a Shaheedi Diwas Samaroh outside Ahirwal region in Jhajjar’s Patauda village on September 23 on the martyrdom day of Rao Tularam.This village is also a ‘Ahir-dominated’ village and comes under Jhajjar district, which is considered to be former chief minister Bhupinder Hooda’s stronghold.This time, Rao Inderjit had invited only Haryana BJP chief OP Dhankar in the rally and he will be the chief speaker. Rao Inderjit, a prominent ‘Ahir’ leader from southern Haryana, wields considerable clout in Ahirwal constituencies.Son of former Haryana CM Rao Birender Singh, Inderjit comes from the famed Rampura House, an icon of royalty in dynastic politics of southern Haryana. He is one of the few BJP leaders, who did not face any protest from farmers in the ongoing farm agitation.As many as six MLAs, two ministers in the Haryana government and four MPs will share the stage with Union minister Inderjit Singh in a show of strength.Rao’s loyalist Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh, Sonepat MP Ramesh Kaushik, Rohtak MP Arvind Sharma, Rajya Sabha MP DP Vats, Haryana ministers Banwari Lal, OP Yadav and MLAs loyal to Rao will attend the rally.Haryana cooperation minister Banwari Lal said, “We have started ground-level preparations to make the rally a success.”A legislator loyal to Rao Inderjit, pleading anonymity, said some opponents within the BJP are trying to underestimate Rao Inderjit by inducting newly-appointed Union minister Bhupender Yadav in the Ahirwal region.“Bhupender Yadav selected the route of his Jan Ashirwad Yatra that is being represented by Rao Inderjit and the MLAs opponent to our faction welcomed the newly-appointed minister. The September 23 rally will prove the charisma of Rao Inderjit outside the Ahirwal belt,” the MLA added.On Shaheedi Diwas (September 23) in 2013, the then Congress MP from Gurgaon Rao Inderjit had announced to quit the grand-old party in a Rewari rally while accusing the then Haryana CM Bhupinder Sigh Hooda on the issue of discrimination in terms of development and jobs.Throwing an open challenge to Hooda, Rao Inderjit had dared Hooda to resign from his assembly seat and said he would resign from the Gurgaon parliamentary seat to have a direct battle on the turf of Gurugram (earlier Gurgaon) to prove who enjoys mass support.Retired professor from Bhiwani government college and political commentator, Anant Ram, said Rao Inderjit enjoys dominance in the southern region of the state and there is no leader in Ahirwal region of his stature.“He had also taken key decisions of his political life on the Shaheedi Diwas. He remained at loggerheads with former Congress CMs Bhajan Lal and Bhupinder Singh Hooda. After Bhupender Yadav’s Jan Ashirwad Yatra that passes through the Ahirwal belt, there is some uneasiness in the Rao camp and he has decided to show his strength by holding his rally at Jhajjar’s Patauda village, which is also a Yadav-dominated village but it comes under Hooda’s bastion. This seems to be a pressure tactic on high command by Inderjit to hold a rally without calling any top BJP leader,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-show-of-strength-rao-inderjit-singh-to-hold-rally-in-jhajjar-on-september-23-101632251174688.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||Gurdwara election body disqualifies Manjinder Singh Sirsa from being ‘co-opted’ as DSGMC member||Chandigarh: The directorate of gurdwara election, New Delhi, on Tuesday disqualified former Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa from being chosen as a ‘co-opted’ member of DSGMC. Sirsa lost the DSGMC polls held on August 22, to Shiromani Akali Dal (Delhi) candidate Harvinder Singh Sarna. On August 25, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said that Sirsa will continue as DSGMC president, and that he will be ‘co-opted’ through the quota of Amritsar-headquartered Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). SAD has majority in SGPC. However, Narinder Singh, the director of gurdwara election, said on Tuesday that Sirsa was not eligible for the post. “The undersigned is constrained to deduce that Manjinder Singh Sirsa is not well versed with reading and writing of Gurmukhi and, therefore, does not qualify the eligibility conditions as laid the section 10 of the (DSGMC) Act,” Narinder Singh said in an order on Tuesday. Sirsa said he will challenge the orders in the high court. “The director is working against the interest of my party and me,” Sirsa said, adding that he has done BA (Honours) in Punjabi. “The same directorate has cleared my nominations thrice in the past, and now they say my knowledge of Gurmukhi is limited, which is not acceptable,” he said. Harvinder Singh Sarna has filed a petition in the Dehi high court, seeking Sirsa’s disqualification on the grounds of the alleged lack of his knowledge in Gurmukhi, the script in which Guru Granth Sahib is written. On September 5, the high court ordered the directorate to submit a report by September 21. Sirsa appeared before the directorate to take a test in Gurmukhi on September 17. After the appearing for the test, he said that he recited Gurbani, but refused to write because any inadvertent mistake would amount to sacrilege. The court will next hear the matter on October 15. As per the norms of DSGMC Act 46 elected members of the DSGMC would meet on September 24 again for nomination of two members from among 350 Singh Sabha gurdwaras in the national capital that falls under the jurisdiction of DSGMC. Other than that, four members from the clergy would also be nominated taking the total strength of the house to 55. In the house one member is reserved to be coopted from SGPC. After Sirsa’s disqualification the directorate has written to the SGPC to send a fresh name for cooption, before September 24. Meanwhile, two members, SAD (Delhi) president Paramjit Singh Sarna, and Vikram Singh Rohini, belonging to the Badals-led SAD were co-opted in the last meeting on September 9, when Sirsa’s nomination was put on a hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gurdwara-election-body-disqualifies-manjinder-singh-sirsa-from-being-co-opted-as-dsgmcmember-101632251054730.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||CBSE announces board exam fee exemption for students who lost their parents during Covid pandemic||New Delhi: The Central Board of Secondary Education on Tuesday announced a one-time exemption of examination and registration fee for those students who lost both their parents to Covid-19 or the surviving parent. “The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the country adversely and keeping in view of its impact on students, CBSE as a special measure for academic session 2021-22, has decided that neither the examination fees nor the registration fees will be charged by the board from the students who have lost both parents, or surviving parent, or legal guardian/adoptive parents due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said a circular signed by Controller of Examination Sanyam Bhardwaj.Students who have lost one of their parents will not be eligible for the exemption. The board also asked CBSE-affiliated schools to submit the details of such students after verifying the cases. Students are required to submit the fee before September 30 – which is the last date for schools to submit their list of Class 10 and 12 candidates to the board. A majority of schools in Delhi are affiliated to CBSE, including the 1,030 Delhi government schools. In 2019, CBSE hiked the board examination fee for Class 10 and 12 students in the general category in Delhi government schools from ₹375 and ₹600, respectively, to ₹1,500 for five subjects. For Class 12 students, the fee can go up to ₹2,500, including the extra amount for practicals, additional and optional subjects.For SC/ST candidates in Class 10, the examination fee was increased from ₹375 to ₹1,200 and for Class 12, from ₹600 to ₹1,200 in Delhi government and government-aided schools. Before 2019, students from the SC/ST category were charged ₹50 and the remainder used to be reimbursed by the government to the board. Now, they have to pay the full fee.Following the 2019 hike, the Delhi government paid the fee for over 314,000 Class 10 and 12 students in government schools that year, but it did not pay the fee last year citing fund crunch. This year, the All India Parents Association has been campaigning and asking state authorities to bear the costs.Officials from the Delhi government and in the education department did not comment on the matter.Principals HT spoke to said the decision will definitely help those students who have lost their parents, but added that several others whose parents were facing financial crisis due to the pandemic will not benefit from it. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Sector-8 Rohini, said, “We have several students whose parents have lost livelihood during the pandemic and they are struggling to arrange for two square meals. It is difficult for them to arrange the board fee especially for those families that have more than one of their children in Class 10 or 12. We have planned to arrange the fee for at least 100 of our 500 board students. Affluent people across the city should meet government school principals and help such students.”Several other government school principals in Dwarka, Najagfarh, Okhla, Mayur Vihar, Dallupura, Seelampur, and Sangam Vihar also expressed similar concerns. Dallupura resident Sunita Chaudhary, a domestic worker whose daughter studies in a nearby government school in Class 10, said she lost work during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The numbers of houses where I worked were almost halved due to the pandemic. I have three children to feed, and need some money for their education as well. Though my husband is an auto driver, he doesn’t contribute much to the household income. Arranging for ₹1,800 is not easy for me,” she said.Last year too, HT reported that doctors, book publishers, grocery store owners, and members of residents’ welfare associations helped schools pay the board exam fee of students in many government schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cbseannounces-board-exam-fee-exemption-for-students-who-lost-their-parents-during-covid-pandemic-101632250935083.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||From 2022, not separating household waste will invite fines in east Delhi||From next year, residents of east Delhi will have to pay a penalty if they do not segregate their household waste into the three mandated categories of non-biodegradable (dry waste), biodegradable (wet waste) and domestic hazardous waste. For commercial institutions, however, the penalties for the same will start from November 1, 2021, said an order by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Tuesday.According to civic officials, the penalty ranges from ₹200 (for individual households) to ₹10,000 (for gated communities) and ₹20,000 (for market associations). The penalties will be imposed by the civic body under the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016, and the by-laws under its jurisdiction.As per the order, commercial outlets such as marriage halls, party lawns, banquet halls, exhibition and fares, with area less than 5000 square metres (sqm), the penalty will be ₹10,000. For cinema halls, pubs, community halls with an area less than 5000 sqm, the fine shall be ₹5,000. For hotels, the penalty will be ₹50,000 and for restaurants, it will be ₹20,000.“A month’s time will be given to all categories of establishments, including residential, to comply with the rules. Door to door collection of waste has already been started in the area. We have been carrying out awareness drives for the same. Also, we have been holding meetings with the stakeholders, including resident bodies and market associations, to make them aware of the significance of segregating waste and opting for different alternatives such as composting of wet waste to reduce the overall waste generated,” said a senior corporation official, who asked not to be named.The order, dated September 21, stated: “Mandatory segregation of solid waste at source will come into implementation --- for commercial, industrial, institutional and non- residential premises -- from October 2 while for residential premises it will start from December 1 this year. The levying of penalty on defaulters in the commercial category will start from November 1 this year while for residential category; it will begin from January 1, 2022.” As per the SWM Rules, it is necessary for all waste generators to segregate and store solid waste in three categories --- non-biodegradable or dry waste; biodegradable or wet waste and domestic hazardous waste. Those not complying with the rules are liable for levying fines/penalties. “The penalties vary for different categories. For instance, for individual households, the amount of waste generated is less and hence the penalty levied is lesser. In the case of group housing societies and market associations, which are bulk waste generators, the penalties will be much higher,” the official quoted above said.EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, however, said he has not seen the order yet and that he is not in favour of the decision. “I have yet to see the order. We need to educate people and make them aware of how they can segregate waste and provide different alternatives for the same before we can think of levying penalties. There are a number of resettlement colonies and other such areas where people need to be provided with a mechanism to segregate waste,” he said.Resident associations in east Delhi, too, are against the civic body’s decision of levying penalty without providing a framework.“We are ready to segregate waste and are doing it even now. However, there is no point doing it till the waste is also collected in a segregated manner. So far, the waste collector dumps the entire waste in the same vehicle without segregating it. So the civic body has to first ready its own mechanism for segregation before penalising people,” said Shivaji Samaddar, president, Samachar group housing society, Mayur Vihar Phase-I.BS Vohra, president, East Delhi RWAs Federation, said imposing a penalty is just not right. “The civic body is ready to levy fines on people without even holding a discussion with the residents. They first need to provide adequate services. When there is waterlogging in the streets and potholes, there is no penalty imposed on the civic body for inconveniencing residents,” said Vohra.So far, EDMC is the first municipal corporation to issue an order to this effect. The south and north corporations have not imposed any penalties for non-segregation of waste. While the South corporation had last year started levying user charges for collection and transportation of waste and even issued notices to households for not complying with the segregation, the order was withdrawn after resident groups opposed it.The east corporation had started levying user charges on commercial institutions from this July while residences are still exempted from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-2022-not-separating-household-waste-will-invite-fines-in-east-delhi-101632250814807.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi court rejects plea to hold day-to-day trial in Dalit girl rape-murder case||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Tuesday rejected the city police’s plea for holding day-to-day trial in the alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old Dalit girl at a crematorium near Delhi Cantonment, saying that there is huge pendency of crime against children cases.Additional sessions judge Ashutosh Kumar dismissed a plea by the police seeking expeditious hearing in the matter. The judge said that he has 620 pending cases under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012 in his court, including the present one, and several accused are languishing in jail pending trial.“In view of the huge pendency before this court and the submissions of the defence counsel that they have to attend their other matters, day-to-day hearing will not be possible in this case. However, this court shall expeditiously hear the case,” the judge said.The girl, from a Dalit family in a village near Delhi cantonment, was found dead by her parents in a local crematorium earlier this month. The accused — a 55-year-old priest and his three associates — say the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from a cooler but the family alleges that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after raping her. The four accused are in jail.On August 28, police filed a charge sheet against the four accused—Radhey Shyam, Kuldeep Singh, Salim Ahmed and Laxmi Narayan--for rape, wrongful confinement, murder, destruction of evidence, and under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Prevention of Atrocities Act. On Tuesday, additional public prosecutor Yadvinder Singh, appearing for the police, said fast tracking the case will bring justice to the victim’s family.However, this was opposed by Radhey Shyam’s counsel, LK Verma, who contended that the arguments on charge can only begin after the police submit evidence of rape of the minor girl in their supplementary charge sheet.“There are so many Pocso cases. Why is the police trying to fast track this case only? The charge sheet was filed within a month and evidence of rape is yet to be proved by them. The accused in this case deserve a fair trial too, one which is not hurried,” he argued, adding that he had other cases to look into and he cannot devote his time only on a single case.Verma, also moved an application in the court, seeking protection for his client who was being assaulted by the co-inmates in the prison as well as the jail van. The application also said that there was danger to Shyam’s life because he is being threatened to life by the inmates.“Life of the applicant (Shyam) is in danger as some of the co-prisoners used to beat him in jail as well while traveling to the court on a police van during the proceedings of the case and are regularly being threatened to kill,” it alleged.The court issued notice to the concerned DCP and jail authorities on the plea and posted it for consideration on September 29, the date already fixed. It also sought the response of the police on the plea by Shyam seeking the CCTV footage of August 1 and the coloured photographs of the incident of crime, annexed in the charge sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-rejects-plea-to-hold-day-to-day-trial-in-dalit-girl-rape-murder-case-101632250697020.html

22-09-2021||Delhi||Children must be taught to become job givers, not job seekers: Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said in order to boost business enterprises in the country, children must be taught to become “job givers” and not “job seekers”, “If our students only run in the direction of jobs in the corporate or IT sector, then who will create jobs in the country? Who will give an upward push to the economy of the country?” the minister said, while speaking at the opening session of a two-day commerce festival organised by the state industries department, in collaboration with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).Sisodia also said the increase in India’s exports -- from $1.7 billion to $300 billion in 75 years -- is not remarkable and blamed the “mentality” of policy makers and “the system” for the slow progress. “The country’s system is so indifferent to trade that when we first made computers, there was no change in the law for its export for five-six years and India was exporting computers as typewriters for all those years. The sad reality is that students in our country are studying with a mindset to grab jobs as soon as they complete their graduation. Students are brainwashed to become job seekers instead of job providers. Do we want our kids to just become a small part of a big corporate company one day or should we prepare them to take risks like an entrepreneur and become change-makers of society?” Sisodia said. The deputy chief minister also said government software systems are flawed and are resistant to reforms. “You try to do something, make it better and it immediately shows an error. This problem needs to be immediately rectified. This is the reason why it took seven years for the country’s first computer to be exported as a computer and not as typewriters. Also, if laws are made on the assumption that the traders are working with the aim to steal, then this will only lead to the creation of a negative mindset among businessmen. This needs to be immediately changed or else only the export data will increase but the reality will remain the same,” he said. Industries minister Satyendar Jain said, “Delhi is the biggest exporter of skilled man force across the globe. Most Indian doctors and engineers working abroad are from Delhi. It tells a lot about the potential of Delhi as a state. This is evident from the export business turnover of up to $10 billion. The government should focus on doing the job of an enabler. The export business in Delhi requires quite a lot of space and this space cannot be created within the city all of a sudden,” he said. Jain added that 30 years ago, a policy of decentralisation of services was formulated, and at that time, thousands of people travelled from one place to another within Delhi, now that figure has gone up by lakhs. All governments should remove restrictions from export industries, and let businesses prosper and grow, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/children-must-be-taught-to-become-job-givers-not-job-seekers-delhi-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia-101632250574787.html
22-09-2021||Delhi||Centre gets time to respond to Delhi Waqf Board plea to preserve heritage properties that are likely to be affected due to Central Vista revamp||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court Tuesday granted time to the Centre to respond to a plea by Delhi Waqf Board seeking the preservation and protection of its heritage properties that are likely to be affected by the ongoing Central Vista Redevelopment Project.Solicitor Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva that he would take instructions on the Board’s petition in a week’s time following which, the court posted the matter for September 29.In its plea, the board has sought the preservation and protection of six of its properties in the area within which the redevelopment work was ongoing, namely Masjid Zabta Ganj at Mansingh Road, Jama Masjid at Red Cross Road, Masjid Sunehri Bagh Road Near Udyog Bhawan, Mazar Sunehri Bagh Road behind Moti Lal Nehru Marg, Masjid Krishi Bhawan inside Krishi Bhawan Compound and Masjid Vice President at the official residence of the Vice President of India.Appearing for the Delhi Waqf Board, senior advocate Sanjoy Ghose, urged the court that an assurance be given by the SG with respect to the protection of the properties till then.The judge, however, said that such an assurance would be an “indirect stay” on the ongoing work.“Why should he give an assurance? This is an indirect stay. The project is continuing in a particular fashion. There is a timeline. They would have taken it (the structures) into account,” the court said adding that a stay on the project has already been refused by the Supreme Court and the high court.Ghose responded that they do not intend to impede the ongoing project but merely sought a “clarification that the government would honour the integrity of these places of worship.”He said that one of the structures even housed the remains of Dr Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, the fifth President of India and the father of former high court judge Badar Durez Ahmed.“The waqf properties, subject matter of the present petition, are all more than 100 years old and are continuously being used for religious purpose. It is not the case that the Government Buildings were built first and thereafter these properties came into existence, to the contrary, these properties were well in existence when the Government buildings were constructed around them or in the vicinity,” said the petition filed through lawyer Wajeeh Shafiq.Claiming that the six properties “are more than an ordinary mosque and have a distinction attached to them”, the petition states that neither the British government nor the government of India ever created any hindrance in the observance of religious practices at these properties which were always preserved.“The British Crown transferred few of these properties to the predecessors of the petitioner by way of registered agreements; these waqf properties were also spared when Government buildings were constructed around them or in their immediate vicinity, few of these waqf properties were also withdrawn from the acquisition and their title was allowed to revert to the petitioner,” the plea added.It said that the representations sent by the board seeking assurance about the properties have not been responded to in spite of the expiry of over two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-gets-time-to-respond-to-delhi-waqf-board-plea-to-preserve-heritage-properties-that-are-likely-to-be-affected-due-to-central-vista-revamp-101632250514604.html

She added that the Centre has not acted despite the Supreme Court directing it to do so. Rajoana’s sister Kamaldeep Kaur had visited the SGPC headquarters to meet the president; she requested the SGPC chief to take up the issue, at which the chief said the gurdwara management body would write to the Union home minister in this regard. “The government is pursuing a policy of evasion in this matter, despite the apex court’s clear instructions. Rajoana’s name was among the eight prisoners to whom the Indian government had announced a relaxation in imprisonment on Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary. Under this decision, Rajoana’s sentence was commuted to life. The government has not implemented its own decision,” the SGPC chief added. “On January 25, 2021, the SC issued orders to the government to take a decision within two weeks. On its appeal, another six weeks were granted to the government, effectively mandating a decision by March 26, 2021. To date, no decision has been taken,” she added. SGPC members Gurcharan Singh Grewal, Gurbakhsh Singh Khalsa and others were present, as the chief met Rajoana’s sister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/take-early-decision-on-mercy-plea-of-rajoana-sgpc-chief-to-centre-101632250460293.html

22-09-2021||Delhi||Bodies of Kyrgyz woman and her one year old son found in Kalkaji flat||New Delhi: The bodies of a 28-year-old pregnant woman from Kyrgyzstan and her 13-month-old son, with multiple stab wounds, were found on Tuesday morning at her friend’s flat in south Delhi’s Kalkaji, police said, and added that a kitchen knife purportedly used in the crime was also recovered from the crime scene. Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said the victim, Myskal Zhumabaeva, had gone to her friend’s house on Monday evening after an alleged argument with her husband, Vinay Chauhan, an Indian citizen. She stayed there for the night, he said. Chauhan had gone to her friend, Wahid’s, house in South Extension after the argument, and was present there at the time of alleged murders, the police said. He added that Myskal’s friend, Matluba Madusmonov, an Uzbek citizen, was present inside the flat with her Indian friend, Avnish, and at least two others, when the incident took place between 8am and 9am on Tuesday. The DCP said though they have registered a case of murder at the Kalkaji police station, the police were also investigating if Myskal murdered her son and then killed herself. “All possibilities are being thoroughly probed, considering the circumstances of the cases,” the DCP said. Police officers investigating the case said there were at least five stab wounds on Myskal’s body, and three on the body of the boy. DCP Meena said that Matluba, Avnish and the two others were being questioned. He said they have told the police in their initial statements that they were in another other room, and have no idea how Myskal and her son died. They were the first to see the bodies. They have claimed that Myskal’s room was shut from inside, and they had to use force to open it. They told the police that they informed Chauhan about the death of his wife and son. It was Chauhan who called the police, the DCP said.“We are verifying the statements of the four people who were present in the flat. None of them has been given a clean chit. We have established that the knife used in the crime came from the flat’s kitchen. As Chauhan was not present at the crime scene, his involvement is unlikely at least according to the circumstances of the case. However, we are also investigating him,” DCP Meena said. He said Myskal and Chauhan lived in a rented flat in Greater Kailash Part-2. Police said the crime was reported around 10am, when Chauhan called up the police control room. A police team that reached the Kalkaji flat found the two bodies on the bed. The bodies were shifted to the mortuary at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) where a post-mortem examination will be conducted on Wednesday by a panel of doctors. The Delhi Police have already requested the Delhi government to constitute the doctors’ panel.Preliminary investigation has shown that Myskal met Chauhan on a social networking site, and they got married around two and a half years ago. She was two months pregnant and often required visits to hospital, investigators said.On Monday evening, Myskal asked Chauhan to take her to a maternity hospital since she had pain. Chauhan suggested that they should visit any nearby clinic. An argument began after which Chauhan left home, saying that he was going to his friend’s place, the officer said quoting statements of the family’s friends. After Chauhan left, Msykal called Matluba and asked her to take her to a hospital. Matluba and Avnish took Myskal to a hospital and brought her to Matluba’s flat in Kalkaji, where their two friends were already present, the investigator said.“What happened after they reached the flat and when the bodies were found is a matter of probe. We are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the flat’s neighbourhood to ascertain if anybody else visited the flat during that period,” the investigator said, adding that Chauhan owns as guest house but could not tell the location.Matluba’s immediate neighbour, an elderly woman who did not want to be named, said that she did not know about the incident until she stepped out in the morning to see a huge crowd and police gathered outside her house. “We barely saw this couple outside. They did not even mingle or interact with anyone here, and had shifted here just two months ago. Usually all the tenants leave in less than a month,” she said.The police have learnt that Matluba shifted to Kalkaji four months ago. They were trying to find out when did she came to India, and her purpose of staying in the country. They were also ascertaining details of Myskal’s status of stay in India, and if she had applied for Indian citizenship or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bodies-of-kyrgyz-woman-and-her-one-year-old-son-found-in-kalkaji-flat-101632250274693.html

Giri was the president of the Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) and mahant of Bade Hanuman temple of Prayagraj. The letter petition was filed at midnight by Sunil Choudhary, a lawyer by profession in which a request has been made to treat the letter as a public interest litigation (PIL). Choudhary has also demanded that the probe be transferred to CBI and has sought the suspension of the district magistrate and senior superintendent of police (SSP), Prayagraj. It his letter, Choudhary claimed he was informed by some ‘residents of Baghambari gaddi’ that reason behind the incident was huge amount of financial misappropriation. Citing some news portals, Choudhary also alleged involvement of a top cop and a land shark in the case. The letter further stated the ABAP president was provided security by state government and raises the question about “how such an incident was possible in the presence of huge number of disciples and security.” Giri was found hanging from a ceiling fan by a rope, officials said. A purported suicide note was found from ABAP president’s room in which mahant’s disciple, Anand Giri, and two others were held responsible for the extreme step, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lawyer-urges-high-court-to-order-cbi-probe-into-abap-chief-s-death-101632250214728.html

22-09-2021||Delhi||Parts of Delhi get light showers; patchy rain to continue through week, says IMD||After the past few days of sweltering heat, parts of Delhi on Tuesday received light rain much to the relief of capital’s residents. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials, light to moderate showers are likely to continue in Delhi over the next two days and while the intensity might reduce after that, the capital will receive patchy rain throughout the week. The IMD recordings show that on Tuesday, Delhi’s Safdarjung weather station, which is taken as representational for the entire city, received 3.6mm of rain, while Lodi Road received 1mm of rain. The observatory in Ridge reported 17.6mm rain, according to IMD data. The maximum temperature in Delhi on Tuesday was 35.6 degrees Celsius, a notch above what is considered normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 25.8 degrees Celsius .“Most parts of Delhi will receive light to moderate rain over the next two days. After that, the intensity of showers is expected to reduce and the patchy rain will continue through the week,” said a senior Met official, asking not to be named. Delhi this year has been witnessing an erratic monsoon, with several records -- highest single-day, monthly and seasonal rainfall -- being broken. Despite a late start to monsoon, it is turning out to be one of the wettest seasons the city has ever seen. IMD data shows that between June 1 and September 21, Delhi received 1,161.1mm rainfall, as opposed to the seasonal normal of 624.3mm rainfall, a departure of 86% towards surplus. The all-time record for the wettest monsoon is 1,420.3mm rainfall, in 1933. Forecasters said this year, Delhi is likely to see a late withdrawal of monsoon, just as it did in 2019. “The current conditions indicate that the monsoon is likely to stay at least till the first week of October. It is possible that the withdrawal this year, just like in 2019, will be late,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather Services, a private weather forecasting agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/parts-of-delhi-get-light-showers-patchy-rain-to-continue-through-week-says-imd-101632249735957.html

While rejecting the bail plea, single judge Justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava said that it was evident that the accused/applicants had prior information regarding the police raid, and they ‘evidently’ revealed it to gangster. “There are policemen, maybe very few in numbers, who show their loyalty more to such gangsters than to their department for reasons best known to them,” the HC observed. The act of the accused alerted the gangsters and eventually led to a shootout in which 8 police personnel lost their lives. Dubey too was later killed in police encounter. Tiwari and another policeman were arrested in 2020 on charges of allegedly leaking information on police action to Dubey. An FIR was registered after the incident under sections 147, 148, 504, 323, 364, 342 and 307 of Indian Penal Code and section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932 at Chaubeypur police station of Kanpur Nagar. Tiwari’s counsel submitted that there was only some “scattered” evidence against the accused applicants. UP government’s counsel countered that role of Sharma was evident since he was regularly in touch with Vikas Dubey and his gang and through him SO Vinay Tiwari was also in his touch. “The police force faces some real difficulty in combating organised crime and criminal activities. The police personnel are mostly not provided with that kind of sophisticated arms which are available in plenty to the gangsters and their gang members. The police stations are mostly under-manned and the strength of police force is remarkably less in comparison to the population,” the HC order read. The court also said that there is a concerning trend of political parties welcoming gangsters and criminals involved in organised crime in the party. The parties try to back and protect such gangsters, painting and spreading an imaginary image of Robinhood, the Court observed. “They are given tickets to contest elections and sometimes they win also. This trend needs to be stopped as soon as possible. All the political parties should sit and together a decision is required to be taken by them that gangsters and criminals will be discouraged in politics and no political party will give ticket to them in elections,” the HC emphasised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bikru-case-hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-cops-accused-of-leaking-info-on-police-action-to-gangster-101632249617151.html
22-09-2021||Kolkata||Mamata’s mosque visit insult to Islam, says Bengal BJP’s new boss; cleric rebuts||KOLKATA: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Bengal unit’s president, Sukanta Majumdar, 41, on Tuesday accused the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) of imposing a Taliban-like regime in the state, hailed his predecessor Dilip Ghosh as the most successful state president in the party’s national history and gave a call to move ahead as a team comprising the youth and veterans.A day after being appointed as state president, Majumdar, the Bengal unit’s youngest chief, also alleged that many Hindu supporters of the BJP were killed by members of a minority community during post-poll violence. He did not name the community.“This was never Bengal’s culture though political clashes are not new. It is also a fact that minority community members of the BJP have also been attacked. Sadly, Bengal’s intellectuals have not said a word. They prefer enjoying champagne in the evening,” said Sukanta Majumdar, a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) member who entered electoral politics in 2019 when he contested and won the Balurghat Lok sabha seat in north Bengal.Addressing party leaders and the media at the BJP state office in West Bengal capital Kolkata, Majumdar said, “Talibanisation does not mean some people in long garbs going around with guns. Killing people who practice a different ideology or follow a rival party is real Talibanisation.”“We saw it when a young man and even his pet dog were killed on the streets of Kolkata,” said Majumdar, referring to the murder of BJP worker Abhijit Sarkar in the city’s Narkeldanga area on May 2 when the assembly poll results were announced. The case is being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation.“We will oust Mamata Banerjee’s Taliban government at any cost. Even if we consider for argument’s sake that TMC can win all 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal in 2024, Narendra Modi will still become the Prime Minister. The TMC’s dream will never come true. Today, I promise to give the BJP more than 18 Lok Sabha seats in the next polls,” said Sukanta Majumdar.The state BJP leadership, the party’s national deputy observer for Bengal, Amit Malviya, and three former state presidents, Ashim Ghosh, Tathagata Roy and Rahul Sinha, attended the programme held to felicitate Majumdar and Ghosh, who is now a national vice-president.The only prominent face missing at the event was Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the assembly.Majumdar said: “There is no need to speculate. Adhikari is holding a campaign rally at Jangipur in Murshidabad district. I was supposed to be there today but last evening, our national general secretary B L Santhosh called me to say that I have to take up a new responsibility. He did specify what it was. The announcement was made late in the evening.”Assembly elections in Jangipur and Samserganj in Murshidabad could not be held in March-April as the TMC candidates fielded from these seats died of Covid-19. Both seats will go to the polls on September 30 along with Kolkata’s Bhawanipore from where Mamata Banerjee is contesting.“Our strategy for Bhawanipore is working well. TMC bigwigs who earlier ridiculed our candidate Priyanka Tibrewal are now getting irritated on hearing her name. Mamata Banerjee is campaigning every day. She recently visited a mosque. Islam does not permit women to enter mosques. I see this as an insult to Islam,” said Majumdar.Md Yahiya, chairman of the West Bengal Imams Association, promptly rebutted Majumdar.“The Quran does not say anywhere that women cannot enter mosques. The Prophet never said it. The BJP leader is absolutely wrong. Moreover, a mosque’s committee decides who will be given entry. It is not the prerogative of a party like the BJP,” Md Yahiya said, in response to a question by HT.Asked what he thought of Dilip Ghosh’s 2019 remark that Indian cow milk contains gold, Majumdar, a professor with a doctoral degree in botany, said, “Dilip Da (elder brother) said this because a scientific paper published at that time said elements of gold were found in the milk of Indian cows. A plant called Equisetum grows in areas that have gold deposits. It does not mean Equisetum can produce gold.”Though found in the wild in many countries, some varieties of Equisetum grow in parts of the US and Alaska where the ground is mineralized with metals such as copper, gold and zinc, according to some research papers.Majumdar also heaped praises at Ghosh, who sat next to him at the Press conference.“He (Dilip Ghosh) is the most successful state president. Under his leadership, the number of BJP MLAs rose from three to 77 and we won 18 Lok Sabha seats. This will be etched in gold in the BJP’s national history. Even ministers in other states long to hear his speech. Bengal BJP leaders never reached the national level because they could not speak Hindi fluently. Dilip Da has been chosen for a national role because he is an exception. But we will urge the party to ensure that he spends the maximum time in Bengal.”Admitting that the state unit is going through a bad phase because of an exodus of BJP leaders to TMC, Majumdar said, “Failure in any election demoralises party workers. There is nothing new about it. Those who believe in ideology will stay. They are in majority. The deserters should evaluate their decision.”“We made some strategic mistakes. Those are being analyzed,” he said.TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy promptly hit back at the Taliban barb. “The Talibanisaton he is talking about can be seen in BJP-ruled states. Majumdar should check the facts first,” the TMC leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/a-taliban-like-regime-bengal-bjp-s-new-boss-takes-a-swipe-at-mamata-banerjee-101632249616005.html
22-09-2021||Other||70% households in Uttar Pradesh use LPG as primary cooking fuel: CEEW||LUCKNOW More than 70% of the households in Uttar Pradesh (UP) use LPG as their primary cooking fuel and 85% have LPG connections, according to a recent independent study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). However, 54% of households continue to use solid fuels, either exclusively or by stacking them with LPG. These findings are based on data collected from over 1,500 households in 16 districts of the state. Using solid fuels such as firewood, dung cakes, agriculture residue, and charcoal for cooking increases exposure to indoor air pollution in such households. Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched Ujjwala 2.0, aimed at providing free LPG connections to 1 crore poor and migrant families in the country. CEEW senior programme lead Shalu Agrawal said, “The government deserves credit for its efforts to expand clean cooking energy access, primarily through the first phase of Ujjwala. But 15% of households in the state still lack LPG connections. Phase II of Ujjwala should focus on bridging the coverage gap through targeted beneficiary identification, improved enrolment processes, and awareness campaigns.” “Districts like Etawah, Mahoba, and Mainpuri, where LPG penetration is especially low, deserve particular attention. Further, policymakers should prioritise reinstating LPG refill subsidies to wean consumers away from solid fuels, which disproportionately impact the health of women and children,” Agrawal added. CEEW’s findings are from the India Residential Energy Survey (IRES) 2020, conducted in collaboration with the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy (ISEP). The findings indicated that LPG coverage in UP is better than Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal— but poorer than 13 other IRES states. The CEEW study also highlighted that LPG coverage is particularly low in districts like Etawah, Mahoba, Mainpuri, Pratapgarh and Sultanpur. Further, around one-fourth of households in these five districts use only solid fuels for cooking. The CEEW study highlighted that 93% of UP households, which use solid fuels along with LPG, cite high cylinder costs as one of their reasons for stacking fuels. This finding is significant in the context of the ongoing surge in LPG prices, which have risen by Rs240 per cylinder (a 40% hike) over the past one year. Lower household incomes during the pandemic and the suspension of LPG subsidies in May 2020 have made cooking gas unaffordable for a section of the population. Other reasons for fuel stacking including a preference for cooking on chulhas, the availability of free biomass, and the limited availability of LPG refills. The CEEW study recommends incentivising rural distributors to improve home delivery of LPG. This is particularly important in UP, where only 28% of rural LPG-using households have cylinders delivered at home. For rural households in Basti, Pratapgarh, Sitapur, and Sultanpur districts, this number falls to less than 10 per cent. Sunil Mani, Programme Associate, CEEW, and lead author of the study, said, “Given the high social costs of using solid fuels for cooking, we must strive to make LPG affordable and accessible through timely home delivery. The government should consider diverse strategies to disburse subsidies to deserving households.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/70-households-in-uttar-pradesh-use-lpg-as-primary-cooking-fuel-ceew-101632249614737.html

Measures must be carried out to foil the reoccurrence of such incidents in future,” said GSTA in the letter. The association also sought that the teacher who was attacked be considered on duty till he recovers completely.Vikrant (who goes by his first name), a teacher at Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Baprola, was attacked with an iron rod by a student on school premises during school hours last Saturday. The 21-year-old student, who had failed twice, was arrested, while the teacher is being treated. Deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parminder Singh said that a case had been registered at Ranhola police station. “The teacher was sitting in the staffroom along with his colleague, when the student, Lalit, attacked him with an iron pipe and injured him,” said Singh.In the letter, the GSTA also pointed out that this was not the first time that a teacher had been attacked. The association wrote that another teacher at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Nangloi, was allegedly killed by his students in 2016.Anju Kumar Ahlawat, district secretary (West B), GSTA, said that teachers needed to be reassured that they will not be attacked as they impart their duties. Ahlawat said that the Delhi government could deploy police personnel for the safety of students and teachers just like it had provided marshals in DTC buses. “Teachers need assurance that they will not be harmed or attacked while doing their job. The government can depute police personnel or security guards along the lines of marshals in buses. These incidents will reduce drastically if security personnel are deployed within schools,” said Ahlawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-school-teachers-body-calls-for-action-against-class-11-student-who-attacked-teacher-101632249555422.html

The move comes after several complaints from residents of the Arun Vihar locality which is opposite Sector 29.According to authority officials, the action was taken after some vendors refused to shift to a separate vending zone that has been created in the nearby area of Sector 37. Brahmaputra Market is one of the oldest and famous market complexes in the city.“There are 101 registered roadside vendors in the sector, including those who set up their stalls in Brahmaputra Market. These vendors were repeatedly being asked to move to the vending zone. However, only 25 of the registered vendors supported the decision, and the rest were staying put at the market illegally,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty, Noida authority.Last week, the authority had proposed to set up a vending zone along Arun Vihar locality’s entry gates in Sector 37 which was opposed by the Arun Vihar Residents’ Welfare Association (AVRWA) citing security and sanitation concerns. After the protest, the vending zone was shifted towards the post office along the T-junction of the Ambedkar Market in Sector 37.“The Noida authority has created a separate zone for the vendors to set up their stalls/shops in a legal and organised manner. By setting up their shops at the Brahmaputra Market on the space meant for pedestrians, the vendors not only create nuisance but also deface the market,” said Colonel (retired) IP Singh, chairman of AVRWA.The residential area in Arun Vihar majorly houses retired armed forces personnel.Colonel (retired) UB Singh, ward director of Ward 6A, said, “As the authority officials have removed the encroachment from Brahmaputra Market, the RWA will ensure that the illegal vendors do not return.”Meanwhile, SK Gupta, president of Rehri Patri Sanchalak Welfare Association, said that the vendors at Brahmaputra Market have been given licences to shift to the vending zone. “We encourage all street vendors in Noida to follow the rules and set up their shops legally. At the Brahmaputra Market too, the authority officials have given licences to the vendors so they can shift to the new vending zone. However, some of them are still resisting the move. We will talk to them and try to resolve the issues,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-removes-illegal-vendors-from-brahmaputra-market-101632249554174.html

The five locations identified by the civic body include the old bus stand, civil courts, Turab Nagar market, tehsil complex at Gandhi Nagar and corporation headquarters.The project cost is pegged at ₹50 lakh per annum with 48 different access points at the five locations. The officials said that the decision to provide free Wi-Fi service in these areas was taken after directions from the Uttar Pradesh government.“The locations were selected by a team of our officials and all the places have high footfall. It is estimated that more than one lakh people per day visit these areas. Now, a proposal will be put forward in our upcoming meeting of the executive committee to get the financial approval,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.“The work will be awarded thereafter, and the project is expected to get implemented in the next one month,” he added.The state administration on September 10 this year issued a government order in which the municipal corporations across the state were directed to choose places having high movement of public for the free Wi-Fi service.The Turab Nagar market association has welcomed the corporation’s initiative.“Our market is about 30 years old, and about 20,000 customers visit here every day. It is still without a Wi-Fi facility. If the municipal corporation provides free Wi-Fi, it will be a boost for shop owners too. Normally, there is a network issue in our market. The new facility will really helpful to both the shop owners and customers,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairperson of Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal.Officials of the UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) said that the daily passenger footfall at the old bus stand, from where around 100 buses depart every day, is about 25,000-35,000. “The decision by the corporation to provide free Wi-Fi is a welcome step. We will urge the corporation officials to install the facility at ISBT Kaushambi too, which has a higher footfall of about 40,000 passengers, and both bus stations will soon be linked through the electric bus service,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-body-to-provide-free-wi-fi-at-five-locations-101632249434012.html

It has been given the task of framing the syllabi with respect to the new interdisciplinary courses that are part of the undergraduate course programme approved by the university’s academic and executive councils in August this year. “The NEP Interdisciplinary Course Committee is empowered to constitute Interdisciplinary Sub-committees/Working Groups for assisting the committee in framing the syllabi for the NEP Interdisciplinary Courses, comprising of teachers of the Departments, Centres and Colleges of the university,” the university’s registrar said in a notification issued on Monday. From the next academic session, DU students will get the chance to opt for a three-year Honours programme or a four-year Honours in a discipline or four-year Honours in a discipline with research. In addition to the courses that exist in the current honours programme, the new programme shall include a number of additional courses in the first three years of the programme. These courses will focus on social and emotional learning, innovation and entrepreneurship, extracurricular activities, ethics and culture and multidisciplinary research. SP Aggarwal, principal, Ramanujan College, and member of the committee, said that the committee will frame the syllabus for the new interdisciplinary courses that are being introduced as part of the four-year undergraduate programme. “We need to frame the syllabus and outline how the curriculum will be taught. These papers are practical papers, and we will strive to incorporate innovative teaching practices. We want to ensure that students develop a basic understanding of the paper as well as the practical application of the knowledge,” said Aggarwal. He said that the committee will meet in the coming days and added that details on the roadmap for syllabus framing will emerge after that. Anju Srivastava, the principal of the Hindu College who is also a part of the newly constituted committee, said that while it was too early to comment on the processes that will be taken in the coming days, the committee will ensure that the exercise is undertaken carefully while prioritising the interests of the students. “I have been on the NEP implementation committee. Discussions on interdisciplinary courses have taken place in the past as well. While we have not had any meetings with the interdisciplinary course committee till now, we are aware that these are pertinent issues. We will have to do a lot of work to ensure that the courses are interdisciplinary, particularly, keeping in mind the interests of students who will be opting for these courses out of interest,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-university-constitutes-nep-committee-for-framing-syllabi-101632249375194.html

Police have found a suicide note from the room, but his family alleged foul play due to domestic disturbances.According to police, when the man’s wife went inside the room on Monday night to call him for dinner, she found him hanging from the ceiling fan. She raised an alarm, and officials of the local residents’ welfare association (RWA) made a call to the Sector 24 police station, and a police team took the man to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead.“In the suicide note recovered from the room, the man apologised to his parents, saying he had lost the money he invested in cryptocurrency, and that is why he took his life as he was facing a financial crisis,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police (zone 1).Police also found a ledger in the house which showed that the man had borrowed at least ₹6 lakh from some lenders for some investment.The man’s family, however, suspect a foul play in the case of his death.“Autopsy results confirmed death due to hanging, and prima facie there is no evidence of a foul play. Still, we will look into the family’s allegations. An investigation is underway,” said Verma.The man had recently taken up a new job at a private company in Delhi, and his wife works at a private bank in Noida Sector 18. They got married nine months ago. Police, meanwhile, said that though Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline number to deal with such situations, there are a few suicide prevention helpline numbers in India such as +914066202000 for Roshni (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 for Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-dies-by-suicide-in-noida-101632249373972.html

Multi-coloured signages do not suit this well-planned city’s character,” he said.“Private companies will also have to take service of the agency chosen for the purpose by the authority so that signages outside their premises, too, look similar. They will have to pay for the service,” Chand added.As of now, many signages in the city do not have names of roads, lanes and sectors. “We will install signages at roads and lanes among other such areas to make things easier for the commuters. New signages will be installed, and older ones will be replaced with new ones to give the city a better look,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/g-noida-authority-to-make-all-traffic-signages-uniform-in-4-months-101632249253981.html

Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer (SHO) of Dadri police station, said, “A group of men allegedly pulled down some of posters of the programme on Saturday, after members of the Gurjar community claimed that Samrat Mihir Bhoj was a Gurjar, but the word ‘Gurjar’ was missing from all the posters.”Three separate cases were registered against six persons -- identified as Kartar Singh, Anil, Shyam Singh Bhati, Lokesh Bhati, and Vipin Nagar and Mohit Nagar (arrested on Tuesday) -- under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation, with intent to cause riot), 505-1B (public mischief), and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) at the Dadri police station on Sunday.“These men are accused of damaging the posters, and sharing videos of the act on social media platforms.

22-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to induct only e-autos from now, one-third permits reserved for women||Soon, Delhi will have women driving auto-rickshaws on the capital roads, with the government deciding to reserve 33% of at least 4,000 auto permits for women. Besides that, the city administration will also induct only electric autos from now, instead of the CNG ones that have been plying passengers for over two decades, senior transport officials said.Documents seen by Hindustan Times showed that this month, transport minister Kailash Gahlot approved a proposal to induct women auto drivers. A total of 4,261 auto permits will be up for grabs in Delhi from next month, and of these, at least 1,406 will be reserved for women.And to apply for a permit, all one needs is a Delhi-issued light motor vehicle driving licence (for driving cars), which means the new scheme will give young people a means to be self-employedAlso, in a first, the entire fleet of 4,261 auto-rickshaws will be electric. On July 21, HT first reported about the Delhi government’s plan to reserve at least 4,000 fresh auto permits exclusively for e-autos. The move is aimed at giving a further push to the roll-out of the government’s electric vehicle policy, which has been hit by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, high electric vehicle cost and a lack of supporting infrastructure.Currently, the city has about 95,000 registered auto-rickshaws, all of which run on CNG. There is a cap of 100,000 on the number of autos that can be registered in Delhi.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the Delhi government will provide a subsidy of about ₹30,000 to each e-auto. The average cost of an e-auto will be around ₹2.7 lakh after the subsidy which is almost similar to the price of a CNG auto in Delhi. The cost of battery swapping e-autos, after subsidy, will be around ₹1.8 lakh, the minister said.. “But, we are trying to make this scheme even more appealing by tying up with CESL (Convergence Energy Services Limited, a company of the Union government) and introducing an additional 5% interest subvention scheme. The talks are on and we are in the final stages of the discussion. With this, we hope many women also will come forward as they will be able to own a vehicle and earn a livelihood. A car taxi becomes way too expensive; so, e-autos will help a lot of people looking to become financially independent, irrespective of gender,” he said.“At a time when many have lost their livelihoods due to the pandemic, this scheme will give them a chance at self-employment,” Gahlot said.Sunita Chaudhary, Delhi’s first and currently the only woman auto driver, said she applied for a permit for an e-auto as soon as she got wind of the e-auto roll-out from the motor licensing officer (MLO) at Rajpur Road a few days ago.“I have submitted my application to the MLO and to the chief minister’s office as well. This scheme looks very promising because with an EV, I will not have to queue up at CNG stations and waste precious duty hours. The e-auto models which the government is likely to approve are from reputed manufacturers. They are not going to be like e-rickshaws that are dangerous in terms of road safety as well as charging. So, it will be like an elite club and we hope many passengers will take rides just to experience a journey in an e-auto,” she said.Chaudhary (45), started driving an auto-rickshaw in 2003. It took her three years to merely get the permit that is required to ride an auto in Delhi. “They just kept refusing to give me a PSV (public service vehicle) badge and kept finding some excuse or the other. I kept going back every month and finally, after three years, they agreed to give me a PSV badge. So, it is not for no reason that we do not see women auto-rickshaw drivers in Delhi. You will still find women e-rickshaw drivers because for e-rickshaws, a PSV badge is not required. Now, I hear the state transport department is relaxing its norms for more women to join the ranks,” she said.A senior transport official, on condition of anonymity, said the department will soon start granting auto permits on the basis of the light motor vehicle driving licence of the applicant. “It is true that the rule has been stringent until now. To attract women drivers, we will be removing the clause that made a PSV badge mandatory for getting an auto permit. Once launched, applications of all those who have a light motor vehicle (LMV) driving licence in Delhi will be accepted. Next, a computerised draw of lots will be conducted to select the permit holders. Once that is done, the selected applicants will get one month’s time to get a PSV badge for which the transport department will provide a one-stop solution,” the official said.That means any person, especially a woman, who has a licence to drive a car will be eligible to buy a subsidised e-auto, drive it and earn a living.The official further said the department is in talks with all related auto-rickshaw dealers to facilitate these processes at the time of purchasing the e-auto itself. “The idea is to make the auto-rickshaw dealers a one-stop window for completion of the entire process of enrolling with the transport department as an e-auto driver,” the official said.Chadhary said, “I am eagerly looking forward to this scheme because finally, my dream of buying an auto will come true. Right now, I have to pay ₹350 every day to the owner of the auto and then the cost of CNG also comes out of my pocket. So, my net earnings are meagre.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-induct-only-e-autos-from-now-one-third-permits-reserved-for-women-101632249134810.html

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is to submit the report by October 18. The court of special CBI judge Sushil Kumar Garg has also communicated with the CBI director for expeditious completion of investigation in the case. The court said a case was registered against Hooda and others on January 23, 2019, and a chargesheet was filed by the CBI against three public servants along with an accused company on January 4, 2021.

He (the investigating officer) has also categorically admitted in his statement that due to paucity of time, he was unable to conduct further investigation as he was busy in investigation of some other cases,” the court said. The court also made it clear that paucity of time due to other cases is not a ground for not conducting further probe in cases pertaining to former and sitting MPs and MLAs. The case The Congress government, in June 2009, had issued a notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act to acquire 1,407 acres for developing residential Sectors 58 to 63 and commercial Sectors 65 to 67 in Gurugram by HUDA. While issuing the declaration under Section 6 on June 2, 2010, the total area was reduced to about 800 acres. Finally, the award, dated May 29, 2012, was passed for 87 acres only. The SC had in 2017 ordered a CBI probe in the release of about 1,300 acres in the favour of private builders.

Yue reiterated China’s policy of not interfering in Afghanistan’s internal affairs to the Afghan side.Afghanistan should reach an open and inclusive political arrangement, implement moderate and prudent domestic and foreign policies, completely cut ties with various terror organisations, and get along with neighbouring countries, Yue conveyed to the Taliban leadership, Zhao said.The Taliban leadership emphasised that it attach great importance to the relations between Afghanistan and China, Russia and Pakistan. The three countries are playing a constructive and responsible role in consolidating peace and stability in Afghanistan, the Taliban said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-pak-chinese-russian-envoys-hold-talks-with-taliban-in-kabul-101632335378653.html

Macron and Biden will meet in Europe at the end of October."The two leaders agreed that the situation would have benefited from open consultations among allies on matters of strategic interest to France and our European partners," the statement said. "President Biden conveyed his ongoing commitment in that regard."Washington also committed to boosting support for counter-terrorism missions led by European nations in Africa's Sahel region, Macron's office said.The United States "recognises the importance of a stronger and more capable European defense, that contributes positively to transatlantic and global security and is complementary to NATO," the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-to-send-envoy-back-to-us-france-says-after-biden-call-101632331341122.html

Researchers say lettuce, spinach can replace the traditional mRNA shots||It’s the end of 2021, which means more than two years of the world combatting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. While several anti-Covid vaccines have come up and vaccination is underway across the globe, they come with their set of challenges.Aimed at addressing such challenges, scientists of the University of California, Riverside are currently studying the possibility of transforming edible plants into mRNA (Messenger RNA) technology vaccines against Covid-19.According to a press release issued by the university, mRNA vaccines come with the mandate of being kept in a cold environment for their stability to be maintained during transport and storage. Coronavirus vaccines based on this technology, including Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, function by teaching the human body cells to identify and safeguard the system against infectious ailments.What plants are the scientists using?The UC Riverside scientists of this project aim to eradicate the mandate of keeping vaccines in cold conditions – as required by mRNA vaccines. The team is focusing on projecting three vital matters – first “DNA containing the mRNA vaccines can be successfully delivered into the part of plant cells;” second, edible plants can produce adequate mRNA just like a traditional jab; and third, determining the accurate dosage of the plant-based vaccines.“Ideally, a single plant would produce enough mRNA to vaccinate a single person,” Associate professor in UC Riverside’s department of botany and plant sciences, and the head of the research, Juan Pablo Giraldo said.He is working with scientists from UC San Diego and Carnegie Mellon University, Pennsylvania.Also Read | India to not buy Pfizer, Moderna Covid-19 vaccines as local production jumps: ReportGiraldo explained that the team is testing the plant-based vaccine approach with spinach and lettuce, with a long-term agenda of people growing these plants in their gardens. “Farmers could also eventually grow entire fields of it,” he added in the release.How are the scientists working?The primary element in this research, said Giraldo, is chloroplast – the small organs in plant cells that transform sunlight into energy for the plant to use. Giraldo explained that chloroplasts are “tiny, solar-powered factories” that produce sugar and other molecules.“They’re also an untapped source for making desirable molecules,” he added.Earlier, the lead researcher had shown, the release noted, that it’s possible for chloroplasts to express genes that are not a natural part of the plant. Giraldo and his colleagues did this independent research by sending foreign genetic material into plant cells inside a protective gear."Our idea is to repurpose naturally occurring nanoparticles, namely plant viruses, for gene delivery to plants," Nicole Steinmetz, a UC San Diego professor of nanoengineering said. "Some engineering goes into this to make the nanoparticles go to the chloroplasts and also to render them non-infectious toward the plants,” she was quoted as saying in the release.Why are the scientists working to produce plant-based mRNA vaccines?Giraldo said that having the opportunity to work towards creating edible plant-based mRNA vaccines is the “culmination of a dream.” He added that the goal behind his work in nanotechnology was to create “new technology solutions” not just for food but also for high-value products like pharmaceuticals.The lead researcher is separately co-leading another project pertaining to nanomaterials for delivering nitrogen – a fertiliser, directly to chloroplasts that are the most significant ingredient for plants to function. For this project, Giraldo and his team has received a grant of $1.6 million from the National Science Foundation to develop a targeted nitrogen delivery technology.“I’m very excited about all of this research,” Giraldo said, adding that he thinks it could have an enormous effect on the lives of people.Meanwhile, the National Science Foundation has also given a grant of $500,000 to Giraldo and his team for the plant-based mRNA vaccine manufacture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-researchers-studying-if-lettuce-spinach-can-be-turned-into-covid-vaccines-101632330028954.html
22-09-2021||World||Kabul's ‘ex-mayor’ comes to office every day; says he's not helping Taliban, can't escape duty||As the Taliban government in Afghanistan reportedly sacked the last remaining minister Waheed Majroh of the erstwhile Ashraf Ghani government, 66-year-old Daoud Sultanzoy, the ‘former mayor' of Kabul, is counting his days in the office. Kabul has already got a new administrator, Taliban leader Hamdullah Nomani, but Daoud Sultanzoy remains the mayor as the post has not officially gone to Nomani. Sultanzoy is coming to the office every day and both Sultanzoy and Nomani are sharing the office space. A former US citizen, Daoud Sultanzoy was born in Kabul and fought against the Soviet Union in the early 1980s. A pilot by profession trained in the US, Daoud Sultanzoy returned to Afghanistan after 9/11 to help the post-Taliban government.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he shared about his peculiar situation in the Kabul administration. He was contacted a day after Kabul fell on August 15 by the Taliban who assured him of his security and his resumption of work soon after Kabul fell ensured that municipal works like trash collection, sanitisation go on uninterrupted. “This is a responsibility that you cannot throw away frivolously because you just say, ‘Oh, I don’t like these people’", he said adding that he is not involved in politics at all. "I am here because I am responsible to the people of Kabul, and I’ve decided to stick to it," he told WSJ.No country should ask us to form 'inclusive govt' in Afghanistan, says Taliban"The mayor’s unusual and precarious position exposes the complexities of Afghanistan’s transitional period, as well as the Taliban’s attempts to move from a brutal rural insurgency to a government that can manage a country of 40 million and run its modern cities such as Kabul, home to one in eight Afghans," the Wall Street Journal article commented.To contest in the 2014 presidential election, Daoud Sultanzoy relinquished his US passport though his wife, crowned Miss Afghanistan in 1972, and his children are in the US. They are very supportive of the decision that he took, Sultanzoy said.“I am not helping. I was assigned to serve this city, and I am still serving this city,” he said noting how he perceived a change in the Taliban. "I find them more tolerant. I am not saying I’ve met everybody, I am sure there are other elements. But the ones I have met are very polite, very understanding," he said.Kabul's new administrator Hamdullah Nomani told WSJ the leadership likes Daoud Sultanzoy and the political issues are not being considered. “Anyone who has served honestly and has a good record, and that includes the mayor, the deputy mayor and other directors, they are all our friends, we have not brought any change to these positions,” Nomani told.The Kabul municipality has recently asked its male workers to rejoin duties while the Taliban have asked the female workers to stay home.  The decision is of the Taliban leadership and Sultanzoy looks after day-to-day activities. For the last three months, Sultanzoy has not received any salary, first because the Ashraf  Ghani government delayed payment and now as the Taliban do not have funds to pay salaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabuls-ex-mayor-come-to-office-every-day-says-he-s-not-helping-taliban-can-t-escape-duty-101632327561654.html
22-09-2021||World||'This is our homeland': Women plead for basic rights in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan||As the Taliban increasingly excludes women from public life in Afghanistan, some are determined to speak out despite the threat of retribution from the hardline Islamist group.The Taliban were notorious for their brutally oppressive rule from 1996 to 2001, when women were banned from going to school or work and only allowed to leave the house with a male chaperone.They have promised to change, saying they would respect women's rights within the framework of Islamic sharia law, but many remain sceptical.In Kabul -- the city that has seen the most change over the past 20 years -- some young women, such as activist Shaqaiq Hakimi, refuse to be forced into exile by a return to Taliban rule."I want to fight and regain the rights that they took from us. We don't need to go to another country. This is our homeland," she told AFP."If we are not forced to leave, then we won't go anywhere."The Taliban claim that blocks on women returning to work or girls going to secondary school will be lifted once new systems are established.But this is an echo of the early days of the last regime, which never allowed women to return.NGO worker Farkhunda Zahidbaig, 21, described how Taliban fighters entered her office to tell management that women employees should leave."After this, our boss made the decision that the rest of us shouldn't come to the office," she said."Women want to have a profession, but... they can't continue in their jobs. The Taliban have taken away their freedom to work."- 'We're afraid' -Shabana, who asked to not be identified, is fearful she will never find a job again.This would leave the 26-year-old unable to provide for loved ones."I am very worried because I was the sole breadwinner of the family," said the former employee of a Swedish organisation.Gains for women under the Western-backed government were largely confined to cities in the conservative country, but the Taliban have faced international censure for incrementally stripping them away.In the face of that criticism, the group pledged Tuesday to allow girls to return to school "as soon as possible" but did not provide a timeframe.Their all-male government has also shut down the former administration's ministry of women's affairs and replaced it with one that earned notoriety during their first stint in power for enforcing religious doctrine.On top of the pressures of unemployment, women now fear going outside alone."We're afraid that if we go out the Taliban might whip us or hit us," said Shabana, who was travelling around Kabul with her father."We can't even go to the bazaar alone."Hakimi said she would wait to see if the Taliban fulfil their promise to allow all Afghans to go back to work or school."I hope that they do just that."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-our-homeland-women-plead-for-basic-rights-in-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-101632300918895.html

Washington-based Freedom House has published a report titled "Freedom on the Net 2021: The Global Drive to Control Big Tech" which claimed global internet freedom declined for the 11th consecutive year.Myanmar, Belarus, and Uganda witnessed the greatest deteriorations in internet freedom amid electoral and constitutional crises. Myanmar reported a massive 14-point decline, the largest since the group started the documentation project. Myanmar’s military recently captured power in a coup and frequently shut down the internet to crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.On the other hand, Iceland, Canada and Germany were among the top 10 countries with greater internet freedom.The report has measured the level of internet freedom for 70 countries and assigns them numerical scores ranging from 100 (the freest nation) to zero (the least free). The report determines the level of internet freedom by examining three broad categories: obstacles to access; limits on content; and violations of user rights.Also Read: RTI filed on government use of 'facial recognition' in airports, Covid-19 vaccinationCountries with scores between 70 to 100 are designated as ‘Free’ on internet freedom status while those with points between 40 to 69 are designated as ‘Partly-free’. Countries scoring less than 39 are designated as ‘Not free’.China remained the world’s worst abuser of internet freedom for the seventh consecutive year and failed to score a single point in the ‘violation of user rights’ category. “The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is tightening its control over the state bureaucracy, the media, online speech, religious groups, universities, businesses, and civil society associations, and it has undermined its own already modest rule-of-law reforms,” the report says.Here’s the list of the top 10 countries with the highest level of internet freedom:Here’s the list of the top 10 countries with the lowest level of internet freedom:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-worst-abuser-of-internet-freedom-pakistan-in-top-10-report-101632324135388.html

The official also said that at some point, almost all children between 12 and 15 years of age would get infected by Covid-19 without vaccinations.“There is definitely substantial transmission happening in this age group. In fact, the age group we're talking about is the one in which the highest rate of transmission is currently occurring, as far as we can tell,” news agency Reuters quoted England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty as saying earlier in the day. The official made the remarks during a session with British lawmakers on the decision to administer Covid-19 vaccine to children in the 12 to 15 age group.Also read | ‘Looking at it urgently,’ says UK envoy on vaccine certification for IndiaComments from Whitty came two days after the UK expanded the scope of its vaccination program on Monday to include school children from 12 to 15 years of age. Earlier on September 14, UK’s top medical officers had recommended a single dose of the vaccine to all children in the age group to avoid disruption to their education. “I have accepted the recommendation from the Chief Medical Officers to expand vaccination to those aged 12 to 15 - protecting young people from catching Covid-19, reducing transmission in schools and keeping pupils in the classroom,” UK health minister Sajid Javid had said following the recommendation.Meanwhile, Whitty said that while the vaccination programme is expected to cause some disruption to the schools, it would outweigh the disruptions that would be caused if the children were to be infected by Covid-19.“The great majority of children who have not currently had COVID are going to get it at some point,” he said. “It won't be necessary in the next two or three months but they will get it sooner or later because this is incredibly infectious... vaccination will reduce that risk,” he further said.All children in the age group would be inoculated with one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine while the government is undecided on the second dose. However, vulnerable children in the age group were already eligible for the shots under the country’s vaccination program.Along with vaccinating school children, the UK has also planned to roll out booster doses for people above 50 years of age and those with weakened immune systems to check the transmission of the disease during the winters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/englands-top-medical-official-warns-of-substantial-transmission-of-covid-19-among-children-101632323108541.html

This comes as the Pakistan Prime Minister has repeatedly said that the world should give more time to the Taliban. In an interview with the BBC, the Pakistan PM said the idea that women should not be educated is just not Islamic. "I think they will allow women to go to schools. It has nothing to do with religion," Imran Khan said.The Taliban have recently asked male students to join schools but said nothing about girl students, though universities have resumed classes for female students. The Taliban have dissolved the ministry for women and replaced it with their notorious 'vice and virtue' ministry, despite the commitment they made to uphold women's rights.Imran Khan says world should give Taliban more time, US misunderstood HaqqanisThe full Cabinet has also been announced with no woman minister which shows how the Taliban went back on their promise of giving equal rights to women.In an earlier interview with CNN, which was Imran Khan's first international interview after the Taliban takeover, Khan said Afghanistan's women are strong and they can assert their rights. It is wrong to think that they can be helped from outside, he had added.On Pakistan recognising the Taliban government, Imran Khan said that Pakistan will not take the decision individually. The decision will be taken only after consulting with other neighbours. "All neighbours will get together and see how they progress. Whether to recognise them or not will be a collective decision," Imran Khan said.Sooner or later, Afghanistan will have a civil war of the Taliban do not include all factions in the governance, Imran Khan said. "That would mean an unstable, chaotic, Afghanistan and an ideal place for terrorists. That is a worry," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-says-stopping-women-from-accessing-education-unislamic-101632320003294.html

22-09-2021||World||Hong Kong slyly tweaks language of security law, puts media at greater risk||Months after China imposed the draconian national security law on Hong Kong, the administration of the semi-autonomous region has quietly hardened the language of the terms of violations that were already vague. The city’s administration is now even planning to introduce new laws under Hong Kong’s Basic Law that will pave way for easily cracking down on dissenting voices. The proposals include ‘Fake news’ legislation, anti-doxxing law, and anti-sanctions law among others.Reports suggest that Hong Kong authorities, who were initially using the phrase “actions that “endanger national security", have quietly started using the term “contrary to the interests of national security”. While the phrase “endanger national security” appears more than 30 times in the national security law, "contrary to” has not been mentioned in the original legislation.The Hong Kong government has proposed ‘Fake news’ legislation months after officials and lawmakers started using the term ‘fake news’ in their press statements and in speeches. But they have not outlined any exact provisions for the law. The Asia Internet Coalition has even warned that tech giants may stop offering their services in the semi-autonomous region if anti-doxxing laws were used to target their employees.Article 7 of the Hong Kong Basic Law still requires the local government to pass its own law. The newly proposed Article 23 can do away with this obligation. China is also planning to extend the anti-sanctions law to Hong Kong. The law allows Beijing to deny visas, deport, or seize assets of those involved in formulating or complying with sanctions against China.These minor changes could provide greater ammunition to the government for harassing businesses and citizens as it increases compliance risk for companies operating from what is touted as global financial capital. The broadening of the language of terms of violations put more companies and people at the risk of being accused of security violations.Several pro-democracy activists, including Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, were arrested last year days after the implementation of the controversial law. The international community, especially the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, has often termed the legislation contrary to China's international obligations under the principles of the legally binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-slyly-tweaks-language-of-security-law-puts-media-at-greater-risk-101632308406740.html

Unless urgent action is taken, the country faces an imminent humanitarian catastrophe. Our visit allowed us to witness the immediate needs of the Afghan people first-hand and meet with stakeholders to define ways to urgently scale up our health response,” it added.Cuts in donor support to Sehetmandi health projectNoting that the lack of donor support to the country’s largest health project Sehetmandi, the WHO chief said that thousands of health facilities have been left without funding for medical supplies and salaries for health staff. Also, many such facilities have either shut down or reduced operations.Also read | WHO chief thanks Mansukh Mandaviya for resuming vaccine exports to COVAX pool“Only 17% of all Sehatmandi health facilities are now fully functional. This breakdown in health services is having a rippling effect on the availability of basic and essential health care, as well as on emergency response, polio eradication, and Covid-19 vaccination efforts,” the statement showed.Response to Covid-19 pandemic droppedThe WHO further said that nine out of the 37 Covid-19 hospitals in the country have closed and surveillance, testing and vaccinations against the disease have dropped.“In recent weeks, vaccination rates have decreased rapidly while 1.8 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in the country remain unused,” it said. It also called for swift action to achieve the national target of immunizing at least 20% of the population by the end of 2021.Polio remains endemicIn its statement, the WHO also said that Afghanistan remains one of two countries where polio is endemic. While there were 56 cases of wild poliovirus reported in 2020, this year only one such case has been reported.“There has never been a better time to eradicate polio. However, the polio programme will struggle to respond if the basic immunization infrastructure begins to collapse around it,” the WHO noted.It also offered to begin a country-wide, house-to-house polio vaccination campaign and also include measles and Covid-19 vaccinations in an integrated campaign, along with its partners.Assuring its investment in the health education of girls and women, the WHO said it would continue to support an extensive trauma programme including supplies for 130 hospitals and 67 blood banks in the country.Following the Taliban takeover, several news reports emerged of the militant group shutting healthcare facilities. In one instance, the Taliban banned the administration of Covid-19 jabs in Paktia province, earlier in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-the-brink-of-collapse-who-on-health-system-in-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-calls-for-urgent-action-101632307129750.html

This comes as a departure from the previous occasions when Pakistan denied the permission of President Ram Nath Kovind and PM Modi at least thrice following India's abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.A high-level delegation including National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and top government officials are accompanying PM Modi to the US. Islamabad also denied permission when PM Modi was visiting the US and Germany and President Kovind was visiting Iceland.According to government sources quoted by ANI, India had sought permission from Pakistan regarding the usage of Pakistan's airspace for Prime Minister Modi's flight to the US, for which a nod was given by Islamabad. This comes after India permitted Pakistan PM Imran Khan's flight to use India's airspace when he was travelling to Sri Lanka.When did this airspace 'ban' come into force?In 2019, Pakistan had issued a statement refusing to allow PM Modi's flight "in view of the situation in (Jammu and) Kashmir and India's attitude, oppression and barbarity...and the violation of rights in the region"."We have decided not to give permission to the Indian prime minister and we have conveyed this decision to the Indian High Commission," Pakistan foreign ministry had said in a statement in 2019.After that, India registered a protest against Pakistan with International Civil Aviation Organisation on the denial.PM Modi's plane also decided to avoid Afghanistan airspace as the country had closed its airspace for any commercial use.In a statement just before leaving for the US, Modi said he will conclude his visit with an address at the United Nations General Assembly focusing on the pressing global challenges including the Covid-19 pandemic, the need to combat terrorism, climate change and other important issues. "I will be visiting the USA from 22-25 September 2021 at the invitation of His Excellency President Joe Biden of the United States of America. During my visit, I will review the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership with President Biden and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest," the prime minister said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-allows-pm-modi-s-flight-to-use-its-airspace-101632304546889.html

A security source told reporters unidentified gunmen opened fire at a checkpoint at Ghawchak district in Jalalabad from a rickshaw, killing all three bystanders. While confirming the attack, a Taliban official, however, denied any casualty of members of the outfit. It said all the three killed were civilians.Jalalabad province has been the main operating base for the Islamic State’s (IS) Afghanistan chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), for years during the Afghan government’s rule. The outfit has, however, not yet claimed responsibility for Wednesday’s attack.IS-K was behind the attack on Kabul airport about a month ago which killed more than 100 people, besides several other minors attacks over past few weeks.The IS-K and Talibans are both Sunni groups but they differ on critical issues of religion which leads to severe fighting between the two. The IS-K also carried out weekend attacks against the Taliban in Jalalabad via its propaganda arm Amaq. The group claimed responsibility for "three separate bomb attacks" targeting three "Taliban vehicles" in Jalalabad on Saturday, and another "bomb attack" Sunday on "a Taliban vehicle".The attack on Hamid Karzai International airport was perpetrated as strategic strikes against both the US and the Taliban, the American government told New York Times. US President Joe Biden cited IS-K and not Taliban as the reason for sticking to the original evacuation date for American troops from Afghan soil.“Everyday we say there is a new day that we know ISIS-K is going to target the airport and attack Americans as well as allies and innocent civilians,” Biden said during a press briefing in the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-taliban-fighters-among-three-killed-in-jalalabad-attack-report-101632300628931.html

However, we have not yet put this agreement into effect due to the unfairness of obligations,” Erdogan told the UN before announcing Turkey’s decision. “We plan to submit the Paris Climate Agreement for the approval of our parliament next month, in line with the constructive steps to be taken and within the framework of our national contribution statement.”Erdogan’s ruling AK Party has a commanding a majority in the parliament together with its nationalist ally and is aiming to ratify the agreement before the COP26 meeting, which will run from October 31 to November 12 in Glasgow. “We envisage the ratification phase of the carbon-neutral targeted agreement, before the United Nations climate change conference, which will be held in Glasgow,” Erdogan said.As of now, Turkey is one of six signatory states that have not ratified the agreement also including Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen, according to the UN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-to-become-last-g-20-nation-to-ratify-paris-climate-accords-101632292979033.html
22-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Jagmeet Singh’s NDP wins 25 seats, well short of expectations||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s clarion call to voters to avoid opting for smaller parties in the 2021 Canada elections - in what is called split-voting - seems to have dealt Jagmeet Singh’s New Democratic Party (NDP) a blow. Tipped to win about 40 seats in the September 20 snap polls, the NDP settled for 25 – going up marginally from the 24 it had won in 2019. Jagmeet Singh and his NDP clearly failed to live up to their expectations in the just concluded Canada elections despite recording 17.7% of the vote share.The NDP will, however, return to its status of putting pressure on PM Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party to deliver on issues that the NDP pursues as the fourth largest party in the 338-seat House of Commons.Days before the Canada elections, Justin Trudeau and his main rival Erin O’Toole of the Conservative Party had both urged voters across the country to avoid backing smaller parties. Justin Trudeau and his Liberals won the election, but yet again settled for a minority government.Jagmeet Singh addressed a post-election press conference in Vancouver on Tuesday and said the NDP was “proud” of its electoral performance. “Despite our number, we were the most successful opposition party in the last parliament, and this parliament looks pretty much the same,” he said, according to CTV News.Jagmeet Singh said he had spoken to Justin Trudeau on Monday night and pointed that “we’ll not hesitate to provide support to get things done, and he knows my priorities”.However, the NDP was still unable to even become the third-largest party in the House of Commons. Just like it had done in 2019, the Bloc Quebecois won more seats this time as well, getting 34. That gives Justin Trudeau options in terms of turning to another party for support to pass key legislation.There was no immediate question of a leadership shake-up within the NDP even though the party failed to get near its 2015 seat share of 44.At different points during the campaign period for the 2021 Canada elections, Jagmeet Singh’s NDP was tipped to secure 20% vote share translating to 40 or more seats, according to surveys, but was unable to touch those figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-jagmeet-singh-s-ndp-wins-25-seats-well-short-of-expectations-101632292414962.html
22-09-2021||World||With eye on climate change, Xi Jinping makes new pledge at UNGA||With an eye on climate change, China will no longer build coal-power plants abroad, President Xi Jinping said early on Wednesday at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), reiterating his pledge that Beijing will seek to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and eventually achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.During his video address to the UNGA, Xi Jinping said Beijing, instead of building coal plants overseas, will support developing countries in the transition to green and low-carbon energy as part of the global effort to tackle climate change. The Chinese president did not share details on how China would go about implementing the policy but, if put in place, it would restrict financing of coal plants in developing countries, which largely depend on coal to meet their power needs.“China will strive to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This requires tremendous hard work, and we will make every effort to meet these goals. China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad,” Xi said at the UNGA.“We need to improve global environmental governance, actively respond to climate change and create a community of life for man and nature. We need to accelerate transition to a green and low-carbon economy and achieve green recovery and development,” the Chinese president said.Xi’s announcement at the UNGA followed similar moves by South Korea and Japan earlier this year, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and US climate change envoy John Kerry have urged China to follow the lead of its Asian counterparts, Reuters reported.Kerry, who was in China earlier this month for climate change talks, welcomed Xi’s announcement, calling it a “great contribution” and a good beginning to efforts needed to achieve success at the October 31-November 12 COP26 UN conference in Glasgow, Scotland.“We’ve been talking to China for quite some period of time about this. And I’m absolutely delighted to hear that President Xi has made this important decision,” Kerry said.Belinda Schape of climate think tank E3G tweeted that China still hosts more than 50% of the world’s coal fleet, so Beijing still needs to “lend credibility” to its domestic climate targets and unveil a clear timeline for phasing coal out at home.China is the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gases, accounting for 28% of global emissions.According to a report published in late 2020, China cannot build more coal-fired power plants after 2020 as planned if it wants to honour its pledge to go carbon neutral by 2060, keeping in mind climate change.The Chinese government’s plans to build more coal-fired power plants “contradicts” its carbon neutral targets, Draworld Environment Research Centre of Beijing and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Finland said in the 2020 report.The report pointed out that China has around 130GW redundant coal power capacity among the total coal-fired capacity of more than 1,000GW. “However, power industry players have advocated for an expansion to 1,300GW or even higher by 2030,” it said.QUAD, AUKUS, AFGHANISTANXi Jinping said in his UNGA remarks there was a need to “reject the practice of forming small circles or zero-sum games,” a veiled reference to the US-led Quad forum of Australia, India and Japan seen as a means of pushing back against China’s rise.The Quad will have its first in-person meeting of the leaders of the member states in Washington on Friday.China had last week warned of an intensified arms race in the region after the US, Britain and Australia announced a new Indo-Pacific security alliance, dubbed Aukus, which will provide Australia with the technology and capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines.“Recent developments in the global situation show once again that military intervention from the outside and so-called democratic transformation entail nothing but harm,” Xi Jinping told the UNGA, in what was possibly a reference to the situation in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of US troops.“Differences and problems among countries, hardly avoidable, need to be handled through dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect,” he said.“One country’s success does not have to mean another country’s failure, and the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries. We need to pursue dialogue and inclusiveness over confrontation and exclusion,” the Chinese president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-eye-on-climate-change-xi-jinping-makes-new-pledge-at-unga-101632290074580.html
22-09-2021||World||Covid-19: Direct passenger flights from India to Canada may resume on Sept 27||Direct flights from India to Canada may resume on September 27, but there’s a catch. The ongoing flight ban, in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic, would be lifted only on the basis of the results of Covid-19 tests conducted on arrival in Canada on passengers travelling from New Delhi on three flights on Wednesday.As a “first step”, Transport Canada said, all passengers on the three Air Canada flights from New Delhi on Wednesday will be tested for Covid-19 on arrival “to ensure that the new measures are working”.The India-to-Canada direct flight ban, which expired on September 21, has been extended by Transport Canada until the end of September 26.If a high number of positive Covid-19 results are found, the planned lifting of the flight ban on September 27 will be reconsidered. “Border and public health measures also remain subject to change as the epidemiological situation evolves,” Transport Canada said.Canada had banned direct flights from India in April as the Delta-driven second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic raged across the country.Also, there are additional conditions that will have to be fulfilled by travellers from India once the flight ban is lifted. Passengers will have to take a molecular test for Covid-19 from the Canada-approved Genestrings lab at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi, and will only be allowed to board if the result is negative. That test will have to be taken “within 18 hours of the scheduled departure of their direct flight to Canada”. Covid-19 tests from any other lab in India will not be recognised for travel to Canada.“We continue to remain engaged with our Canadian partners and to emphasise the importance of early resumption of normal air mobility,” India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, told HT.Meanwhile, rules for travellers from India via a third country remain the same. They will have to obtain a valid negative test result conducted within 72 hours of boarding a flight headed for a Canadian destination at the place of departure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-direct-passenger-flights-from-india-to-canada-may-resume-on-sept-27-101632287794274.html

The city also ordered businesses like mahjong parlors, cinemas and gyms to shut. City authorities say residents must display a negative virus test to be able to leave for only essential travel.

The new Taliban regime is yet to be officially recognised by most nations, including India which has raised questions on the non-inclusive nature of its government. A number of its top ministers are blacklisted by the United Nations.The Saarc is a regional intergovernmental organisation of South Asian countries -- India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Afghanistan was the latest entrant to the bloc in 2007.Pakistan is said to have initially agreed to an empty chair as a representative of the war-torn nation, but was not willing to let any official from the previous Ashraf Ghani-led government take part in the meeting. It had then proposed that a Taliban member may take part in the event that was scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session in New York this week. Soon after, disagreement cropped up and the meeting of the bloc was eventually called off. Nepal was scheduled to host the talks.An official letter sent by the Saarc secretariat to the foreign ministries of the eight countries on Tuesday said it had received a note verbale or unsigned diplomatic correspondence from Nepal’s foreign ministry that stated the informal meeting of foreign ministers, which was to be held on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on September 25, “will not take place” because of the “lack of concurrence from all member states”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-wanted-taliban-to-represent-afghanistan-in-saarc-meeting-report-101632283752032.html

A new fissure has now emerged north of the original eruption site. At least 200 people were forced to flee their homes on Tuesday as a new fissure emerged in the erupting volcano on Spain's Canary Islands.The volcano on the island of La Palma erupted on Sunday after a week of seismic activity that progressed to a 3.8 magnitude quake.The new vent is 900 meters (3,000 feet) north of the Cumbre Vieja national park, where the volcano first erupted. It emerged after a 4.1 magnitude earthquake late Monday, the Involcan volcanology institute said.What has been the damage so far?Rivers of lava, as much as 6 meters high, rolled down hillsides, burning and crushing everything in their path and affecting nearly 400 farms.By Tuesday, lava had covered 103 hectares (about 260 acres) of terrain, according to the European Union's Earth Observation Program, Copernicus.So far, about 6,000 people on La Palma have been evacuated, and 183 houses have been damaged, government spokeswoman Isabel Rodriguez said after a Cabinet meeting in Madrid.No casualties have been reported.When will lava reach the sea?Molten lava was expected to reach the sea by Monday, but its speed has slowed down. By Tuesday morning, the white-hot mass of molten rock, with a temperature of nearly 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,830 degrees Fahrenheit), had still not reached the western coast.Volcanologist Stavros Meletlidis said it was not clear when it would reach the sea because its speed was "very variable.""It can accelerate very quickly, especially when the topography changes ... or it can stop on a plain for several hours. You have to see how both the main flow and the secondary flow are developing," he said.Experts warn that, when lava reaches the sea, it will generate clouds of toxic gas.How has the government reacted?Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the crisis management on La Palma "does not end when the lava reaches the sea.""It will end when we rebuild all the damage caused by the eruption of the volcano," Sanchez said, pledging to stand with those affected.Authorities are seeking financial aid from the EU to help rebuild, said Angel Victor Torres, the head of the Canary Islands regional government.Torres said the damage already amounted to more than €400 million ($470 million), qualifying the region for emergency EU aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canary-islands-volcano-new-vent-opens-more-people-flee-101632280213541.html

China demanded last month that Lithuania withdraw its ambassador in Beijing and said it would recall its envoy to Vilnius after Taiwan announced that its mission in Lithuania would be called the Taiwanese Representative Office.Taiwanese missions in Europe and the United States use the name of the city Taipei, avoiding a reference to the island itself, which China claims as its own territory. US president Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke to Lithuania's prime minister Ingrida Simonyte last week and stressed support for her country in the face of pressure from China.The National Cyber Centre's report also said the Xiaomi phone was sending encrypted phone usage data to a server in Singapore. A security flaw was also found in the P40 5G phone by China's Huawei but none was found in the phone of another Chinese maker, OnePlus, it said. Huawei's representative in the Baltics told the BNS news wire its phones do not send user's data externally.The report said the list of terms that could be censored by the Xiaomi phone's system apps, including the default internet browser, currently includes 449 terms in Chinese and is continuously updated."This is important not only to Lithuania but to all countries which use Xiaomi equipment," the Centre said in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/get-rid-of-chinese-phones-as-fast-as-possible-lithuania-on-censorship-concern-101632277026579.html

Travellers who are unable to meet these requirements will be denied boarding.This comes on a day when three flights from India are scheduled to land in Canada. Transport Canada said that all the passengers on these flights will be tested for Covid-19 upon arrival to ensure that the new measures are working.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-extends-ban-on-commercial-and-private-passenger-flights-from-india-101632275585977.html
22-09-2021||World||Taliban name UN envoy, ask to address United Nations General Assembly||The Taliban, the new rulers of the war-torn land of Afghanistan, have now demanded representation at this week's United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session, thereby challenging the credentials of the pre-existing envoy of the country. The Taliban have named a new UN permanent representative – Mohammad Suhail Shaheen, once a spokesperson for the insurgents during peace negotiations in Qatar. The move is expected to trigger a diplomatic battle between Afghanistan's former UN envoy and the Taliban rulers over the high-level meeting of the international body.The world is watching closely every single move of the new rulers of Afghanistan before coming to a decision regarding recognition of the newfound regime. While the global community is in no hurry to do so, the question now facing the United Nations is a crucial one – should the Taliban be provided with a platform at the global stage to put forward their views? And if so, to what extent should the said platform allow or curb the expressions of the insurgents?Also Read | At UNGA, Biden says ‘future’ belongs to those who allow people to ‘breathe free’The way the world leaders choose to approach this question, experts believe, may define the molding conflict between the former UN envoy of Afghanistan and the new representative put forward for the global stage by the country's Islamist rulers.According to UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, secretary-general Antonio Guterres received a communique on September 15 from the currently accredited Afghan ambassador, Ghulam Isaczai, with the list of Afghanistan's delegation for the assembly's 76th annual session. Five days later, Guterres received another communication with the letterhead “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” signed by “Ameer Khan Muttaqi” as “Minister of Foreign Affairs,” requesting participation in the UN gathering of world leaders.In this new communique, the Taliban claimed that Isaczai no longer represents Afghanistan since former president Ashraf Ghani was “ousted” as of August 15 this year and that countries across the world “no longer recognise him as president”. In light of these developments, the Taliban said they are nominating Mohammad Suhail Shaheen as the new permanent UN representative.Also Read | No respect: Afghan rights commission says Taliban using its cars, computers, other assetsHowever, it is not yet known if the UN credentials committee is going to legitimise this request. An official from the panel told the Associated Press under strict condition of anonymity that the UN committee “would take some time to deliberate”, suggesting the Taliban's envoy would not be able to speak at the General Assembly at this session at least during the high-level leaders' week. Senior officials of the US state department said they were aware of the Taliban's request, but could not predict how the panel might rule.Afghanistan is scheduled to give the last speech on the final day of the high-level meeting on September 27. It wasn't clear who would speak if the committee met and the Taliban were given Afghanistan's seat.In cases of disputes over seats at the United Nations, the official protocol says that the General Assembly's nine-member credentials committee must meet to make a decision. Both the aforementioned letters have been sent to the committee after consultations with General Assembly president Abdulla Shahid's office, the international body said. The committee's members are the United States, Russia, China, Bahama, Bhutan, Chile, Namibia, Sierra Leone, and Sweden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-name-un-envoy-ask-to-address-united-nations-general-assembly-101632270110101.html

The aim of the summit is to rally world leaders, philanthropists, civil society, NGOs, and industry “to align on a common vision to end Covid-19 together” by the end of 2022.The White House further said that “this meeting is about expanding and enhancing our shared efforts to defeat Covid-19, building out from previous gatherings of world leaders and ministers in fora like the G7, G20, and Act Accelerator”. The United States will “be asking participants to commit to a higher level of ambition by expanding reach in four broad avenues," it added.These four avenues are: enhancing equitable access to vaccines and getting shots in arms; solving oxygen crisis; making tests, PPEs, therapeutics more easily available, and establishing sustainable health security financing by tracking progress and supporting each other in fulfilling our commitments.Biden has been pushing for vaccination both domestically and globally and urging people to do their part so the pandemic can end once and for all. “We have the tools to put this pandemic behind us, but we all have to do our part. If you haven’t yet, please get vaccinated. And if you’ve gotten vaccinated, reach out to family and friends who haven’t. Let’s finish this once and for all,” he tweeted on September 20.

All the windows, the glass, was shaking -- like a wave of shaking," he told AFP."I have never experienced that before. It was a little bit scary."Sizable earthquakes are unusual in Australia's populated southeast."It was quite violent but everyone was kind of in shock," Melbourne cafe worker Parker Mayo, 30, told AFP.Bricks and rubble lay on the ground outside Betty's Burgers in Melbourne, with large sheets of metal hanging off the restaurant awning.The restaurant said in a Facebook post that everyone was safe: "We were fortunate that nobody was in the restaurant at the time."'Very disturbing event'At around just under magnitude six this was "the biggest event in south-east Australia for a long time" Mike Sandiford, a geologist at the University of Melbourne told AFP."We had some very big ones at magnitude six in the late 1800s, though precise magnitudes are not well known."A quake of this size is expected every "10-20 years in south-east Australia, the last was Thorpdale in 2012" he said. "This is significantly bigger."Sandiford said Australians should expect "many hundreds of aftershocks, most below human sensitivity threshold, but probably a dozen or more that will be felt at least nearby."The quake "would have caused many billions of dollars in damage had it been under Melbourne," he added.Geosciences Australia said an aftershock measuring 4.0 struck shortly after the initial temblor.The mayor of Mansfield, near the quake epicentre, said there was no damage in the small town but it had taken residents by surprise."I was sitting down at work at my desk and I needed to run outside. It took me a while to work out what it was," Mark Holcombe told public broadcaster ABC."We don't have earthquakes that I am aware of -- none of the locals I spoke to this morning had that experience with earthquakes here before -- so it is one right out of the left field."Emergency services said they had received calls for help as far away as Dubbo, about 700 kilometres from the quake epicentre, with fire and rescue crews dispatched to help.Prime Minister Scott Morrison, speaking from New York, said there were no initial reports of injuries."It can be a very, very disturbing event for an earthquake of this nature," he said. "They are very rare events in Australia."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/earthquake-of-magnitude-5-6-strikes-near-melbourne-australia-gfz-101632267146464.html
22-09-2021||World||World is facing a dead end: UN chief||United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world is hurtling towards ecological destruction, sounding a bleak opening tone to the annual UN General Assembly meeting in New York.Speaking a day after convening world leaders to ratchet up climate commitments, Guterres said on Tuesday that the “climate alarm bells” are “ringing at fever pitch”. Calling current global efforts insufficient, he forecast a “hellscape of temperature rises” if emissions aren’t cut more than currently planned.“We are weeks away from the UN Climate Conference in Glasgow, but seemingly light years away from reaching our targets,” Guterres told world leaders at the hybrid event where leaders including US President Joe Biden and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are speaking in person but others will appear by video. “We must get serious. And we must act fast.”There were also hints of optimism on the climate front. Speaking on the sidelines of an event on the subject at the UN on Monday, US climate envoy John Kerry expressed confidence that world leaders will meet a target of raising $100 billion in climate aid to developing nations before the UK hosts two weeks of climate talks - known as COP26 - in Glasgow, Scotland, beginning on October 31.“I think we’re going to get it done by COP,” Kerry told reporters. “The US will do its part,” he said. “I’m not hoping. I’m telling you to stay tuned to the president’s speech.”Guterres also decried the global vaccine inequity that has left rich countries with surplus doses and considering booster shots even as developing nations have barely started vaccinating their populations.“This is a moral indictment of the state of our world. It is an obscenity. We passed the science test. But we are getting an ‘F’ in Ethics,” the UN chief said.Reviewing the mistrust and lack of unity that he says have undermined global efforts to address Covid-19 and climate, Guterres said, “Instead of the path of solidarity, we are on a dead end to destruction.” While millions around the world go hungry, Guterres said, they see “billionaires joyriding to space”.‘Recipe for trouble’The United Nations chief urged the United States and China to engage in dialogue, warning of an increasingly divided world. “I fear our world is creeping towards two different sets of economic, trade, financial and technology rules, two divergent approaches in the development of artificial intelligence - and ultimately two different military and geopolitical strategies,” Guterres said.“This is a recipe for trouble. It would be far less predictable than the Cold War. To restore trust and inspire hope, we need cooperation,” he said.“We need dialogue. We need understanding.”The summit featured the first speech to the world body by US President Joe Biden, who has described a rising and authoritarian China as the paramount challenge of the 21st century.Chinese President Xi Jinping is also set to address the United Nations but by video in light of Covid restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-is-facing-a-dead-end-un-chief-101632248980152.html
22-09-2021||India||Vaccine ingredient supply lines must stay open: PM Modi||The supply chains for Covid-19 vaccine raw materials must be kept open so that India can increase production and resume vaccine supplies to other countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a virtual Covid summit on Wednesday.At the same time, international travel should become easier through mutual recognition of vaccine certificates so that the world can cope with the pandemic’s economic impacts, Modi said while addressing the summit called by US President Joe Biden.Earlier on Wednesday, before he left for the US, Modi said the visit was an opportunity to strengthen the bilateral and global strategic partnerships and consolidate ties with key partners, Japan and Australia. He will be in the US during September 22-25, and will have separate meetings with US President Joe Biden, vice president Kamala Harris, Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga, and hold talks with leading American businesspeople in Washington. He will travel to New York to address the UN General Assembly session on September 25.“During my visit, I will review the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership with President Biden and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest,” Modi said.In his remarks at the opening of the summit convened on the margins of the UN General Assembly, Biden announced the donation of another 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine to low and middle income countries, taking total US commitments to more than 1.1 billion shots.Modi noted the pandemic has resulted in “unprecedented disruption and it is not yet over”. Biden’s initiative is timely and welcome as much of the world is yet to be vaccinated, he said.“As newer Indian vaccines get developed, we are also ramping up production capacity of existing vaccines. As our production increases, we will be able to resume vaccine supply to others too. For this, the supply chains of raw materials must be kept open,” he said.India is working with partners in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue to leverage the country’s manufacturing strengths to produce vaccines for the Indo-Pacific region. India and the South Africa have proposed a waiver of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for Covid-19 vaccines, diagnostics and medicines to scale up the fight against the pandemic, Modi said. “We also need to focus on addressing the pandemic’s economic effects. To that end, international travel should be made easier, through mutual recognition of vaccine certificates,” he said. Modi recalled India’s role in helping other nations tackle the pandemic by producing cost-effective diagnostic kits, drugs, medical devices and PPE kits, and sharing medical supplies with more than 150 countries. “Earlier this year, we shared our vaccine production with 95 other countries and with UN peacekeepers. And like a family, the world also stood with India when we were going through a second wave,” he said. India is now running the world’s largest immunisation campaign, and had vaccinated 25 million people on a single day. More than 200 million Indians were fully vaccinated, and India is willing to share its digital platform CoWIN and other digital solutions freely as open source software, he said. Biden too highlighted the US partnership with Quad members India, Japan and Australia to help produce one billion vaccine doses in India to boost global supplies by the end of 2022. “The US is buying another half billion doses of Pfizer to donate to low and middle income countries around the world,” he said. “This is another half billion doses that will all be shipped by this time next year. And it brings our total commitment of donated vaccines to over 1.1 billion vaccines.”He added, “Put another way, for every one shot we’ve administered to date in America, we have now committed to do three shots to the rest of the world.” Biden announced the launching of the European Union-US partnership to expand global vaccinations, and said the US will provide an additional $370 million to support administering and delivery of vaccines worldwide. More than $380 million will be provided to GAVI to facilitate distribution of vaccines in regions with the greatest need, he said. The summit, Biden said, was focused on “supercharging efforts” in 3 key areas: vaccinating the world by ramping up production, donations and delivery of doses, addressing the oxygen crisis in hospitals around the world and making other treatments more accessible, and building better so that global healthinfrastructure becomes more resilient. He said US secretary of state Antony Blinken will convene a meeting of foreign ministers later this year to check collective progress, and proposed a second virtual Covid summit in the first quarter of 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-ingredient-supply-lines-must-stay-open-pmmodi-101632335077948.html
22-09-2021||India||UK recognises Covishield, but still no green light for Indians||The UK government on Wednesday added Covishield as one of the vaccines it will recognise when allowing international travellers to skip quarantine on arrival, but has not yet included India in the list of countries from where people will be eligible for this new rule. The move comes a day after India warned of reciprocal measures as the controversy around UK’s new travel rules, which come into force on October 4, sparked allegations of racism. UK high commissioner Alex Ellis attributed the issue to a significant shift in his country’s travel policy that was announced only on September 17 and made it clear Covishield is “not a problem”. He declined to set a deadline for resolving the matter and said things are moving “at a rapid pace” on recognising India’s vaccine certification. National Health Authority chairman RS Sharma, who supervises functioning of the CoWIN platform, said officials from both sides had two meetings this month to discuss the technical aspects of each other’s certification systems, and the discussions were now closed. “In the first [meeting], the British high commissioner met me on September 2, and the second one was yesterday (September 21) between the technical teams. We made them understand how our system worked and they explained the functioning of their system to us. Both these meetings were quite fruitful,” said Sharma. People familiar with developments, who asked not to be named, said the discussions focused on certification done through the CoWIN app, the security of the system, data sharing between the two sides, and reconciling the CoWIN system with the NHS Covid Pass developed by Britain’s National Health Service (NHS). There were also some concerns about the security of the certification system, the people said without going into details. Ellis confirmed the NHS was in talks with officials managing CoWIN. The UK has to have confidence in the Indian app as the movement of people from both countries could affect public health, he said. “We have been having detailed technical discussions regarding certification, with the builders of the CoWIN app and the NHS app, about both apps. They’re happening at a rapid pace, to ensure that both countries mutually recognise the vaccine certificates issued by each other,” Ellis said in a statement. “We’re clear Covishield is not a problem. The UK is open to travel and we’re already seeing a lot of people going from India to the UK, be it tourists, businesspeople or students. Over 62,500 student visas have been issued in the year ending June 2021, which is an increase of almost 30% as compared to the previous year. We want to make the process of travelling as easy as possible,” he added. According to Sharma, a communiqué from the UK on Wednesday said there was no need for further discussions on the issue. “They said there was no need for a third discussion as they were good. Now a decision will be taken at the diplomatic and policy level. No concern has been raised to us regarding certification issues. A decision is yet to be taken on this,” he said. “Therefore, the reports doing rounds on our certification having been found faulty are all fake. Our system is a very safe system and the vaccination certificates that we issue are very much digitally verifiable,” he added. On Tuesday, India had urged the UK to change its policy requiring visiting Indian nationals to quarantine even if they are fully vaccinated, describing it as discriminatory, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla warned New Delhi could impose “reciprocal measures” against countries that don’t accept Indian vaccine certification. The issue was also raised by external affairs minister S Jaishankar at a meeting with his British counterpart Liz Truss on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on Monday. The new UK rules introduced last week were described by Britain as an effort to change the current “red, amber, green traffic light system” to a single red list of countries and “simplified travel measures” for arrivals from around the world. Under the rules, only people who have got both shots of a double-dose vaccine such as Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna, or the single-shot Janssen vaccine “under an approved vaccination program in the UK, Europe, US”, or UK vaccine programme overseas will be considered fully vaccinated. Additionally, people who have received these jabs in Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahrain, Brunei, Canada, Dominica, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea or Taiwan will also be considered fully vaccinated. Early on Wednesday, the UK updated the guidance to include formulations of the four vaccines, including Covishield, in the list of approved doses. A large part of the issue for India, until Wednesday’s update, was that the UK did not recognise Covishield, the brand name for the version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made by Serum Institute of India (SII). Earlier, UK authorities only recognised AstraZeneca’s version of the vaccine, which is sold as Vaxzevria. Recognising one but not the other had led to allegations of racism since the bio-equivalence between both doses has now been established in scientific studies.Covishield has been recognised by the World Health Organization as well but not by several other prominent regulators, such as European Union’s European Medicines Agency (EMA), which too has recognised Vaxzevria. To remedy this, AstraZeneca has applied to EMA for SII to be recognised as an alternative manufacturer. “The company is tracking acceptances and currently there are 23 European countries accepting Covishield without restrictive measures such as quarantine,” said a person familiar with the developments, on condition of anonymity. The 23 European countries with no restrictions are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, The Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-recognises-covishield-but-still-no-green-light-for-indians-101632334959253.html
22-09-2021||India||Women’s entry to NDA will not be delayed: Supreme Court||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Wednesday stressed that it “cannot belie the aspirations of young girls” as it rejected the Union government’s request to delay the first-ever examination for women candidates for their entry into the National Defence Academy (NDA), and directed that they shall be allowed to sit for the upcoming exam on November 14. “We will not put this train in reverse gear... we will not set the clock back. A beginning has to be made now. Having given some hope to women that they can take exams in November, we don’t want to belie that hope by saying they will have to wait for one more year and then something may happen. Exam cannot be postponed,” a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and BR Gavai said. While seeking the exemption for this year’s admission, the government on Mondaysaid that women can sit for the entrance exam in April-May next year and join the academy in January 2023. But the court was emphatic that there cannot be a request from the authorities to make the aspiring women skip the upcoming exam in November. The bench accepted submissions by senior counsel Chinmoy Pradip Sharma and advocate Mohit Paul, who appeared for the petitioner in the case, that the Centre’s latest affidavit, filed on September 20, was effectively asking to wipe out the court’s interim order of August 18 that permitted women to take the exam this year. “What would effectively mean by the submission of the armed forces is – No jam today, jam tomorrow! It will be difficult for us to accept that position, the aspirations of women having been arisen in view of the order, albeit subject to the final outcome of the petition. We would thus not like to effectively vacate the order passed,” said the bench in its order. The order added: “The armed forces having dealt with very difficult situations admirably, both at the borders and inside the country, to deal with emergencies is a part of their training. We are sure they can deal with this ‘emergency’, if it is so perceived.”The bench directed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to issue a revised notification for the entrance exam for NDA after consultation with the ministry of defence (MoD), which will indicate tentative requirements for the women candidates if the standards cannot not be finalised by the time of issuance of the notification. It fixed the petition filed by Kush Kalra in the third week of January, noting the court will pass further orders emerging from the situation that emerges later. Under the current eligibility criteria, only male candidates who have cleared Class 12 level or its equivalent, and are in the age group of 16-and-a-half and 19 are eligible to apply. Those who clear the NDA exam are called for interview by the Service Selection Board (SSB), and following a medical exam, candidates are recruited in the army, navy, and air force wings of NDA, and for the INA course for pre-commission training. NDA was commissioned in 1955. Representing the Centre, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati tried to persuade the bench that women candidates will have to skip the exam in November in view of the sweeping changes that have to be brought about before women cadets are inducted and start their training at the joint defence service training institute of the Indian armed forces. “There is a study group in place to examine all the requirements relating to curriculum, medical standards, accommodation, training needs, etc. We will be in a very difficult and tight situation if we are not ready for the women who clear the exam this year,” said Bhati. The bench retorted: “Armed forces have been in far more difficult and tight situations... It is not very easy but it is not that complex as it is being projected. Armed forces deal with all kinds of emergency situations and they are the best people to handle such situations. What answers do we have for women who are now ready to take exams? Will we say you try your luck sometime in future? No, you work out something this year only.” The bench further told the ASG: “It has to begin this year. We appreciate all your problems but I am sure you people are capable of making arrangements. You proceed with the exam and let us see how many women sit this year. There may not be many candidates this year. We appreciate your efforts in areas where you will have to make changes such as curriculum, fitness, accommodation, etc. But the exam cannot be postponed.” It remained firm that instead of waiting for a perfect model to come up, the process must commence immediately while the other nuances of their absorption and training, depending on the number of women who sat for the exam and those who clear it, can be dealt with at a later stage. At this point, Paul, appearing for Kalra, requested the bench to issue appropriate directions to ensure women candidates get sufficient time to prepare for the exam. The bench, however, refrained from passing any order. “Let us accept that there may not be the best result this time. The idea is to begin the process. You will get a better process next time. This is a big step and we appreciate that the armed forces have taken this decision. It will not send the right signal to postpone it but we also don’t want to push the agenda too much. Everything takes some time,” it told Paul. Turning to Bhati, the bench pointed out that the court was not dealing with a field where women are not absorbed at all since the armed forces do absorb women in various roles at a later stage. “We are therefore talking about the feeding channel only. We appreciate that the mental block seems to have been removed and that the process may take a little time but let’s make a beginning. Certainly, aspirations having been raised, we are not willing to whittle down their aspirations. We are only helping you to iron out the creases but the clock won’t be set back,” it told the ASG. Bhati, on her part, said that the Centre will come back if there is any difficulty in implementing the orders. The bench also heard another petition for admission of girls into the Dehradun-based Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC) and asked Bhati why is taking it long for the Centre to come clear on the issue when a decision has already been taken for NDA. Bhati replied that “RIMC will have to follow the suit now that NDA is opening up” and a study group has been set up separately to examine the issues relating to admission of women in RIMC. She added that a decision will have to be made whether girls will be admitted in the same institution or a separate institution only for girls will be created. “We don’t have problems with whatever you decide. But now that a course has been charted for the NDA, a similar chart will have to be there for RIMC. The issue will have to be addressed immediately and cannot be postponed,” said the bench, giving the Centre two weeks to submit its response on an affidavit. The court took note of the fact that October 31 is the last date of filing applications and the exam for RIMC is scheduled for December 18.On August 18, the top court directed that women can also sit for the upcoming NDA exam while holding that the policy that restricts their entry into the elite institution is based on “gender discrimination”. Following this interim directive, the government on September 8 conceded that it had taken an in-principle decision to throw open the doors of NDA to women cadets, but wanted an exemption for this year’s admission. To this, the court called for an affidavit to place the developments along with the future plans. Submitting its affidavit on September 20, the government said it proposes to have the necessary mechanism in place by May 2022 -- the time by which UPSC is required to publish the first notification of the Year 2022 for entrance examination for entry to NDA. It added that a study group has been constituted by the defence services, comprising of the experts to expeditiously formulate the comprehensive curriculum for women cadets at NDA and a Board of Officers (a team of senior officers) has been convened to give a holistic and futuristic proposal for training of women cadets at NDA. The affidavit further said that various amenities pertaining to accommodation, training capacity, security and privacy arrangements, physical segregation of living quarters, associated physical and electronic surveillance measures, additional administrative and miscellaneous requirements in terms of gender specific getting ancillary requirements, etc, will have to be worked out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/womens-entry-to-nda-will-not-be-delayed-supreme-court-101632334898566.html
22-09-2021||India||₹50,000 ex gratia for Covid deaths, declares Centre||States will pay an ex gratia amount of ₹50,000 to the families of those whose deaths have been certified as Covid-19 fatalities, the Union government has informed the Supreme Court through an affidavit. The Centre added that the scheme framed by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) lays down that ex gratia compensation is also applicable to those involved in relief operations or those associated with preparedness activities, and that the states will disburse the money from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The assistance will be continued for any Covid-19 deaths that may occur in the future, added the affidavit submitted on Wednesday.The Union government contributes 75% of SDRF allocation for general category states and Union Territories and 90% for special category states and UTs such as the North-East states, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir. The compensation scheme has been put in place after Supreme Court’s direction on June 30 in a petition filed by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal. Underlining that NDMA “failed to perform its statutory duty” by not envisaging a compensation scheme, the court ordered uniform guidelines on ex gratia payments to the families of those who died of Covid-19. At the same time, the court had clarified that the amount of ex gratia cannot be fixed by the court, and that the Centre and NDMA should determine the quantum after taking into account their policies and other relief and mitigation measures already put in place. For the pandemic, NDMA had so farsaid that there was no scheme for payment of ex gratia for Covid-19 deaths due to absence of such provision under the “minimum standards of relief”. State governments were also asked by the Centre not to use the disaster relief funds in case they wish to pay compensation to the next of kin of those who died of Covid-19. Some states, such as Bihar, Karnataka and Delhi, have been paying compensation on account of Covid-19 deaths from their chief minister relief funds. After the Supreme Court sought response on compliance of its June judgment, the Centre filed an affidavit on Wednesday, stating that on September 11, NDMA decided to provide an ex gratia assistance of ₹50,000 per deceased person under Section 12(iii) of the 2005 Act which talks about “minimum standards of relief”. On the same date, NDMA wrote to all the states and UTs apprising them of the new scheme, the Centre said. The affidavit, attached with a NMDA notification, said: “The Authority recommends an amount of ₹50,000 per deceased person including those involved in relief operations or associated in preparedness activities, subject to cause of death being certified as Covid-19.” The matter is listed for hearing before the Supreme Court on Thursday, whena bench of justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna will examine the government’s compliance. The ex gratia assistance announced by the Centre has not been limited to the Covid-19 deaths that took place in the first and second waves of the pandemic. “The ex gratia assistance to families affected by Covid-19 deaths will continue to be provided for deaths that may occur in future phases of the Covid-19 pandemic as well, or until further notification,” NDMA said in the notification. To apply for ex gratia compensation, the next of kin of the deceased will be required to submit claims through a form issued by the state authority, along with specified documents including a death certificate that certifies the cause of death to be Covid-19. The Centre has already issued guidelines with regard to the issue of death certificates where it said that any death within 30 days of a positive Covid test would be considered a Covid death, irrespective of whether this happened at home or a hospital. Deaths occurring due to poisoning, suicide, homicide, or accident were excluded from the category of Covid deaths, although the top court expressed its reservation on excluding suicide deaths from the scope of Covid death categorisation. The guidelines also stated that the deaths of Covid patients who spent more than 30 days in hospital will also be treated as Covid deaths. These guidelines were also issued only after the Supreme Court, in its June 30 order, directed the Union government to come out with uniform and simplified norms for granting certificates stating the exact cause of death as “Death due to Covid-19”. Such guidelines, according to the court, were also to consider people who died within two to three months of being diagnosed with Covid-19. The court further directed the Centre to provide a mechanism for the families of those whose death certificates had already been issued to get the same corrected. India’s official death count stands due to Covid-19 stands at446,107. To be sure, this number may rise in terms of the compensation due under the expanded parameters.“DDMA will ensure that the verification, sanction and disbursement process is done through a robust, yet simple and people-friendly procedure,” the notification said, adding that all claims must be settled within 30 days of submission of required documents. The final disbursement will be through Aadhaar-linked Direct Benefit Transfer procedures, it added. The NDMAsaid that the ex gratia assistance will follow these guidelines to identify Covid-19 deaths, and any dispute will be addressed by a district-level committee with designated officers.Before arriving at the figure of ₹50,000, the NDMA saidthe stakeholders considered a host of reasons -- primary among them being the uncertainty about future Covid deaths, the possibility of further waves of pandemic due to new variants of virus, sparing funds for mitigating other natural disasters, and the payouts made to vulnerable sections of population under various welfare schemes of the Centre and states.“There is uncertainty about new variants of the virus and likely future waves. It is not possible to ascertain the total final financial burden emanating from ex gratia assistance. Financial prudence demands that we plan in a manner that assistance can be provided to larger number of people should the number of deaths rise,” the Centre stated.It also considered the financial and material assistance provided under SDRF, the money spent by central government for the nationwide vaccination drive, and relief under central welfare schemes such as PM-CARES for Covid orphans and PM Garib Kalyan Yojana package. “While Covid is an unprecedented disaster, other natural disasters that occur more frequently have not abated. It is important that sufficient funds are available under SDRF to provide a timely and effective response to other disasters as well,” the notification said. The June 30 direction by the Court on ex gratia assistance came on public interest litigations filed by advocates Gaurav Kumar Bansal and Reepak Kansal. Besides ordering compensation, the court passed directions on evolving guidelines to identify Covid deaths and to evolve a national insurance scheme for disaster deaths as per the recommendations of 15th Finance Commission. On framing a national insurance scheme for Covid-19 deaths, the Centre told the Court that it is a time-consuming process as the groundwork has to be done, insurance mechanisms analysed and the same introduced with due diligence in partnership with insurance companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50000-ex-gratia-for-covid-deaths-declares-centre-101632334897992.html
22-09-2021||India||J&K sacks 6 govt employees for ‘terror links’||Srinagar: Six government employees, including two police constables, were dismissed from their services for “anti-national activities” in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday, taking the total sackings to over a dozen since April this year. The six separate dismissal orders were issued by commissioner secretary, General Administration Department, on behalf of J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha. The orders were cleared after a designated committee in the Union territory, formed in April this year to scrutinise and recommend cases under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India, recommended their removal from government services over their alleged links with terrorists. “The lieutenant governor is satisfied under sub clause c of the proviso of clause 2 of Article 311 of the constitution of India that in the interest of the security of the state, it is not expedient to hold an inquiry in the case of Mr Showkat Ahmad Khan, constable in IRP 12th Bn, Narbal, District Budgam. Accordingly, the LG hereby dismisses Khan from service with immediate effect,” an order issued against one of the employees said. Those dismissed include, Abdul Hamid Wani, a resident of Bijbehara in Anantnag, who worked as a government teacher; police constable Jaffer Hussain Butt, a resident of Kishtwar; Mohd Rafi Butt, also a resident of Kishtwar, who was posted as a junior assistant in road & building department; Liyaqat Ali Kakroo, a school teacher and resident of Baramulla; Tariq Mehmood Kohli, a resident of Poonch, who was posted as a range officer in the forest department; and police constable Showkat Ahmad Khan, a resident of Budgam. Police have not yet released any details of the charges against these employees.After the dismissals of these employees, the government said their activities “tantamount to posing a threat to the country’s security” or they were involved in “anti-national activities”. The dismissals, however, attracted sharp reactions from various mainstream political parties and employees’ unions, who claimed the sackings were done on “flimsy grounds”. The dismissals, however, attracted sharp reactions from various mainstream political parties and employees’ unions, who claimed the sackings were done on “flimsy grounds”.Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti earlier had lashed out at the Centre for dismissing government employees in Kashmir on what she said were “flimsy grounds”.“In the middle of a pandemic, GOI should focus on saving lives instead of firing government employees on flimsy grounds in Kashmir,” she had said in a tweet.National Conference has termed the dismissal orders arbitrary. “Notwithstanding anything, most of the employees who are being shown the door at the drop of a hat were inducted into government service by former Jammu and Kashmir Governor,” an NC spokesman said. “Now, after decades, the employees are being shown the door regardless of their length of service and the resulting impact on their families. Such arbitrary action has created a fear psychosis among the employees and impaired the work culture in government departments,” he said.Former employees’ union leader and chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Forum, Abdul Qayoom Wani, expressed resentment over the dismissals, calling it a “jab on the employees’ integrity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-sacks-6-govt-employees-for-terror-links-101632334719466.html

Further, Vijayan also said that the Centre cannot say that it has no role in awarding the compensation to the victims of Covid-19.Vijayan’s remarks came after the Centre, earlier in the day, told the Supreme Court that an ex-gratia of ₹50,000, from the state disaster response fund, would be provided to the families of those who lost their lives to the pandemic. The ex-gratia would also be given to the families of victims who were involved in relief operations or activities associated with the preparedness for dealing with the pandemic, the Centre told the top court.Also read | States to provide ₹50,000 as ex gratia for deaths due to Covid: Centre tells SCMeanwhile, responding to a query regarding this submission by the Centre, Vijayan said that while the states cannot entirely distance themselves from providing the assistance, a major share of it should also come from the Centre, news agency PTI reported.

In 2014, Biden had hosted PM Modi for lunch when the former was the deputy of then-President Barack Obama. The two leaders also met in 2016 when the prime minister addressed the US Congress which was presided over by Biden.“You'll recall that there have been 3 direct phone calls between 2 of them, there are 2 major summits,” ANI quoted Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu as saying. “So, it's a continuation of that interaction.”The Indian envoy said that the two countries were frequently interacting during Biden’s first 100 days of presidency despite the pandemic and other limitations. He also pointed to the US visit by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary to highlight the intense interactions between the two countries over the months.“So, the intensity of interaction has increased as also the content,” Sandhu added.On Wednesday, PM Modi departed from New Delhi for his much-awaited visit to the US that will have six broad elements, including bilateral meeting with Biden, in-person Quad Summit, and United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) address. He is expected to hold separate meetings with industry leaders including CEOs of Qualcomm, Adobe, First Solar, General Atomics and Blackstone."My visit to US would be an occasion to strengthen the Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership with US, consolidate relations with our strategic partners - Japan and Australia - and take forward our collaboration on important global issues," the prime minister said before leaving for the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-biden-meeting-will-be-continuation-of-earlier-interactions-indian-envoy-101632329092664.html
22-09-2021||India||No all-party meet to discuss Bishop’s statement, says Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan||The Kerala government has no plans of calling an all-party meeting to discuss the situation arising out of the controversial statement of Pala Bishop Joseph Kallarangatt on “love jihad” and “narcotic jihad,” said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday. The chief minister said the religious leader’s statement was “unfortunate and uncalled for” and both (love jihad and narcotic jihad) were not based on any statistics or fact. The Bishop’s statement had triggered a war of words between different communities and opposition parties urged the government to call an all-party meeting. “How can we call an all-party meeting on such non-issues? Both are non-existent. We don’t want to call a meeting on non-existent issues. Some people are trying to exploit the situation by whipping them up and we have to isolate them first,” the CM said reeling out statistics. He said the government has information that about 100 people joined the Islamic State (IS) till 2019. Out of these 72 slipped out from countries (mainly middle-east) where they were working. This is the first time the government is admitting that 100 people from the state joined the IS. “Out of 72, 71 are Muslims. And some of the people who went to IS-held areas from north Kerala were converted much earlier. There are no complaints that some women were converted and forcibly taken to war-torn areas,” he said. Even the Union government and many courts had made it clear that such a practice never existed. He said after 21 people left from north Kerala in 2016 the special branch of police started several re-radicalisation camps to bring youngsters who were attracted to extremist forces back to the mainstream. He reiterated that social evils like narcotics have no religion and it is highly improper to put into the account of a particular religion. He said in 2020 around 4941 cases were registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and 5422 people were arrested in connection with them. “Out of these Hindus were 2700 (49.80%), Muslims 1869 (34.47%) and 853 (15. 73%) belonged to Christianity. It shows offenders belonged to all religions. Such crimes are not based on religions. There are no unusual numbers from any particular community either,” the CM said adding that some forces were trying to fish in troubled waters and their attempts would be stopped. He said strict action will be taken against those who vitiate the communal fabric of the state. When asked whether any action will be taken against the Bishop he said he had already made it clear no case will be registered against him. He criticised the opposition Congress and BJP for exploiting the issue for political gains. Opposition leaders are yet to react to the CM’s statement. Addressing a church ceremony in Kottayam on September 9, the Bishop came out against a particular community saying that Catholic girls and youth were targeted by it. “Wherever arms are not used, narcotic drugs are being used and Catholic girls turn victims. Some groups are functioning in the state to support them. To understand this, one needs to analyse how women from other religions landed in the Islamic State camps,” he said. He was referring to the trip of 21 people, including five converts to Islam, from north Kerala to Afghanistan in 2016. Muslim leaders request Bishop to withdraw statement A delegation of Muslim leaders in Kozhikode (north Kerala) on Wednesday requested Pala Bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt to withdraw his controversial statement. Many leaders said his statement had led to a polarisation and it was ideal for the religious leader to withdraw his statement that squarely blamed a particular community. “We request the Bishop to withdraw his statement. It will help pacify frayed tempers. We all are duty bound to keep amity and brotherhood for which the state is known. We also request the government to call an all-party meeting,” said Muslim League leader Sadiq Ali Shahib Ali Thangal. He said it was not ideal for a religious head to criticise another community citing a social evil and he said Muslim leaders had kept calm amid the row.. On Monday, Cardinal Mar Baselios Cleemis, head of the Syro-Malankara Catholic church, had also convened a meeting of religious leaders. After the meeting, the Cardinal said it was called neither to neither support nor criticise anyone but just to remind and request all to maintain peace and harmony in the state. The Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Conference, the highest body of Catholics, has called a meeting on Friday to discuss the issue. CM welcomes Covid-19 relief The CM welcomed the decision to pay compensation to Covid19 victims but he said it is quite unfair that states will have to take the whole responsibility. “We all know the poor economic condition of states after the Covid-19 pandemic set in. We hope the Centre will adequately compensate states,” he said adding virus cases were dipping slowly. Kerala reported 19,675 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday with a test positivity rate of 16.45% after 1,19, 594 tests. It also reported 142 deaths while the death toll crossed 24,000 (24,039).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-all-party-meet-to-discuss-bishop-s-statement-says-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-101632329919514.html
22-09-2021||India||‘India has always seen humanity as one family’: Modi at Global Covid Summit||Addressing the virtual Covid-19 summit in the United States, ahead of his meeting with President Joe Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has been an unprecedented disruption and it is not yet over. “India’s pharmaceutical industry has produced cost-effective diagnostic kits, drugs, medical devices, and PPE kits. These are providing affordable options to many developing countries,” the Prime Minister said.Modi hailed US President Joe Biden’s announcement to half a million doses of Pfizer’s Covid-19 shots to distribution among low and lower-middle-income countries. “Much of the world is still to be vaccinated. That is why this initiative by President Biden is timely and welcome,” Modi said during his speech.India has always seen humanity as one family, the Prime Minister highlighted, while thanking the countries for standing with New Delhi during the deadly second wave of the pandemic. “Earlier this year, we shared our vaccine production with 95 other countries and with UN peacekeepers. Like a family, the world also stood with India when we were going through a second wave. For the solidarity and support extended to India, I thank you all,” Modi said.He informed the global forum that two indigenously developed vaccines received Emergency Use Authorisation in India, including the world’s first DNA-based vaccine, ZyCoV-D. “Several Indian companies are also involved in the licensed production of various vaccines,” Modi added.Talking about India's Covid-19 vaccination programme  — which he said is the world’s largest inoculation campaign — Modi said, “Recently, we vaccinated about 25 million people on a single day. Our grassroots-level healthcare system has delivered over 800 million vaccine doses so far. Over 200 million Indians are now fully vaccinated."India has inoculated the highest number of beneficiaries with their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine in the world.Modi said this feat was possible through India's use of “innovative digital platform CoWin.”“As newer Indian vaccines get developed, we are also ramping up production capacity of existing vaccines. As our production increases, we will be able to resume vaccine supplies to others too. For this, the supply chains of raw materials must be kept open,” Modi said. ALSO READ | India to resume export of surplus Covid-19 vaccines next month: MandaviyaThe Prime Minister said that India is leveraging its manufacturing strength to produce vaccines for the Indo-Pacific region with the help of Quad partners. “India and South Africa have proposed a TRIPS waiver at the WTO vaccine, diagnostics and medicines. This will enable rapid scaling of the fight against the pandemic,” Modi said.He also expressed his concern on pandemic’s economic effects and called for mutual recognition of Covid-19 vaccine certificates and urged the countries to enable easier international travel.Modi left for the United States on Wednesday morning. He will hold several bilateral meetings, including with Biden, besides attending the Quad leaders summit and addressing United Nations General Assembly session during the visit which will conclude on September 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-always-seen-humanity-as-one-family-modi-at-global-covid-summit-101632329060687.html
22-09-2021||India||SC directs Allahabad HC, UP govt to find common formula for bail for convicts languishing in jail||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Uttar Pradesh government and the Allahabad High Court to come out with mutually acceptable suggestions in two weeks that could enable life convicts languishing across the jails in the state to get bail pending the hearing on their criminal appeals.The order by the Court came on a bunch of 18 petitions filed by life convicts who have been languishing behind bars for over a decade awaiting hearing on their criminal appeals. The state government had informed the Court last month that there are 1.83 lakh criminal appeals pending in the Allahabad High Court and the Lucknow Bench of the High Court.Finding this figure “astronomical”, the Court had asked the Allahabad High Court on August 25 to consider the suggestions given by the state government and evolve commonly accepted standards for granting bail to such convicts.On Wednesday, the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and BR Gavai felt that its order had not been properly understood by the High Court as the latter filed additional suggestions to those given by the state.To resolve the issue, the bench asked Additional Advocate General Garima Prashad appearing for UP government and advocate Yashvardhan for the High Court to sit together and devise a common solution to the problem.The bench said that the purpose of the order was “to work out the agreed directions which they seek from this Court” on which the Court can then give its imprimatur and remit the 18 petitions before it back to the High Court. The bench further stated that it will be open to the High Court to itself deal with the issue by passing appropriate directions to meet the problem at hand. The Court posted the matter for further hearing on October 5.The petitions filed by the 18 life convicts had sought broad parameters to expedite hearing of bail in cases where the appeals are pending for long duration. During the earlier hearing, Court had observed, “People can’t be in jail for such a long time” and said that before sending the matter to the High Court, some issues needed to be ironed out. The Court wanted the state to come out with a benchmark, such as those who had spent 10 years in prison, for release on bail. The state informed the Court that nearly 7,214 convicts across various jails in the state have crossed 10 years in jail and this category included hardened criminals, rapists, repeat offenders, kidnappers, massacre, more than three murders, habitual criminals who who do not deserve to be released on bail. The High Court in its suggestions said that period spent by the convict in jail cannot be the sole criteria for releasing them as each case should be decided on its own merits. However, it supported the suggestion of the state to consider granting bail to such convicts whose appeals were pending in High Court for more than seven years. In addition, the High Court said that rights of the victims and their families should also be considered before grant of bail to the accused in serious and grave offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-directs-allahabad-hc-up-govt-to-find-common-formula-for-bail-for-convicts-languishing-in-jail-101632327758123.html
22-09-2021||India||Why do farm concerns not get as much political attention as they should?||An analysis of the report of the latest Situation Assessment Survey (SAS), the findings of which were first reported on September 11 by HT, offers an insight into the reasons for the problems in the agriculture sector not finding a resonance in politics.A large majority of the population at the bottom of the social hierarchy in India does not have significant stakes in agriculture. The social groups, who are still invested in farming, are also the ones who are more successful in getting out of villages. This creates a political vacuum for a social-economic class that can build pressure for an effective policy framework to rescue Indian agriculture from its current crisis. Even those who are left in villages are sidetracked by other issues and unlikely to make efforts to develop a genuine farmers’ solidarity.Here are four charts that explain this argument in detail.The socially downtrodden are over-represented in rural IndiaBR Ambedkar, India’s most important social reformer and also the father of the Indian Constitution, wanted Dalits or the Scheduled Castes (SC) to get out of villages. “The love of the intellectual Indian for the village community is of course infinite, if not pathetic... What is a village but a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow-mindedness and communalism?” Ambedkar wrote.Ambedkar’s was not a subjective rant against village life, something Mahatma Gandhi, the tallest leader of the Indian freedom movement always eulogised. Dalits hardly owned any land in the village and during Ambedkar’s time, they were mostly bonded labourers for the upper caste “oppressors”. Ironical as it is, it is the upper castes which took Ambedkar’s lesson seriously and started moving out of villages. A comparison of estimated population shares of SC, scheduled tribes (ST), other backward classes (OBC), and others, shows that SCs and STs are significantly over-represented in India’s villages.Even today, a rural Dalit is more likely to be a labourer than a farmerWhat makes SAS unique among many surveys which are conducted in rural India is the fact that it separates those who are significantly invested in agriculture. To be sure, this criterion is pretty inclusive.SAS defines an agricultural household as one that has at least one member self-employed in agriculture and that produced agricultural products worth at least ₹4,000 in the 365 days preceding the survey.Among the four broad social groups in India, SCs are the only ones where the majority of rural households are non-agricultural households. More than anything else, this is a reflection of poor landownership among SCs. SCs account for 21.6% of all rural households in India, but they own just 10.2% of total land.The social asymmetry in agrarian stakes kills any potential farmer solidarityBecause SCs do not own any land, and are therefore not invested in agriculture, they end up being the biggest source of cheap and often heavily exploited labour in India’s villages, including farms.The numbers speak for themselves. SC households have a share of 21.6% in rural India, but their share among the casual work-dependent is 32.8%. In relative terms, SC households have the largest share among casual work-dependent in rural India. It is important to note that casual work-dependent households are not just those who belong to the non-agricultural household category. Even agricultural households might be dependent on casual work for their main income (so long as they produce the ₹4,000 quota from agriculture). As is to be expected, SC households have the largest relative share among casual work-dependent both among agricultural as well as non-agricultural households.Given the deeply entrenched discriminatory practices in India’s villages, an SC worker is likely to suffer more exploitation than his upper caste, even OBC peers. In fact, a 2016 Economic and Political Weekly paper by Amrita Datta at the Institute for Human Development (IHD) shows that migration might be helping those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder — the most being in Bihar. For Dalits, Ambedkar’s advice of getting out of the village is still relevant. This also means that more than one-fifth of the rural population has no material interest in fighting for policies to address agrarian distress.The Mandal rhetoric against upper caste feudalism is not true anymoreSocial justice politics in India has moved far beyond the trajectory of annihilation of caste which Ambedkar and his comrades wanted it to take. The real political game changer in social justice politics was not the rise of Dalits but that of OBCs. The OBC resurgence in politics drew a lot of initial legitimacy by claiming to challenge oppressive feudal hierarchies dominated by a handful of upper castes.While this rhetoric still continues, facts have changed dramatically on the ground. OBC landlords – if one uses the term for those who own more than 10 hectares of land – outnumber their upper-caste counterparts by a ratio of 2:1. This is most likely the result of upper castes selling their land to OBCs (the only social group which had the means to buy it) to migrate out of villages. To be sure, OBC households in general are twice the number of upper caste households in rural India. It is the fact that this ratio is maintained even among the biggest landowners is the sign of land transfer from upper castes to OBCs.These facts outline the difficulty of forming a social alliance to generate political pressure for rescuing agriculture.SCs are still the poorest and most exploited community in Indian villages, making them adversaries of the “farmers”. Anecdotal accounts do not offer any evidence that OBCs are any less oppressive in dealing with the SC worker than upper castes.Upper castes and OBCs could make a case for supporting agriculture, and they have a rich farmer class which can take a lead in this cause. But they do not see eye to eye on other political issues, especially reservations.The challenges facing political mobilisation to rescue Indian agriculture from its current crisis are partly a result of India’s feudal past. The socially downtrodden never had enough land, and hence stakes in agriculture. A democratic revolution sans redistributive reforms – land reforms were a stillborn project in most parts of India – has only complicated these problems further, where political parties find it easier to ignore the agrarian crisis and exploit other avenues for mobilising votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-do-farm-concerns-not-get-as-much-political-attention-as-they-should-101632326197324.html
22-09-2021||India||HT This Day: Sept 24, 1975 — Attempt to kill Ford foiled: President unhurt; woman held for firing shot||A 45-year-old woman fired a shot in the direction of President Gerald Ford as he left a downtown hotel yesterday, but her gun was deflected by an alert policeman just as it went off, a San Francisco policeman said. Mr. Ford was not hurt.San Francisco Police Lt. Frank Jordan said the Secret Service had taken a woman into custody identified as Sarah Moore.“She was standing 35-to-40 feet away from the President,” Lt. Jordan said. “She produced a 38-calibre revolver and fired one shot, fortunately striking no one.”Capt. William Conroy of the San Francisco police said the Secret Service had checked on the woman on Sunday night because she was on a list of potential threats to the President.“The Secret Service examined her and passed her,” Capt. Conroy said He said she was a known activist who had been involved in the massive food giveaway organized last year as an effort to free kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst.San Francisco policeman John Gleason said he was standing by as part of the Presidential Guard detail when he saw Mr. Ford walk up to the Limousine and wave to a small crowd across the street.“At that time somebody shot a gun in the direction of the President and I looked over across the street to see a chrome revolver pointed at the President.” Mr. Gleason said.Mr. Ken lacavoni, special agent in-charge of the San Francisco Secret Service office, later identified the woman as Sarah Jean Moore, 45.There was no immediate address on the woman.Mr. lacavoni also said police had recovered a 38-caliber handgun from her.He placed the time of the shooting at 3-30 p.m. (local time) and said only one shot had been fired and that nobody hit.The Presidential jet, Air Force I, left San Francisco International air- port about 20 minutes after the shot rang out.The President had arrived at the airport after a high-speed race from the city’s downtown section.Mark Knight, 22, a free-lance photographer, who was perched In a bush across the street from Mr. Ford’s car, said he was watching the President emerge from the St. Francis Hotel when he heard the shot and saw the woman.“The shot rang out, and all the attention went to her,” Mr. Knight said. “The Secret Service men were on her in a second and the crowd moved away from her. It was a women, wearing a blue pant suit and Secret Service men got on top of the President, almost, and pushed him into the car. Then they took off.”Miss Moore, who claimed to be a one-time FBI informer until a year ago, was one of the first volunteers to join the million-dollar “People in Need” food ransom programme established by kidnapped Patricia Hearst’s parents last year in an attempt to win her release from the Symbionese Liberation Army.The suspect, also known as “Sarah Jane Aalberg,” who has a 9-year-old son, also has written articles for the underground newspaper. “Berkelley Barb.” reports UPI. When she was arrested on Sunday, she was carrying 13 live rounds in her purse and police found about 100 bullets in her car.She was held on $1 million bail on a federal charge of attempted murder of the President. US Attorney James Browning said he would ask that she be examined by a psychiatrist. The man who saved the President’s life by hitting her arm to deflect the gun was identified by police as Oliver Sipple, 33, an exMarine on 100 per cent disability. Then police officer Tim Hettrien, 26, immediately put his hand around the cyclinder of the revolver to keep it from firing again, and Officer Joseph Currie, 20, put his hand on top of Hettrich’s. Earlier, police said Currie had deflected the gun.The bullet ricocheted, and, nearly spent, struck a bystander who was treated for a minor injury.Earlier in the day, police arrested a 24 year-old man, Ronald Carlo, on suspicion of wanting to kill Mr Ford. Carlo had handed a threat pning letter to a St. Francis Hotel cashier.’ A few minutes later, he began denouncing Mr Ford to a hotel porter, who called the police.According to Reuter, despite advice from his close aides and the Secret Service, the President refused to let the earlier incident upset his usual free-wheeling style of campaigning and plunging into crowds. Richard Krohm, a San Francisco businessman, who saw the second emoting incident, said he was standing about 16 metres from the President when the shot rang out. “He (Mr Ford) appeared to be gunned but no shot,” Mr Krahm said. He was crouching in the back seat of his car as it raced away,” he added.As the Presidential motorcade drove off at high speed, a young buy picked up what was believed to be the spent bullet and gave it to a policeman.Yesterday’s incident occurred just 17 days after a woman member of the Charles Manson murder cult family Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme, brandished a loaded 45 pistol in Mr Ford’s face as he walked through a crowd in Sacramento, California.No shot was fired and she was seized by Secret Service agents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-sept-24-1975-attempt-to-kill-ford-foiled-president-unhurt-woman-held-for-firing-shot-101632326138361.html

Isak-Muivah led National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM), while seeking his ouster, had claimed last year that Ravi misinterpreted the 2015 Framework Agreement between the Naga groups and the Centre and tried to manipulate it. In a statement issued in August last year, NSCN-IM said that R N Ravi was creating hurdles in the final settlement of the Naga political issue. His removal on September 9 from Nagaland is being seen as a positive step towards finalising the peace deal, especially at a time when all the members of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly have agreed to come together to push for settlement and pave the way for it. “The trust deficit between Ravi and Naga groups had deepened so much in the last two years that talks had not moved at all. The process has begun again,” said a government official. The biggest and oldest of the Naga rebel outfits, NSCN-IM had been in peace talks with the Central government since 1997 and signed a Framework Agreement (FA) on August 3, 2015, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which was to be the basis for a final deal on the long pending Naga issue. Though peace talks with NSCN-IM and other pro-talks rebel outfits (Naga National Political Groups-NNPGs) concluded In October, 2019 a formal deal to end the decades old Naga political problem is still awaited. Former Intelligence Bureau special director – Akshay Mishra is currently handling the peace talks “unofficially” but government officials familiar with the development said Mishra’s name as interlocutor will be made formal soon through a notification. Mishra has already been advising the Centre on the matters of north-east since his retirement in June this year. There are also indications that IB chief Aravind Kumar may join as an additional interlocutor for the Naga peace talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/r-n-ravi-resigns-as-naga-peace-talks-interlocutor-101632322898168.html
22-09-2021||India||‘Looking at it urgently,’ says UK envoy on vaccine certification for India||The British government on Wednesday included India’s Covishield in a list of approved Covid-19 jabs though the two sides are yet to reach common ground on certification so that fully vaccinated Indian travellers to the UK can avoid quarantine. The two countries are locked in a vaccine row as Indian nationals who have received both doses of Covishield, the local variant of Britain’s AstraZeneca vaccine, will be considered as unvaccinated and have to quarantine for 10 days under new British travel rules that come into force on October 4. UK high commissioner Alex Ellis attributed the matter to a significant shift in his country’s travel policy that was announced only on September 17 and made it clear that “Covishield is not the issue”. Talking to NDTV news channel, he declined to set a deadline for resolving the issue but said Britain is “looking at it urgently”. Early on Wednesday, the UK updated its travel guidance to include Covishield among the list of approved vaccines, along with the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson jabs and their formulations. A spokesperson for the UK mission reiterated that Britain is engaging with India to expand British recognition of Indian vaccine certification. India and the UK have held several meetings and discussions between technical experts since the beginning of this month, the latest being on Tuesday, to bridge differences over vaccine certification, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. These discussions focused on certification done through India’s CoWIN app, the security of the system, data sharing between the two sides, and reconciling the CoWIN system with the NHS Covid Pass developed by Britain’s National Health Service, the people said. There were also some concerns about the security of the certification system, the people said without going into details. Ellis said the UK was shifting its travel policy from being country-focused with red, amber and green lists to a single list that combines incidents of Covid-19 and vaccination. India was on the amber list of countries. Over the last couple of weeks, there were detailed conversations between builders of the Indian and UK apps that covered their working and security protocols, he said. The UK has to “have confidence” in the Indian app as the movement of people from both countries could affect public health, he said. “It’s not a question of doubt, it’s a question of the normal processes which technical experts go through in order to [have] the assurances on both sides about how our certification works,” Ellis said. “We are moving at great speed to try and resolve any outstanding questions with India so we can give the best possible advice for ministers to take a decision, and which they will want to do quickly,” he added. National Health Authority CEO RS Sharma, whose organisation operates the CoWIN app, told CNBC-News18 that technical discussions between the two sides were closed, and the Indian side had “not encountered any concerns” during talks. Sharma said he had met the British envoy on September 2 to discuss the matter. India’s vaccine certificate is digitally verifiable as it contains an encrypted QR code with the private key of the department. Any QR code reader with the Indian key will be able to establish the authenticity of the certificate, Sharma said. CoWIN uses established global encryption standards that satisfy the World Health Organization’s standards, he said. On Tuesday, India urged the UK to change its policy requiring visiting Indian nationals to quarantine even if they are fully vaccinated, describing it as discriminatory, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla warned New Delhi could impose “reciprocal measures” against countries that don’t accept Indian vaccine certification. The issue was also raised by external affairs minister S Jaishankar at a meeting with his British counterpart Liz Truss on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on Monday. However, Ellis played down the prospect of the issue affecting bilateral ties and said the matter had emerged because of the large number of people travelling to the UK. He noted Britain had issued 65,000 student visas this year, up 30% from last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/looking-at-it-urgently-says-uk-envoy-on-vaccine-certification-for-india-101632321397622.html

The ex gratia will also be given to kin of Covid-19 victims who were involved in relief operations or associated with “preparedness activities”, the court was told.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued guidelines on ex gratia for Covid-related deaths after the apex court directed the Centre in June entitling kins of Covid victims to an ex gratia amount under the Disaster Management Act 2005. The court had then granted Centre six weeks to fix the amount of ex gratia and extended the deadline multiple times.“By the time you will take steps, even the third wave (of Covid pandemic) will be over. Our orders directing correction of death certificates was passed long back. You had agreed to file a response on our directions by today. We will now grant you a last opportunity,” the bench of justices MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose said after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had sought another extension.The compensation will be paid for future Covid-related deaths as well, the government told the court. The cause of death will need to be certified as Covid-19 in accordance with the health ministry guidelines to claim the compensation. In the affidavit submitted to the top court, the government said that all claims related to Covid deaths must be settled within 30 days of submission of the required documents, adding that the amount should be disbursed through the Aadhaar-linked direct benefit transfer procedures.India has reported more than 4,45,000 virus-related deaths so far, of which the majority were reported during the disastrous second wave of the Covid pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-will-provide-50-000-as-ex-gratia-for-deaths-due-to-covid-19-centre-tells-sc-101632317085203.html

This is the first time that the disease has been reported in the state. The disease was initially detected in Assam last year and later followed by cases in Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. A total of 87 samples were sent to the Guwahati-based North East Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and ADMAC Core Lab on August 26 after officials observed a series of deaths of pigs since mid-August earlier this year. Tripura has till date recorded nearly 160 deaths of pigs.“Out of 87 samples, they confirmed four samples had African Swine Fever DNA virus. We got the reports on September 15 and later started following guidelines as laid down by the Central government in this case,” said Tripura nodal officer of Disease Investigation Laboratory Dr. Mrinal Datta. He, however, ruled out chances of human beings getting affected by the virus if they consumed pork. “People do not stand a chance of getting infected with the virus,” said Dr. Datta. He is also the deputy director of the Animal Resources Development department. The Animal Resources Development department has categorised an area within one kilometre radius from the epicentre as an infected zone and another 10 kilometres as the surveillance zone. “Culling has started within the one kilometre radius since September 18. So far, 28 pigs have been culled. The number is expected to increase today,” said the official. The population of pigs in Tripura was estimated at 3.58 lakh as per the latest animal census report published in 2020.The state has a total of 16 pig breeding farms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-reports-four-positive-cases-of-african-swine-fever-101632316957328.html

The senior Congress leader said he will pit a strong candidate against Sidhu so that he can't become the chief minister, triggering speculation over Captain's further political plans. As Amarinder Singh resigned on Saturday amid the ongoing party infighting, he revealed how humiliated he felt because of the latest development in the party. He felt hurt that the party high command started losing trust in him. The Congress Legislature Party meeting was called on Sunday to decide on Amarinder Singh's replacement without his knowledge. Before the meeting, Amarinder Singh went to teh Governor's House and resigned. He said he had informed his decision to party president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday morning.On Wednesday, two days after Charanjit Singh Channi took oath as the new chief minister of the poll-bound state, Amarinder Singh said that he had offered to resign three weeks ago. But at that time, he was asked to continue. "If she had called me and asked me to step down, I'd have. As a soldier, I know how to do my task and leave once called back," Singh said.Also Read | How Amarinder Singh resignation as Punjab CM unfolded: A timeline"Priyanka and Rahul are like my children. This should not have ended like this. I am hurt," Singh, who was a friend of the late Rajiv Gandhi, said adding that they have been clearly misguided by their advisors. The dramatic development in Punjab and the way Amarinder Singh's long chief ministership was put to a drastic end was unexpected given Amarinder Singh's close relationship with the Gandhi family. Amarinder Singh, himself, said he did not understand why the party replaced him so close to the polls when people, as Singh claimed, were happy with his government. The conflict between Amarinder Singh and Navjot Sidhu was going on when Sidhu was elevated to the post of the Punjab Congress president despite Amarinder's objection. Amarinder Singh restrained Sidhu's advisors from commenting on general issues after their comments drew flak. As the clash was going on, Amarinder lost the support of around 60 MLAs which eventually led to the overnight shuffle in Punjab.Referring to Sidhu's hug to Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa during the Kartapur event, Amarinder Singh had earlier said that he will oppose if Sidhu is picked up as the CM. Calling Sidhu "anti-national, dangerous, unstable, incompetent," Amarinder Singh said that Sidhu as CM of the border state will be a threat to national security.Charanjit Singh Channi was announced the chief minister on Sunday, a day after Captain's resignation. But Congress leader Harish Rawat clarified that Punjab will go to the polls under the leadership of Sidhu. The comment even left Congress leaders baffled.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-priyanka-like-my-children-amarinder-singh-says-he-won-t-let-navjot-sidhu-become-cm-101632316389803.html
22-09-2021||India||BJP, Congress no longer ignore AAP as it makes attractive poll promises||With Uttarakhand in poll mode ahead of the next assembly elections in 2022, both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Opposition Congress are no longer ignoring the new entrant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). As it is making poll-centric promises related to key issues such as electricity and employment, the BJP and Congress have been attacking the AAP.Union minister Prahlad Joshi, who is the BJP’s in-charge of the elections, attacked Delhi’s chief minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal for making “false” promises. He accused him of doing “nothing for development in Delhi” and accused him of trying to “befool people of Uttarakhand on same lines.”Former chief minister Harish Rawat, who heads Congress’s election campaign committee, has also lashed out at the AAP.Experts say the chances of AAP forming the government in 2022 seem to be almost nil, but the party has managed to mark its presence in the state and made the polls a tripartite contest. “The AAP was not considered a serious contender in 2022 till last year. But it has gathered steam with the recent announcements made by Kejriwal during his visits... both the BJP and Congress are wary,” said political commentator Jai Singh Rawat.Also Read | Uttarakhand Cong writes to Speaker to disqualify MLA who defected to BJPKejriwal on Sunday announced if AAP is voted to power in Uttarakhand, it will give employment to a member of every household. He also promised ₹5,000 stipend till unemployed people get jobs. Kejriwal has announced AAP will provide 100,000 government jobs within six months of coming to power. He earlier promised 80% reservation for the people of Uttarakhand in jobs. On August 17, Kejriwal announced AAP will make Uttarakhand the spiritual capital for the Hindus. He promised in July 300 units of free electricity if AAP is voted to power.Rawat said the announcements are well thought out. “They know that what will make them the talk of the town in the election year...they have succeeded. Now, whether they actually win the elections in 2022 to fulfil the promises is a different matter...but they have got the attention of the people...”Another political analyst SMA Kazmi said Kejriwal’s announcements have made the people think because when it comes to providing free electricity, he has done that in Delhi.The leadership of BJP and Congress claim in the public that AAP will fail “to get votes on false promises” but privately they acknowledge it cannot be taken lightly.“We are taking it very seriously... At a recent core group meeting of the party chaired by ...Joshi, AAP was part of the agenda...,” said a BJP leader on the condition of anonymity.A Congress leader said the AAP poses a challenge for the party. “With its entry in the polls, it is the Congress which will be impacted the most because the voters will have now a second significant option against the BJP. So, it is the Congress which will face a divide in its vote bank.”BJP state president Madan Kaushik questioned AAP’s promises for jobs and free power and asked whether it has managed to do the same in Delhi. “No. In Delhi, where it is in power, it has made many areas electricity-free under the promise of free electricity. It will not be able to play the same card here because the people are smart.”Congress state president Ganesh Godiyal accused the AAP of spreading lies and making unrealistic promises. “People of Uttarakhand are not going to fall for their lies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-no-longer-ignore-aap-as-it-makes-attractive-poll-promises-101632315157459.html

The five tourists were rescued by lifeguards posted at the waterfall after being stranded.“The group of five were travelling to Dudhsagar along the rocky terrain when they decided to drive across a swelling river. On reaching the halfway mark, the vehicle stalled and refused to budge. The swelling waters gushed into the vehicle making it unstable. The men tried to escape but were unable to do so due to the force of the water,” Drishti, the lifeguarding agency, said in a statement. “The men were secured and brought back to safety. The vehicle was marooned in the river and backup was called to assist with its recovery,” the statement added. The Dudhsagar waterfalls --- a world-famous attraction lies in the heart of the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary in Mollem along Goa’s border with Karnataka. The access to the waterfall is via a mud road that is unusable during the monsoons owing to the fast flowing swollen Dudhsagar River making it dangerous to cross. A recent move by the Goa government to build an all-weather road leading to the falls was grounded by the Bombay High Court which asked the Goa government to first obtain a clearance from the National Wildlife Board before any work can start.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-delhi-tourists-rescued-from-swollen-river-in-goa-after-vehicle-stops-midstream-101632312337053.html

22-09-2021||India||Uttarakhand Cong writes to Speaker to disqualify MLA who defected to BJP||Uttarakhand Congress president Ganesh Godiyal has written to the assembly Speaker demanding disqualification of MLA from Purola constituency, Rajkumar, who defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) about a week ago. In his letter to Speaker Premchand Aggarwal on Tuesday, Godiyal cited the anti-defection law for his demand. “We have urged the Speaker to end Rajkumar’s assembly membership because he joined the BJP without resigning from his membership of both the Congress and the assembly...this disqualifies him from the latter as per the anti-defection law in Constitution,” said Godiyal about his letter. The ruling BJP however, said they will “accept whatever decision is taken by the Speaker.” Party state general secretary Kuldeep Kumar said, “BJP has no involvement in the matter and can’t say anything because it is a constitutional matter on which the Speaker has to take the decision.” Also Read | Uttarakhand forest dept catches wildlife smuggler with 33 turtles, bookedWhile legal experts seem to agree with the Congress, they have questioned the delay in reaching out to the Speaker. Senior advocate of Uttarakhand high court Kartikeya Gupta said, “As per the anti-defection law, MLA Rajkumar gets disqualified from his membership of state assembly...However, it depends on the Speaker.”Political analyst Jai Singh Rawat questioned the “delay” in lodging a complaint against the defection by Congress leadership. “Rajkumar switched sides on September 12 and Godiyal wrote to the Speaker on September 21. It should have been done the same day or the next day. Why was there so much delay? Also, it should have been done by the leader of Opposition but this doesn’t show there is no coordination between him and the party state president,” said Rawat. Rajkumar joined the ruling BJP in its party headquarters in Delhi on September 12 in the presence of Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, party state president Madan Kaushik and party Rajya Sabha member Anil Baluni. Rajkumar, who was a BJP MLA from 2007-2012 from Sahaspur constituency of Dehradun, fought independently from Purola in 2012 and lost. He then joined Congress for 2017 elections and won from Purola. Despite several attempts, he couldn’t be contacted. Interestingly Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party national convener during his Kumaon visit on Sunday also said his party welcomed all the good people in the BJP and the Congress. The anti-defection law was added to the Constitution as the tenth schedule by the 52nd amendment during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure as the Prime Minister in 1985 according to which a member can be disqualified in two circumstances -- if they “voluntarily give up membership of a party” of they are disqualified for voting (or abstaining from voting) contrary to the directive issued by the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cong-writes-to-speaker-to-disqualify-mla-who-defected-to-bjp-101632309396645.html

The Indian vaccine supplies included grants, commercial export and doses for the COVAX facility.India halted its vaccine export in April as it faced severe shortage of vaccines amid a deadly second wave of Covid-19 infection.

Among those dismissed were two police constables.According to available reports, the government initiated the steps after a designated committee in the Union territory mandated to scrutinise cases under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution recommended the removal of the six employees from government service over terror links. This provision gives the government the power to sack employees without an inquiry if "the President or the Governor, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the interest of the security of the State, it is not expedient to hold such inquiry". The order came days after the UT administration issued instructions on periodic character and antecedents verification of government employees. According to instructions issued by the general administration department of J&K, every government employee is mandatorily required to maintain absolute integrity, honesty and allegiance to the Union of India and its Constitution and not do anything that is unbecoming of a government servant. Last week, the UT administration also said government employees would not be issued a passport unless they got a vigilance clearance from their respective departments.In July this year, the government had dismissed 11 of its employees, including sons of Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin and two from the police department, for allegedly working as overground workers for terrorist organisations, officials said on Saturday.(With inputs from bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-govt-sacks-6-employees-over-terror-links-2-cops-among-those-dismissed-101632303394713.html

22-09-2021||India||Travelling to UK? Know latest rules on Covishield, quarantine||The United Kingdon on Wednesday recognised Covishield, a formulation of Oxford's AstraZeneca vaccine, as a recognised vaccine in the country. However, there is no clarity yet on whether people fully vaccinated with Covishield will be exempt from the mandatory quarantine period or not as the revised UK travel guideline is silent on India's vaccine certificate and earlier the UK raised some issues with the Co-Win certification.  The new rules are applicable from 4am on October 4.Here is all you need to know about the ongoing controversy:Is Covishield, Covaxin recognised by the UK?The UK government has recently recognised Covishield, as it is a formulation of AstraZeneca. Covaxin is not recognised in the United Kingdom.Will Indian travellers fully vaccinated with Covishield be exempt from mandatory quarantine?If a particular vaccine is approved, it means travellers who have been inoculated with the vaccine will not have to undergo quarantine there. But according to reports, the UK government is yet to recognise the Co-Win certificate. So, as of now, there is no clarity on whether Indians vaccinated with both doses of Covishield will be exempt from quarantine or not.Can unvaccinated Indians travel to the UK?Yes. Unvaccinated travellers can travel to the United Kingdom, provided they take a pre-departure Covid-19 test, book and pay for day 2 and day 8 tests to be taken after the arrival in England and complete a passenger locator form anytime in the 48 hours before arriving in England.If the UK government does not recognise Co-Win certificate, there will effectively be no difference between vaccinated or unvaccinated Indians as everyone will have to undergo the mandatory quarantine period. Since there is still time for the new vaccine rules to become effective, it is expected that both governments will work out a solution where people fully vaccinated with Covishield will be exempt from quarantine. What is UK's problem with the Co-Win certificate?Co-Win is the one-stop-shop software for India's all vaccine-related issues. It generates the certificate which according to top government officials is of international standard. Initially, the UK government did not even keep India on the list of countries whose vaccines are recognised in the UK. After it mentioned Covishield following India's nudge as India told that a similar action might be taken against people travelling to India from the UK, the government included Covishield and clarified that they do not have a problem with the vaccine, but they have some doubts regarding the vaccine certificate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/travelling-to-uk-know-latest-rules-on-covishield-quarantine-101632301880170.html

It ordered the Administrative Committee entrusted with the audit to complete the exercise preferably within three months.A bench of Justices UU Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat, and Bela M Trivedi passed the order on an application of the panel.Thiruvananthapuram district judge heads the committee, which has been entrusted with the interim charge of running the temple following a July 2020 Supreme Court order.The committee sought to audit the temple trust, run by the erstwhile Travancore royal family, citing serious financial difficulties in running the shrine’s affairs. According to the committee, the monthly expenses of the temple are about ₹1.25 crore, but it hardly manages to get ₹60-70 lakh. When it sought details of accounts from the trust, the latter moved the top court seeking clarification.Also Read | SC dismisses C’garh govt plea in toolkit case against ex-CM Raman Singh, PatraThe bench said, “We have held that the order passed by this court on July 13, 2020, was not confined to the temple but also the trust in light of the report submitted by the amicus curiae and the submissions made on behalf of the trust.”The Supreme Court in July 2020 set aside a Kerala high court order in 2011 allowing the state to take over the temple. It held the temple will be managed by the erstwhile royal family and will enjoy the rights of carrying out puja and other rituals. As an interim arrangement, the top court directed the constitution of the committee to manage the temple’s affairs. Senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam, the amicus curiae, recommended the audit covering 25 years and the top court allowed it.The committee interpreted this to mean audit of the temple and the trust. A private firm engaged by the committee for carrying out the audit asked the trust to submit income and expenditure details.Senior advocate Arvind Datar, who represented the trust, told the Supreme Court the direction for audit concerned only the temple. The committee cited the amicus curiae’s report and added it said both the trust and the temple have to be audited. It added the trust had cash reserves of ₹2.8 crore and assets worth about ₹2 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-paves-way-for-audit-of-sree-padmanabha-swamy-temple-trust-101632299795966.html
22-09-2021||India||Bengal residents get vaccinated in Bihar to escape paying ‘illegal commission’||30-year-old Wasim, a resident of Bhaluka village of West Bengal’s Malda district says he saved ₹500 and a lot of time and energy by opting to receive the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine at a public health centre in Bihar’s Katihar district, instead of Bengal.“In Bengal, we have to pay ₹600, even ₹800, but in Bihar, health officials have charged just ₹100,” he said, suggesting there was a huge difference in the alleged illegal commission one was required to pay in the two states to get vaccinated. He is not the only one to make such a claim, another resident from West Bengal’s Malda district, 35–year-old Mohammad Saifuddin too got vaccinated at Amdabad public health centre (PHC) in Katihar last Saturday. He said his experience wasn’t any different. “We are happy paying ₹100 as against the ₹600 one has to pay in our state” he alleged “There is complete chaos in West Bengal in administering jabs,” he added. Some other Bengal residents said they preferred Bihar’s PHCs for vaccination as they were nearer. “In Bengal, we have to walk about 10 kms to get vaccinated, but Amdabad PHC is just 2km from our village,” said Mohammad Munna, resident of Harischandrapur area of Malda district.These cross-border trips and allegations of illegal commission sought for vaccines that are meant to be given free of cost at government health centres came to light on Monday after a few men from Bengal posted video clips on social media narrating their experiences of vaccination centres in their state of residence and neighbouring Bihar.Taking a strong view of the allegations made in the video clips, Katihar district magistrate (DM) Udyan Mishra asked Katihar civil surgeon DN Pandey and Manihari sub divisional officer (SDO) Kumar Siddharth to probe if officials at the PHC in Bihar were charging ₹100 as ‘convenience’ fee for vaccinating beneficiaries.“It is totally wrong to charge money for free vaccines” the Katihar DM said, and added, “Manihari SDO and Katihar civil surgeon have been asked to probe the matter.”Mishra said the veracity of the video clips will be examined first, however, he agreed that a large number of residents from neighbouring Bengal were regularly visiting health centres in Bihar to get vaccinated. Amdabad PHC officials, however, denied the allegations of charging a fee for vaccination and suggested that the video posts could have been aimed to “defame” the health system in Bihar.A senior Katihar district administrative officer claimed that the vaccination drive in Bengal was not as smooth as Bihar. However, a senior health department official from West Bengal said they had not received any such complaints and would act if they received one in future. Katihar created a record by administering 86,081 doses on September 17 against the target of 80,000. In Bihar, over 50 million people have been given at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-residents-get-vaccinated-in-bihar-to-escape-paying-illegal-commission-101632299015562.html

22-09-2021||India||Biggest stockpile of rhino horns consigned to flames in Assam on World Rhino Day||Nearly 2,500 rhino horns, claimed to be the world’s largest such stockpile, were consigned to flames at Bokakhat in Assam on the World Rhino Day on Wednesday amid chanting of hymns and blowing of conches with the aim to dispel myths associated with hunting for rhino horns.Total of 2,479 horns were burnt in six large iron pyres, specially made for the event, at a stadium located 240 km east of Guwahati. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, accompanied by several cabinet colleagues, lit the pyres remotely through drones. “Through this event, we want to convey to the world that rhino horns are just a mass of compacted hair and there is no medicinal value to them. We want to urge people not to kill these rare animals or buy their horns based on superstitions or myths. We should allow rhinos to live and grow naturally,” Sarma said. “Some are saying that instead of destroying the horns we should have sold them. But like the way we can’t sell seized drugs to earn revenue, the same way a government can’t earn money by selling rhino horns. In Africa, they have burned seized rhino horns, but the quantity is not that large. I think today we are setting a world record,” he added. Sarma said from now on, all rhino horns recovered from animals dying naturally or during disasters and accidents will be burned every year and won’t be stored for long. The burnt horns had been seized from poachers and traders of animal parts or recovered from dead rhinos in the state’s national parks and wildlife sanctuaries since 1979 and were stored in 12 district treasuries. While 2,479 of these were destroyed on Wednesday, 50 horns associated with pending court cases will be kept in treasuries and 94 others will be preserved for exhibition or educational purposes. The state government said it will set up a natural history museum near the Kaziranga national park to keep the preserved pieces. Before destroying them, experts had verified the horns using scientific methods at the treasuries where they were kept. Each horn was cleaned, weighed, photographed, labeled with a unique barcode, DNA samples extracted and packed and sealed again in presence of several people. “This is a rare event and since there’s god present in each being, we decided to consign the rhino horns to flames with Vedic rituals. The horns were verified in a very transparent manner before destroying them. We also want to convey a stern message to poachers not to dare target another rhino in Assam,” forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya said. Of the total 2,623 horns kept in treasuries, 15 were of African rhinos (which have two horns) and 21 were found to be fakes. The longest horn measured 57 cm and the heaviest weighed 3 kilos. The average height and weight of the horns were 13.77 cm and 560 gm respectively. The total weight of the horns destroyed on Wednesday was 1,305 kilos. Though there is no scientific basis, rhino horns form part of traditional medicine in some Asian countries including China and Vietnam. Each horn, which is made up of keratin (found in hair, nails), is valued over thousands of US dollars, leading to rampant killing of rhinos in Asia and Africa. “Scientifically, rhino horns don’t have any value, but they have a price in some markets based on superstitions about its medicinal properties. If we preserve them, it will convey the message that we believe in such superstitions. It’s good that the horns stored in Assam are being destroyed,” Rathin Barman, joint director, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) said. “I congratulate the Assam government on the decision to burn the rhino horns and send the message that they don’t have any medicinal value. The horn looks best on a living animal and is not suited for any other purpose,” said Bibhab Talukdar, chief executive officer (CEO) of Aaranyak, a wildlife non-governmental organisation (NGO). Assam is home to the world’s largest population of one-horned rhinos. According to a 2018 census, there are nearly 2,650 rhinos in the state with around 2,400 of them concentrated in Kaziranga National Park. Rhinos are listed in Schedule 1 of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 as an endangered animal and there is an international ban on trade of rhino horns under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna). The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 allows for destruction of wildlife parts (including rhino horn) under Section 39 (3). On September 16, the Assam cabinet had approved destruction of the horns kept in treasuries. In recent years, in a bid to save rhinos from poaching, the state government has taken measures like arming forest personnel with sophisticated weapons and increased surveillance using drones. The measures have helped one-horned rhinos move up from ‘endangered’ to ‘vulnerable’ category in IUCN’s red list of threatened species.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biggest-stockpile-of-rhino-horns-consigned-to-flames-in-assam-on-world-rhino-day-101632298475581.html

However, Indians vaccinated with both doses of Covishield will still need to quarantine in the UK due to an issue over ‘vaccine certification’, even though the country has been added to the ‘amber list’ according to the latest travel rules.The guidelines provided in the latest advisory suggest that Britain has no problems with the formulation of the Covishield vaccine, but with the vaccine certification provided by India. Notably, India had earlier protested the UK's non-recognition of the Covishield vaccine and warned of “reciprocal measures” if the “discriminatory policy” was not amended.Also Read | Working with India, says UK on recognising Covishield vaccine certificateIn its new advisory, the UK said that a traveller will be considered fully vaccinated if they are inoculated with a full dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Janssen vaccines from a relevant public health body in select countries.

"For the government's programme, the ideal gap remains 12 weeks."India doubled the gap between the AstraZeneca vaccine's two doses in May to make sure more people were inoculated with at least one dose when supplies were scarce at the height of the country's outbreak this year.AstraZeneca recommends the second dose of its Covid-19 vaccine be taken four weeks after the first shot, but says on its website there is a "trend of increased efficacy with a longer than 4-week dosing interval". The World Health Organization recommends an interval of eight to 12 weeks.The sources, who declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, could not say when the changes will be implemented.The health ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.India's total vaccine output has trebled since May to 300 million doses a month. Less than a quarter of the production is sold by private hospitals while the rest is provided by the government free of cost.India has administered at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in 65% of its 944 million adults and two doses in 22% of adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-may-allow-smaller-gap-between-2-doses-of-covishield-vaccine-101632295918768.html

I look forward to continue working with you to further strengthen India-Canada relations, as well as our cooperation on global and multilateral issues,” Modi tweeted as he embarked on a visit to the US. Trudeau, who has been in power since 2015, and his Liberal Party are set to win the most seats in Canada’s Parliament but are expected to fall short of the 170-seat threshold for a majority. US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson are also among world leaders who have congratulated Trudeau, who has been governing with a minority in the House of Commons since 2019. Also Read | Visit an opportunity to consolidate ties, says PM Modi before leaving for USRelations between India and Canada have been strained in recent years over a range of issues. Ties nosedived during a disastrous visit to India by Trudeau in 2018 and have never really recovered since then. At the time, the Indian side was upset by perceived links between members of Trudeau’s cabinet and pro-Khalistan elements in Canada. New Delhi also believed these members of the Canadian cabinet had interfered in the Indian government’s outreach to pro-Khalistan elements. More recently, Trudeau had angered the Indian side when he said in December 2020 that his government had conveyed its concerns over a protest by Indian farmers against new farm laws to New Delhi.

It said observation in the order terming the First Information Report (FIR) filed in the case as politically motivated will not come in the way of the high court in finally deciding the matter.The Chhattisgarh government approached the Supreme Court against the high court’s June 14 interim order. A single judge of the high court passed the order saying there was no case against Singh and Patra. The two were accused of spreading fake news and promoting enmity between classes through their tweets related to the alleged toolkit.Also Read | Can’t deny them their right: SC on Centre’s plea to defer NDA exams for womenThe BJP has alleged the toolkit was prepared to build a biased narrative over the government’s handling of the second wave of the Covid-19, and the Central Vista Project. The Congress has dismissed the allegations.The high court issued a notice on the basis of Singh and Patra’s pleas against the FIR and sought a response from the state government. It said the averments in the FIR reflected that by the tweets, Congressmen “are aggravated which clearly indicated that no public peace or tranquillity is being adversely affected”. The court linked the allegations in the FIR to political rivalry between two parties.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the state government, cited the high court’s observations, and asked: “What is left for me to go back for?”A bench of Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli was not inclined to entertain the petition. “There are a large number of cases alleging politically motivated FIRs across courts in this country. This court cannot be dealing with all such cases. Why should we give any preference to you?”Singhvi said the least the state government expected was a fair hearing before the Supreme Court and this was not possible with the high court’s observations.The bench told Singhvi, “Do not waste your energy. We are not interfering with the HC (high court) order. Let the high court decide the matter finally. The state would also have the opportunity to challenge the final order before this court.” Dismissing the appeal, the bench said, “...we request the high court to dispose of the petition expeditiously.”Singh and Patra were booked on May 19 on the complaint by Akash Sharma, the Chhattisgarh chief of ruling Congress’s students’ wing. The two moved the high court for quashing the FIR against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-c-garh-govt-plea-in-toolkit-case-against-ex-cm-raman-singh-patra-101632295595115.html

Let's begin from this year."Stating the armed forces were best suited to deal with “emergencies”, the apex court said, “We don't want women to be denied their right. Needful be done by the defence department in collaboration with UPSC.”A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy directed the Union Public Services Commission (UPSC) to give wide publicity to the new admission policy through advertisements so that the order is translated into effect and more women are encouraged to apply.On Monday, the Union government informed the Supreme Court the NDA will be ready to welcome the first-ever batch of women cadets in January 2023 after they sit for the entrance exam in May next year.“Entrance examination for entry into NDA is held twice in a year and the government proposes to have the necessary mechanism in place by May 2022, i.e. the time by which the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) is required to publish the first notification of the Year 2022 for entrance examination for entry to NDA,” read the government’s affidavit submitted before the bench.The Centre’s response was made on the basis of a judgement passed by the Supreme Court on August 18 which held the policy that restricted entry of women in the NDA was based on “gender discrimination”. The court allowed women to sit for the upcoming entrance examination in November this year, breaking a glass ceiling that has held women back for 65 years.With agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-deny-them-their-right-sc-on-centre-s-plea-to-defer-nda-exams-for-women-101632292908502.html

CPT was continuously investing in term deposits and the same was allegedly pre-closed by the accused one after another after the bonds were created.Around ₹100.57 crore was transferred from CPT in five investments against which 45 term deposits of different amounts were created. Out of the amount invested, ₹55.19 crore could be frozen, and the remaining ₹45.40 crore has been swindled by the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-arrests-two-foreigners-in-chennai-port-trust-bank-fraud-case-101632281433460.html

22-09-2021||India||Gadkari seeks policy for sleep detection sensors on commercial vehicles||Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday directed officials to work on a policy for having sleep detection sensors on commercial vehicles at par with the European standards.Speaking at a National Road Safety Council (NRSC) meeting, Gadkari underlined the need for fixed driving hours for truck drivers similar to pilots to reduce fatigue-induced road accidents. He asked the NRSC members to work in diversified areas of road safety so that more lives can be saved.As of 2020, there were nine million truckers and transporters involved in carrying freight across India. About a quarter of the truck drivers, who participated in a 2018 study conducted by automotive lubricant maker Castrol, complained of sleep deprivation. Up to 53% reported fatigue, insomnia, obesity, backache, joint and neck pain, poor vision, breathlessness, stress, and loneliness.The European Union’s System for Effective Assessment of Driver Vigilance and Warning According to Traffic Risk Estimation (AWAKE) project has developed guidelines for fatigue warning systems. AWAKE employs both driver state measures and traffic risk measures to conclude the need for warning drivers and the type of warning called for. The driver state measures include eyelid movement, changes in steering grip and driver behaviour (including lane tracking), use of accelerator and brake, and steering position. The system determines if and what information or warning messages need to be communicated to drivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gadkari-seeks-policy-for-sleep-detection-sensors-on-commercial-vehicles-101632280653511.html
22-09-2021||India||African swine fever detected in Tripura, culling of pigs begins around epicentre||Tripura is the latest state to register an outbreak of African swine fever in pigs with three of 87 samples testing positive for the virus in Kanchanpur sub-division under North Tripura district.The director of the animal resource development department K Shashi Kumar told reporters on Wednesday all pigs within 1km radius of the epicentre will be culled and a 10-km zone will be under surveillance.“Three of 87 samples of pigs tested positive for African swine fever. We'll cull all pigs within 1km from epicentre and declare the 10km area as a surveillance zone. We've issued notification and begun the culling process,” he told news agency ANI.On Monday, the authorities had declared the exotic pig breeding farm in Kanchanpur the epicentre of the infection. “To control the disease and prevent infection, the exotic pig breeding farm in Kanchanpur has been declared as the epicentre of the disease under the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animal Act,” an official from the department said.According to experts, African Swine fever does not infect or spread to humans even though it is deadly and highly contagious for pigs.The department had also announced a compensation ranging from ₹2,200 to ₹15,000 for private farm owners for culling their source of income. As per established protocol, the caracas will be buried deep inside the ground after the process of culling concludes.Last month, this highly contagious viral infection had afflicted pigs in Mizoram, claiming the lives of over 25,000 pigs in five months since late March, and leading to substantial losses of more than ₹121 crore. Aizawl was the worst impacted district in the state where more than 11,000 pigs died after being infected with African swine fever.With agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/african-swine-fever-detected-in-tripura-culling-of-pigs-begin-around-epicentre-101632280141841.html

However, on this occasion, the feast was organised in honour of a dead dog they loved dearly. The dog had been raised by one of the shopkeepers, who said he loved the mongrel as if she was his daughter.Most of these shopkeepers of Bhadrak town run fast-food stalls. Dearly attached to the bitch named Champi for the last 13 years, when it was first handed over to Sushant Biswal, the group invited over 500 people to a meal on the 11th day of its death, which took place on September 10.“It was like no other dog in the area. I got it from a man 13 years ago. I treated the mongrel as my daughter. It never mingled with other dogs and would prowl around my shop most of the time. At night, it slept inside my shop. It was like part of my family,” said Sushant Biswal, a fast food stall owner, who has now put up a framed photograph of Champi in front of his shop. A couple of shopkeepers in the area got their heads tonsured on the occasion.Biswal said the mongrel would not eat food that was thrown on the ground. “We would give it biryani, rasagola, roti or rice on a plate. Even if someone gave it a biscuit, it would be put on a plate or else the dog would not touch it,” he said.Last month, officials of a police station in Odisha cremated a monkey in accordance with Hindu rituals. The officials of Balichandrapur police station in Jajpur district had formed a close bond with the animal.In May this year, a dog owner in Bihar’s Samastipur region carried out a funeral procession for his pet dog that died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-shopkeepers-throw-community-feast-for-500-people-in-memory-of-mongrel-101632279693255.html

Another milestone in our journey towards a clean and green India led by PM Shri @NarendraModi Ji," Yadav tweeted.Blue Flag certification is a globally recognised eco-label accorded on the basis of 33 stringent criteria in four major heads which are environmental education and information, bathing water quality, environmental management and conservation and safety and services in the beaches.The Blue Flag beach is an eco-tourism model endeavouring to provide the tourists/beachgoers clean and hygienic bathing water, facilities, a safe and healthy environment and sustainable development of the area.The recommendations are done by an independent national jury composed of eminent environmentalists and scientists.Blue Flag beaches are considered the cleanest beaches of the world, according to the ministry.The Blue Flag label is accorded by the international jury composed of eminent members - United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP), United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), Denmark-based NGO Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE) and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).A waving Blue Flag is an indication of 100 per cent compliance to the 33 stringent criteria and sound health of the beach, the ministry had earlier said.India had started its journey of sustainable development of coastal regions on World Environment Day in June 2018 by launching its beach cleaning campaign – I-AM- SAVING-MY-BEACH simultaneously at 13 coastal states and thereafter implementing the ministry's coveted programme Beach Environment and Aesthetics Management Services (BEAMS).“The Ministry of Environment, in its pursuit of sustainable development of the coastal regions of India, embarked upon a highly acclaimed and flagship programme BEAMS, which is one of the initiatives under its integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) approach that the ministry has undertaken for the sustainable development of coastal regions of India, with a prime objective to protect and conserve the pristine coastal and marine ecosystems through holistic management of the resources,” the ministry said in a statement issued here on Tuesday.The objective of the BEAMS programme is to abate pollution in coastal waters, promote sustainable development of beach facilities, protect and conserve coastal ecosystems and natural resources, and seriously challenge local authorities and stakeholders to strive and maintain high standards of cleanliness, hygiene and safety for beachgoers in accordance with coastal environment and regulations.“In the last three years or so, our ministry has achieved commendable results in the environmental management of these 10 beaches which include sand dune restoration and nourishment of 95,000 sqm (approx.) with native plantation; reduction in marine litter by 85 per cent and marine plastic by 78 per cent in the last three years; scientific and responsible disposal of 750 tonnes of marine litter; improvement in cleanliness level from ‘C’ (poor) to ‘A’ (outstanding) through scientific measurement system,” the statement said.The Environment Ministry said it has also saved 1,100 ml/year of municipal water through recycling; educated around 1,25,000 beachgoers about responsible behaviour at the beaches; provided alternate livelihood opportunities to 500 fishermen families through pollution abatement, safety and services and has also increased footfall for recreation activities at the beaches by approximately 80 per cent leading to economic development.The ministry said it is committed to developing and deliver 100 more beaches under its ICZM initiative in the ensuing five years.In December last year, the ministry had virtually hoisted the international Blue Flags in eight beaches across the country. The flags were also simultaneously hoisted on these beaches physically by state ministers and senior officials of the respective state and Union territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-more-beaches-in-india-awarded-prestigious-blue-flag-tag-details-here-101632270649443.html

22-09-2021||India||Bill for setting up of university on land acquired for industries gets Karnataka assembly nod||The BJP-led state government in Karnataka on Tuesday passed a bill to allocate the setting up of a private university on land acquired for industries at one-third of the cost of acquisition.The bill was brought in the ongoing monsoon session of the state assembly in which Dr Ashwath Narayan, Karnataka’s minister for Higher education, tabled the bill to allow Chanakya university to be set up in 116 acres in the Aerospace Park near Devanahalli, on the outskirts of Bengaluru.The Congress took serious objection to this as it was brought up for discussion after 8 pm on Tuesday which they called a “scam”.Siddaramaiah said that there was no provision to give the land for setting up for a university when it was acquired by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) for the sole purposes of giving it to industries.“Around 116 acres of land was acquired at a cost of ₹1.5 crore per acre. The cost of acquisition itself is around ₹170 crore and you are giving it at ₹50 crore,” he said.The former chief minister also said that the land was developed further and the total cost to the government was in excess of ₹300 crore and it was “loot” that the government was giving it to a private university for ₹50 crore.Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said that it was a not-for-profit model and had a comprehensive multi-subject curriculum. “When there is a big reform, there is apprehension,” Bommai said.The chief minister also justified the allocation since similar concessions are given to industries to create jobs and the government will continue to dole out concessions to organisations who come in “good faith” and give their children education with the future in mind.The contentious bill was passed amid chaos and even speaker Visweswara Heggade Kageri too weighed in his favour to give such universities an opportunity.“We should give more encouragement to institutions that promote Indian cultural values. Today’s education has been westernised,” he said.He added that the intent to give encouragement to such universities is to ensure that future generations do not become more westernised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-for-setting-up-of-university-on-land-acquired-for-industries-gets-karnataka-assembly-nod-101632257775490.html

The identities of the victims are yet to be determined.Pandey said that the preliminary information indicates that it was due to a domestic gas explosion and that the search was on for any other fires or survivors. He said that several persons in adjacent flats were evacuated.“Until now, two persons have died. Now we are making an effort to take the body out,” he said.The fire department has also deployed the aerial ladder platform, a new machinery that can elevate to a height of 54 meters, to check for any other fires in any other part of the building.Joshi Srinath Mahadev, deputy commissioner of police (south-east) said that all evacuation was complete and people residing in adjacent flats were all moved out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-die-in-bengaluru-apartment-fire-101632257415659.html
22-09-2021||India||Bill to protect religious structures passed in Karnataka assembly||The Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government on Tuesday managed the passage of the Karnataka Religious Structures (Protection) Bill, 2021 just one day after it was proposed and then tabled in the lower house of the ongoing monsoon session of the state assembly.The bill, which will now be tabled in the upper house, was passed even as legislators across the aisle, including of the BJP, sought to get clarifications on the scope of the bill and its intent to protect religious structures from being demolished as per the 2009 Supreme Court order.The bill primarily provided protection to all religious structures that came up on public land before the law comes into force. It means that the authorities would not be able to demolish religious structures on public land unless there is a specific court order for demolition of a religious structure, reading of the bill shows.JC Madhuswamy, Karnataka’s minister for minor irrigation, law and parliamentary affairs, said that structures of all religions will come under the ambit of this new bill.“There was lacuna and to fill it up we have brought this (bill),” Madhuswamy said, reacting to allegations over the government’s inability to stop the demolition of a temple in Nanjangud of Mysuru district on September 12.The bill comes days after a video of a temple in Nanjangud being torn down by an earth mover went viral on social media with Mysuru-Kodagu member of Parliament Prathap Simha raising the issue to target authorities who were carrying out the drive with no consultations. The demolition also saw right-wing groups attack the BJP over the move, even as the Basavaraj Bommai government claimed that it did not have any prior information.Siddaramaiah, the Congress’ leader of the opposition and former chief minister, questioned how the temple was demolished without the government’s knowledge and sought to know why no action was taken against the district officials for carrying out the act.“You are saying that from now on no temple should be demolished but what about the ones (demolished) earlier? You are bringing this bill because the Hindu Jagrana Vedike and Hindu Mahasabha pressurised you and the government got scared,” he said.The regularisation of illegal encroachments for religious purposes not just circumvents the court orders but is also likely to set a precedent in the state where a significant chunk of government land, lakes, forests and other places are lost to land sharks and others.“I have an apprehension that government land that is set aside for various purposes, if temples are built there and in deemed forests and in such zones, will this law be applicable there?” Krishna Reddy, the Janata Dal (Secular) legislator from Chintamani questioned.The Bommai government is moving quickly to pass a bill which will not just minimise the backlash but also has the potential to pander to religious groups ahead of the yet-to-be announced zilla panchayat elections as well as the 2023 assembly polls.“Provision empowers the state government to make rules regarding the circumstances in which protection to religious structures in respect of which any case relating to the removal is pending in any court of law,” the bill states.The Karnataka high court had pulled up authorities for failing to take action against illegal structures built on government land, prompting the Mysuru district administration to act. On August 12, the HC said the Supreme Court has stated that all illegal religious structures that were built after September 29, 2009 shall not be tolerated. The HC is hearing a petition to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court order on the matter. “It is considered necessary to provide protection of religious constructions on public places constructed before the date of commencement of this act, in order to protect communal harmony and not hurt the religious sentiments of the public,” the bill states in its objects and reasons.The bill further states that the provisions “empower the state government to make rules regarding the circumstances in which protection to religious structures in respect of which any case relating to the removal is pending in any court of law.”Several BJP legislators too sought to know the wordings of the bill which stated that no action can be taken against an official if the demolition was done in “good faith”.Bommai clarified that no action can be taken against the district officials since they were following court orders.Madhuswamy said that the demolition was done due to “over enthusiasm” of the district officials and to avoid a repeat of the incident, the bill was introduced.The chief minister said that there were 315 illegal structures of temples, mosques and churches in Mysuru district and of this 161 were demolished between 2010-2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-to-protect-religious-structures-passed-in-karnataka-assembly-101632257296572.html
22-09-2021||India||Law against involuntary religious conversions on anvil: BJP minister in Karnataka assembly||The Karnataka government on Tuesday said it is deliberating on introducing a law to “check involuntary religious conversions”, after a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator raised the issue in the state assemblyearlier in the day, claiming his mother was “brainwashed” into converting to a different religion. Gulihatti D Shekar, the legislator, said there has been “heightened activity” around conversions. “In Chitradurga district and my constituency (Hosadurga), around 15,000-20,000 people have already been converted,” he said.Shekar said his mother was taken to a church by some people from the missionary and asked not to apply vermillion (sindoor) on her forehead, remove all photos of Hindu gods and puja items from the house. He claimed his mother was also asked to listen only to “Christian songs” and has even changed her ringtone, which has become an embarrassment within the family. “Dalits, backward classes, and even Muslims are converted,” he said.Shekar said those who resist are slapped with false cases of atrocities and even rape, among other charges. “If some want to convert, it is their wish, but they should leave all the benefits of the faith or group they were entitled to and include themselves in the one they are joining,” he said.Araga Jnanendra, the state home minister, said the government is aware of these developments and deliberating on the law and other measures at the earliest. He sought details of organisations slapping false charges. Jnanendra said the state would investigate the charges and take action against such people or missionaries. Other legislators supported the proposal for a law against conversations, which they said was disturbing the peace of society.Assembly speaker Visweswara Heggade Kageri said he had spoken about the issue in detail between 1999 and 2001 during the SM Krishna-led Congress government in the state. “There are many other states that have this law, and it would be useful if we too bring in something,” said Kageri.Devanand Fulsasingh Chavan, a Janata Dal (Secular) legislator, alleged Christian missionaries were targeting the vulnerable Banjara community in his constituency of Nathan in the Vijayapura district. He added entire settlements of these communities got converted in recent years.BJP-ruled states such as Madhya Pradesh have criminalised what they call forced religious conversion, including interfaith marriages. Critics of the legislation say they are misused to target minorities.There have also been allegations, especially against Christian missionaries, that they lure weak and oppressed people and convert them by promising monetary and other rewards.“For adult baptism, we ask the concerned party to go to the court to make an affidavit or a notary. In that we record that it is not out of force and out of voluntary commitment to come to the church for baptism,” Rev PK Samuel, the Bishop of the Church of South India (CSI) told Hindustan Times on Tuesday.The Reverend said that the CSI is a mainline church and does not use forceful methods. “Unless there is a court affidavit or notary, we do not allow baptism in our church. All the priests have this instruction. The pattern has not been there now but for the last 20-25 years,” he said. There are 125 churches in the Diocese. “We allow children because the parents belong to the church,” the Reverend added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-against-involuntary-religious-conversions-on-anvil-bjp-minister-in-karnataka-assembly-101632257055414.html

The programme officer Shailendra Pataudi and zonal officer Brijmohan Bhadoriya were also suspended. An inquiry has also been ordered in this regard, Pal said.“The incident of throwing idols in a pond has hurt the religious sentiments of people,” Pal said.Based on a complaint lodged by an employee of the IMC, an FIR under section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) was registered against nine civic employees, an official from Chandan Nagar police station said.The video of the incident has gone viral on social media, in which IMC employees can be seen throwing the Ganesh idols in a hurried manner, even as enraged citizens were heard saying that their religious sentiments were being hurt and strongly criticising the civic administration.Congress MLA Sanjay Shukla with other party leaders staged a protest in Indore demanding action against senior officers.Shukla said, “It was the responsibility of senior officers of IMC to hold the immersion of idols collected from different parts of the city but they deputed the work to contractual employees. The action and FIR on contractual employees are not enough. The state government should take strict against IMC officers for hurting the religious sentiments.”BJP leaders said it is a serious issue and all the people at fault will be punished. BJP MP from Indore, Shankar Lalwani, said, “The conduct of employees is unacceptable and they have already been punished for that. An FIR has been registered against them. The inquiry is being held by IMC and further action will be taken on the basis of findings of reports.”(With inputs from Neha Jain in Indore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-indore-civic-body-employees-booked-for-disrespecting-ganesh-idols-madhya-pradesh-police-101632256695597.html
22-09-2021||India||Couple held in Afghan heroin seizure at Mundra Port got ₹10-12 lakh: Probe||New Delhi: Initial investigations into the seizure of the largest ever single cache of Afghan heroin from Mundra port last week have so far revealed that a Chennai couple whose import firm received the drugs in the garb of talc powder received a commission of ₹10-12 lakh for the job, officials familiar with the probe said on Tuesday.The couple – Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali and her husband Machavaram Sudhakar – are being interrogated about the “bigger players” behind smuggling of such a huge consignment. They were arrested last week after 3,000kg high-quality heroin worth ₹21,000 crore in the international market was seized by the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) from two containers shipped from Kandahar and imported via Iran’s Bandar Abbas port by their Vijaywada-registered firm – Aashi Trading Company.An official dealing with narco-terrorism said they have information that Vaishali and Sudhakar were taking instructions from some people based in Afghanistan and Iran. “Their role in smuggling drugs previously in the garb of imports is being investigated but they appear to be small players as their commission was very low”.Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has jumped to probe a money laundering angle in the recovery as it wants to unearth the international syndicate behind it and seize their assets.“With possible Taliban-Pakistan-Afghanistan link emerging in the high-quality heroin consignment smuggled through a shell company, it is a fit case to be probed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and to seize the assets of conspirators,” said an ED officer, asking not to be named.HT reported about the largest-ever heroin consignment seizure on Monday.The Congress tried to corner the government and Adani Group, which runs the Mundra port in Gujarat, over the seizure. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said: “The drugs sent from Afghanistan to India via Iran port were found on Mundra port of Gujarat. It is a serious issue for India when you have a look at its price and amount. It is a conspiracy to throw our youth into drug addiction. The money made through the sales of these drugs in India is used to fuel terrorism against our nation. This issue is serious and raises a lot of questions.”He asked why the Centre did not appointed a regular director-general of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for the past 18 months. The Adani Group said in a statement that it has no policing authority of ports. “The law empowers the government of India’s competent authorities such as the Customs and the DRI to open, examine and seize unlawful cargo. No port operator across the country can examine a container. Their role is limited to running the port. We sincerely hope that this statement will put to rest the motivated, malicious and false propaganda being run on social media against the Adani Group. APSEZ is a port operator providing services to shipping lines, We have no policing authority over the containers or the millions of tonnes of cargo that pass through the terminals in Mundra or any of our ports”, said a spokesperson of Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd (APSEZ).” Apart from the Chennai couple, DRI has arrested four Afghan nationals and an Indian citizen from Delhi-National Capital Region in last two days while several places have been raided, during which additional 20kg heroin and 8kg cocaine were seized.The Vijaywada Police said in a statement on Tuesday that the drugs consignment has no link with the city except that an address linked to the Chennai couple is from there. “It is learnt that Durga Purna Vaishali, resident of Chennai has taken GST registration in August 2020 on the address at Satyanarayana Puram, Gadiyaramvari Street, Vijaywada. Sudhakar, a resident of Chennai, is the husband of Vaishali. The above address building is owned by Govindaraju Taraka who happened to be the mother of Vaishali,” said the Vijaywada Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/couple-held-in-afghan-heroin-seizure-at-mundra-port-got-10-12-lakh-probe-101632255915335.html

In all, 10 individuals linked to JEI, most of them senior office-bearers, have been questioned in national capital Delhi during the past week about the source of funds, utilization of funds, key players in India and links with Pakistan, a person aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.According to NIA, JeI’s Kashmir chapter raised donations in India and abroad, ostensibly for charity, but diverted the funds raised to finance violence and secessionist activities.In a statement issued after the raids in August, NIA said the funds raised by the group “are also being channelised to proscribed terrorist organisations such as Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and others through well organised networks of JeI cadres”.People aware of the details said more Jamaat functionaries will be called for questioning in the coming days as NIA looks to unearth the entire terror-funding network, links with separatist leaders, madrasas run by the organisation and foreign trips by its office-bearers.The Jamaat-e-Islami came into existence in 1941, spearheaded by Moulana Abul Alla Madoodi and with its headquarters at Lahore. After Partition, JeI Hindi separated from this body and established its headquarters in Rampur, Uttar Pradesh. Its Kashmir chapter, established in 1945, started following directions from Pakistan’s JeI after Jammu and Kashmir’s accession to India.JEI, J&K, was banned in February 2019 after the Pulwama terror attack in 2019, in which 40 Indian troopers were killed and which brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. The ban was upheld in September 2019 by a tribunal set up to review the decision under the anti-terror law, which noted that 179 criminal cases were filed against individuals linked to the group including 10 cases being probed by NIA.Over 100 JeI members, including its chief Abdul Hameed Fayaz were arrested by the J&K Police after the group was banned. Fayaz continues to be behind bars.A senior official said JeI, J&K is intrinsically linked with the United Jehad Council based in Pakistan, which is the “umbrella organisation” of all major terrorist outfits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-questions-10-individuals-linked-to-jei-jammu-and-kashmir-in-terror-funding-case-101632255557180.html
22-09-2021||India||BJP may drop 50% of MLAs for 2022 assembly polls to blunt anti-incumbency||NEW DELHI: After changing chief ministers in Gujarat and Uttarakhand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is looking to drop as many as half of the sitting legislators to blunt anti-incumbency in the states going to polls in 2022, said party functionaries aware of the details. In the previous assembly elections, the party had dropped 15-20% of the sitting MLAs, but the figure could be much higher this time given public dissatisfaction over a host of governance issues, said a senior party functionary. Assembly elections will be held in Punjab, Manipur, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh in 2022. “In several states, the party has carried out ground surveys to assess the mood. MLAs were also asked to submit their report cards of the work done in the last five years, which were tallied with the party’s own findings. Those whose performance has not been up to the mark will not be repeated,” the functionary said, requesting anonymity. The legislators are being assessed on parameters such as the spending of local area development funds, projects done to empower the marginalised, and their contribution to the big-ticket Seva Hi Sangathan programme — the party’s welfare programme launched during the pandemic. Surveys were done across constituencies where people’s feedback on the government’s performance was sought. “The Covid-19 pandemic came with an unprecedented challenge. While the government did its bit by ramping up the health infrastructure, ensuring vaccination and scaling up medical supplies, the party also did its bit by organising relief work. The party president (JP Nadda) had asked each state unit to carry out campaigns to feed the needy, assist those who lost their jobs and ensure 100% vaccination in their respective booths under the Seva Hi Sangathan campaign. The work done by the MLAs on the seva front will also be counted,” said the functionary. Countering anti-incumbency has been a key concern for the party. It is for this reason that the central leadership decided to replace Vijay Rupani as the CM of Gujarat. An all-new cabinet was also sworn in to help reinvigorate the party cadre in the state that will go to the polls towards the end of 2022. “It is not unusual for the party to deny sitting legislators tickets based on various reasons. For instance, in Rajasthan in 2018, the BJP dropped 43 sitting MLAs, including four ministers. In Jharkhand, too, over a dozen sitting MLAs were dropped for younger and newer faces representing women and SC/ST communities,” he said. Performance isn’t the only factor that will determine ticket distribution. According to a second functionary, given the growing clamour for a caste-based census, BJP will also have to pick faces that will strengthen its outreach among castes that it courts for favourable electoral outcomes. The BJP has been eyeing a coalition of non-dominant castes to build its support base. In states such as Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, it had invested in the non-dominant castes, but with a change in political discourse following the demand for a caste census, the party has had to revisit its policy. Subsequently, it has appointed a Patidar CM in Gujarat and a Thakur CM in Uttarakhand. “The caste of a candidate has always been a key factor in deciding tickets. The party does not believe in appeasement of any caste and has ensured that government’s policies at the Centre and in the states benefit people across castes and classes,” said the second functionary based in Uttar Pradesh. The issue of giving tickets to turncoats will also feature prominently. In the past few years, the BJP leadership has been accused of overlooking the party cadre for those who come from other political parties. “In many instances, the turncoats did not win. Take the case of Gujarat. In the 2017 polls, 81 BJP MLAs were repeated, while the rest were fresh faces or those who had contested in elections before 2012. Four of the six Congress turncoats who were given tickets lost. Similarly, in West Bengal recently, there was a lot of resentment in the party cadre for giving Trinamool Congress turncoats tickets and party positions,” said the first functionary. Dropping sitting MLAs serves the twin purpose of diverting public attention and mitigating public anger, said professor M M Semwal, head of the political science department at the HNB Garhwal Central University in Uttarakhand. “When governments fail to deliver on their promises, they pass the buck. Instead of taking collective responsibility, the government will blame the individual legislators, so when elections come and people ask questions they react by such posturing,” he said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-may-drop-50-of-mlas-for-2022-assembly-polls-to-blunt-antiincumbency-101632255195211.html
22-09-2021||India||Education ministry forms panel to draft new national curriculum framework in line with NEP||New Delhi: The Union education ministry on Tuesday constituted a 12-member national steering committee to develop the new national curriculum framework (NCF) in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The committee will be headed by K Kasturirangan, who had also led the NEP 2020 drafting committee. The national curriculum framework serves as a guideline for syllabus, textbooks, teaching and learning practices in the country. India is currently following its fourth national curriculum framework that was published by the NCERT in 2005. Officials at the education ministry said the timeline for the development of new framework is three years. According to a statement issued by the Union education ministry, the committee will develop four curriculum frameworks -- national curriculum framework for school education; national curriculum for early childhood care and education; national curriculum framework for teacher education; and national curriculum framework for adult Education. “The Committee will discuss different aspects of these four areas keeping in focus all the recommendations of NEP 2020 for proposing curriculum reforms… All the national curriculum frameworks would also reflect upon the implications of situations such as COVID-19 pandemic on respective areas for future,” the statement said.The committee included Mahesh Chandra Pant, Chancellor of the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration; Govind Prasad Sharma, chairman of the National Book Trust; Najma Akhtar, Vice Chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia; TV Kattimani, Vice-Chancellor of Central Tribal University of Andhra Pradesh; Jagbir Singh, Chancellor of the Central University of Punjab; and MK Sridhar, who was a member of the NEP 2020 drafting committee, among others.While the tenure of the committee is three years, its term may be expanded as per the requirement, the statement added.A senior official said a tech platform will be set up to receive inputs from the states after wider consultation at district and block level. “The consultation will be completely digital. The committee will take these inputs in consideration while drafting the framework. The committee will be free to invite subject experts, scholars, educationists, etc. as and when required and deliberate and decide upon the course of actions with the objective to meet the timelines of the strategy for the development of the NCF,” the official said.The committee will only finalise the framework after incorporating suggestions received from various stakeholders including states and Union Territories, Executive Committee (EC) and General Body (GB) of the NCERT and Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE). The Director of NCERT will assist the committee to complete its module.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/education-ministry-forms-panel-to-draft-new-national-curriculum-framework-in-line-with-nep-101632254355197.html

I am not granting any stay. I am issuing notice, you file your reply. Then only I can pass an order,” the judge said.Abhishek and Rujira, who were asked by the agency to personally appear before it in Delhi today, have contended that they are residents of Kolkata and should not be compelled to join the probe in the national capital.Opposing the plea, the ED said that the money laundering case has national and trans-national ramifications and its investigation is not restricted to any police station or area.Appearing for the couple, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the ED had no jurisdiction to call his clients to Delhi for probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-declines-to-stay-ed-summons-to-tmc-leader-101632253746850.html
22-09-2021||India||Couple held in Afghan heroin seizure case got ₹10-12L: Probe||Initial investigations into the seizure of the largest ever single cache of Afghan heroin from Mundra port last week have so far revealed that a Chennai couple whose import firm received the drugs in the garb of talc powder received a commission of ₹10-12 lakh for the job, officials familiar with the probe said on Tuesday.The couple – Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali and her husband Machavaram Sudhakar – are being interrogated about the “bigger players” behind smuggling of such a huge consignment. They were arrested last week after 3,000kg high-quality heroin worth ₹21,000 crore in the international market was seized by the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) from two containers shipped from Kandahar and imported via Iran’s Bandar Abbas port by their Vijaywada-registered firm – Aashi Trading Company.An official dealing with narco-terrorism said they have information that Vaishali and Sudhakar were taking instructions from some people based in Afghanistan and Iran. “Their role in smuggling drugs previously in the garb of imports is being investigated but they appear to be small players as their commission was very low,” the official said.Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has jumped to probe a money laundering angle in the recovery as it wants to unearth the international syndicate behind it and seize their assets.“With possible Taliban-Pakistan-Afghanistan link emerging in the high-quality heroin consignment smuggled through a shell company, it is a fit case to be probed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and to seize the assets of conspirators,” said an ED officer, asking not to be named.HT reported about the largest-ever heroin consignment seizure on Monday.The Congress tried to corner the government and Adani Group, which runs the Mundra port in Gujarat, over the seizure. Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said: “The drugs sent from Afghanistan to India via Iran port were found on Mundra port of Gujarat. It is a serious issue for India when you have a look at its price and amount. It is a conspiracy to throw our youth into drug addiction. The money made through the sales of these drugs in India is used to fuel terrorism against our nation. This issue is serious and raises a lot of questions.”He asked why the Centre did not appointed a regular director-general of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for the past 18 months.The Adani Group said in a statement that it has no policing authority of ports. “The law empowers the government of India’s competent authorities such as the Customs and the DRI to open, examine and seize unlawful cargo. No port operator across the country can examine a container. Their role is limited to running the port. We sincerely hope that this statement will put to rest the motivated, malicious and false propaganda being run on social media against the Adani Group. APSEZ is a port operator providing services to shipping lines, We have no policing authority over the containers or the millions of tonnes of cargo that pass through the terminals in Mundra or any of our ports”, said a spokesperson of Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd (APSEZ).”Apart from the Chennai couple, DRI has arrested four Afghan nationals and an Indian citizen from Delhi-National Capital Region in last two days while several places have been raided, during which additional 20kg heroin and 8kg cocaine were seized.The Vijaywada Police said in a statement on Tuesday that the drugs consignment has no link with the city except that an address linked to the Chennai couple is from there. “It is learnt that Durga Purna Vaishali, resident of Chennai has taken GST registration in August 2020 on the address at Satyanarayana Puram, Gadiyaramvari Street, Vijaywada. Sudhakar, a resident of Chennai, is the husband of Vaishali. The above address building is owned by Govindaraju Taraka who happened to be the mother of Vaishali,” said the Vijaywada Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/couple-held-in-afghan-heroin-seizure-case-got-10-12l-probe-101632253510408.html

22-09-2021||India||Delhi HC overrules LG’s objection to govt’s Covid deaths panel||The Delhi high court on Tuesday overruled the objections of the Lieutenant Governor (LG) against the constitution of a high powered committee (HPC) by the Delhi government to ascertain causes of death, including those due to alleged shortage of oxygen, during the brutal national second wave of Covid-19 in April-May this year.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said that it does not see any difficulty in the constitution of the committee, which, besides finding the reasons for the death, will recommend the compensation amount for the families of those deceased.The court said that the committee will pass a reasoned order without importing the liability on the hospital, and specified that the HPC will be permitted to go ahead if the Delhi government clarifies that any compensation will be paid and absorbed by it alone.“The issue here is a legal issue. Can you determine a fault-based liability by a committee (and) fix liability on a third party, which not only puts financial liability but tarnishes professional reputation?” the court said. “...you say you will fix liability, you are entering into the domain of judiciary and medical council. You can’t do it.”The bench said that HPC will not overlap with the areas already being looked into by the subcommittees constituted by the apex court, adding that the Supreme Court-appointed committee was seized of issues at the “macro level” while the HPC proposed to look at “micro situations”.“[The] Supreme Court [order] is on logistics and not specifics... We take it that there should be over overlap,” the court stated.The ruling came on a plea by Riti Singh Verma, who sought that all Covid-19 deaths be probed by the expert committee after her 34-year-old husband died of Covid-19 at the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Rohini, on May 14 during the second wave.In a statement on Tuesday, the Delhi government said, “We respect the court’s direction and are grateful for the same. The Delhi government has been serious about the deaths in the capital due to lack of oxygen during the corona pandemic. The Delhi government wants the truth to come out...Finally, today the court has upheld the stance of the Delhi government.”On May 27, the Delhi government constituted a committee to probe the causes of death during the second wave and grant ex-gratia payments to the victims.However, the LG had put it in abeyance on June 8, saying that the matter was pending before the Supreme Court and that the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was yet to come out with uniform compensation guidelines.Between June and August, the Delhi government and the LG’s office have gone back and forth over the matter. The AAP government in June proposed a new committee to look into cause of death, a request that was turned down by the LG, who holds a veto over most administrative matters. The government reiterated at the request, which too was rejected. In both cases, the LG’s office cited the Supreme Court-appointed panel’s probe, according to people who asked not to be named.At its peak, Delhi recorded around 28,300 cases in a day and a positivity rate exceeding 36% on April 20 and 22 respectively. Around that time, at least 31 people are believed to have died because of oxygen shortage in two separate incidents in two separate hospitals – Jaipur Golden and Batra hospitals. The Union government told parliament in July that no state has reported deaths due to oxygen shortage during the April-May wave of infections, a position that was the trigger for Delhi government to reiterate its request for a probe panel in August.On Tuesday, the court noted the submission of the Delhi government that the criteria for determining compensation will be open to scrutiny and that the task of the committee will not overlap with that of a subgroup constituted by the Supreme Court on allocation and utilisation of oxygen.Appearing for the Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra told the court that the HPC was only a “fact-finding committee” which would not attribute any fault or negligence to a hospital and “compensation was purely going from the government”.He told the court that compensation of up to ₹5 lakh would be calculated by the HPC on the basis of an objective criteria decided by it, which would be open to a challenge by any party.Mehra told the court that the scope of work of the HPC would be different from the committee constituted by the Supreme Court, and it would be different from the ₹50,000 ex gratia being offered by the state government.Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, for the LG, requested the court to defer passing any order and wait for the guidelines of the NDMA on uniform compensation in accordance with the order of the SC.However, the court said that there was no reason to wait for the findings of the committee constituted after the orders of the apex court.Earlier, the Delhi government had told the court that the LG was behaving in an “obstructionist manner” and his decision to put the proposal for the committee in abeyance is “misconceived”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-overrules-lg-s-objection-to-govt-s-covid-deaths-panel-101632252873355.html
22-09-2021||India||Supertech MD faces jail if no refund in a week||The national consumer commission has sent a strong message by sentencing the managing director (MD) of Supertech to three years in jail for not refunding a homebuyer after its failure to hand over possession of his house in Uttar Pradesh’s Yamuma Expressway Industrial Development Area (YEIDA) for several years.The commission on Monday issued an arrest warrant against Supertech MD Mohit Arora, while directing that its order shall come into effect after seven days if the builder fails to deposit around ₹1.79 crore by then.The money is to be paid to Brigadier Kanwal Batra (retired) and his daughter Aakriti Batra, who jointly purchased a villa in Supertech’s Upcountry project, offered by the builder in December 2013 at a cost of approximately ₹1.03 crore, which the builder promised to deliver in August 2014. Supertech could not give possession of the villa for want of clearances, nor did it comply with the commission’s 2019 judgment to refund the money with interest despite undertakings.The development comes days after the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of two 40-storey residential towers of Supertech’s Emerald Court project in Noida over grave violation of building norms, which, the court said, was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida authority and the builder.“We know how you (Supertech) will pay,” remarked the bench, which comprised presiding member C Vishwanath and justice Ram Surat Ram Maurya, while issuing the order which could set the benchmark for action against real estate developers that flout the consumer court orders.The commission, in its order, said that in view of non-compliance and dishonouring of his commitment, Arora was being sentenced to three years in jail under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and a warrant of arrest was being issued.This warrant, the commission said, shall not be executed if Supertech deposits the money before it within a week.It underlined that Supertech was “evading the implementation of the decree passed by the Commission” in April 2019, obligating the builder to refund the money to Brigadier (retired) Kanwal Batra, along with an interest of 10% per annum from the date of each payment made by the home buyer to Supertech.Section 27 of the 1986 Act clothes a consumer forum with the powers of a judicial magistrate, having an authority to order arrest and impose a jail term up to a maximum of three years over non-compliance with its orders.When contacted, Batra told HT: “I booked this villa in 2013 and Supertech had promised me to hand over the possession in August 2014. Seven years on, the builder has failed to get the approvals which activated the 2019 judgment to refund my money with an interest. They did not comply with even this order despite repeated promises made. There was grave misconduct on the part of the Supertech MD which has led to this order.”Advocate Vrinda Kapoor, who represented Batra before the commission, said: “This is a eureka moment not only for my client but also for all other similarly situated home buyers, who are made to run from pillar to post, first for their houses and then for refunds. The commission has sent out a very strong message to all the builders that you cannot bail out after making promises.”During the proceedings on Monday, the consumer commission took strong exception to the fact that Supertech had neither refunded the amount it had received from Batra as consideration of the house along with compensation, nor had Arora cared to show up despite the commission’s previous directive.Mohit Arora, Supertech MD, told HT: “We have the highest respect for the commission. We will comply with the commission’s order by Thursday. Supertech will initiate the process on Wednesday and will complete compliance by depositing the money by Thursday.”On July 20, Arora remained present before the commission after a bailable warrant was issued against him. This warrant was cancelled on his assurance that Supertech will make all payments to Batra within 60 days. While fixing September 20 as the next date of hearing, the commission then directed that Arora “shall be present on each day of hearing”.However, Supertech moved another application in the meantime, asking for 12 months to clear the dues. This plea was rejected by the commission on September 13, pointing out that the bailable warrant issued against Arora was cancelled only on his undertaking to pay within 60 days.When the hearing commenced on Monday, the counsel appearing for Supertech said that the amount was yet to be paid to Batra. Arora was conspicuous by his absence, annoying the commission further.Meanwhile, Supertech also moved the Delhi high court against the commission’s order of September 13. The hearing in this matter also came up before the high court on Monday, where Supertech’s lawyer conceded that the commission already issued an arrest warrant against Arora earlier in the day.In view of the panel’s latest order, Supertech had to withdraw its petition from the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supertech-md-faces-jail-if-no-refund-in-a-week-101632252631575.html

HT has seen the document.The Dalit girl was found dead in a crematorium near Purani Nangal village on August 1, sparking protests by activists and politicians. Days later, police arrested the main accused, 55-year-old Radhey Shyam and his three associates, Kuldeep Singh, Salim Ahmed and Laxmi Narayan.“Accused Radhey Shyam threw his own mobile phone (that also had porn content), bedding of the takht (Where he and Kuldeep raped deceased) and foot wear of the deceased in the burning pyre of the deceased. The traces of the mobile phone have been found in the ash lifted by the forensic team from the pyre of the deceased,” the police said in its charge sheet.The charge sheet accuses the four people of rape, wrongful confinement, murder, destruction of evidence, and under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Prevention of Atrocities Act.On September 9, a local Delhi court took cognisance of the charge sheet, summoning the accused on September 29.In its charge sheet, the police, quoting the statement of the mother given to the magistrate, said that an alleged middleman, identified as Naresh, offered the victim’s family a bribe of ₹20,000 and also threatened them. The document also said the victim’s parents were confined to the crematorium and not allowed to go anywhere, and also threatened.The police, quoting the mother’s initial statement to the police, said that Shyam used to take massages from the girl and give her ₹10 in exchange.According to the document, the mother also alleged that she was called by Shyam through an e-rickshaw driver on August 1 and when she went to the crematorium, she found the accused cooking non-vegetarian food and drinking alcohol in the hall with iron shutters. The footwear (chappal) of her daughter was also lying in the hall, the mother’s statement said.Police said the mother alleged that she wanted to touch and check the body of her daughter but Shyam did not let her. Shyam told her that the girl has to be cremated else it would become a police case and doctors would take out all her organs, according to the mother’s statement.The police said the accused tried to stage the death as electrocution and threw water on the clothes of the child.The accused say the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from a cooler. The girl’s family alleged that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after raping her. The police also maintained that the death did not take place due to electrocution and instead the girl child was suffocated by Shyam to death during the sexual assault.Advocate LK Verma, who represents Shyam, called the police’s investigation “tainted” and said that the probe has not been done in a proper manner.On September 17, HT reported that police told a city court that the girl died due to “suffocation” during the sexual assault, citing disclosure statements of two accused -- Ahmed and Narayan -- in the case.To be sure, a confession or disclosure statement of any person made before a police officer is not admissible as evidence before a court unless it is backed by other evidence.Only a confession before a judge is admissible as evidence against an accused.However, documents reviewed by HT revealed that the disclosure statements of Ahmed and Narayan were corroborated by the Forensic Science Lab (FSL) and post mortem (PM) reports, which also ruled out death due to electrocution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-in-dalit-girl-case-tried-to-destroy-proof-cops-101632252338958.html
22-09-2021||India||NIA raids 8 locations in J&K after IED recovery||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday conducted searches at eight locations across Jammu and Kashmir in connection with the recovery of a 5.5kg improvised explosive device (IED) which was dropped using a drone in Jammu on June 27.On the same day, two drones had also targeted an Indian Air Force facility in Jammu with explosives, leading investigators to suspect the role of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group and its newly-created arm in the Valley -- The Resistance Front -- behind the aerial attack.The searches in Doda and Kishtwar districts of Jammu province and Anantnag, Baramulla, Kulgam and Srinagar in Kashmir Valley on Tuesday were held following inputs suggesting the involvement of a few people from these areas in the IED recovery case.“Investigation revealed that Pakistan-based handlers of proscribed terror outfit LeT and their associates based in J&K are planning terrorist activities in J&K using the pseudo-acronym TRF (The Resistance Front) so as to maintain plausible deniability,” a NIA spokesperson said in a statement. “The conspiracy by LeT was aimed at causing (an) explosion in Jammu using the IED. NIA re-registered the case on July 19. NIA had earlier arrested three persons in this case,” the spokesperson added.The raids were conducted with the assistance of J&K Police and the Central Reserve Police Force. Several digital devices and other incriminating materials were recovered during the searches, the NIA spokesperson said. One Nadeem-ul-Haq was caught by police when he was heading towards the Valley after picking the IED in Bathindi on June 27. However, the target for the IED blast is not yet known as Haq was reportedly only directed to collect the explosive device, officials said.According to people familiar with both incidents on June 27, probe agencies suspect the drones flew in from a village across the border through technical help provided by the Pakistan Army and its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-raids-8-locations-in-j-k-after-ied-recovery-101632251696989.html
22-09-2021||India||Allahabad high court denies bail to two Uttar Pradesh cops arrested for ‘forewarning’ Vikas Dubey||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of Uttar Pradesh police officers Vinay Tiwari and K K Sharma who were arrested inJuly last year for allegedly forewarning gangster Vikas Dubey of a police raid, who then ambushed and killed eight policemen in Bikru village on July 3 last year. A single-judge bench of Justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava said it was evident that Tiwari, who was the station officer of Chaubeypur police station, and Sharma who was a sub-inspector, had prior information about the police raid and revealed it to the gangster. Commenting on the trend of police personnel hobnobbing with gangsters, the court said it couldn’t figure out why a small number of people in uniform “show their loyalty more to such gangsters than to their department”. “The prevalent conditions in which the police has to perform the complicated and difficult job of ensuring law and order, maintaining security and peace, preventing crime and taking action against offenders... These all require home work and team work and if any member of police force starts giving clues about and leak the police strategy, the strategies are bound to fail and shall certainly result sometimes, particularly when police is confronting against organised crime and criminals, in disastrous situation as has resulted in this case,” the court said. “In such situation, policing such police personnel is a big task and it requires early identification of such black sheep, monitoring of their conduct, isolating them and taking immediate strict disciplinary action against them,” the court added.Dubey was later nabbed from Madhya Pradesh on July 9, 2020 and was gunned down while trying to escape from custody on July 10 while being brought back to Uttar Pradesh.The counsel of Tiwari, submitted that there was no direct or indirect evidence against him and it was a police raid that was resisted Dubey that led to the death of eight policemen. He also said that the evidence against Tiwari and Sharma was “scattered”. But Additional Advocate General, Manish Goyal, submitted that Sharma’s role was evident because he was regularly in touch with Dubey and his gang, and through him, Tiwari also maintained links with the gang. Both policemen turned a blind eye to Dubey’s criminal activities, submitted Goyal.The Allahabad high court expressed sympathy with the police who it said face “real difficulty” in combating organised crime. “The police personnel are mostly not provided with sophisticated arms which are available in plenty to the gangsters. The police stations are mostly under-manned and the strength of the police force is remarkably less in comparison to the population,” the order said.The court also expressed concern about the trend of political parties welcoming gangsters and criminals to their fold, often projecting them as Robinhood-like figures. “They are given tickets to contest elections, and sometimes they win as well. This trend needs to be stopped as soon as possible,” the court said, adding that all political parties should unanimously decide not to give such people tickets in elections. The court added that such an approach would not only undermine the rule of law but also damage the democratic setup of the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-high-court-denies-bail-to-two-uttar-pradesh-cops-arrested-for-forewarning-vikas-dubey-101632251776506.html

He was also found involved in burning vehicles and damaging public/ private property, the NIA said. The agency said that further investigation is on.The arrest comes a year after the riots that engulfed the eastern parts of Bengaluru on the night of August 11 in which at least two persons died. The NIA had taken over the case in August last year.The NIA named Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) leader Muzamil Pasha for instigating the mob and inciting violence when it started the investigation into the case.The charges levelled against Pasha was that he had earlier called a meeting and directed the members of PFI (Popular Front of India ) and SDPI to instigate the mob and incite violence.A mob had gathered outside the residence of Akhanda Srinivas Murthy, the Congress legislator from Pulekeshi Nagar after his nephew put up a derogatory Facebook post on Prophet Mohammed.Despite the attempt from police to calm tempers down, the growing mob went on a rampage across several localities in the eastern part of the city.A mob of over 1000 people had spread across eastern parts of Bengaluru, damaging public property, arson and attacking the police.They attacked D.J.Halli and K.G. Halli police stations and set fire to the building and vehicles parked outside.The incident had ignited heated exchanges between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, who traded charges of inciting violence to appease its respective voter base.The former Mayor of Bengaluru and Congress member of the city corporation, Sampath Raj, was also arrested in the riots case.The case was filed on August 12 after the police station and other public property during the riots and the NIA re-registered the case on September 21, 2020, and took up the investigation.“After conducting a thorough investigation, NIA had filed the charge sheet before the NIA Special Court, Bengaluru under various sections of UA(P) Act, IPC and Karnataka Prevention of Destruction and Loss of Property Act (KPDLP Act) against 109 accused persons on 05.02.2021,” the NIA said in a statement on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-dj-halli-riots-case-accused-absconding-for-a-year-101632251654710.html
22-09-2021||India||Karnataka House passes bill to protect religious structures from demolition||The Karnataka legislative assembly on Tuesday passed the Karnataka Religious Structures (Protection) Bill, which seeks to protect religious structures from demolition.The Bill, which was tabled on Monday and will now be presented in the upper house of state legislature, provides protection to all religious structures that came up on public land before commencement of the law. It means the authorities will not be able to demolish religious structures on public land unless there is a specific court order for demolition of a religious structure, reading of the Bill shows.The Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government introduced the Bill on Monday after it came under attack from within the party as well as Opposition Congress and various pro-Hindu organisations following the demolition of a temple at Nanjangud in Mysuru a few days ago.JC Madhuswamy, Karnataka’s minister for parliamentary affairs, said that structures of all religions will come under the ambit of this new Bill. “There was lacuna and to fill it up we have brought this (bill),” Madhuswamy said, reacting to allegations over the government’s inability to stop the demolition of a temple in Nanjangud of Mysuru district on September 12.The Bill comes days after a video of a temple in Nanjangud being torn down by an earth mover went viral on social media with Mysuru-Kodagu MP Prathap Simha raising the issue to target authorities who were carrying out the drive with no consultations.During the discussion, leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah questioned how the temple was demolished without the government’s knowledge and sought to know why no action would be taken against the district officials for carrying out the act.“You are saying that from now on no temple should be demolished but what about the ones (demolished) earlier? You are bringing this bill because the Hindu Jagrana Vedike and Hindu Mahasabha pressurised you and the government got scared,” he said.Chief minister Bommai clarified that the government had no role in the temple demolition in Nanjangud. “Let there be no confusion. We (government) did not order demolition,” Bommai said.Assembly passes Bill against online gamingThe Karnataka legislative assembly on Tuesday also passed the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill, 2021, intended to curb gaming through internet or mobile applications. Karnataka’s home minister Araga Jnanendra tabled the Bill in the assembly on Friday during the ongoing monsoon session of the state legislature. The Bill also enhances the punishment for gaming for the orderly conduct of citizens and to wean them away from the vice of gambling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-house-passes-bill-to-protect-religious-structures-from-demolition-101632251481811.html

He didn’t name the community. “This was never Bengal’s culture...though political clashes are not new... With the cooperation of my predecessors and the central leadership, I will continue my fight against the talibanisation of the state” Majumdar said, addressing party leaders and the media at the BJP state office.Reacting to Majumdar’s allegation, TMC Raj Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said, “The Talibanisaton he is talking about can be seen in BJP-ruled states.

India has sought to broaden regional cooperation through other groupings that exclude Pakistan.An official letter sent by the Saarc secretariat to the foreign ministries of the eight countries on Tuesday said it had received a note verbale or unsigned diplomatic correspondence from Nepal’s foreign ministry that stated the informal meeting of foreign ministers, which was to be held on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on September 25, “will not take place” because of the “lack of concurrence from all member states”.Besides the strained relations between India and Pakistan, there had been a question mark over the meeting because of the status of Afghanistan following the takeover of the country by the Taliban last month. The interim setup created by the Taliban in Kabul has not been formally recognised by any country, and India has questioned its legitimacy as it is not inclusive and was not formed through negotiations.In recent years, the strains in India-Pakistan relations have been reflected at the Saarc foreign ministers’ meetings in New York. In 2019, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had boycotted the speech of his Indian counterpart at the Saarc meet to protest changes in the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saarc-foreign-ministers-sept-25-meet-called-off-due-to-lack-of-concurrence-101632251294735.html
22-09-2021||India||Assam govt orders probe into deaths of 2 suspected terrorists in police encounter||The Assam government on Tuesday ordered an inquiry into the deaths of two suspected cadres of a newly formed militant outfit who were killed in an encounter with police on Saturday. Jayant Narlikar, Commissioner (Lower Assam Division) has been directed to enquire into the circumstances leading to the deaths of two suspected cadres of the United Liberation of Bodoland (ULB) in a police encounter in the Ultapani area of Kokrajhar district. “He will ascertain the facts and circumstances leading to the deaths…..and submit an enquiry report within fifteen days,” said the notification issued by Debaprasad Misra, secretary to the state home and political department. The government move came after public outcry and allegations from opposition parties claiming that the two youths killed in the encounter—Janak Brahma and Jawngsar Mushahary (both 23)-were not ULB cadres. The police maintain that the youths were cadres of ULB, which was formed last week with the intention of creating a separate Bodoland state, and were killed in an “exchange of fire”. Brahma and Mushahary were former terrorists belonging to National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and had surrendered before police in January last year following a peace deal signed between the Centre and four factions of outfit. Police say both youths were involved in extortions following their surrender and were picked up by police on September 17. Based on their information about a camp of ULB located inside Ultapani reserve forest, the police planned an operation the next day. “When police party (along with the two arrested youths) reached near the camp, suddenly miscreants started firing on police party and in retaliation police party took lying position and started controlled fire towards the extremist party,” said a statement issued by Kokrajhar police after the incident. A district police official said on condition of anonymity that during the firing, which lasted nearly half an hour, the two arrested youths fled from police custody towards the ULB camp and they were killed in exchange of fire. Protests sparked in Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) areas following the incident with residents alleging the police had staged the encounter. In a video statement, the ULB too denied any association with the slain youths. On Monday, Pramod Boro, chief executive member of Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), which administers BTR, termed the incident as unfortunate and said there would be an investigation. Boro’s party, United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL) is part of the BJP-led coalition in Assam. Hagrama Mohilary, president of opposition Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), appealed to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday that “in the interest of peace and tranquillity in Bodoland region” a CBI inquiry into the encounter should be ordered. “The outfit (ULB) had given a video statement threatening to launch violence from October if a particular person wasn’t released from jail. The government can’t act under such threats and have to take action to prevent such incidents. Whether those killed are innocent or not will be revealed during inquiry,” CM Sarma said in Guwahati on Tuesday. Since May this year after formation of the second BJP-led government in the state, there has been a rise in police encounters in Assam. Chief Minister Sarma has maintained that police will shoot at those who try to flee from custody or snatch weapons from police. In the past four months, 26 people have been killed and 42 injured in such encounters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-govt-orders-probe-into-deaths-of-2-suspected-terrorists-in-police-encounter-101632251114966.html
22-09-2021||India||Gauri Lankesh case: SC indicates it may set aside part of K’taka HC order||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its judgement on a plea by slain journalist Gauri Lankesh’s sister on the Karnataka high court order quashing charges of harbouring the murder accused under the Karnataka Control of Organized Crime Act (KCOCA), 2000. A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar “tentatively” indicated that it might set aside a part of the high court order. “The high court has dealt with the matter lightly by quashing the charge sheet without analysing it. This is a serious thing. You cannot quash the charge sheet just like that,” the judges said. Gauri Lankesh was shot dead in Bengaluru in September 2017. On April 22 this year, the high court had quashed charges made by a Special Investigation Team against Mohan Nayak of providing shelter to the murder accused under KCOCA. Lankesh’s sister Kavitha Lankesh, a filmmaker, had petitioned the apex court against the high court’s order. “Tentatively, we are indicating that we will quash the last part of the high court judgment as once the charge sheet is quashed, nothing remains for the investigating agency to find out whether you are a member of the organized crime syndicate under KCOCA,” the Supreme Court bench said.The SIT had taken approval from Karnataka’s additional director general of police on August 14, 2018, to invoke sections under the KCOCA against Nayak. A probe by the agency had revealed that Nayak was in close touch with Amol Kale, the main accused in the murder. Kale is also facing a probe in connection with the murders of political activist Govind Pansare at Kolhapur in Maharashtra in February 2015, and noted Kannada writer MM Kalburgi in August 2015 in Dharwad, also in Maharashtra. The high court had said that Nayak cannot be said to be part of an organised crime syndicate as no criminal cases or charge sheets were filed against him in the past. Lawyer Huzefa Ahmadi, appearing for Kavitha Lankesh (CHK) in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, said an offence of harbouring members of an organised crime syndicate does not require the accused to be a member of the syndicate or have a criminal record.“At the stage of granting approval, there is no material to show his involvement in past crimes linked to the syndicate. The approval was granted without any application of mind. Subsequent to investigation, he can be named as an abettor but not as a member of the syndicate,” the Supreme Court said. “To this extent, the high court was correct.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauri-lankesh-case-sc-indicates-it-may-set-aside-part-of-k-taka-hc-order-101632250994723.html
22-09-2021||India||Char Dham Yatra: 18 pilgrims with fake e-passes sent back||Dehradun:Uttarakhand Police have caught and turned back 18 pilgrims trying to undertake the Char Dham Yatra with fake passes, authorities said on Tuesday, rekindling memories of mass fake Covid-19 tests during the Kumbh Mela earlier this year that undermined efforts to control the spread of the pandemic. Police said the 18 people were caught on Monday at a check post at Sonprayag in Rudraprayag district, some 24 km from Kedarnath, one of the four shrines of Hinduism. The other three are Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. The pilgrimage began on Saturday under strict Covid-19 restrictions, with some 42,000 people issued mandatory e-passes. The 18 people were carrying e-passes that were discovered to be fake after the authorities didn’t find their names in the list of people accredited by the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, Rudraprayag superintendent of police Ayush Agrawal said. “The 18 people who had come from neighbouring states were caught at Sonprayag, where the pilgrimage to Kedarnath actually starts.It was the first such incident since the yatra started on Saturday,” he said. The pilgrims told police that they obtained the e-passes from a cyber cafe in their neighbouring areas. “They claimed they didn’t know that the e-passes were fake,” said Agrawal. The district top cop said police turned them back and issued directions to personnel at all six barriers in Rudraprayag to thoroughly check all required documents of the pilgrims travelling to Kedarnath. “After Monday’s incident, the administration has become more alert in the backdrop of the alleged Covid-19 test scam in Haridwar Mahakumbh,” a police officer privy to developments said. Some 100,000 fake rapid tests allegedly conducted during the Kumbh Mela in April-May sparked widespread criticism of the state administration. At the time, the Uttarakhandhigh court came down heavily on the government. “We don’t want to take any risk during the Char Dham Yatra. After Monday’s incident, police have increased the vigil to catch anyone trying to take the yatra with fake or forged documents,” said the officer, requesting anonymity. The government will “strictly implement the standard operating procedure (SOP) on Char Dham Yatra”, said Satpal Maharaj, Uttarakhand’s minister of religious affairs and culture. “We are happy that the yatra has started after the high court allowed it, though with certain conditions. However, at the same time, we will not leave any stone unturned to ensure that the SOP (standard operating procedure) is strictly implemented amid the ongoing pandemic,” said Maharaj. “Only those having the required documents will be allowed to visit the shrines.” The Char Dham Yatra, which attracts about 40 lakh pilgrims annually, was put on hold by the Uttarakhand high court on June 28, citing Covid concerns. The pilgrimage was given the go-ahead on September 16 but with several restrictionsOn September 17, the government issued the SOP for Char Dham Yatra, saying people will need to carry negative Covid reports issued not more than 72 hours earlier, or double vaccination certificate issued at least 15 days earlier, register on the state government portal and get an e-pass from the website of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board .Pilgrims within the state are only exempted from online portal registration with remaining conditions applicable on them too. Pilgrims from Kerala, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh were required to carry negative Covid-19 reports even if they were fully vaccinated.The daily limit of pilgrims visiting the shrines is 1,000 in Badrinath, 800 in Kedarnath, 600 in Gangotri and 400 in Yamunotri. The Char Dham shrines and their surrounding areas will be sanitised thrice a day, the government has announced.The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board has so far issued over 42,000 e-passes. According to board officials, 1,717 people visited Kedarnath, 2,429 visited Badrinath, 833 visited Gangotri and 402 visited Yamunotri shrine till Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/char-dham-yatra-18-pilgrims-with-fake-e-passes-sent-back-101632250817702.html

The jump in exports of agricultural and processed food products during the first five months of current fiscal “is in continuation of growth in exports witnessed in the financial year 2020-21”, an official statement said. Rice exports grew 13.7% from $3,359 million in April-August 2020 to $3,820 million in April-August 2021, according to the data. Export of fruits and vegetables clocked a 6.1% growth in dollar terms, while there was a 142.1% jump in export of “other cereals”.

22-09-2021||India||Tamil Nadu requests central government to postpone plan to resume vaccine exports||The Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday requested the Centre to postpone resumption of exports of Covid-19 vaccines, saying only one third of the country’s population have been fully inoculated so far and 1.15 billion vaccines are still required to give the shots to all the people.Minister for medical and family welfare Ma Subramanian put forth the request after Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday said that exports of surplus Covid-19 vaccines would resume next month under the ‘Vaccine Maitri’ programme.Talking to reporters after unveiling the simulation centre at Apollo Hospitals in Vanagaram on Tuesday, Subramanian said the global medical fraternity welcomed the vaccination programme in India, as inoculating people holds the key in the fight against the Covid-19 virus. However, shortage of vaccines had resulted in Tamil Nadu being unable to hold vaccination camps on September 20 and today, he said.The minister pointed out that the Centre had announced that 800 million people nationwide have received the jabs, of which 61 crore have received the first dose. “Considering the total population of 1.3 billion people who need to be inoculated, 70 per cent of them were identified to be above the age of 18 years, which is 97.30 crore,” he said.Subramanian said that till date 2.77 million people, or one third of the population have received the second dose. So the country still requires another 1.15 million doses to vaccinate every one, he said. The minister said he had raised with Mandaviya, the issue of vaccinating those in this age group, as was being contemplated by other countries, to which he had replied that he would inform him after holding discussions with the officials. “Considering all these (issues), the news of resuming vaccines for exports will not be right in any way.. On behalf of the people of Tamil Nadu, we request Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and the Union Health Minister to postpone the idea to resume vaccine exports and set a target to inoculate all the people in the country”, Subramanian said.On the initiatives taken by the Tamil Nadu government to vaccinate people, he said 4.534 million people have been given the shots in 60,000 camps state-wide on September 12 and 19. The government requires 121.2 million vaccines to vaccinate people in the state, he said, adding that 60.6 million people aged above 18 years have been identified as eligible to receive the shots. “Till date we have vaccinated 4.37 crore people and still need 7.50 crore vaccines” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-requests-central-government-to-postpone-plan-to-resume-vaccine-exports-101632250694817.html

Hailing the contribution of Guru in transforming Kerala as a modern society, he said that the obstacles in the path of becoming a community as envisioned by the sage were racist ideology and the remnants of the caste system which are still strong enough to “embarrass us”.Vijayan said people ought to “proclaim out loud that a religion and a nation are not greater than man. No narrow interests can be allowed to undermine our unity”.“.. let us pledge on this day that we will stand together for the common good of the country. May that unity take our country to new heights,” he said, adding that we have to go a long way to fulfil Guru’s dream.Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan also tweeted a message on the occasion, saying “My pranams to #SreeNarayanaGuru, on his Samadhi day. #Guru placed the human being at the centre of all existence, and advocated self improvement by individuals as the only hope for the society and the world.” The CM, in his post, also said that the Guru gave priority to the essence of man above all else and was critical of brahmanism and the ideas of sectarianism, which are the basis of the caste-feudal system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-not-let-narrow-interests-undermine-unity-says-kerala-cmvijayan-101632250576379.html
22-09-2021||India||Kerala reports 15,768 Covid cases, 214 deaths, says government||Kerala on Tuesday reported 15,768 new Covid cases, and TPR of 14.94 per cent after 105,513 samples were tested, said the state health ministry. The state also reported 214 deaths, taking the total fatalities to 23,897. Active cases came down to 161,195 as compared to the past two weeks when active cases were above 200,000. State health minister Veena George said 90 per cent of the eligible population has got the first dose of the Covid vaccine and four districts will achieve full vaccination soon. On Tuesday, Thrissur topped the Covid-19 chart with 1,843 cases, followed by Kottayam (1,631) and Thiruvananthapuram (1,591) cases. Kasaragod and Wayanad clocked the lowest cases, 186 and 237 respectively. “During the week between Sept 12-18, average active cases were 196,657, and out of this, only 2 per cent availed oxygen beds. Now, the dependence of oxygen beds is below one per cent. It shows there is a sharp dip in active and serious cases,” said the minister. But she asked people not to lower their guard. She said the results of the sero survey conducted by the state will come by the month-end The state had started a sero prevalence survey in the first week of August to get a clear picture of the level of exposure to the virus. According to the earlier survey, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in July, Kerala had the lowest presence of antibodies at 44.4 per cent in comparison to Madhya Pradesh, where it stood at 75.9 per cent. Experts said the low presence of antibodies triggered mounting cases in the state. Statistics of the last two weeks indicate that the active cases and test positivity rate (TPR) in the state have started to come down. In the first week of September, the average Covid cases were between 22,000 and 25,000, but now the average has come down to 15,000-18,000. Similarly, the average TPR dipped to 15% from 20%.

22-09-2021||India||YSRTP chief Sharmila announces padayatra from October 20||YSR Telangana Party president YS Sharmila on Monday announced a marathon padayatra (foot march) across Telangana from October 20, following the footsteps of late father YS Rajasekhar Reddy and brother YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who embarked on a similar journey in the past. Sharmila, who recently formed her party, said she would walk across the state, barring the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits, covering 90 of the 119 assembly constituencies in over a year.She christened her padayatra “Praja Prasthanam” (people’s journey), a name used by her father for his 1500-km long padayatra from April 9 to June 16, 2003, that catapulted him to power in the 2004 assembly elections in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh. Sharmila also chose to start her padayatra from the Chevella assembly constituency in Ranga Reddy district, the same place from where YSR also began his padayatra in 2003.“Chevella has been sentimentally attached to my father, that is why I have chosen this place to begin my padayatra, which will also end up in the same place. I am planning to walk for 12-15 km a day, and I hope to complete my walkathon in a year,” Sharmila told reporters on Monday.She said during her padayatra, she would like to understand the people’s problems personally and highlight what they lost in seven years of Telangana Rashtra Samithi government, led by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, besides recalling the contribution made by her father YSR for the welfare and development of the people.“The TRS government has cheated all sections of people, including Dalits and the unemployed youth. Nearly 7,000 unemployed youth committed suicide during the KCR’s regime,” she said.Sharmila embarked on a similar padayatra between October 18, 2012, to August 4, 2013, where she walked around 3,000 kilometres across 14 districts of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh in the name of “Maro Praja Prashthanam” (Another people’s journey), to sustain the YSR Congress party floated by her brother YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who was in jail in connection with a CBI case.Interestingly, Sharmila’s padayatra did not fetch victory for the YSR Congress party in the subsequent assembly elections held in a bifurcated Andhra Pradesh in 2014. Instead, Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu, who also took up a 2,808-km long padayatra, which he named “Vasthunna Mee Kosam” (I am coming for you) from October 2, 2012, to April 27, 2013, across the state, emerged victoriously.The time-tested strategy of padayatra once again worked out for Sharmila’s brother Jagan Mohan Reddy, who created a history of sorts by walking for a massive distance of 3,648 km for 341 days, starting from November 6, 2017, to January 9, 2019, including a brief period wherein he was hospitalised. He named his padayatra “Praja Sankalpa Yatra” (Tour to take a resolve for people).Sharmila, who launched her regional party on July 8 this year with the slogan “Rajanna Rajyam” (Rajasekhar Reddy’s welfare state) in Telangana, has been taking up 12-hour hunger-strike every week to highlight the unemployment issue in the state for the last couple of months.On Tuesday, she attempted a hunger strike at Boduppal grounds on the outskirts of Hyderabad. But the police did not give her permission to hold the meeting. When insisted, the police arrested her and took her to Ghatkesar police station, about 20km away.The YSRTP workers staged a dharna in front of the police station, demanding her release. She continued her fasting on the police station premises till evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysrtpchief-sharmila-announces-padayatra-from-october-20-101632250454746.html
22-09-2021||India||Civil servants can receive gifts from foreign dignitaries: Centre||The Union government on Tuesday published a gazette notification allowing All India Services (AIS) civil servants to receive and retain gifts from foreign dignitaries.“In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 3 of the All India Services Act, 1951 (61 of 1951), the Central Government, after consultation with the Governments of the State concerned, hereby makes the following rules further to amend the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968,” the gazette notification published by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) stated. “Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rules (1), (2) and (3), a member of the Service, being a member of the Indian delegation or otherwise, may receive and retain gifts from foreign dignitaries in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Acceptance or Retention of Gifts or Presentations) Rules, 2012, as amended from time to time,” it added.At present, under Rule 11, an AIS member may accept gifts from their relatives or friends having no official dealings with them on occasions such as wedding, anniversaries, funerals and religious functions when the gifts are in conformity with prevailing religious and social practices, but the members need to report to the government if the value of such gifts exceed ₹25,000.The AIS comprises Indian Administrative Services, Indian Police Services and Indian Forest Services.According to a former DoPT official familiar with the matter, the issue was addressed by circulars and office memoranda, but now it was incorporated into the AIS rules. Similar provisions already existed under the central civil service rules, which explicitly dealt with the receiving of the gifts, the official said.A second official said the notification did not represent a deviation from existing norms. “There is not anything that different in the notification,” the official said, adding, “It has been practised in the past.”A gift, as defined in the rule, may include free transport, free boarding, free lodging or any other service or financial advantage when provided by a person other than a relative or friend having “no official dealings” with the AIS member, but does not include “casual lift, or other social hospitality”.A sub-rule under the section states that no member of the service “shall accept any gift without the sanction of the government if its value exceeds ₹5,000”. Besides, the member “shall avoid accepting lavish hospitality or frequent hospitality from persons having official dealings with them or from industrial or commercial firms or other organisations”.The department proposed an amendment to the existing AIS conduct rules in March last year seeking members be allowed to “accept/retain” gifts from foreign dignitaries.“Presently, there are no provisions under AIS (Conduct Rules), 1968, with regard to receipt/retention of gifts from foreign dignitaries by AIS members,” the proposal said.Though the conduct rules only refer to domestic gifts, AIS members have declared receiving gifts from foreign dignitaries in the Toshakhana of the ministry of external affairs, according to reports on the DoPT website.“Notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 11, a member of the service may receive and retain gifts in accordance with the provisions of The Foreign Contribution (Acceptance or Retention of Gifts or Presentation) Rules, 2012, as amended time to time,” the proposed amendment added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/civil-servants-can-receive-gifts-from-foreign-dignitaries-centre-101632250394658.html
22-09-2021||India||Haryana: Role of Saraswati river in Mahabharata to be taught in schools||References of the Saraswati river from Vedic and pre-Vedic texts; its role in the battle of Mahabharata; medieval-era Sanskrit text Vamanapurana that explicitly mentions the history of the river and the Harappan-era archaeological site ‘Dholavira’ in Gujarat; are among the topics recommended by the Haryana’s ‘Saraswati river syllabus committee’ to be taught in the state schools. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Haryana government had last month announced to include the history of Saraswati river in the curriculum for students of classes 4th to 12th in its schools with an aim to make students aware about the mythological history of the river. The Haryana Saraswati Heritage Development Board (HSHDB), which is headed by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, constituted a 14-member ‘Saraswati river syllabus committee’ on August 26 to prepare the curriculum. Officials at the board said the committee submitted its recommendations on Monday. Dhumman Singh Kirmach, vice-chairman of HSHDB, said the recommended topics will be included in the already existing state government’s books of History and Geography. “The committee has recommended highlighting the existence of Saraswati river in Vedas and pre-Vedic scriptures. For instance, in Rigveda, the Saraswati river is mentioned as many as 72 times while there is only one reference of other popular rivers like the Yamuna. Similarly, in puranas, specifically Vamanapurana, which is one of the 18 major puranas of Hinduism, there has been extensive mention of the Saraswati. The committee has recommended including all these texts in the curriculum,” Kirmach said. The committee has also suggested including the “role of Saraswati river” wherever Mahabharata or Bhagavad Gita is mentioned in the curriculum. “The Saraswati played a major role in the selection of Kurukshetra as the place for the battle of Mahabharatha. It was chosen because it is situated on the banks of the Saraswati. The committee has suggested teaching all of this to our students. Similarly, we will also be adding shlokas from Bhagavad Gita in the curriculum. It is because Lord Krishna had given lessons to Arjuna by quoting Bhagavad Gita during the battle of Mahabharata,” Kirmach said. Pritam Singh, assistant director of Centre for Dr BR Ambedkar studies at Kurukshetra University (KU) and chairperson of the syllabus committee, said the idea is to include as many references of the Saraswati in the existing books. “For example, there is a chapter on Mahabharata in class 6th History book. We have recommended to include the importance of Saraswati river in its context there itself. Similarly, wherever there are references of rivers, the committee has suggested to include references from our ancient scriptures highlighting the importance of Saraswati river there itself,” he said. Explaining the idea behind recommending inclusion of archaeological site Dholavira, which has recently received the UNESCO world heritage site tag, Kirmach said, “Saraswati river flows up to Kutch in Gujarat and ends near this particular heritage site. That’s why it has been added to the recommendations.” The government will now review the recommendations. “We want to include it in the syllabi of some classes from this academic session itself. Otherwise, it will surely be added to the SCERT books that will be published for the next academic year. We will also be sending these recommendations to the NCERT so that it can also consider adding some of these topics in its books as well,” Kirmach said. Earlier this year, the Haryana government had sanctioned ₹800 crore for the rejuvenation of the ancient river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-role-of-saraswati-river-in-mahabharata-to-be-taught-in-schools-101632249854959.html

Meanwhile, the mobile voice calls and internet were suspended in the area from Monday afternoon, they added.The army had inputs that a fresh group of infiltrators have sneaked into Uri via Gawahalan village taking the cover of darkness and thick foliage, people familiar with the matter said. Defence spokesperson Col Emron Masavi said that suspicious movement was detected along the LoC on the intervening night of September 18/19. “Search of the area is still under progress,” he said on Tuesday.The operation is going on and high alert has been issued around the camps located in the area, especially messages have been passed to both Rampur and Uri brigade commanders to remain on high alert, said the officials.Uri is close to the Line of Control (LoC) and shortest routes for infiltration, however there is three tier security in the area which has prevented infiltration in the past. The Army’s 15 Corps commander, Lt General DP Panday told media persons on Monday that there have been two successful attempts of infiltration in Kashmir and one group was neutralised in Bandipore and operation to track down another group is underway.This year there has been significant drop in infiltration attempts on the LoC in north Kashmir especially from Uri, Nowgam, Tanghdar, Keran, Machil and Gurez sectors, said the officials Officials said that September and October months are always crucial vis-a-vis infiltration attempts as passes and ridges generally used for the infiltration close due to heavy snowfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/search-ops-on-in-uri-to-track-infiltrators-internet-suspended-101632249795337.html
22-09-2021||India||AUKUS won’t impact Quad agenda: Harsh Shringla||New Delhi: The new security alliance between Australia, the UK and the US has no link with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue and will have no impact on the functioning of the grouping, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Tuesday ahead of the first in-person Quad Summit.Shringla’s remarks, the first official response to AUKUS from the Indian side, came against the backdrop of widespread speculation on whether the new security alliance would dilute the Quad’s agenda or affect the working of the grouping that brings together India, Australia, Japan and the US.“Let me make it clear that the Quad and the AUKUS are not groupings of a similar nature,” Shringla told a media briefing ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US, during which he will participate in the maiden in-person Quad Summit on September 24.The Quad is a “plurilateral grouping of countries with a shared vision of their attributes and values” and the four members have a shared vision of the Indo-Pacific as a free, open, transparent and inclusive region, he said.“On the other hand, AUKUS is a security alliance between three countries. We are not party to this alliance. From our perspective, this is neither relevant to the Quad nor will it have any impact on its functioning,” he added.The new alliance was unveiled last week by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden against the backdrop of China’s assertive actions across the Indo-Pacific, and its first initiative is aimed at equipping Australia with nuclear-powered submarines built with technology from the US and the UK.France, a close strategic ally of India, reacted angrily to the new alliance as it resulted in Australia scrapping a nearly $90-billion deal to build 12 French-designed conventional submarines.Responding to a question on whether there are any nuclear proliferation-related concerns regarding AUKUS, Shringla said Australia had already clarified that it would be working on nuclear-propelled submarines but “it would not have any nuclear weapons and, as such, will not be in contravention with any of Australia’s or international commitments with regard to the issue of nuclear proliferation”.He said there is also no link between the Malabar naval exercise and the Quad, just “as there is no link between the AUKUS and the Quad”.The Malabar exercise is conducted by the navies of India, the US and Japan, and Australia has joined the drills for the second consecutive year in 2021.Shringla said the Quad has come a long way as a grouping, from initially holding meetings of senior officials to organising a meeting of foreign ministers in 2019, and moving to a virtual summit in March this year. “As we go along, I think we have already found a lot of common ground,” he said.The Quad has also adopted a “positive and proactive agenda” with an array of initiatives at the global level to address contemporary issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic, supply of vaccines to Indo-Pacific nations, new and emerging technologies, the climate crisis, infrastructure, maritime security, education, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.“The Quad will deal with all issues that would further its objectives of seeing our common vision of an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open and inclusive. From that perspective, the Quad will function and will do what it takes. The effort is to move on areas that would seek to co-opt and enable the Quad to cooperate with our Indo-Pacific partners,” Shringla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aukus-won-t-impact-quad-agenda-harsh-shringla-101632249495259.html
22-09-2021||India||Centre drops proposal for uranium mining in Telangana forests amid stir||The Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) has withdrawn the proposal to allow Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research to undertake survey and exploration of Uranium ore in Nallamala forest areas, following strong protests from locals and environmentalists, besides objections from the state government, state forest department officials said on Tuesday.The decision, which came up for discussion at the meeting of Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) of the MoEF as an additional agenda item on August 16, was conveyed to the Telangana government last week, an official in the state forest department familiar with the development said.According to the official, the proposal for exploration of Uranium mining in the Nallamala forests was considered by the FAC in its earlier meetings held on May 22, 2019 and also on April 23, 2020.Subsequently, the FAC deferred the proposal seeking clarity in recommendation from the state government. The observations of the FAC were communicated to the state government, which replied that, neither the State Board of Wildlife nor the the government has recommended the proposal.“After thorough deliberation and discussions, the FAC recommends that the proposal may be closed, in absence of proper recommendation of the state government,” the FAC said.In May 2019, the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMDER), South Central region at Hyderabad, a unit of the Department of Atomic Energy, sought permission to conduct survey and exploration for Uranium ore in the Nallamala forests and the FAC gave in-principle approval for the same in principle agreement in May.The AMDER sought to conduct the exploration of Uranium over 83 square kilometres of the area, including 76 square kilometres of area encompassing Amrabad Tiger Reserve falling in Nagarkurnool district and another seven square kilometre in Nagarjunasagar area under Nalgonda district.The AMDER sought to drill 4,000 boreholes in the tiger reserve as part of survey for Uranium deposits. The authorities began drilling exercises in a few places in Amrabad area, which triggered protests from the local tribal groups.Within no time, the environmentalists with the support of locals launched a Save Nallamala movement. About 60 different organisations, including political parties, several environment activists joined the movement and held a series of meetings to bring pressure on the government to drop the plans to take up Uranium mining in the tiger reserve.They argued that Uranium mining in the Nallamala forests would also threaten the survival and livelihoods of Chenchus, a primitive tribal group, living in Amrabad forest areas. “Modern technology like internet and social media also helped us spread our movement fast and more and more people joined the campaign,” noted environmentalist Prof K Purushottam Reddy, who led the Save Nallamala campaign, told HT.With the pressure mounting on all sides, the Telangana government reacted quickly and announced that there was no question of allowing Uranium mining in the Nallamala forests. On September 16, 2019, the Telangana Legislative Assembly passed a unanimous resolution, urging the Centre not to allow Uranium mining operations in the Nallamala forest region of the state.While chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao made a statement in the assembly, his son and municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao moved the resolution in the legislative council in this regard.KTR said the exploration of Uranium would hurt the ecological balance in Nallamala forest region, which is home for Chenchu tribes and also has rich biodiversity, including animals like tigers and Nilgai and rare varieties of plants. “It might also lead to contamination of water in Krishna river flowing through the Nallamala forest range and it would, in turn, affect the drinking water being supplied to Hyderabad,” the government resolution said.The state government conveyed the resolution to the Centre and answered a series of queries raised by the MoEF over the last two years. “It is good that the Centre has finally dropped the proposal for Uranium mining. The entire credit goes to the strong people’s movement against the proposal,” Purushottam Reddy added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-drops-proposal-for-uranium-mining-in-telangana-forests-amid-stir-101632249316297.html
22-09-2021||India||Parliamentary committees: Speaker seeks report on members’ attendance||To streamline the functioning of parliamentary committees through better participation, the office of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has asked for a detailed report on the attendance of members in these committees in the last financial year, according to a circular released on Monday. Birla’s office wants to know how many meetings were held by both department-related standing committees and other panels “and the number of sittings attended by each member”. It also wants to know the “total number of sittings held during the current term” of panels other than standing committees and the attendance of MPs in those meetings. The Speaker’s office wants to closely monitor the attendance of MPs as officials have been told to furnish weekly reports. This has come at a time when there is talk of shuffling the panels and a plan to shift absentee MPs to other panels.Apart from that, a committee has also been formed to look into the rules that govern the functioning of the panels “and suggest changes that are necessary in light of the developments in recent years”. Insiders feel there are other more important issues to consider, such as the overlap of subjects of different panels, quorum relaxation, and uniform rules for all panels. “Several things have happened particularly in the wake of Covid-19. Many panels couldn’t meet regularly and some MPs had demanded online meetings. But if there is any change in the House rules, it has to be done by the Rules panel,” said former secretary general of Lok Sabha, P Sreedharan. But officials ruled out online meetings. “Online meetings can compromise the non-partisan character of the panels and their secrecy,” said another senior official on condition of anonymity. Biju Janata Dal MP and chairman of the labour standing committee, Bhartruhari Mahtab said, “There are many issues that might require a relook at the rules. Most important is how long the panel proceedings will be held in-camera. There is a debate that while MPs work very hard in these panels, it is not reflected through the media. After all, the secrecy clause is usually to protect the executive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliamentary-committees-speaker-seeks-report-on-members-attendance-101632249194786.html
22-09-2021||India||150.5 million tonne kharif foodgrain output projected||New Delhi: India has projected a record foodgrain output of 150.5 million tonne from summer crops (2021-22) despite an erratic monsoon, up 4% from the previous year, official estimates on Tuesday showed.The government’s first of the four quarterly estimates of food production, a key indicator of the country’s farm sector that employs half of all Indians, pointed to plentiful harvests of rice, coarse cereals, maize, higher pulses, oilseeds, etc.Farm-produce output and agricultural gross domestic product (agri GDP) was robust in 2020-21, too, when the wider economy came to a standstill due to strict Covid-19 restrictions, pointing to resilience of the rural sector.Robust food output will likely keep a lid on food inflation. Overall inflation levels of between 4-6% offer the Reserve Bank greater flexibility in adjusting its monetary policies to keep the country’s nascent economic recovery on track. However, gluts in some items tend to send food prices crashing, which hurts farmers’ incomes.Still, these are early projections subject to revision when final production figures at the end of the harvest season become available. According to the so-called first advance estimates 2021-22, rice output is estimated to be 107.04 million tonnes, up 5 million tonne from the previous year.Coarse cereals output, such as oats and pearl millets, are set to be nearly 34 million tonne, higher by 2.11 million tonne than the five-yearly average production of 31.89 million tonne.According to Tuesday’s official data, the production of pulses is estimated to be 9.4 million tonne, largely the same as last year. Pulses are among a clutch of items that tend to stoke food prices, along with oilseeds or edible oil.Summer oilseeds are pegged at 23.39 million tonne, higher by 2.96 million tonne than the five-year average oilseeds production of 20.42 million tonne. India will still have to import edible oils, as it routinely does, to meet domestic demand.The data also estimated record sugarcane output of 419.25 million tonnes.“The estimates will undergo revision later, but they point to good harvests. However, the trends are more or less similar as earlier. Cereals tend are higher than non-cereals,” said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities firm.The latest kharif output figures show India’s agriculture sector appears to have emerged unscathed during the second Covid-19 wave, just as it had during the first outbreak in 2020.In 2020, when the country faced a recession, agriculture was the only sector to record positive growth. It grew 3.4% in the June 2020 quarter, when the overall economy shrank 24.4%. When all-India growth returned to positive territory in the December 2020 quarter, expanding 0.4%, agriculture grew higher at 3.9%. Two years of back-to-back normal monsoon (2019 and 2020) was also to record farm output.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1505-million-tonne-kharif-foodgrain-output-projected-101632248955342.html
22-09-2021||India||In Firozabad outbreak, no succour at first port of call||Since the last week of August, queues outside Firozabad’s State Autonomous Medical College (SAMC) don’t seem to end. With wailing children cradled in arms, distraught parents stand patiently for hours, hoping to consult a doctor. Their descriptions of the children’s symptoms differ – fever, vomiting, chills – but their experience with rural health care is common: an overstretched, or shut, local health centre in their village forcing them to travel to the city to save their loved ones.“It has been three days since my daughter got fever. I had been running around the Humayunpur primary health centre but it cannot test blood, so I had to come to SAMC,” said Ankur Kumar, a driver.Government records say that at least 61 children have died in Firozabad since August 20. A central team has blamed a combination of dengue, scrub typhus, and leptospirosis. The crisis has put a spotlight on the condition of rural health infrastructure and its shortcomings. A spot check by HT last week found that the first port-of-call for villagers were shut or hopelessly overstretched. A health sub-centre shut for two years and functioning as the home of a nurse, a primary health centre functioning with a third of the medical staff required, a community health centre with just one doctor and an overstretched district hospital where bureaucratic tangles worsened already unsanitary conditions. Due to this, parents and children often find poor or non-existent medical care in their villages, and patients are often critical by the time they reach the district headquarters. As a result, Fizorabad, once known for its decorative glass bangles, is in the grip of a grim dengue and viral fever outbreak sweeping north India.“Out of 540, 480 beds are occupied as of now of which confirmed dengue patients are 131,” said Dr Sangeeta Aneja, principal of SAMC. Aneja said the hospital is getting 250 patients a day, and has 60 doctors working round the clock.In India, rural health infrastructure is three-tiered, a subcentre to cater to four villages or a population of 5,000, a primary health centre (PHC) for a cluster of villages and 30,000 population and a community health centre (CHC) for the block – around 120 villages or 120,000 people. Firozabad has nine blocks. The National Health Mission (NHM) guidelines say each CHC should serve as a referral centre for four PHCs. But government data shows that Firozabad has only four PHCs. Further, a PHC acts as a referral for 4-6 subcentres. An HT spot-check revealed some PHCs and subcentres were either barely functional or hopelessly overstretched. The district hospital, often the nodal institution for health care in the region, was also in bad shape.HEALTH SUBCENTRE, NAGLA PICHIYAThe health subcentre at Nagla Pichiya, a small village 5km from the district hospital and SAMC, has been shut for two years, said local villagers. Instead of functioning as the first port of health care for villagers, an auxillary nurse midwife (ANM) has been using the centre as her home, living here with her family. The premises are surrounded by narrow by-lanes covered with black slush.“I was given permission to live here by the previous CMO,” said Meenu, the ANM living at the subcentre. When asked for the reason behind this arrangement, she said, “This subcentre is used to conduct vaccination on one day of the month and sometimes health officials hold their meeting here. I take care of the subcentre in the meantime.” Just ten steps away, a barren plot is filled with stagnant water, covered with garbage, insects and mosquitoes. Every second household has at least three members suffering from fever. “We are scared for our children after we read reports of ‘mystery fever’ in the area. We do not have much income and can only afford to go to a government hospital. We rush to the district hospital even if my children develop a cough as there is no government health clinic nearby,” said Pappu Singh, a daily wager labourer who lives in front of the subcentre.The National Health Mission (NHM) guidelines say subcentres should provide services related to maternal and child health, family welfare, nutrition, immunisation, diarrhoea control and communicable disease control. Chief medical officer Dinesh Kumar Premi said, “I am aware that the sub-centre at Himayunpur is shut and one ANM is posted here. I have recently taken charge and will look into this matter”.PRIMARY HEALTH CENTRE, HUMAYUNPUR The Primary Health Centre (PHC) at Humayunpur, a small village in Firozabad, is about 5km from the district hospital. The two-bed centre is flooded with fever patients, most of whom are referred to the district hospital or medical college for blood test, as this service is not available at the PHC.“Most of the nearby villagers go to the PHC for their treatment and get medicines and other consultations for the doctor. But now as our children are getting affected with Dengue, we have to take them to SAMC,” said Inayat Khatun, a resident.NHM says a PHC is to be manned by a medical officer supported by 14 paramedical and other staff. It acts as a referral unit for six sub centres and needs 4-6 beds for patients. “Our PHC has one bed, one medical officer, one staff nurse, one lab technician and six ANMs under whom 24 ASHAs are working across the villages conducting door to door survey to gather fever data. We are getting around 100 patients in the OPD every day and the only bed is occupied by a fever patient. Our PHC caters to about one lakh population in the area,” said Dr Pallavi Yadav, medical officer at the PHC. Yadav added that the PHC did not have diagnostic services and patients had to be sent to the district hospital. PRIMARY HEALTH CENTRE, USIYANIThe one-bed facility is about 9km from the district hospital. It is surrounded by empty plots filled with stagnant water, covered with green moss and buzzing with mosquitoes and flies. The medical officer, Dr Deependra Yadav, said the PHC staff is conducting medical camps in nearby villages to screen fever patients. “We cater to a population of about 2.5 lakh people and have been conducting medical camps in nearby villages as per instructions of the health department. 800 fever patients are being screened on a daily bases. Of these, around 10 blood samples for dengue are sent to Lucknow for testing as per signs and symptoms of the patient,” said Dr Yadav. When asked about cleanliness around the PHC, he said, “The premises inside PHC are our responsibility and that area is completely clean”. Local residents said unhygienic conditions around the PHC and village have improved from two weeks ago. “The drains were overflowing with garbage at the time, now there are just filled with it. Municipal workers have been carrying out cleaning drives here one in two to three days,” said villager Shiv Kumar.The Firozabad CMO admitted that none of the health centres, CHC, PHCs or sub-centres have pediatricians on staff. “Which is why the medical officers there cannot handle fever cases among children. As a result, the patients come to SAMC. We will try to resolve the issue at the earliest,” he said. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRE (CHC), DEEMADAIThe 30-bed facility is 10km from the district hospital. When HT visited the centre at around 2pm, it had four-five patients. Government guidelines say a CHC needs four medical specialists -- surgeon, physician, gynecologist and pediatrician -- supported by 21 paramedical and other staff. But at Deemadai, there is only one regular physician, who also doubles up as the medical superintendent. Another doctor has been deputed at the CHC under the non-communicable diseases programme. Importantly, there is no pediatrician – crucial to catch fever cases among children. “We get about 150-200 OPD patients here on a daily basis. While we may be short staffed, but our diagnostic facilities are fully functional. This area mostly gets patients of skin diseases. Since we do not have a pediatrician, we cannot handle pediatric cases and refer them to the SAMC. For fever in adults, if the platelet count is above 20,000, we admit them and try to stabilise them but if the condition deteriorates, we have to refer them to the district hospital,” said Dr Yogendra Singh, medical superintendent. The CHC is located in Basnat Nagar village and is surrounded by open filthy drains and unsanitary conditions. Shah Alam, a villager who lives across from the CHC, said local residents usually prefer to go to the district hospital in cases of critical illnesses. “The adults of the village have been going to the CHC in case of mild fever or cough. However when it comes to our children, we do not go to the CHC as they ask us to go to SAMC. In order to save time, we straightaway take our children there without consulting the CHC,” he said.SN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, FIROZABADThe SN Memorial Hospital, which is the district hospital of Firozabad, is located behind SAMC and caters to patients across the district. Hansraj Singh, the hospital’s chief medical superintendent, said the outpatient department (OPD) is getting at least 150 patients every day, of which 80-90 are suffering from fever. The hospital here has a total of eight doctors, of which four are appointed under SAMC but deputed at the district hospital. “There are 157 beds at the hospital, of which 154 are occupied -- 34 by Dengue patients, 95 by fever patients, and rest by other illnesses. The trauma centre at the hospital has 25 beds of which four are vacant and others are occupied with trauma patients,” said Singh. HT found OPDs swamped with patients and filthy open drains buzzing with mosquitoes and flies right outside Singh’s office. Patients crowded outside the building with white slips in their hands, waiting for hours for their turn to see a doctor. The administration blames infighting for the poor conditions. Singh said he got the hospital cleaned regularly but some areas may have been left out. “The hospital is overburdened with patients as four of my subordinates do not take my orders, being from the medical college and hence the workload is on the other four doctors here,” he added.When asked whether the crowd at the hospital will be lesser if patients first visited local health centres, Singh said, “While we do not deny treatment to any patient coming to our hospital, I cannot say why they are not going to their local health centres firs.”Firozabad chief medical officer Dinesh Kumar Premi said he was aware that four of Singh’s subordinates did not comply with his orders. “As they are appointed by the medical college, there is a conflict among the staff at the hospital. I have recently taken charge and will resolve this issue soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-firozabad-outbreak-no-succour-at-first-port-of-call-101632248594658.html
22-09-2021||India||Centre names Air Marshal VR Chaudhari as next IAF chief||New Delhi: The Union government on Tuesday announced that Air Marshal Vivek Chaudhari will take over as the next chief of the Indian Air Force (IAF) after Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria retires on September 30. Chaudhari is currently serving as IAF’s vice chief. The government has followed the seniority principle in appointing Chaudhari to the top job. He will be most senior IAF officer the day Bhadauria retires. An experienced pilot, Chaudhari has logged more than 3,800 hours of flying on a variety of fighter planes such as MiG-21, MiG-29 and Sukhoi-30. He also flew air defence missions during the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan. He was commissioned into the air force’s fighter stream in December 1982. Before taking charge of his current appointment as vice chief, Chaudhari was the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the operationally critical Western Air Command (WAC). He commanded WAC at a time when the IAF was inducting its new Rafale fighter jets at Ambala, and operationalising them at the earliest was a top priority amid the border row with China in the Ladakh sector. He earlier held the appointment of IAF deputy chief at the Air Headquarters in Delhi and steered a raft of key procurements to sharpen IAF’s combat edge. As deputy chief, he was closely associated with the Rafale programme -- he was the head of the bilateral high-level group monitoring the progress of the fighter jet project in France. He has commanded important fighter bases in his military career including a front-line base in Kashmir. Chaudhari will take over the top job at a critical time -- the armed forces are working out the details of the theaterisation model to best utilise the military’s resources, and he will also oversee several key projects to sharpen the IAF’s combat potential. “He has his work cut out for him and I am sure he will do a great job,” said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Fali Major (retd). The current theaterisation model, which has the full backing of the government, seeks to set up four new integrated commands for synergy in operations -- two land-centric theatres, the Air Defence Command, and the National Maritime Theatre Command. The air force has had some reservations about the model that came out in the open in July, when Bhadauria argued at an event that it was critical to first get the structure right. Speaking separately at the same event, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat gave out details of the theaterisation plan and brushed aside IAF’s reservations. Asset split, leadership and dilution of the powers of the chiefs are key concerns for the IAF on the theaterisation move, as previously reported by HT. Chaudhari takes over months ahead of the scheduled induction of a key weapons system being imported from Russia to strengthen India’s air defence architecture. India is set to begin the induction of the S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems ordered from Russia for ₹39,000 crore in October 2018. India is buying five S-400 missile systems capable of destroying a variety of aerial threats, including enemy fighter jets and missiles, at a range of 400km, with the first deliveries expected by the year-end. Chaudhari’s appointment also comes at a time when the indigenous (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jet project is set to enter a critical phase. State-run plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has set a March 2022 deadline to carry out the first flight of the fighter jet. In February 2021, the defence ministry awarded a ₹48,000 crore contract to HAL for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets for the IAF. The first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the air force by March 2024, with the rest slated to join its combat fleet by 2029. Also, the government recently cleared some key projects that are expected to make progress during Chaudhari’s term as IAF chief. Earlier this month, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) cleared the much-delayed purchase of 56 C-295 medium transport aircraft to replace the IAF’s ageing fleet of Avro-748 planes. The C-295 project is estimated to be worth ₹22,000 crore. CCS also cleared a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) proposal to develop new airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft for the IAF using Airbus jets bought from Air India. The project is estimated to be worth around ₹11,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-names-air-marshal-vr-chaudhari-as-next-iaf-chief-101632248357601.html
22-09-2021||India||Bengal’s Sunderbans to get women tourist guides for the first time||Born and brought up in a remote village on a Sunderban-island located opposite to the Sunderban Tiger Reserve, 34-year-old Bhaswati Kamila Sarkar has seen it all – Royal Bengal Tigers, huge estuarine crocodiles, man-animal conflict, impenetrable mangroves in the world’s largest delta and devastating cyclones like Amphan and Yaas. From October 1, she will have a daunting task of showing and explaining these things to tourists who visit the Sunderbans every year. Sarkar is one of the four women who have been selected by the state forest department to become tourist guides at the tiger reserve. “If a woman can become a pilot, drive a train why can’t I be a tourist guide in the Sunderbans? Tourists often visit my village and I get to interact with them. So when I heard that the forest department was looking for female guides I opted for it. This will also make me self-dependent and I can earn something for my family,” said Sarkar, a resident of Dayapur, who had earlier worked in a village nursery school and as a trainer in a self-help group. This is the first time that women guides will be placed on the boats that enter the tiger reserve with tourist guides. The Sunderbans, located at the southern tip of West Bengal is home to around 100 tigers. Around one million tourists visit the delta, which can be accessed only on boats, to see the tigers and crocodiles among other animals. “We have around 60 – 64 male guides. There were some vacancies. So we thought why not give an opportunity to village women and see if they want to join. A two-day guide orientation training was organised to see whether the women would be comfortable. The four women who had come forward said they can do it and so we decided to go ahead. If everything goes well we can rope in more women guides for our team in future,” said S Jones Justin, deputy field director of the STR. While the reserve has been closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic it is scheduled to reopen from October 1 ahead of the festive season. The peak tourism period in the Sunderban extends from November to February. Around 120 boats are allowed to enter the reserve every day during the peak season. If guides are available they are tagged to a boat. Sprawling over India and Bangladesh the delta consists of 10,200 sq km of mangrove forests spread. The Indian Sunderban region, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, consists of 4,200 sq km of reserved forests. Of this the Sundarban Tiger Reserve is spread over 2585 sq. km. Here river divide the habitat of tigers and villages. The Sunderban accounts for the highest number of people killed by tigers in India. At least 62 people were killed by tigers between 2015 and 2019. “I have just passed my graduation and was looking for some job to support my family and myself. Last week when I heard that the forest department was looking for some female guides I opted for it. Even though I have been born and brought up close to the forest I would need some training to know more about the biodiversity and how to be a guide,” said 21-year-old Sumona Mondol, a resident of Bijoynaar village. While her father and mother are farmers and often need to go to other states as migrant labourers, she stays back with her younger brother in the village. Her brother is studying in class 10. “The forest department would impart them a training covering topics like the ecology and biodiversity of the Sunderbans, climate change and its impact, the importance of the mangrove and man-animal interface among others. They would also be given training on communication skills in Bengali, English and Hindi as they would have to speak with tourists not just from West Bengal but also from other states in India and many times international tourists,” said Justin. The Sunderban with its thick mangrove has often proved to be the savior of Kolkata from the wrath of severe cyclones like Aila, Yaas and Bulbul. The mangrove forest acts like a bio-shield helping to reduce the wind speed drastically when the storm moves through the delta to reduce the impact of waves and the storm surge triggered by the cyclones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengals-sunderbans-to-get-women-tourist-guides-for-the-first-time-101632227173540.html
22-09-2021||India||Signing declaration against dowry a must for Kerala university students||In the wake of several dowry-induced deaths in Kerala in four months, several universities in the state have made it mandatory for students to sign a declaration pledging that they will neither ask for nor give dowry while getting married.The idea was first mooted by governor Arif Mohammad Khan in July, and later supported by the state government. Last week, 386 students of the Kerala University for Fisheries and Ocean Studies in Kochi signed a declaration before accepting their Bachelor’s and Master’s degreesat their convocation ceremony. Now, Calicut University has also prepared a declaration and sent it to principals, officials aware of the matter said. There are 391 colleges under the university, but the total number of students is unknown. “We have made it mandatory for all students to sign it before accepting their degree or Master’s certificates. The Governor had put forward this suggestion and we accepted it immediately,” said Calicut University vice-chancellor M K Jayaraj, adding such initiatives will help raise awareness against the evil. The declaration also warned against withdrawal of degree if the person was found to have accepted or given dowry. “I aver in the full understanding that any breach of the rules or law relating to taking or abetting the taking of dowry shall render me liable for appropriate action including the cancellation of my admission to the university/not being granted degree/ withdrawal of the degree,” said the declaration, a copy of which was seen by HT.“It is a good move. But we have to ensure that offenders should be identified and their degrees cancelled without any delay,” said K Reshma, a student leader. Activists said there were laws in place to stop the practice, but implementation was lax. They called for lessons in the curriculum against such social practices, and to promote ensure gender equality and justice. “Such weird practices are embedded in our culture and society. That is why many laws remain only on papers,” said actor and psychologist Malaa Parvati. The state reported a series of dowry-related deaths in last few months. Among the prominent cases was the death by suicide in June of a 24-year-old woman, an undergraduate student of ayurveda medicine and surgery in Kollam, that trigged a statewide outcry. Another newly married woman, a nursing student, allegedly committed suicide after setting herself on fire in Thiruvananthapuram. In both cases, parents alleged that they were harassed for dowry and driven to death. After their deaths shocking details of many such cases of harassment and torture surfaced. “We have to root out such practices. All varsities will make declarations mandatory,” said state higher education minister R Bindu. She said gender justice forum will be floated in all colleges and they will start working once the campus opens. A vigorous campaign will be launched to make youngsters aware of dangers of such practices and float a consensus against it, she said. In an unusual move, the governor visited the house of the deceased student of the ayurveda medicine in Kollam to console her parents and he broke down. On July 14 he also observed a day-long fast in the state capital to protest against the social evil, a first of its sort, and many Gandhians and activists also participated in it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-varsity-makes-declaration-against-dowry-mandatory-for-students-101632217332398.html
22-09-2021||India||Army helicopter crash-lands in Udhampur, both pilots succumb to injuries||Two pilots were killed on Tuesday when an Army helicopter crash-landed on a hill in Shiv Garh Dhar area, near Patnitop tourist resort in Udhampur district of Jammu and Kashmir, officials familiar with the matter said. The incident took place at around11 am when the chopper, a Cheetah, was on a routine training sortie. The two pilots -- Major Rohit Kumar and Major Anuj Rajput -- were critically injured and rushed to the nearest medical facility where they succumbed later, the officials added. “Today, during a training sortie in Patnitop area, Indian Army’s Cheetah Helicopter crash landed in Shiv Garh Dhar area in Udhampur district. Two pilots were injured and evacuated to the hospital but they could not survive,” defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, While Major Rohit Kumar hailed from Noida West, Major Anuj Rajput was a resident of Panchkula district.Visuals shared on social media showed the wrecked helicopter on a hill with some villagers trying to pull out the injured pilots. “The chopper crashed on a hill. Search parties were rushed to the area but dense fog and rains hampered rescue operations,” a senior J&K police officer said, preferring anonymity. Offering his condolences to families of the deceased, lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha tweeted: “I salute the courage and supreme sacrifice of our braveheart Army officers Major Rohit Kumar & Major Anuj Rajput who laid down their lives in the line of duty at Patnitop, Udhampur. My thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families in this hour of grief.” Union minister Dr Jitendra Singh also expressed grief over the incident. “Saddened to receive the news of death of both the Pilots who were injured this morning in the Army Helicopter crash in #Patnitop region of #JammuAndKashmir. Despite prompt and best possible aid, they could not be saved. My deep condolences to the bereaved families,” he posted on the micro-blogging site. Northern Army commander Lt Gen YK Joshi was also among those who paid tributes to the deceased pilots and offered condolences to their families. On August 3, two pilots were killed after an army helicopter crashed into Ranjit Sagar Dam lake near Pathankot. The body of one fallen pilot is still missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-helicopter-crash-lands-in-udhampur-both-pilots-injured-101632212651361.html
22-09-2021||India||Havana syndrome: CIA chief team member afflicted during India visit, says report||New Delhi: A member of CIA director Bill Burns’s delegation reported symptoms consistent with the mysterious Havana syndrome and had to receive medical attention during his visit to India this month, according to a CNN report on Tuesday. The incident set off alarm bells within the US government and left Burns “fuming”, according to one of three sources cited by CNN. This is the first media report regarding a US official being afflicted by Havana syndrome in India. Some CIA officials “viewed the chilling episode as a direct message to Burns that no one is safe, including those working directly for the nation’s top spy”, two people told CNN. Burns and his team met National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and top members of the National Security Council Secretariat during the visit to India on September 7. From India, the delegation travelled to Pakistan, where Burns met army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa. Burns’s visit to India was kept under tight wraps and there was no official word from both sides on the trip. The CIA chief travelled to India and Pakistan to discuss the way forward in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of the country on August 15 and the installation of a hardline setup that includes several members of the Haqqani Network. “The situation in India could have dramatic implications: the CIA director’s schedule is tightly held and there are deep concerns among US officials about how the perpetrator would have known about the visit and been able to plan for such an aggression,” the CNN report said. The person who experienced the symptoms in India received immediate medical attention on returning to the US. A CIA spokesperson declined to comment on the incident related to Burns’ visit to India. There was no immediate response from Indian officials either. The US administration has said very little officially about the Havana syndrome, a mysterious illness that has afflicted American spies and diplomats and was first reported in Cuba in late 2016. Since then, similar cases have been reported from Russia, China, Austria, and several other countries. CNN reported that the incident in New Delhi was the second time in less than a month that cases of Havana syndrome have affected foreign trips by top US administration officials. Last month, vice president Kamala Harris’s visit to Vietnam was slightly delayed when multiple US personnel reported symptoms consistent with the syndrome just ahead of her trip. Very little has appeared in public about the illness despite the US intelligence community undertaking a wide-ranging investigation into the matter, including a 100-day probe into potential causes that began this summer. Much of the speculation has centred on the illness being possibly caused by microwaves. US officials affected by Havana syndrome have reported hearing buzzing sounds of piercing squeals that didn’t go away even when they covered their ears. Others have reported hearing a low hum and feeling intense pressure on their skulls. Those affected by the syndrome experienced dizziness and fatigue for months and some had to retire after their medical condition worsened, according to media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/havana-syndrome-cia-chief-team-member-afflicted-during-india-visit-says-report-101632194109845.html

22-09-2021||Today's||What India can do to avoid US sanctions over Russia||Even as President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are set to meet this week for the in-person Quad summit, they could face a devastating setback if the United States (US) sanctions India in the coming months. The US’s Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) could compel the Biden administration to impose sanctions on India when it takes delivery of the Russian S-400 air defence system at the end of 2021. This move could deal a blow to the relationship, and their Indo-Pacific strategies. But if Indian leaders can acknowledge the US’s ire with Russia, assume greater burden-sharing, and adopt realism in its dealings with DC, it might better position itself for a sanctions waiver.
22-09-2021||Today's||For the empowerment of social entrepreneurs, a five-point agenda||The second Covid-19 wave has brought to fore the remarkable role of social entrepreneurs as last-mile responders. They mobilised resources, generated awareness, distributed necessities, provided counselling, dispelled myths, ensured home care services, built community service centres, facilitated testing, and supported the vaccination drive. They are also playing a pivotal role in the inclusive recovery and rebuilding of communities at the grassroots level.
22-09-2021||Today's||Why Modi’s visit to the US matters||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has embarked on his first foreign tour in six months to engage directly with the Joe Biden administration in the United States (US). Given the trajectory of India-US ties in recent decades, all bilateral engagements between the two nations come with a sense of anticipation, but this visit will be watched even more closely as it will dare to tackle some key challenges that have emerged in the last few weeks. America’s precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan and the signing of the AUKUS trilateral defence pact have raised some questions in Indian strategic circles about the Biden administration’s commitment to the larger India-US bilateral project.Modi’s visit will not only entail bilateral engagements with his Australian and Japanese counterparts, Scott Morrison and Yoshihide Suga, but will also see the PM address the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). The highlight will be the first in-person Quad summit. Biden had called the first leaders’ summit of Quad in March, giving a renewed impetus to a platform that lacked energy and dynamism. That was in virtual mode, and now, in less than six months, the grouping will be meeting again in the in-person format, underlining the growing importance of Quad in the ever-so-volatile Indo-Pacific region.Also Read | As Quad focuses on tech, the debate on standard settingThe four Quad nations will be meeting days after two of their partners, the US and Australia, sprang a surprise by signing AUKUS, enabling Australia to build nuclear-powered submarines. Though the US has reassured India that this pact is not likely to detract from Quad or bilateral cooperation, concerns have risen in India that the strategic dimension of the Quad engagement can get diluted if Washington begins to privilege AUKUS and other such arrangements. Unlike AUKUS, which is a security alliance, however, Quad’s agenda is distinct. For India, as articulated by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, “The Quad is a plurilateral grouping with a vision for a free, open, transparent and inclusive Indo-Pacific.”Yet, there are messages galore in AUKUS, and New Delhi will have to be able to use the openings provided by emerging alignments. Washington is responding to those who have been raising doubts about the durability of America’s regional commitments in the Indo-Pacific, especially in the aftermath of the Afghanistan debacle. Signing this deal soon after withdrawing military forces from Afghanistan is a way for the US to reassure its allies and partners that it will now focus on the Indo-Pacific, and in so doing, it is now willing to empower its regional allies. Sharing sensitive technologies, such as nuclear-powered submarine technology, is the beginning of a long process in this age of heightened contestation in strategic technologies. The US is showing that it is willing to walk the talk, and both Washington and Canberra are willing to bear the costs that come with making such decisions.For India, which has long complained about its like-minded partners not being ready to make costly choices, this new trilateral security partnership should come as a welcome move, one that will complement all its other engagements in the region, including Quad. The concern in New Delhi would be about the US, the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia mishandling France in forging the new pact. The Indo-Pacific strategic realities are rather fragile and need sustained commitment and consensus among like-minded nations. If AUKUS leads to a weakening of the French and broader European commitment to the Indo-Pacific, then that would only diminish the efficacy of the nascent security architecture and deterrence framework in this maritime geography.It is not without reason that France and India reached out to each other soon after the AUKUS announcement, with France assuring India of its “commitment to the strengthening of India’s strategic autonomy, including its industry and technology base, as part of a close relationship based on trust and mutual respect”. Given India’s close and deepening ties with all major stakeholders in this unfolding drama, New Delhi’s role becomes even more crucial in ensuring that the broader coalition of like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific is not only sustained but also gains in strength. Modi’s role at the Quad summit as well as in his bilateral engagements with the US and Australia becomes even more significant.Also Read | Visit an opportunity to consolidate ties, says PM Modi before leaving for USThe other issue pertains to India’s western frontier where instability engendered by the rise of the Taliban regime has confounded New Delhi’s calculus. At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation-Collective Security Treaty Organization (SCO-CTO) outreach summit on Afghanistan earlier this month, PM Modi made India’s position clear by underlining that “the transition of power in Afghanistan is not inclusive, and it has happened without negotiation”, and highlighted Indian concern that “if instability and fundamentalism persist in Afghanistan, it will encourage terrorist and extremist ideologies all over the world”.India will find it difficult to play its rightful role in the Indo-Pacific if its western frontier continues to remain volatile. Modi will have to put it across to his American interlocutors that as much as the western and eastern peripheries are linked for India, for the US too, the challenges emanating from Af-Pak are only likely to grow with China expanding its footprint in Afghanistan.In his first address before UNGA this week, Biden declared that the US is “not seeking a new Cold War”. New Delhi, too, has no interest in a world divided into rigid blocs, but structural challenges emanating from the Indo-Pacific demand that not only India and the US strive for a more robust partnership but also ensure that a growing coalition of nations with a shared interest in seeking a secure and stable region continues to gain momentum. PM Modi has his task cut out.Harsh V Pant is professor, King’s College London, and director of studies, Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/why-modi-s-visit-to-the-us-matters-101632303816140.html
22-09-2021||Today's||As Quad focuses on tech, the debate on standard setting||Technology will be at the forefront of the first in-person Quad summit in the United States (US). The control of critical technologies and their supply chains remain essential for all States to project their geopolitical influence. However, having a grip on the governance mechanism of these critical technologies in the form of technical standards can prove to be a gamechanger in the geostrategic field.
22-09-2021||Editorials||Assam’s quest for rhino conservation||To mark World Rhino Day, the Assam government on Wednesday destroyed nearly 2,500 horns of the one-horned rhinoceros, elephant tusks, and other body parts of other wild animals. The destruction of horns and other animal parts complies with the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972, and a later Supreme Court order. While Assam had disposed of horns recovered before 1979, those collected later were at the forest department’s district treasuries after they were recovered from poachers or collected from dead rhinos. In India, one-horned rhinos were declared endangered in 1975, but downgraded to “vulnerable” in 2008. Assam has the largest population of one-horn rhino in the world, numbering about 2,600.

The visit has a bilateral component, with the first in-person conversation between PM Modi and President Joe Biden. It has a plurilateral component, with the first in-person summit of the Quad leaders. And it has a multilateral component, as PM Modi moves to New York to address the United Nations (UN) General Assembly. In all forms of engagement, India confronts both an opportunity and a challenge.
