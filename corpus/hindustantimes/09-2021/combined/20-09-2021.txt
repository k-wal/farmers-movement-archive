The officials said they identified the buildings in a new survey soon after the incident.Officials said the identified are at least 50-60 years old. “After a fresh survey, we identified around 18 buildings that either needed to be demolished or required major retrofitting for providing structural stability. Two of the buildings have already been vacated for demolition, and a portion of another one has already been demolished,” said a senior corporation official, who asked not to be named.Two children were passing by a building on the main road of the Old Sabzi Mandi area last Monday when its front portion collapsed, burying them under debris. The building that collapsed was not on the list of “dangerous” buildings identified during the pre-monsoon survey by the civic body.Most of these buildings, being old structures, are vacant or are disputed properties, the North DMC said. “Notices have been issued to the house owners of all these properties under relevant sections of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. Also, awareness drives are being carried out to tell people about the importance of structural safety,” the official said.The pre-monsoon survey conducted by the civic body during May-June to detect such structures across its six zones identified 699 properties as “dangerous” while 444 others were identified for necessary repairs, said officials. The building that collapsed came under Civil Lines Zone.The pre-monsoon survey showed that Civil Lines Zone has 89 “dangerous” properties; municipal ward number 13 (Malkaganj ward, where the incident took place) has 20 “dangerous” structures--the fresh survey this week identified 18 more. Of the 20 buildings identified in the pre-monsoon survey, nine are on the same stretch where the four-storey building collapsed. The civic body had ordered an inquiry into the building collapse incident, a report on which is yet to be submitted, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sabzi-mandi-building-collapse-fresh-north-mcd-survey-identifies-18-high-risk-structures-in-malkaganj-municipal-ward-101632162559521.html

His detention preceded high drama in Mumbai where Somaiya was asked by police not to venture out of his residence citing Kolhapur administration’s order. After being stopped at Karad, Somaiya alleged that he was jostled by the Mumbai police, who on Sunday night to tried to prevent him boarding the Kolhapur-bound Mahalaxmi express. Somaiya planned to visit Kagal in Kolhapur, the Assembly constituency represented by Mushrif, and to file a police complaint against the minister over alleged irregularities committed by him. The ruling Shiv Sena termed Somaiya’s allegations as “theatrics”, while blaming the BJP of trying destablising the Maharashtra government. Former chief minister and leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis reacted to the episode saying action against Somaiya is “unprecedented”. “For the first time in independent India history, a person who was on his way to file a police complaint, has been detained,” Fadnavis told reporters in Goa, a state he has been made in-charge of, ahead of assembly elections there. In Pune, state chief Chandrakant Patil claimed that there was misuse of power and accused state ministers of indulging in corruption. A few days ago, Somaiya had accused Mushrif of indulging in corruption and holding ‘’benami’’ entities in the name of his kin, allegations dismissed as baseless by the latter. Somaiya, who boarded the Mahalaxmi Express in Mumbai on Sunday night to go to Kolhapur, in a tweet on Monday morning said, “Police stopped me at Karad under prohibitory order”. According to Kolhapur superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawde, a team of district police reached Karad. Somaiya was stopped at Karad railway station and served a copy of the (prohibitory) order. “After we told him that he was prohibited from entering the district, he cooperated and will return after addressing a press conference in Karad,” Balkawade said. Somaiya on Sunday displayed an order from Kolhapur Collector Rahul Rekhawar that said the former had been prohibited from entering the district under section 144 of the IPC “in view of the threat to his life and possibility of law and order situation due to his visit”. The order also said the police would be occupied with Ganpati immersions and it would not be possible to provide security to Somaiya. Senior inspector Sunil Kamble of Navghar police station in Mumbai had also issued a notice to Somaiya, asking him to follow the Kolhapur administration order. Somaiya’s residence at Mulund in Mumbai falls within the jurisdiction of Navghar police station. Somaiya termed the development “dadagiri” of the Uddhav Thackeray government. He also accused the Mumbai police of forgery, saying they had handed him an order by the Kolhapur district administration stating that he should not be allowed to leave Mumbai. “When I was given a copy of the order by Kolhapur police today (Monday) morning at Karad, there was no mention that I should not be allowed to go out of Mumbai,” he said. Somaiya said he would move court against his “illegal detention” and the order issued in Mumbai. He said the Kolhapur district administration’s order talks about a threat perception to him if he goes there. “Is it that since I registered a complaint against Mushrif, there was a plan to attack me?” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kirit-somaiya-stopped-on-way-to-kolhapur-sena-bjp-indulge-in-war-of-words-101632162548849.html

The woman’s husband sustained minor injuries in the accident, police said.The deceased were identified as Neeraj Sharma and her daughter Anjali, who lived in a society in Noida’s Salarpur. The family is a native of Agra, police said. According to Neeraj’s husband Ramkaran Sharma, they were waiting for public transport near the Mahamaya flyover when the accident took place.“We had returned from Mathura and were on our way home.

20-09-2021||Delhi||Jamia students want university reopened||Student groups at Jamia Millia Islamia on Monday unanimously sought that the university be reopened. A group of students approached the university to make a case for its reopening. The university was closed last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In a joint statement, students said that it was crucial to reopen the university since several of them had been facing challenges during remote learning. “AC and EC meetings were held four-five days ago but its minutes are not yet released. In this situation, the students are facing an uncertainty related to the reopening of the campus,” said the statement issued by the student organisations Following the Delhi Disaster Management Authority directive on August 30, which allowed students of higher educational institutes to return to campuses as long as 50% seating capacity was maintained, Delhi University (DU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) released their own reopening plans. While JNU allowed final-year PhD students to return to campus from Monday following a mandatory negative Covid-19 test report, DU allowed final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students to return to campus only for their practical examss, lab work, or academic consultation. Jamia, on the other hand, is yet to share any roadmap on reopening for undergraduate courses. The students’ statement also highlighted the travails they were facing due to the challenges of the digital divide and the lack of library facilities. Continued closure of the university would deteriorate the education system further, students said. “We have already seen the grievances students faced due to the ever-increasing digital divide and relentless natural calamities that went in parallel with the pandemic. Many students, who want to access libraries and practical equipment, are not yet given access to them,” the statement said. Less than two weeks ago, vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar said that the university had not discussed reopening for undergraduate students so far. “We have already been allowing final-year PG students of professional and science courses to come to the campus for their practical and lab work. Even final-year PhD students are allowed to come to campus following a special permit. With the risk of a third wave around the corner, we cannot take any decision in haste as it would put our students at risk,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jamia-students-want-university-reopened-101632162368260.html

The new cases have been reported from the district hospital, Post Graduate Institute of Child Health and a private hospital, the officials said. The first dengue case was reported on September 6. “The district has reported a total of 21 dengue cases so far. While four patients are undergoing treatment at different hospitals, others are recovering at home,” said Dr Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, GB Nagar.Last year, the district had not reported any dengue case, while 40 such cases were recorded in 2019.After a dengue outbreak in western Uttar Pradesh districts like Agra, Mathura and Firozabad, GB Nagar has been on alert regarding the vector-borne diseases and viral fevers. Experts at the Indian Council of Medical Research have confirmed the D2 strain of dengue in samples of children who died due to a ‘mystery fever’ in some UP districts.However, officials in GB Nagar said that none of the dengue cases in the district have shown signs of the new strain. “The new strain is deadlier and often causes haemorrhage. Experts have said that the new strain is limited to the affected districts only,” said Sharma.Meanwhile, the district health officials are also monitoring scrub typhus and leptospirosis cases. “GB Nagar had reported three cases of scrub typhus who have all recovered now. However, there have not been any cases of leptospirosis so far,” said Sharma.According to GB Nagar chief medical officer Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, the district has been taking preventive measures to control breeding of mosquitoes. “Sanitation and fogging drives have been ramped up across the district to stop the spread of dengue and viral fevers. Fortunately, cases of dengue and malaria have remained low in GB Nagar so far,” said the CMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/eight-new-dengue-cases-in-gb-nagar-in-three-days-tally-reaches-21-101632162367025.html

20-09-2021||Delhi||Pragati Maidan tunnel road corridor may open by November, says PWD||New Delhi: A 1.2-kilometre-long tunnel road corridor underneath Pragati Maidan, connecting Mathura Road, Ring Road and Bhairon Marg is likely to be opened by November, said senior officials of the Delhi government’s Public Works Department -- the agency that is executing the work.The underground road corridor will help decongest one of the most traffic-intensive areas in Delhi as well as roads that are marred perennially by traffic jams. Once the tunnel opens, along with six underpasses that are also part of the project to allow traffic move seamlessly enter and exit the underground road, a drive to the India Gate and parts of central Delhi from different corners of the city will become hassle free.However, like the Ashram Chowk underpass, this project too has been running way behind schedule, and the PWD is not only yet to finish work on the tunnel, but also have to get necessary approvals to finish work on two of the six underpasses that are part of the project. This is besides the major road repair works that the agency will have to undertake on Mathura Road, Ring Road and Bhairon Marg, near project sites. The tunnel and the six underground U-turns were to be finished by March 2019. The same year, PWD fixed two new deadlines -- first for May and then September. However, when it could not meet either of them, the department did not fix a new deadline. Senior officials quoted above, however, expressed the confidence that the entire project will be opened in phases, after trials, adding that around 95% work on the tunnel has been done. Of the six underpasses -- five are located on Mathura Road, and one on the Ring road. Two of the five underpasses on Mathura Road are near Sundar Nagar and three are between Pragati Maidan and Supreme Court. The underpass on the Ring Road connects it to Bhairon Marg. Officials said though work on four underground U-turns is nearing completion, the other two are stuck. “Work at two of the underpasses near Supreme Court and Matka Peer is stalled as we are yet to receive permissions from a few agencies. As soon as we get those, work will commence there as well and we will soon be able to open those stretches as well. We will also construct a service lane along Mathura road before we open the roads for trial. After getting a final nod from the traffic police, it will be thrown open for final operations by November,” said an official.In the first phase, the main tunnel will be thrown open to traffic by November along with three other underpasses at DPS Mathura road, Kaka Nagar and Bhairon Marg. Officials said that trials on this stretch will begin after the second week of October, but only a limited number of vehicles will be allowed.Besides finishing work to be able to open the tunnel road by November, the PWD will have to undertake major road repairs on Mathura Road as well as Bhairon Marg. Stretches on both roads where work is going on, are in tatters. The project was primarily designed to handle the projected growth in traffic after revamp of Pragati Maidan. The tunnel road, goes beneath Pragati Maidan, starting near National Sports Club of India (NSCI) on Purana Qila Road, and ends on Ring Road near the Pragati Power station. The 932-crore project will help reduce snarls by cutting east Delhi-bound traffic from south and Lutyens’ Delhi through India Gate and ITO. At least 90,000 commuters use the ITO intersection every day and at least 60,000 commuters use the Bhairon Marg intersection every day, according to PWD data. A senior PWD official, who is associated with the project said the tunnel will also provide three entry/exit points to the underground parking coming up at Pragati Maidan. Sewa Ram, professor, School of Planning and Architecture, said the tunnel will definitely help decongest ITO and provide easier ride to and from East Delhi to Central Delhi. “However, the full results of this project will only be seen once the PWD opens all six underpasses,” he said.Other experts said to completely decongest the entire Mathura Road, the PWD should also expedite work on the under-construction underpass at the Ashram Chowk. They said once the tunnel opens, and traffic flow becomes smoother from ITO, vehicles will still get stuck at the Ashram Chowk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pragati-maidan-tunnel-road-corridor-may-open-by-november-says-pwd-101632162308096.html

The first dengue case this year was reported on September 1, officials said.The data also revealed that the instances of scrub typhus have reached 39 and over 87% of such patients required hospitalisation. Scrub typhus is caused by a bacterium called Orientia tsutsugamushi and the disease spreads to people through bites of infected larval mites.Till Monday evening, Ghaziabad reported a total of 155 dengue cases, the data showed. Last year, the district had recorded only 15 cases of dengue. According to the officials, the dengue cases reported so far in Ghaziabad are the highest since 2017 when the district had recorded a total of 232 such cases.Explaining the high rate of hospitalisation in these cases, Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer, said, “The fatality rate in case of scrub typhus is usually about 30%, while in case of malaria it is just about 1%. So, patients of scrub typhus prefer hospitalisation. Likewise, in case of dengue, when the platelet count comes down, patients prefer hospitalisation.” No death due to these two diseases has been reported in the district, Gupta said. “Our teams are regularly keeping an eye on high incidence areas where dengue cases have emerged. Anti-larvae sprays and fogging are getting done regularly. As far as the rise in cases of scrub typhus is concerned, we came to know that people who visited hill stations have got affected by scrub typhus. More than 90% of scrub typhus patients have history of visits to hill stations. So, the spread is not local,” said GK Mishra, district malaria officer.Experts said that indications of scrub typhus are fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, among others. “Patients who are getting admitted to hospitals due to fever are also being tested for scrub typhus. In the past few years, we have come across high number of cases of scrub typhus. Its patients also develop red rashes on skin. However, many scrub typhus and dengue patients with mild symptoms get recovered easily. Only patients having complications like dengue haemorrhagic fever require admission,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). “The incidence of vector-borne disease is high this year as there have been frequent rains during the ongoing monsoon season. This has resulted in waterlogging in several parts of the district, giving favourable conditions for mosquitoes to breed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/dengue-cases-cross-150-in-ghaziabad-more-of-scrub-typhus-patients-getting-hospitalised-101632162186967.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||Slight uptick as dengue cases crosses 200-mark in Delhi||New Delhi: With 53 more cases of dengue recorded in the Capital over the last week, the total number of the mosquito borne infection so far this year in Delhi has crossed the 200 mark.Delhi recorded 211 cases and no deaths due to the viral infection till Saturday, according to the weekly report released by the municipal corporations on Monday. The tally is higher than the 172 cases of the infection reported during the same period last year, even as doctors reported a surge in co-infection of dengue and Covid-19 in September last year. Delhi, along with 10 other states, is also reporting some cases of serotype 2 dengue, which is associated with higher risk of severe disease and may result in internal bleeding or capillaries leaking out fluids resulting in a sharp drop in blood pressure. There are four serotypes of dengue virus – Type 1 and 3 are the milder serotypes while type 2 and 4 are associated with severe disease. The Capital last saw serotype 2 infections in 2015 when a large outbreak affected nearly 16,000 people and killed 60. Since then, serotype 3 caused most of the infections in Delhi. So far this year, doctors have not reported too many cases of persons coming in with bleeding, circulatory shock, or severe drop in platelet count. “There has been an increase in dengue cases over the last three weeks. However, most people are coming in with mild to moderate disease. Although some do end up needing platelet transfusion, their numbers are still very low,” said Dr Atul Gogia, senior consultant of internal medicine at Sir Ganga Ram hospital. Dr Amitabh Parti, director of internal medicine at Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram, said, “There has been a 15-20% increase in the number of fever cases in the out-patient clinics. Over the last two months, most of the fever cases were that of flu. However, with flu cases on the decline, dengue has overtaken now.” “Only 2 -3% of the patients with dengue currently have reported severe symptoms. In most cases, the platelet count drops to around 40,000-50,000 and then starts going up again on its own. Only symptomatic management and hydration is needed [in most cases]. There are a few patients whose platelet count hovers in the 17,000-20,000 range and may need a platelet transfusion, but even they are recovering easily.” Platelet is a component of the blood that helps form clots and prevent bleeding from wounds. The decline in platelet count results in internal bleeding in dengue patients. The normal count is 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Dengue is caused by the aedes aegypti mosquito which mainly breeds in fresh, stagnant water near homes during the monsoon season and bite during the day. The Delhi government has started its ’10 hafte, 10 baje, 10 minute’ campaign that urges people to clean out all water-containing vessels in their homes and check for breeding once a week, thereby breaking the eight to ten day life-cycle of the mosquito. Dr Neeraj Nischal, associate professor in the department of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), said that there was need to prepare keeping in mind the dangerous serotype of the virus. “Dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases are easily preventable if we ensure that we don’t allow mosquitoes to breed in and around our houses. If the cases of dengue rises significantly, it will definitely lead to complications in some patients and may even be life threatening. The general principle is to ensure you are adequately hydrated... Take medical opinion of an expert before taking any sort of medicine,” he said.Doctors said several pain medicines can lead to increased bleeding in dengue patients. They advised people to seek medical opinion within 72 hours since there are many infections doing the rounds in the city. “We are seeing cases of dengue, malaria, typhoid, flu, and Covid-19. It is very hard for patients to distinguish and some of them might worsen within a few days. So, it is best to seek medical opinion within 48-72 hours of getting fever,” said Dr Parti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/slight-uptick-as-dengue-cases-crosses-200-mark-in-delhi-101632161947649.html

20-09-2021||Delhi||Steep stairways make way for ramps at Delhi’s Qutub Minar||Steep stairways at the world heritage site of Qutub Minar will no longer pose a challenge to the disabled and the elderly as the Archaeological Survey of India has installed wooden ramps at three places within the complex, said officials in the premier heritage body. One ramp has come up between the Qutub Minar and the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque (both built by the Mamluk sultans of Delhi in the late 12th and early 13th centuries), while another is under construction and will connect the 16th-century Tomb of Imam Zamin built during the reign of Emperor Humayun with the 14th-century Alai Darwaza constructed by Sultan Alauddin Khilji. A third ramp will come up near the mosque. These ramps are being built over the existing stairways, which will no longer be accessible to any visitor. “Earlier, visitors were required to climb 15-20 stairs, which was not comfortable. While one ramp has already come up, two others are nearing completion and will be made operational soon. These will provide ease of access for the disabled and the elderly who struggle to climb stairs,” said an ASI official, who did not wish to be named. But this won’t limit the visitor experience. “We have installed glass panels on the sides of the ramps, which will allow visitors to see the staircases and their layouts below,” the official added. This is among the many changes that the complex has seen since last year, including a new parking lot, six new booking counters, four ticket-vending machines, toilets, drinking water kiosks, a cafeteria and a cloakroom. Due to this, the official said, the monument is close to becoming an ‘aadarsh smarak’ (model monument) as envisioned by a 2014 scheme of the same name that promises better civic amenities at heritage monuments. “There is now Wi-Fi internet connectivity at the complex, while touch-screen kiosks are also being set up. In terms of infrastructure and facilities, the complex is nearly ready and only a few aspects are left to be covered. Only an interpretation centre is missing right now,” said the official. A UNESCO world heritage site, the Qutub complex usually ranks among the top two in Delhi when it comes to footfall. Before the pandemic struck last year, Red Fort had the highest footfall. “When the monuments reopened after the first lockdown, Qutab Minar saw the highest footfall. Even before the pandemic, Qutub Minar was among the most visited monuments,” said another senior ASI official, requesting anonymity. As per ASI data, 24,496 people visited the site between September 1 and 19; the visitor figures for Red Fort and Humayun’s Tomb during this period were 23,052 and 6,018, respectively. The official said that there could be multiple reasons behind the post-lockdown visitor spike at the monument. “South Delhi has many well-to-do people who might have found it easier to visit the monument during the unlock phase at a time when other public transport facilities were suspended,” said the official. Heritage enthusiast, writer and filmmaker Sohail Hashmi said better facilities and easier access were welcome developments. “Quite a lot of our monuments such as Kotla Ferozeshah, Begumpur Masjid, and Hauz Khas, among others, are inaccessible to the differently-abled,” said Hashmi, adding that even eateries around the Qutub complex look cleaner now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/steep-stairways-make-way-for-ramps-at-delhi-s-qutub-minar-101632161768217.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||Self-styled commander of Manipuri insurgent group arrested in Delhi||Delhi Police’s special cell has arrested a 24-year-old self-styled commander-in-chief of a Manipur-based alleged insurgent group, Kuki National Front (KNF), from Dwarka in southwest Delhi on Sunday. He is wanted by Manipur Police in connection with various criminal activities including kidnapping for ransom, snatching of firearms, extortion, firing, and robbery, senior police officers said.According to deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah, Mangkholam Kipgen, alias David Kipgen, controls a vast network of armed militants in Manipur. He was planning the abduction of employees of a construction company in Manipur, which is involved in the construction of roads and other establishments in the state, for ransom, said Kushwah.On Sunday, the DCP said, the special cell received inputs about Kipgen’s presence in Delhi. They arrested him from Sector 7 in Dwarka. During interrogation, Kipgen disclosed that he met KNF cadres in his village in 2018 and joined them in extortion, robbery, dacoity, and other crimes.“Soon, Kipgen became notorious in Manipur for snatching weapons from personnel of the armed police forces, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion. In June 2020, he declared himself as the commander-in-chief of KNF,” added DCP Kushwah.Police said that on the night of December 12, Kipgen and his associates armed themselves and allegedly attacked, overpowered, and abducted two sentries of Kangvai police outpost in Manipur’s Churachandpur and took away one INSAS rifle. Police arrested eight members of the outfit and recovered the stolen rifle. However, Kipgen evaded arrest. On February 18, Kipgen and his associates allegedly abducted a Nepali citizen, Tikkaram Rizal, from Churachandpur for ransom. Two suspects, including Kipgen’s brother, Haopilun Kipgen,20, were arrested, the police said.On the day of ‘Sahnit Ni’, the Kuki’s Black Day on September 13, 2021, KNF declared total shutdown in the state, restricting the movement of vehicles and closing down all administrative offices and business establishments.

20-09-2021||Lucknow||UP’s GSDP shrinks 5.9 per cent in 2020-21||Uttar Pradesh’s Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) is estimated to have shrunk by 5.9 per cent in 2020-2021 following the adverse impact of Covid-19 on the state’s economy, according to the State Planning Institute (Economics and Statistics Division), Uttar Pradesh.The revised estimates of the state’s income may push even farther the objective of making Uttar Pradesh a trillion-dollar economy in the next five years.The revised estimates of UP’s income that the State Planning Institute (Economics and Statistics Division) released on September 16 though show a slight improvement in the growth of GSDP (on constant price), the state government will have to mobilise additional resources to push the economy ahead. Advance estimates for 2020-21 (released in March 2021) had shown a contraction of about 6.4 per cent in the GSDP.A close scrutiny of the revised data released for 2018-19 (revised provisional) 2019-20 (revised quick) and 2020-21 (revised advance) also indicates that the state’s economy grew at a rate of less than 5 per cent in the past four-and-a-half-year tenure of the BJP government in UP. The GSDP growth in 2017-18 is estimated to be 4.9 per cent. In 2018-19 and 2019-20, it remained at about 4.3 per cent only. Significantly, the data shows that UP’s GSDP (at current prices) is estimated to have reached ₹15,82,682 crore in 2018-19, ₹17,25,860 crore in 2019-20 and ₹17,39,114 crore in 2020-21. The state government had recently claimed that the GSDP has increased from ₹17,91,263 crore to ₹19,40,527 crore (revised estimates) on March 31, 2021. “These estimates do not paint a rosy picture of the state economy and its performance over the past four years. As per these estimates, the rate of growth of the economy was less than 5% during 2017-20 and (- 5.9%) in the Covid-19 year 2020-21.These rates of growth are much lower than what is warranted by the target of making UP a trillion-dollar economy by 2025,” said Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of the department of economics, Lucknow University.Tyagi further said, “A worrisome fact is that an important sector like manufacturing registered negative rates of growth over the last four years. Its share in GSDP is also declining and is less than 15%. For rapid industrialisation of the state, this is not a good sign. The performance of the agriculture sector has been quite good. Even in the epidemic affected year 2020-21, it had a positive growth of 2.7%. Services or the tertiary sector has done well except in 2020-21 wherein it contracted by 7.9%. The above facts should be a sobering reminder to the state government that much needs to be done to put Uttar Pradesh on the fast trajectory of growth.”The Indian economy contracted by 7.3 per cent in the fiscal year 2020-21, according to the GDP statistics released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) of the Central government on May 31, 2021. The state planning institute has prepared the revised data on the basis of the methodology provided by NSO and using the data after holding online discussions from March 30 to April 30, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ups-gsdp-shrinks-5-9-per-cent-in-202021-101632161467657.html

In a separate direction, the department also issued restoration notice to buyers and developers involved in constructing and selling flats in Sai Lane of Old Gurugram. DTCP officials said that despite repeated notices to violators, they did not stop developing and selling plots in Sector 69. The directions were issued on September 13 but the notice was shared by the department on Monday.RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that they have written to the Badshahpur police seeking FIRs against 30 persons for developing an illegal colony in Sector 69. “We have asked the police to register a case against 30 persons for developing the colony illegally. We had earlier also got a case registered in this matter at Sector 65 (police station) but on investigation, it was revealed that these persons have neither stopped development work nor construction in this colony,” he said, adding that the matter was transferred to the Badshahpur police. Bhath said that the identified people colluded to dupe buyers, who will lose their investments as permissions were not obtained from the competent authorities. In the Sai Lane issue, the enforcement department issued notices to 20 persons for allegedly developing illegal flats at the colony in Old Gururgam. In its notice to the developers and owners of properties, the department said that replies to the show-cause notices were “not satisfactory.” “In view of the above, you are here by ordered under Section 10 (2) of the Haryana Urban Development Act No. 8 of 1975 to restore the said land to its original state including demolition of any building/ means of access wherever constructed to bring it in conformity with the provisions of the act or the rules framed thereunder as your offence is still continued by you. In case of non-compliance, the undersigned shall take necessary measures under Section 10 (3) of Act No. 8 of 1975 to restore the land, which may include demolition of the unauthorised construction to bring the land in conformity with the provisions of Act/Rules and cost incurred upon such measures shall be recovered from you as arrears of land revenue under act,” the notice issued by DTP (enforcement) on September 18 stated. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement), said that the action against the owners and developers of illegal flats can include sealing of properties, registration of FIRs and demolition, as a final measure. “Action is being taken systematically against developers of illegal colonies and legal parameters are being met to ensure they stand scrutiny at all forums,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/firs-recommended-against-30-over-illegal-colony-in-sector-69-restoration-notices-issued-to-sai-lane-developers-101632161412177.html

Rathee was announced as the candidate by the party on Monday for the elections scheduled for October 3.Rathee joined BJP on September 16 and has previously served as the councillor of Ward 34 as an independent candidate from 2011-2016. She is the wife of the late RS Rathee, who was a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and had won the Ward 34 seat in the 2017 MCG elections. The seat has been vacant since RS Rathee’s death due to Covid-19 on May 30.“Being a former ward councillor myself, as well as closely monitoring the developments executed in the area by my late husband, I am well-versed with the problems and localised issues of the ward.

20-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram-Faridabad highway: Nine animal underpasses proposed in Aravallis to reduce road kills||The Gurugram wildlife department has identified nine spots on the Gurugram-Faridabad highway that can be converted into animal underpasses as this busy road passes through the Aravallis, officials of the forest department said on Monday. Officials said that these spots are located along a 12-kilometre stretch between the Bandhwari landfill and Regional Centre for Biotechnology on the highway. MS Malik, the chief conservator of forests for the Gurugram circle, said that underpasses can help mitigate man-animal conflict on the stretch. “We have identified around seven to nine points on the Gurugram-Faridabad highway, which are either stormwater outlets that are not in use or other structures which can be used as animal underpasses, after proper fencing is done along with roads. We will be meeting with the Public Works Department this week to finalise the points and work is likely to start from next month,” Malik said.The Gurugram-Faridabad highway is a busy stretch that fragments the Aravalli forests, due to which several road kills have been reported. In June 2021, a two-year-old female leopard was found dead on the Pali-Surajkund Road near Gurugram, with autopsy reports suggesting it could have been hit by a vehicle. This was the seventh death of a leopard to be reported from this region since 2015. The stretch from where the leopard’s carcass was recovered is an ecologically sensitive area, as it is flanked by the Asola Bhati wildlife sanctuary on both sides.Sunil Harsana, a Faridabad-based wildlife researcher, said, “The points which have been identified for wildlife underpasses can work really well, provided proper fencing is done to stop the animals from going to the road and ensure that the underpass is the only outlet available for the animal. Some of the spots are close to places where leopard deaths have been reported earlier, so if made properly, the underpasses can serve the purpose. When the roads will be blocked with fencing, smaller animals or herbivores will start using the underpasses and leopards which follow these animals as prey, will also start using them.”In 2017, the Wildlife Institute of India, in a study titled ‘Mapping landuse/landcover Patterns in Aravallis Haryana’ concerning the status of key wildlife species, had mentioned, “Highways passing through the wildlife habitats have adversely affected the fauna in these forests. Fast moving vehicles kill these animals when they move across these road stretches. The Gurugram-Faridabad expressway is one such road in Aravallis.”Earlier this year, in August, the wildlife department had decided to convert three stormwater outlets on the National Highway-48 (NH-48) into animal underpasses, to provide safe passage to wild animals and reduce road kills and conflicts. Two of the underpasses are located near Panchgaon and the third is near the National Security Guard outpost in Manesar. Officials said that two passages are of one-metre diameter, and one is a box passage structure with dimensions of 1.5mX1.5m.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugramfaridabad-highway-nine-animal-underpasses-proposed-in-aravallis-to-reduce-road-kills-101632161407591.html
20-09-2021||Gurugram||Mayor-SE tiff: MCG workers defer strike till Friday||Employees of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Monday again deferred their strike to protest the suspension of a superintending engineer (SE) following a tiff with the mayor. They have now decided to wait till Friday, September 24, for the Haryana government to reinstate the SE, members of the engineers’ union said.“We have internally decided to give the MCG and the Haryana government till the end of this week to sort out the matter. If they still do not meet our demands on Friday, we will deliberate over the next course of action,” Praveen Kumar, head of the MCG engineers’ union, said.Kumar, however, did not specify any reason for extending the deadline again.Last week, the protesting employees had threatened to carry out a strike unless the government reinstated the SE by Monday. Union members said that the decision to extend the deadline was taken internally, without the intervention of any official.Following a tiff with mayor Madhu Azad regarding the cleaning of a blocked drain in Ward 22, the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) had suspended SE Ramesh Sharma two weeks ago. The ULB’s decision had evoked a strong reaction from MCG officials, contractual staff, and their unions.For the first time since its formation in 2008, the MCG employees staged a protest in the form of a two-day pen-down strike on September 9 and 10, demanding the reinstatement of the SE.After reassurances from the MCG commissioner, Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, that the matter would be “looked into”, the protesters had initially given the commissioner a five-day deadline, till September 15, to resolve the matter. On September 15, after a meeting with Ahuja, they deferred their deadline by another five days to September 20, due to unavailability of officials concerned.A senior MCG official, requesting anonymity, said that the strike has lost momentum and it is unlikely that a full-scale strike will be carried out again.“Just a day before the September 15 deadline, ULB had asked for details of around 30 officials, workers, and union leaders who were protesting against the SE’s suspension. Details such as the time remaining on their tenure, whether they were permanent or contractual employees, were sought. Since then, most union leaders, contractual workers, and even the engineering wing staff have backed down and returned to their full-time roles,” the official said.Despite calls, Ramesh Sharma could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mayorse-tiff-mcg-workers-defer-strike-till-friday-101632161349277.html

They were escorted by a heavy police force and an earthmover was used in the drive, they said.“The team took action on the basis of a complaint received at the CM Window and demolished part of a house occupied by a person on MCG land as well as an adjoining house built by the same person. After this, the team took action to demolish several temporary structures, including dozens of illegally settled slums, junk and building material shops in other areas of the village,” SS Rohilla, the MCG’s public relations officer, said. Rohilla said that police were present at the spot to deal with any possible resistance. However, no untoward action was reported and the drive was completed peacefully.Over the years, the MCG has faced heavy resistance from Nathupur locals during such drives.During an anti-encroachment drive in the area held in February 2020, three policemen were injured as locals resorted to stone pelting.During a drive to capture stray animals in August 2017, locals thrashed four MCG officials with rods, sticks, and batons.Six MCG officials were also injured during a demolition drive in May 2014 as residents of the slum took to stone-pelting. Two vehicles of the fire department were also set afire by protesting locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/encroachments-cleared-mcg-reclaims-land-in-nathupur-village-101632161347612.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||HC stalls proceedings against Gambhir, his foundation in drugs hoarding case||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Monday halted proceedings in a trial court against BJP MP Gautam Gambhir, his foundation, wife and mother in a complaint filed against them by the state Drugs Control Department for alleged unauthorised stocking and distribution of Fabiflu medicine during the second wave of Covid-19. Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar issued a notice to the department on a plea by Gambhir which sought quashing of the criminal complaint and the summons issued by the trial court. Seeking the Drugs Control Department’s response, the judge said, “Till then the proceedings are stayed.”In a plea filed through advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, Gambhir said the medicines were distributed under the guidance of a doctor and was done for charity, a stand disputed by the department.The Drugs Control Department registered a complaint against Gautam Gambhir, his mother Seema, and wife Natasha, in addition to the Gautam Gambhir Foundation and its CEO Aprajita Singh, for offences under section 18(c) read with section 27(b)(ii) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.Section 18(c) of the Act prohibits manufacturing, sale and distribution of drugs without a license and Section 27(b)(ii) makes sale and distribution without a valid license punishable with imprisonment for a term not less than three years but which may extend to five years and with fine.The complaint was registered by the department after a division bench of the high court directed it to conduct inquiries against people stocking and distributing medicines as it was a violation of the Act.The high court expressed displeasure over the manner in which a huge quantity of the drug was procured during the Covid wave, noting that genuine patients who needed medicines at that particular time could not get it as a bulk of the stock was taken away by Gambhir’s NGO.On June 3, the department informed the high court that Gambhir’s NGO was guilty of unauthorised stocking, procuring and distributing Fabiflu medicines to Covid-19 patients.On July 26, pursuant to the complaint by the department, a trial court noted that the complainant has been able to prima facie prove the commission of the offence, and had summoned Gambhir to appear before it.Last month, the city court posted the matter for hearing on February 7, 2022.On Monday, senior advocate Atmaram NS Nadkarni, appearing for Gambhir, challenged the city court order and argued that the complaint against his client could not be justified because he had distributed medicines free of cost to those in need and did not sell them to make profit. He added that Gambhir’s family members have also been named in the complaint for no reason.Additional standing counsel Nandita Rao, appearing for the Drugs Control Department, pointed out that the inquiry against Gambhir’s NGO was carried out on the instructions of the division bench of the high court. She submitted that while the division bench had exempted the people who were distributing oxygen, it directed inquiry against those stocking and distributing medicines.She said that a large quantity of medicines was found from Gambhir’s NGO, adding that the distribution of medicines cannot be done without a licence. The court said that the matter needed consideration and asked the department to file its reply. The matter will be heard on December 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hcstalls-proceedings-against-gambhir-his-foundation-in-drugs-hoarding-case-101632161287515.html
20-09-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka to launch major campaign in UP, 1st rally in Meerut on Sept 29||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra proposes to launch a massive campaign and address a series of public rallies beginning in Meerut on September 29 to connect with the people, including farmers agitating against the Centre’s three new farm laws.Priyanka is expected to make a number of public announcements about the promises her party may make to people in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly election, according to senior Congress leaders.“Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is expected to make some important announcements about the promises the Congress proposes to make on various fronts. The promises may include scrapping of three farm laws (farmers have been agitating against the three farm laws since), free power, waiving loans of farmers and about the party’s stand on some other issues concerning the people,” said a senior Congress leader on condition of anonymity.Priyanka, who presided over a meeting with senior party leaders via video conferencing on Monday, also proposes to address public meetings at a number of other places that include Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gorakhpur, the Lok Sabha seat that chief minister Yogi Adityanath represented as an MP, and in the Bundelkhand region.“Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is scheduled to address mega public rally at Meerut. She will also address rallies in Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Mahoba and a number of other places. She may address a public rally in Varanasi on October 2 or 3. We will get details about her public rallies soon,” said another senior leader.Priyanka, who reviewed the Congress’s preparedness for the 2022 assembly election in Lucknow recently, had asked the state party leaders to launch Pratigya Yatras covering a distance of about 12,000 km to span nearly all the assembly seats across Uttar Pradesh. The party has worked out a detailed programme of the proposed yatras that would cover most parts of the districts during the Navratri celebrations the next month.“If the Congress wants to get some results this time, it should begin implementing certain welfare programmes using party funds. Making announcements at public rallies may not work,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.The Congress has been targeting the BJP governments in the state and the Centre over various issues that include inflation, unemployment, crime against women and issues concerning farmers. It has also raised issues like Rafale and Pegasus in the recent past.The Congress had contested the 2017 assembly election in alliance with the Samajwadi Party. As the alliance experiment failed to work for both the parties with the BJP sweeping the 2017 polls, the short-term alliance ended soon after the polls. The Congress won only seven seats in the 403-member state assembly, getting only 6.25 per cent votes in the 2017 assembly elections. Its vote share on the seats contested with the SP support was, however, 22.09 per cent in 2017 polls. The Samajwadi Party had won 47 seats while the BSP got 19 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-to-launch-major-campaign-in-up-1st-rally-in-meerut-on-sept-29-101632160627560.html
20-09-2021||Lucknow||2022 UP assembly polls: Oppn may be treading soft Hindutva path||There is a buzz about Prime Minister Narendra Modi arriving in Ayodhya for this year’s Deepotsav that the Yogi Adityanath government has been holding annually since coming to power in Uttar Pradesh in March 2017. Deepotsav is celebrated in the temple town the day before Diwali which falls on November 4 this year.While Modi’s yet to be confirmed Ayodhya visit is largely being viewed as the party’s attempt to play up the temple card ahead of the 2022 UP assembly election, politicians of other parties, too, are engaging in what is being referred to as “soft Hindutva.” In fact, as the Congress leaders indicated, the party could take out a “pratigya yatra” (pledge journey) from Ayodhya in October during the Navratri, a nine-day period which Hindus consider auspicious. “Nothing official yet but yes, something is in the works,” said a Congress party leader. Ahead of the 2017 UP polls that the Congress had contested with the Samajwadi Party, Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi had offered prayers at Ayodhya’s Hanumangarhi temple in September 2016. Back then, it was the first visit by a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family to Ayodhya since the demolition of the Babri mosque on December 6, 1992 when there was a Congress government at the Centre and a BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. Other Opposition parties too are engaged in this subtle Hindutva play, which political experts said could be guided by the thought of blunting BJP’s ploy of labelling the Opposition as one engaged in “tushtikaran” (appeasement) of the minorities, mainly Muslims. “On offer these days is a deft play of soft Hindutva by almost all the major political parties ahead of the UP election,” said professor Manuka Khanna from the political science department of Lucknow University (LU). Whether it was Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party, which decided to take out a tiranga yatra (tricolour journey) in Ayodhya or the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) that launched its prabuddha samaj (intellectual class) meetings from the temple town, soft Hindutva is trending ahead of the 2022 UP polls. UP assembly speaker Hriday Narain Dikshit, who won the 2017 UP polls as a BJP MLA from Unnao, said, “There are many political parties whose leaders are visiting temples now. However, the people well know their vote bank considerations behind this.” He was speaking at a meeting of the intellectual class in Unnao. In December 2020, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, too, had visited Ayodhya.“Bhagwan Ram belongs to us as much as anyone else,” he had said. Yadav has since visited a series of temples across the state, including the famous Bankey Bihari temple in Mathura. However, the BJP has continued to target Akhilesh, continuously using the appeasement charge.“We know what the BJP is up to. However, we aren’t going to fall for their trap. They are trying to show that they have a copyright on Lord Ram or Lord Krishna while labelling us as ones engaged in appeasement. But we are saying the Lord is for all, not for a select few. We are Hindus, too, but the BJP is cleverly engaging in selectivism for the sake of the same vote bank politics that it accuses us of,” a Samajwadi Party (SP) leader, requesting anonymity said. Even lawmakers across all parties in UP appear to be guided by “soft Hindutva”. Take for instance, the UP tourism department scheme launched for the promotion of heritage and tourism places in the state. “Majority of MLAs, across all parties, preferred to identify sites associated with the Hindu faith for development. In all, close to 370 proposals for as many sites were received,” an official of the state’s tourism department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/2022-up-assembly-polls-oppn-may-be-treading-soft-hindutva-path-101632160147470.html
20-09-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow: PGI faculty forum opposes government move on raising age of superannuation||The faculty forum of the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) has objected to raising the retirement age of faculty members of medical institutes/medical colleges to 70 years. The forum intends to call an urgent general body meeting (GBM) to chalk out a strategy to oppose the move.Professor Sandeep Sahu, president, SGPGIMS Faculty Forum, said, “Recently, the UP government had taken a decision to raise the retirement age to 70 years. The faculty forum of SGPGIMS strongly disagrees with this decision to increase the retirement age of faculty members. This decision will only hamper patient care, as older faculty members, due to the issue of increasing age, are not able to serve patients professionally. They lack the required energy levels and modern vision to improve the institute.”He said, “Old faculty members are reluctant to adopt new methods of teaching. Old faculty members if not retired at the appropriate time, will debar new faculty acquiring administrative skills so that second line will never be prepared to take care of hospitals.“Earlier, the retirement age was 60, which was increased to 62, then it was increased to 65 but now it is going to be 70 years. But every time doctors were never consulted before making a decision.”He added, “Doctors want their point to be heard before reaching any decision, because young doctors are going to be affected because of this decision.”Another senior doctor who was unhappy with the decision said, “Nowhere in the country are people forced to work till 70 years.”He added, “If doctors do not retire, then new posts will not be created, new medical students will not get a chance for faculty jobs. The PGI Faculty Forum will oppose the decision and will request the state government to reconsider the proposal for wider interest of the public and future of young doctors. Besides, the forum will also call for implementation of rotary headship of each department so that all faculty members get administrative experience.”However a senior official of the medical education department said, “The fears of doctors are unfounded. If the age of retirement is increased, it will not affect further recruitment of new doctors. Other apprehensions of doctors can be solved when we sit across the table.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-pgi-faculty-forum-opposes-government-move-on-raising-age-of-superannuation-101632159547543.html
20-09-2021||Other||Unease in SAD camp over Channi’s elevation||Chandigarh With the Congress appointing Charanjit Singh Channi as the first dalit chief minister of Punjab, a certain degree of uneasiness has crept into camp of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), even as the party has already firmed up a pre-poll alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for next year’s assembly polls. At stake is the vote of 32% dalit population of the state, with every political party wanting a major chunk of it. Political developments over the weekend, however, have forced the top SAD leadership into a state of unease and, mostly, studied silence, with its eyes on the Congress. Channi, in his maiden press itself on Monday, categorically stated that he will work for the welfare of his community. As things stand now, the Congress government leave no stones unturned to woo dalits, something all parties in the state want to do. Towards this aim, Akalis have has promised the berth of deputy CM for a dalit candidate from the quota of alliance partner, BSP. Channi is elevation, is thus a bit upsetting, for the Akalis. “Political developments taking place in the Congress party is an issue for our party. I think, however, that the juncture at which the shift of power has taken place (in Congress) it will not have a major impact on our prospects because it has come out as a delayed response to cover up failures of the Congress government under Capt Amarinder Singh,” said SAD MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala who comes from Nakodar assembly segment in Doaba. As part of its pre-poll alliance, SAD has allocated 20 assembly seats to the BSP. “We were hoping to mop up the major share of the dalit vote bank in the upcoming polls,” said a SAD leader on anonymity, adding that after Channi’s appointment as CM, things will be difficult for Akalis. BSP state president Jasvir Singh Garhi termed the development as a much-delayed response from the Congress, as a dalit CM has been appointed in Punjab, but 74 years after Independence. “BSP is a party formed for the welfare of dalits and the Akali Dal has always given respect and support to the downtrodden community,” he claimed. Another Akali MLA Pawan Tinu, who comes from dalit community accepted that the Congress move was purely aimed at electoral gains and had come on the right time for it. Tinu, of Adampur segment in Doaba, said, “Dalits, however, are intelligent and Channi could make the difference only when he sorts out issues pertaining to dalits, pending for four years now. Can he expedite pending scholarships for SC students and waive debt of farm labourers, who are also dalits? The new CM needs to perform up to earn support.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unease-in-sad-camp-over-channi-s-elevation-101632159127497.html

Meanwhile, Patil was still missing on Monday evening. “The spot where the incident occurred is not an immersion point, otherwise security personnel would have been there,” said an official. Officials said all men were residents of Kasam Nagar, a chawl off Veera Desai Road near Andheri RTO. “They probably did not know how to swim,” police officials said.Meanwhile, Prabhat Rahangdale, deputy municipal commissioner of BMC’s disaster management cell, said, “None of the five who drowned were on official duty for immersion of Ganesh idols.

20-09-2021||Mumbai||Congress picks ex-MP Rajni Patil for Rajya Sabha bypoll from Maharashtra||The All India Congress Committee has picked former MP and party’s in charge of Jammu and Kashmir Rajni Patil as party candidate for Rajya Sabha bypoll to be held on October 4. The bypoll was necessitated due to the demise of party’s sitting MP Rajiv Satav in May this year. Significantly, Patil was recommended for nomination to Maharashtra legislative Council as one among 12 persons appointed by the Governor. Patil, 62, who is currently party’s in-charge of Jammu and Kashmir, served as Rajya Sabha MP for five years till April 2018 on the seat fallen vacant after the demise of former Union minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. She was elected to Lok Sabha in 1996 from Beed as a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate. She is considered to be close to party president Sonia Gandhi and has been preferred over other aspirants including Mukul Wasnik, Milind Deora among others. The party has believably picked the Marathwada (central Maharashtra) leader for the seat represented by Satav, who too was from the region.The move, however, has raised eyebrows in the state unit of Congress as Patil’s name has also featured in the list of 12 members recommended by the state government for nomination to legislative Council from governor’s quota. “The names are under consideration by Raj Bhavan and if not replaced in time by taking other two ruling parties into confidence, the party may lose chance to appoint its four leaders to upper house. This may lead to further clashes, same as the differences over the election to the post of speaker, within the ruling alliance,” a state Congress leader said.Initially, Pradnya, wife of Rajiv Satav, too was in the race but the party has reportedly decided to field her in Lok Sabha or Assembly polls in 2024. “This has been discussed with the Satav family. The sympathy after the death of Rajiv, who was a dynamic party leader, may play in favour of his widow in the general polls,” said a Marathwada leader.Satav, who was 46, died due to the post-Covid complications in Pune in May.The bypoll will be held on October 4 if necessary, while the last day to file the nomination is September 22. The BJP has fielded its Mumbai unit general secretary Sanjeev Upadhyay. The contestant is elected by the members of Assembly, where the rulling Maharasthra Vikas Aghadi has majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-picks-ex-mp-rajni-patil-for-rajya-sabha-bypoll-from-maharashtra-101632158407384.html
20-09-2021||Mumbai||FYJC admission: Around 1.9 lakh vacant seats to be reallocated in special round||First-year junior college (FYJC) aspirants will get another chance to seek admission in colleges of their choice as the authorities will announce a special round on September 22. As per information shared by the office of the deputy director of education (DYDE), around 1.9 lakh seats of 3.2 lakh intake capacity across junior colleges remain vacant after three rounds of online seat allocation.“Once again interested students can refill the college preference list and a special merit round will be announced. We will decide the further course of action based on seat vacancy after the special round,” said an official from DYDE’s office.While the number of vacant seats is on the higher side, this is not the first time that the authorities are conducting special rounds to fill up unoccupied seats in FYJC. In 2018, DYDE conducted nine rounds of admissions, after which nearly 72,800 seats still remained vacant. Similarly, in 2019, seat vacancy stood at 1.3 lakh after three rounds of online admissions, forcing authorities to conduct a special “first come, first serve” round to fill up vacant seats.Since 2020, however, the number of vacant seats has been increasing. From 1.84 lakh seats vacant in junior colleges after first three rounds in 2020, the number stands at 1.9 lakh this year.A total of 117,883 FYJC aspirants were allotted seats in the first merit list on August 27, however nearly 50% of these students did not confirm admissions. Similarly, 60,037 students were allocated seats and only 21,116 (35.17%) of those confirmed admissions in the second round. In the third round, 39,964 seats where allotted of which less than 25% students confirmed admissions this year.“In the past two years, scores of students from neighbouring states and cities who would otherwise opt for Mumbai colleges have given the city a skip due to the pandemic. Since hostels are also still shut, many students from outside Mumbai have chosen to continue their education in their hometown since it’s a matter of two years only,” said TA Shiware, speaking for the management of Wilson College. He is also the chairman of Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fyjcadmission-around-1-9-lakh-vacant-seats-to-be-reallocated-in-special-round-101632158287443.html

The undertrial, Sanjay Yadav, escaped at around 12.45pm on Saturday.On the pretext of getting medicine, Yadav went to the hospital of the jail along with another inmate, identified as Sanio Pasco Keni, and managed to sneak near the watchtower. The watchtower, wherein the guards keep a watch from the top, has an iron-grilled door, which is locked so that it is not accessible for anyone.Yadav managed to climb the watch tower’s door, which was around seven feet tall. Yadav then managed to find grip on the exteriors of the tower. The grips were the rear part of the stairs which were inside the tower. The tower was adjacent to the 25-foot wall. From the exterior of the tower, he climbed onto the wall and then jumped down. While Yadav could jump off the wall, Keni got terrified and changed his mind. Keni was eventually caught by a guard.Taloja jail officials and Kharghar police searched for Yadav in the nearby bushes and other areas but he was not to be found anywhere. A team of police went to Bhandup as well to his residence but he could not be traced. A case against Yadav and Keni was registered with the Kharghar police under Section 224 (Resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the IPC.In July 2018, Yadav and his two accomplices hacked to death a 17-year-old minor boy near his college on the suspicion that the deceased boy was trying to get close to the girlfriend of one of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/undertrial-escapes-from-taloja-jail-by-jumping-off-25-foot-wall-101632158108615.html

Moreover, the residents also claimed that the college authority has also given them merely 15 days’ preparatory leave for the exams while the leave should actually be at least 45 days.A resident doctor who did not wish to be named said, “According to a circular issued by the College of Physician and Surgeons of Mumbai (CPS), who conducts these examinations, they have mentioned that students can render service after the training is completed if and only if they are willing to do so. Some of us have to apply for higher education or jobs in our respective cities, but with the new TMC guidelines we can’t do either.”He claimed that if the new students join in late, they will end up working for a long time.Another resident doctor added, “We have worked tirelessly in the pandemic due to which our original speciality work has been hampered. Still, we have worked very hard. We are meeting the TMC officials to discuss the issue today or tomorrow, requesting them to rethink the decision.”Bhimrao Jadhav, dean, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital, Kalwa, said that the decision taken is in the interest of the patients and also the students. “The decision to not relieve the resident doctors was taken after talking to all the concerned department heads in the hospital. Every year, after the NEET PG and other PG exams are held, many PG students join the hospital. However, since the examinations were delayed this year, there are no new PG students as of now. If we release these residents immediately, we will fall short of doctors at the hospital. Our aim is not to make them suffer any losses but at present we are in need of doctors at the hospital too.”He added that the residents can prepare for their examinations while managing their duties too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/forced-to-work-after-completion-of-tenure-claim-resident-doctors-pursuing-pg-courses-at-kalwa-hospital-101632157627261.html

Residents in these Majhail districts, also comprising Tarn Taran and Pathankot, claim that it is after five decades that their representatives have got key posts in the state cabinet. With Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Navjot Singh Sidhu also representing this region, a sense of expectancy is in the air. “The elevation of Randhawa and Soni as deputy CMs has made Majha residents feel pride,” said former ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria in a statement.Office-bearers of the Amritsar Vikas Manch, an NGO working for the betterment of Amritsar, said, “After Partap Singh Kairon, Àmritsar has been devoid of any political bigwig,who took interest in establishing big-ticket projects here. Now, Amritsar residents hope that both the deputy CMs, of Majha, will use their powers for the overall and holistic development of Majha region, and especially Amritsar. It is sad, but true that previous chief ministers have ignored this important area.”“During Parkash Singh Badal’s tenure, the prestigious All- India Institute of Health sciences (AIIMS) and the Central University allocated to Amritsar by the Centre, were relocated to Bathinda, the seat in Parliament represented by his daughter-in-law Harsimrat kaur Badal,” said Kulwant Singh Ankho, patron of the NGO. He added that even during the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev and the 400th birth anniversary of Guru Teg Bahadur, not a single penny was sanctioned for the establishment of any project in Amritsar. He added, “The Capt government sanctioned special incentives for the airlines operating from Mohali airport, harming the prospects of Sri Guru Ram Das Jee international airport Amritsar. Residents now expect the state government under Channi to issue a gazette notification to purchase land for the establishment of the Post Graduate Institute of Horticulture Research and Education.”Another local activist Manmohan Singh said, “We want the Amritsar medical college to be upgraded. International cricket stadium, hockey grounds with astro-turf and convention centre must come under the leadership of the two deputy CMs. Soni is also expected to improve law and order, along with making the Tung Dhab free of pollution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-both-deputy-cms-from-majha-locals-hope-for-devp-push-101632157507503.html

However, the rift between Sena and BJP has further increased after the remark.Mhaske also claimed that despite such calls, the action on illegal constructions in the city would not stop. The issue of illegal constructions rampant in the city has come to light since Majiwada-Manpada ward assistant municipal commissioner Kalpita Pimple was attacked during a demolition drive.Though Pimple was razing illegal hawkers, she had claimed that the attack was for revenge against an illegal construction she had questioned.BJP corporator, Krishna Patil, had raised the question of illegal constructions in the question answer session of the TMC house. He said, “We demand to know the correspondence with respect to illegal constructions by guardian minister, Eknath Shinde, and housing minister, Jitendra Awhad, and also what directives Shinde gave to demolish illegal constructions so far. We want a copy of all these letters along with the one giving directives to be presented before the house.”Mhaske, however, objected to the question claiming that they did not have to abide by such a request as both the ministers were not part of the house. He said, “We have received letters and directives from BJP too. So, why aren’t those demanded to be presented before the house? BJP is merely politicising the issue. I have, in fact, received a call from a minister in the central government to give protection to certain illegal constructions in the city, though I will not reveal the name of the minister.”BJP, however, claimed these were mere baseless accusations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/central-minister-called-to-give-protection-to-certain-illegal-constructions-claims-thane-mayor-naresh-mhaske-101632156848585.html
20-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra ATS arrests second terror suspect from Mumbra||The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) on Sunday arrested second terror suspect Rizwan Momin from Mumbra in connection with a suspected criminal conspiracy, purportedly hatched by Zakir Hussain Shaikh to commit terrorist acts.Zakir, a Jogeshwari resident who was arrested by the ATS on Saturday, was allegedly acting as per instructions of his foreign handler, Anthony aka Anwar aka Anas, the ATS said in a statement. The agency has, however, not revealed what the conspiracy was all about.Maharashtra ATS swung into action after the Delhi Police’s Special Cell on September 14 busted a terror module by arresting six persons, including Mumbai resident, Japan Mohammed Shaikh.On September 17, ATS registered an offence under section 17 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 against 52-year-old Zakir and Anthony aka Anwar aka Anas, and a lookout circular was issued for arresting Zakir, who came to be arrested the next day.During the course of interrogation, Zakir revealed that he was receiving instructions from his foreign handlers and that Momin too was involved in his nefarious activities. The ATS then arrested Momin and seized some incriminating material from his residence.ATS further claimed in the statement that Zakir had given his mobile handset to Momin and the 40-year-old Mumbra resident had broken Zakir’s mobile handset into three pieces and dumped it in a drain near his residence, with an intention to dispose it off. The ATS claimed to have recovered the broken pieces.The ATS on Monday produced both Zakir and Momin before a special court but did not seek their custody. The court then remanded both to judicial custody. On September 14, Delhi Police’s Special Cell and Uttar Pradesh Anti-terrorism Squad in a joint operation arrested six terror suspects allegedly backed by Pakistan.The six men were arrested from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and were identified as Jaan Mohammad Shaikh (47), Osama alias Sami (22), Moolchand Srivastav alias Saaju (47), Zeeshan Qamar (28), Mohamed Abu Bakr (23), and Mohammed Amir Javed (31). Police claimed to have seized 1.7kg RDX from Zeeshan’s house in Kareli, Allahabad, and a live improvised explosive device (IED) was found in Prayagraj and defused.The Delhi Police had said that the plot was to carry out terror strikes in Delhi, UP and Maharashtra during the festival season for which ISI had instructed Zeeshan and Osama to survey locations to plant IEDs.Police had also said that Anees Ibrahim, brother of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was connected to this module and was tasked to smuggle arms and ammunition into India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ats-arrests-second-terror-suspect-from-mumbra-101632156608232.html

Under the banner of Magahi Yuvak Morcha, Tripathi and others submitted a memorandum to the Palamu deputy commissioner, pressing for their demand. Last week, chief minister (CM) Hemant Soren stirred row in an interview with the Hindustan Times, saying that languages like Bhojpuri and Magahi have been kept out, as they are “borrowed languages” from Bihar. The CM’s statement has now become a major political issue in the state, with the opposition BJP cornering the ruling dispensation, in which Congress is a major player. Tripathi, also the national president of Indian National Trade Union Congress, has been vocal on the issue, targeting his own government. “The religious government tried to divide the state by making a different employment policy for 13 scheduled and 11 general districts. We had objected to that as well. The policy was later struck down by courts. Now, this government cannot differentiate among districts on the basis of religion. I will take this up with the government as well as with my party,” said Tripathi. The ruling Congress and RJD, whose considerable support in the state comes from belts where the two aforementioned regional languages are spoken, have been guarded in their response, as the BJP has been raising heat over the issue. Reacting to the development, Jharkhand Congress chief Rajesh Thakur said he has taken up the issue with the CM. “Our stand is clear that Bhojpuri, Magahi and Angika should be included in the regional language list. I raised the issue three days back with the CM when I met him. He has assured us that he is working on a solution for it,” said Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-language-controversy-ex-cong-minister-leads-demand-to-include-magahi-bhojpuri-in-competitive-exams-101632154147408.html

Speaking at the launch of the MDA round across 22 of Bihar’s 38 districts of Bihar on Monday, Pandey said the drive would be successful only through community participation. For this, he urged the HCWs, including accredited social health activists (ASHA) and auxiliary nursing midwives (ANM), to motivate at least one person from every household to become a volunteer to create awareness about it in the society when they visit from door-to-door for the administration of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole tablets during the MDA round. He also urged public representatives, including MP, MLA, MLC and panchayati raj institution representatives to join the mass movement and encourage people to take the tablets and also motivate others to take them. “Community participation is essential for the success of any programme. Let’s eliminate this disease together and realise the vision of a healthy, filaria-free Bihar,” said Pandey. The 22 districts where the campaign was launched includes Araria, Banka, Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Buxar, East Champaran, West Champaran, Gopalganj, Jehanabad, Jamui, Kaimur, Katihar, Khagaria, Madhepura, Munger, Muzaffarpur, Patna, Saharsa, Saran, Sitamarhi, Siwan and Supaul. The minister and other attendees at the launch also consumed the anti-filarial drugs while demonstrating the contactless bowl method (drugs administered through a bowl) which health workers would be using during the round. Filariasis is a disabling disease that is transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Usually acquired in childhood, filariasis damages the lymphatic system and if left untreated, causes abnormal enlargement of body parts such as hydrocele (abnormal swelling of the scrotum) and lymphedema (swelling in the limbs). A few people also develop chronic cough called tropical pulmonary eosinophilia and can have symptoms like the passing of milky white urine (chyluria). Patients suffering from lymphedema and hydrocele often experience difficulties in carrying out day-to-day activities in their lives. Furthermore, patients also face stigma and discrimination due to severe disability and disfiguration that is irreversible if not treated early. “The albendazole administered in the filariasis elimination programme, also treats worm disease in children, which directly helps in their physical and intellectual development,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar. Filariasis is preventable with the administration of anti-filarial drugs during annual MDA rounds. Around 7 crore target beneficiaries will be administered these drugs during this MDA round. The tablets are administered to the eligible population, excluding children below two years, pregnant women and seriously ill people, in affected areas to interrupt transmission of the disease. These drugs must be consumed in the presence of health workers, said Dr Navin Chandra Prasad, director-in-chief (disease control and public health) health services, Bihar. Additional director Dr Anjani Kumar proposed a vote of thanks. Representatives of partner organisations like WHO, CARE, PCI, CFAR, LEPRA, GHS were also present on the occasion..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/create-volunteers-to-encourage-mda-for-filaria-free-bihar-health-minister-101632154087133.html

It was recovered from the terrorists’ possession, while further probe in the matter was on.Railway Protection Force (RPF) commandant A K Lal on Sunday wrote in this regard to senior police officials concerned of Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Sitamarhi, Supaul, Purnia, East Champaran, West Champaran, Khagaria, Madhubani, Begusarai, Madhepura and Saharsa, requesting to keep a close vigil and beef up security in the backdrop of a threat. Following the alert, the Government Railway Police (GRP) and RPF personnel have been directed to maintain strict vigil on movement of strangers, unclaimed baggage and abandoned vehicles in trains, platforms and outer circulating areas in view of upcoming festivals too, officials said.“Dog and bomb squads have been asked to remain alert, and regular checking and monitoring is being carried out at railway stations. The GRP and the RPF are jointly patrolling entry points of all railway stations and railways culverts and bridges,” said a senior security officer of ECR.The ECR has already issued an advisory to check parcel luggage reaching any major stations from different places to avert any kind of parcel blast incident.

20-09-2021||Mumbai||Somaiya detained on way to Kolhapur, levels fresh graft claims against Mushrif||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former MP Kirit Somaiya was detained by the police on his way to Kolhapur, where he was heading to lodge a complaint against rural development department minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Hasan Mushrif. Police action against Somaiya as well as fresh allegations levelled by him against Mushrif led to high-voltage drama and a slugfest between ruling parties and the opposition BJP on Monday. Significantly, Shiv Sena tried to distance itself, saying that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was not aware of the police action, exposing a probable internal rift between the ruling parties. Meanwhile, Somaiya accused Mushrif of corruption amounting to ₹100 crore in a cooperative sugar factory in Kolhapur by holding majproty share in the factory through a company in which his son-in-law has “benami” ownership. Mushrif rubbished the allegations and said he was being targeted out of “political rivalry”.Somaiya had announced that he would be lodging a police complaint in Kolhapur against Mushrif for corruption. The local NCP unit threatened to stage protests against the BJP leader, following which the administration issued a prohibitory order to stop Somaiya from visiting Kolhapur. While he was on way to Kolhapur by train, he was detained by local police at Karad, which is about 74 km away from Kolhapur. Somaiya then held a press conference alleging that a cooperative sugar factory (Appasaheb Nalawade cooperative sugar factory) was handed over to Brics India Private Limited, a firm allegedly owned by Mushrif’s son-in-law Matin Hasin Mangoli, without following any bidding process in 2020. Somaiya alleged that Mangoli is “benami owner” of the Brics India Pvt Ltd, which had no previous experience of running any sugar factory. Somaiya said that 7,185 shares of the sugar factory are held by SU Corporation, a shell company, used by Mushrif to park the money, while 998 shares each are held by Mangoli and one Gulam Hussain. He said that 98% shares of the sugar factory held by Mushrif family.The BJP leader also announced to expose a third case against Mushrif in the next two days and said that he would submit all related documents to the enforcement directorate (ED) and income-tax department in Mumbai in the next two days. Somaiya alleged that the minister diverted his illegal money earned after becoming RDD minister in 2019 to the sugar factory. This is the second set of allegations by Somaiya against Mushrif. Earlier, he had accused the minister of laundering Rs127 crore. Somaiya also alleged that Brics has links with the shell companies that were linked to the transactions in Sarsenapati Santaji Ghorpade sugar factory, which was named by Somaiya in the previous case. Mushrif, a senior NCP leader from Kolhapur in western Maharashtra, rubbished the allegations. “The sugar factory in question had been taken over by Brics in 2012 till 2020 and now being run on the cooperative basis by more than 60,000 farmers as its shareholders. The Maharashtra State Central Cooperative Bank had refused to hand over the factory to any private entity. The sugar factory is debt free now. Neither my son-in-law nor I has anything to do with the factory or Brics. I have been helping the factory as a local MLA of the constituency,” he said.Mushrif said that he has welcomed Somaiya in Kolhapur and he was ready to provide him every details related to the firms in question. He said he was being targeted because he turned down BJP’s offer to join the party ahead of 2019 Assembly polls.Police action Somaiya accused the police of high-handedness. He said the action taken against him by the police in Mumbai was illegal and he was obstructed from traveling to Kolhapur. Mumbai police had allegedly detained Somaiya at his Mulund (Mumbai) residence on Sunday afternoon and tried to stop him at CST station from travelling in Mahalaxmi Express to Kolhapur. The BJP leader said that the police failed to produce the order for his detention and orally cited the prohibitory order issued by Kolhapur district collector. He said the police had no rights to stop him from travelling from Mumbai.Somaiya had headed for Kagal in Kolhapur to lodge a complaint against Mushrif for his alleged Rs127-crore corruption through transactions, amounting to money laundering. He was stopped at Karad on Monday morning on the basis of prohibitory order issued by Kolhapur collection. The order has said that since there could be threat to his life, he was prohibited from entering the district. “Thackeray government should clarify if my life was under threat from NCP workers or the goons of Mushrif or NCP workers are goons,” he said. Somaiya has announced to visit Alibag on September 27 to reveal more information related to multiple bungalows owned by Rashmi Thackeray, wife of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He has also announced to reveal more irregularities in Jarandeshwar sugar factory, which is under control of relatives of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, on September 30. Sena distances itself from police action Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday said that BJP leader Kirit Somaiya was disallowed to enter Kolhapur district due to fear of law-and-order situation. Raut, the chief spokesperson of the party, distanced chief minister Uddhav Thackeray from the action against BJP leader, saying it was taken by the home department.“The action against the one who is making allegations happened by the home department. Nobody should call it vindictive as the home department felt that there could be a law and order situation on both sides. Therefore, there is no need to level allegations at the chief minister personally. Chief minister doesn’t involve himself in such small matters,” Raut said.He further added. “...if you are using central agencies at the behest of central government and making allegations against prominent leaders and ministers in Maharashtra, which could result in a law and order issue, the state home department can act on it. I spoke to chief minister and he has said that the chief minister office is not involved in the action [against BJP leader] and it was done by the home department.”The Sena leader also said that the MVA government will not “bow down” and is not “cowardly” to cower down against the action by central agencies. Raut targeted the Centre, saying the central agencies are used to “destabilise and defame” Maharashtra. “Whatever has been done by the Opposition since yesterday has happened with the backing and support of the Centre and this is an attempt to destabilise and defame Maharashtra. Over the past some days, it has become the opposition’s party programme to level allegations and create a doubt in the minds of people,” he added.Raut added that there will be “no cracks” in the government due to the “false allegations” by the Opposition. “If they think that there can be a political shift in the state by pressuring leaders, by threatening them of arrest, seizing their properties, harassing their family members, then they are disillusioned. We will face the situation. This government is not cowardly. This fight under the leadership of chief minister and Sharad Pawar will continue. No matter how many allegations are levelled, we will not bow down,” the Sena leader said.“The courts will decide whether the allegations are true or false. The attempt to destabilise our government will not succeed. Let them make allegations, our government is strong,” he further added.Somaiya, in his press conference in Pune on Monday, said that he would visit Alibaug to see a property allegedly bought Rashmi Thackeray, CM’s wife. “He (Somaiya) can go on the Moon and Mars and look for properties of our people. There is freedom in this country and state,” he said.Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said on Monday that instead of issuing political statements Mushrif should face the probe to prove himself innocent. “We never had given him any offer to join the BJP. He should face the probe if he thinks he is innocent…. It is not true that we are exposing only Sena or NCP ministers, we are going to expose two Congress ministers in next few days,” he said in Pune.Somaiya after returning to his Mulund residence on Monday evening said that he will expose all 40 ministers in the Thackeray government by December 31.Somaiya said that he was detained by police at his Mulund residence for more than five hours. “More than 100 policemen were there outside my house. I was not allowed to attend the Ganpati immersion at Chowpatty. I was allowed to venture out only after my lawyer lodged a complaint in Mulund police station. I was manhandled by the police at CST railway station,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/somaiya-detained-on-way-to-kolhapur-levels-fresh-graft-claims-against-mushrif-101632153370117.html

20-09-2021||Patna||Centralised portal to regulate pvt affiliated colleges in Bihar||All affiliated colleges and those seeking fresh affiliation would now required to apply through a portal of the department of education, government of Bihar, to be launched Tuesday by education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, officials said. The objective is to regulate the mushrooming growth of substandard affiliated colleges, usher in greater transparency in the way they function and better service conditions to teachers and staff working there and ensure accountability.Bihar government had last month tightened the parameters for of giving performance grant to the aided intermediate colleges and degree colleges by making presentation of audited accounts a prerequisite. It will have direct impact on 602 intermediate colleges and 225 affiliated degree colleges, which were awaiting funding, including backlog for years.Earlier, the colleges got affiliation directly from the universities and this led to complaints of serious irregularities made to the Governor, who is the chancellor of state universities, as well as the state government. The Raj Bhawan had also constituted committees of vice chancellors to regulate these colleges in the past, but many members resigned, alleging pressure from the affiliated colleges.Now, the affiliated colleges have to apply online and after that, there is timeline for different procedures to be completed, including inspection of the institutions and submission of report. In case of deficiencies, notice would be served to the institutions for their removal within a time frame. The final decision will rest with the state government.“When the government gives grants to affiliated colleges, it will like accountability and transparency to be maintained. At present, the same land deed is shown for two-three institutions, there is no principal trustee who would be accountable in case of many institutions and there are issues with the way government grant meant for salary to teachers and staff is disbursed. The government is accountable for every penny it spends. Why not colleges?” said a senior department official.This is not the first time the government has tried to regulate the mushrooming affiliated colleges. It had abolished unaided education policy on March 26, 2008, and decided to make payments to institutions on the basis of their performance, directly linked to pass percentage of actual number of students, in the hope that things would improve, but it did not. Instead, a new concept of non-attending colleges gained currency, where students were not required to attend classes and could directly take exams.“The effort is to help the genuine colleges and the teachers and staff working there so that the students could benefit. For sham institutions, it will be difficult,” said minister Choudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/centralised-portal-to-regulate-pvt-affiliated-colleges-in-bihar-101632152528255.html

20-09-2021||Kolkata||‘Didi will decide’: Babul Supriyo on his new role after meeting Mamata Banerjee||Former Union minister of state Babul Supriyo met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee at Nabanna, the state secretariat, on Monday, and said after the talks that he is thankful to her and her nephew and Trinamool Congress (TMC) national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee for welcoming him to their party. He referred to the CM as Didi (elder sister). “Didi will decide what role I will play in the TMC. I profusely thank Didi and Abhishek for welcoming me with such warmth. She asked me to work sincerely and sing with all my heart. That was the icing on the cake. She asked me to sing during the coming Durga Puja festival. We talked about music for a long time. She shared some anecdotes on music and gave me a book as a gift for my father,” said the former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader who joined the TMC on September 18. The two-time Lok Sabha member from Asansol in Bengal’s West Burdwan district announced on Sunday that he would go to Delhi on Wednesday and resign from the Parliament. “My ‘Z’ category security has already been withdrawn. I am moving without central paramilitary force personnel since August,” Supriyo said while leaving Nabanna on Monday. On a lighter note, the Bollywood singer-turned-politician said the chief minister advised him not to have commercially made puffed rice, a popular snack in Bengal, as these are laced with urea. “Didi said urea makes one gain weight. Like her, I also eat only traditionally made puffed rice and keep a can in my car,” said Supriyo.It may be recalled that in May 2015, when he was a Union minister, Supriyo made news by accepting Mamata Banerjee’s invitation to have jhal-muri, a spicy puffed rice snack, from a roadside vendor near the Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata. The CM had offered him a lift in her car as both were heading for the governor house to attend an official dinner. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in the Bengal capital on that day to inaugurate a Swachh Bharat mission project.Hours after Supriyo met the Bengal CM on Monday afternoon, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “The effect of the puffed rice he had with the chief minister six years ago can be seen now. Let him work well in the party he has chosen.”Although the Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya on Sunday described his party’s tryst with Supriyo as “a closed chapter,” BJP leaders did not stop targeting the Asansol MP. Ghosh called Supriyo a political tourist on Sunday and alleged that he left because he was not made a minister during the July reshuffle of the Union cabinet. Jagannath Sarkar, the MP from Ranaghat, on the other hand, alleged that Supriyo joined TMC to evade probe because he is involved in the coal and cattle smuggling case that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) are investigating.Hours before the cabinet reshuffle, Supriyo was removed from the government where he served as minister of state for environment, forest and climate change. He wrote an emotional post on social media saying he was “asked to resign.” This led to strong differences between Supriyo and Ghosh and it surfaced in comments the two made after Supriyo declared that he would quit politics and the Lok Sabha. “I’m leaving...Alvida (farewell)...If you want to do social work, you can do it without being in politics...” Supriyo wrote on Facebook on July 31.However, on August 2, he changed his decision and decided to stay in Parliament. “I have a constitutional responsibility,” Supriyo said after meeting BJP national president JP Nadda in Delhi. Supriyo did not elaborate on the talks he had with Nadda but said he remained firm on his decision to quit politics. “It is my personal decision and I am not going to change it. I may move either to Kolkata or Mumbai. I will not engage in any political activity. People of Asansol have asked me to stay as their MP,” he said. He also said that he would give up his security cover, the bungalow in Delhi and other facilities he is entitled to as a Lok Sabha member. “You may soon see me earning my living through other means, singing for example,” Supriyo told the media last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/didi-will-decide-babul-supriyo-on-his-new-role-after-meeting-mamata-banerjee-101632149287941.html

On September 14 last year, the 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang-raped by four people in Hathras district when she had gone to the fields to collect cattle fodder. She was partially paralysed in the attack. As her condition deteriorated, she was moved to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on September 28 and died in the early hours of September 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hathras-gangrape-murder-case-family-wants-trial-to-be-fast-tracked-says-victim-s-lawyer-101632146408359.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||At Delhi's Ganga Ram Hospital, doctors save mucormycosis patient's life by removing kidney, portion of lung||Officials at Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital informed on Monday that, in a recent operation, a team of multidisciplinary doctors saved the life of a 34-year-old patient by performing a surgery to remove a kidney, as well as a portion of his left lung, both of which, they said, were infected with mucormycosis, a complication found in several patients who recovered from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Also Read | Mucormycosis cases declining? Here's what senior doctor at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has to sayThree doctors performed the operation in this case which, hospital authorities claimed, was being reported in medical literature as the “first case in the world happening after Covid-19 infection” which involved a kidney, lung and sinus.“The patient, who is from Ghaziabad, was brought here with breathing difficulties, blood in sputum and high-grade fever. After checking, it was found that the mucor, besides penetrating the patient’s nasal cavity, had also spread to his right kidney and the left lung,” the premier hospital noted in a statement, which further said that the kidney, and a portion of the lung, were both severely damaged. “As a result, we feared further spread. Hence an emergency removal of the infected areas was planned,” it added.Describing the surgery as a complicated procedure which went on for six hours, the statement noted that the patient was successfully operated upon and has since been discharged. It identified Dr Sabyasachi Bal as the one who removed the portion of the left lung, while Dr Manu Gupta worked on the right kidney. Dr Varun Rai, meanwhile, performed the sinus surgery, it said.Commonly known as black fungus, mucormycosis is more commonly found among people with lowered immunity due to issues such as Covid-19, diabetes, kidney disease, liver or cardiac related disorders or due to age-related problems.The risk of contracting black fungus is particularly high for patients who are immune-compromised, especially those being treated for Covid-19 with steroids.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-delhi-s-ganga-ram-hospital-doctors-save-mucormycosis-patient-s-life-by-removing-kidney-portion-of-lung-101632144464114.html

Once it is complete, we will prepare the plan for public hearing, which will mostly be held in October,” said a senior DDA official, aware of the matter.DDA officials said that arrangements will be made for the public to participate in the online hearing.“We held public consultations online last year when the master plan was being prepared to get people’s perspective. This year, we held an online consultation after the MPD-2041 was put in the public domain to clarify people’s doubts related to the new plan,” said the official.The land-owning agency plans to notify MPD-2041, the vision document for the city’s development in the next two decades, by December end. The process has already been delayed due to the pandemic, as the land-owning agency had to extend the last date of submission of suggestions/objections by a month following demand from the public. While it received over 12,000 comments on its portal, officials said a large number of people submitted their comments manually.Explaining the process, a senior official said based on the inputs received during the public hearing, MPD-2041 will be tabled again in the authority meeting and, once approved, it will be sent to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for notification.The MPD-2041 focuses on regeneration of old areas (unauthorised colonies, urbanised villages), allowing mixed-use development, providing affordable rental housing and small format housing, promoting walkability and non-motorised transport, development of green-blue (green spaces and waterfronts) infrastructure and corridors etc for sustainable development of the city.The land-owning agency has also introduced new concepts and proposals to make Delhi a 24x7 city by promoting night time economy and nightlife; increasing economic activities; and ensuring planned development of urban extensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-to-hold-public-hearing-on-master-plan-of-delhi-2041-in-october-gets-33-000-comments-101632145266700.html

Sanjay Yadav, an undertrial, managed to flee on Saturday in broad daylight at around 11.30 am, officials said. In the pretext of getting some medicine, the undertrial went to the hospital of the jail along with another inmate identified as Rahul Jaiswal and managed to sneak near the watchtower of the jail. The watchtower, where the guards keep a watch from the top, has an iron grilled door that is locked so that it is not accessible for anyone.Yadav managed to climb the door of the watchtower which was around seven feet tall. He then managed to find the grip on the exteriors of the watchtower. The grips were the rear part of the stairs that were inside the watchtower. The watchtower was adjacent to the 25 feet tall wall. From the exterior of the watchtower, he managed to climb onto the wall and then jumped down. While Yadav could jump off the wall, Jaiswal got terrified and changed his mind and was later caught by the guard, people cited above informed.Taloja jail officials, along with Kharghar police, looked for Yadav in the nearby bushes and other areas, but he was nowhere to be found. A team of police went to Bhandup as well to his residence but could not be traced. A case against Yadav and Jaiswal was registered with Kharghar police under section 224 (Resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the India Penal Code. In July 2018, Yadav, along with his two accomplices, hacked to death a 17-year-old minor boy near his college thinking that the victim was trying to get close to one of the accuseds’ girlfriend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/28yearold-undertrial-escapes-taloja-jail-by-climbing-25-feet-high-wall-101632144727524.html
20-09-2021||Lucknow||Mayawati: Punjab chief minister’s appointment a Congress stunt before polls||Terming the appointment of Charanjit Singh Channi as Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister a political gimmick of the Congress before the assembly polls, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati asked the Dalits in Punjab to remain wary of “the dual face, character and tricks of the Congress”.Addressing a press conference in Lucknow within a few minutes after Channi took oath on Monday, Mayawati said, “The Congress has made it clear that it will not contest the assembly election under the leadership of Channi. It clearly shows that the Congress has no faith in the Dalit community.”“The Congress party is not concerned with the welfare of the Dalit community. It has made a Dalit chief minister to grab the votes of the community in the upcoming assembly election. The Dalits should not be allured by the gimmicks of the Congress,” she said.“The removal of the chief minister a few months before assembly election and the appointment of a Dalit community leader as new CM clearly shows that there is panic in the Congress camp over Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)- BSP alliance for the 2022 assembly election in Punjab,” she said. “The Congress and other rival political remember Dalit community either under compulsion or when these parties are facing trouble in elections,” she added.“It can be gauged from the fact that the Congress appointed Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar the chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee as it did not have another leader who could match the capability or intellect of Ambedkar. Had there been a leader more capable than Ambedkar, Congress would not have made Ambedkar chairman of the drafting committee,” Mayawati said.“The Dalits, backwards and religious minorities would have been denied the rights they enjoy under the Constitution. The rights of the Muslim community have been also safe guarded by the Constitution. The people should know that Ambedkar followed the principles of secularism while drafting the Constitution,” she said.The Dalit community should know that in Uttar Pradesh too when few months are left for the assembly election, the Bharatiya Janta Party is also showing love for Dalit and other backwards castes.Terming the affinity of the saffron brigade for Dalits a mere show off and hollow Mayawati said, “Had the BJP been really concerned about the uplift of the Dalit community, it would have filled the backlog in government posts reserved for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The posts reserved for these communities are still lying vacant.”“The BJP would also have considered the demand for the caste census raised by the backward community. The fact is that the BJP and other casteist political parties are panicky over the caste census. Earlier, the BJP had opposed the implementation of the Mandal Commission report. It had also launched a violent agitation across the country,” BSP chief added.“Now Dalit and other backward communities have realised the dual policy pursued by the BJP to get their votes. The BJP leaders should realise that ‘kaath ki haandi baar baar chaadney wali nahi hain’. I have full faith that Dalit and backward communities would not be allured by the BJP, the Congress or other political parties that use them as a vote bank. They should know that whatever rights they are enjoying today were given to them due to the initiative taken by Ambedkar,” she said.“Under the pre-poll alliance, the BSP will field candidates on 20 out of 117 assembly seats in Punjab while the SAD will field candidates on the remaining 97 seats,” said a BSP leader. The alliance is hopeful of support of 32% Dalit community (in Punjab) in the assembly election,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-punjab-chief-minister-s-appointment-a-congress-stunt-before-polls-101632144608188.html
20-09-2021||Lucknow||84-yr-old retired official to pursue LLB from Kanpur university||KANPUR In 1998, Sitaram Srivastava lost his wife to medical negligence at a government health facility in Lucknow. He was crestfallen and pledged to start a legal fight for justice. Without hiring any lawyer, he pled the case from the Consumer Forum to the Supreme Court — and his arguments won him everywhere. In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court’s order to penalise the hospital and compensate Srivastava. At that time, he decided to pursue a degree in law and become a lawyer. “I wanted to help people victimised by corruption, in the court of law,” said Srivastava. At 82, he attempted to enroll in the LLB course, but as per rules, he was overage. Two years later, the New Education Policy opened up the window for him to chase his dream at the age of 84. The CSJM University, Kanpur, accepted his application. Soon, he would be in the LLB class at Dayanand College of Law at Civil Lines, Kanpur. “Sitaram Srivastava had vice-chancellor Dr Vinay Pathak last week with his application stating that university computers were not processing applications of people born in 1960 or before that. But the V-C has given him special permission to pursue the course” said Dr Vivek Sachan, university spokesman. “We are updating our systems to help the elderly people still interested in pursuing different courses as the New Education Policy puts no age bar,” he said. Srivastava was born in 1937 (in Kanpur) and completed his graduation from Christ Church College. He retired from Provident Fund organisation as enforcement officer in 1995. His wife took ill in 1997-end and a hospital in Kanpur “misdiagnosed the problem and continued with the treatment.” This line of treatment was followed at the hospital in Lucknow, said Srivastava. “I contested the case tirelessly. The District Consumer Forum ruled in my favour and levied damages on the hospitals – both in Kanpur and Lucknow. The verdict was upheld in the state and national commissions. I went to the Supreme Court and filed a special leave petition expressing dissatisfaction over the compensation amount,” he said, adding the Supreme Court ruled in his favour in the first hearing. The success after tireless efforts made him to pursue LLB course. “I am excited that I am finally registered for it and waiting for admission forms,” said the senior citizen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/84yrold-retired-official-to-pursue-llb-from-kanpur-university-101632144126773.html

If they have any proof, they should arrest those who are sponsoring it,” ANI quoted Gundu Rao as saying, in response to Bommai’s remarks. Further, he also went on to call the Karnataka chief minister “clueless”.“We asked him about inflation, LPG price, fuel price but he replied what is not asked. The CM is clueless,” he added.Notably, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, during his visit to state capital Bengaluru earlier in the year, had called for farmers to protest in the city similar to how it was being done in Delhi against Centre’s three farm laws. “Unless the three laws are repealed, and there is a law related to the MSP, you need to continue this agitation in Karnataka as well,” he had said.The fresh spat between the two parties in the state came even as the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) had earlier in the day organised protests against the rising fuel prices. Several state Congress leaders including KPCC president DK Shivakumar, leader of opposition in Karnataka legislative council SR Patil, former state minister Priyank Kharge and former CM Siddaramaiah were all part of the protests.The leaders rode their bicycles from the KPCC office in Bengaluru to the Vidhana Soudha (Karnataka Legislature), condemning the “continuous fuel price hike” by the Centre. Several other state Congress leaders were also present during the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-cm-bommai-calls-farmers-protest-sponsored-congress-hits-back-saying-comments-insult-to-farmers-101632142704293.html

Dry fruits, jewellery, clothes and carpets from Afghanistan are a big hit among Indian consumers but traders from the country, some who have been bringing these items to India for the last 20 years, say that the recent developments have made exports and imports difficult.Amir Hamza, a trader from Afghanistan who had set up a stall at the Shimla International Trade Expo-2021 organised by the PhD Chamber of Commerce and Collaboration, said, “There is a lot of uncertainty in our country since the new regime took over. The situation seems to be improving slowly but this time we were not able to bring jewellery, dresses or carpets to India due to Visa restrictions. We have also not been able to transport fresh bananas to our country from India.”“We hope that the bilateral relations between Afghanistan and India remain good so that our trade isn’t hit,” he said. Bias Ibrahim, another trader from Afghanistan, said, “At least 60% of our business is dependent on trade with India. Nearly five tonnes of dry fruit is expected to arrive through the Wagah border in a day or two. But the situation back home is far from normal. There is barely any law and order, and government is also temporary. We hope they (Taliban) shun their conservative ideas. If they do so, people will be able to accept their government.” Anurag Singh Rana, one of the organisers of the trade fair, said, “We had 88 stalls in all, of which one was of dry fruits from Afghanistan. Had the situation been better, we would have had 17 to 18 more stalls, including those of spices and clothes, from the country.”The five-day fair, which was inaugurated by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on September 16, culminated on Monday. The idea, organisers say, was to cater to those consumers who have been unable to travel to other countries due to the Covid-19 situation for the last two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exportimport-hit-after-taliban-takeover-say-afghan-traders-in-india-101632142688114.html
20-09-2021||Dehradun||How Himalayan Heritage Walk spurred restoration project of George Everest’s house in Mussoorie||It took a heritage walk for close to four years, including that of senior Indian Administrative Service officers, to renovate and restore the heritage bungalow of Sir George Everest, the former surveyor-general of India, who who initiated the survey for measuring the height of Mount Everest, the peak named after him. After the restoration is completed by December 2021, part of the Everest House would be converted into a Cartographic Museum, Uttarakhand government officials said. George Everest House and laboratory, where he lived for eleven years, is located at Park Estate near Hathipaon, about 6 kilometres from Gandhi Chowk in Mussoorie. He bought the Park Estate, where this house was already built in 1833, and lived there for almost a decade before retiring and returning to England in 1843. But, years of neglect resulted in many parts of the building losing their traditional charm with some portions crumbling. Getting the attention of policymakers towards the heritage bungalow in Mussoorie was not easy. So, anthropologist Lokesh Ohri, who is also the convenor of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), Uttarakhand chapter, decide to organise a heritage walk through their group called “Been There Doon That”.The walk used to be conducted on July 4 on Sir George Everest’s birthday. “Over two years ago, we conducted a walk through Landour for the reunion of the 1986 batch of IAS officers. After the walk, a very senior IAS officer asked me if they can do something for Mussoorie. We suggested that a group be formed that would focus on the conservation of Sir Everest’s house,” Ohri recalled. The group was formed and after some time, the then additional secretary, tourism, Neeraj Jyoti Khairwal asked Ohri to send a proposal for conservation of the bungalow. As Ohri had a plan ready, he immediately sent the proposal to Khairwal. “And this is how the restoration project for Sir Everest’s home came to the forefront,” Ohri said. On how the restoration work is being carried out, Yugal Kishore Pany, deputy director Uttarakhand Tourism Development Corporation said the restoration project was taken up under Asian Development Bank funding. “The project is focussing not only on the restoration of the House but also improving the whole area and making it attractive for tourists. Over one-kilometre-long pathway to the house has been given a heritage look by using cobbled stones,” he said. Pant said they are very careful in renovation and restoration as they wanted it to gel with construction materials used originally. “There is one observatory in the bungalow where George Everest used to make triangulation measurement of the Himalayan peaks. We are developing some glass-domed huts there on the premises where tourists can clearly see the night sky,” he said. Pant said a cartographic museum is also being developed where cartographic equipment and information about such scientific instruments and procedures would be put on display. “We have also sought the help of experts from Survey of India based in Dehradun. The whole restoration project would be completed by December,” he said. Ohri said he was satisfied with the restoration work and was happy that a cartography museum is also being built under the ₹24 crore restoration project. He added that the heritage building has immense historical and scientific value. According to the Survey of India, Sir George Everest (July 4, 1790 –December 1, 1866) was a British surveyor and geographer who served as the Surveyor General of India from 1830 to 1843. For his contributions, Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth which was earlier called Peak XV, was named in his honour. He worked on Great Trigonometric Survey and was largely responsible for surveying the meridian arc from the southernmost point of India north to Nepal, a distance of about 2,400 kilometres from 1806 to 1841.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/how-himalayan-heritage-walk-spurred-restoration-project-of-george-everest-s-house-in-mussoorie-101632142209211.html

Water reserves near-full capacity means there will be sufficient quantities to meet the city’s water supply requirements throughout the year and residents are unlikely to face any water-cuts.Mumbai city receives its drinking water supply from Upper Vaitarna, Modak Sagar, Tansa, Middle Vaitarna, Bhatsa, Vehar, and Tulsi lakes, whose total water capacity is 1,447,363 Million Litres (M Litres). They are located in Mumbai, and the neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) supplies 3,850 M Litres of water to Mumbai per day.The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems- the Vaitarna system supplies water to the western suburbs and the Island city, and the Bhatsa system that provides water to the eastern suburbs.Tulsi, Vehar, Tansa, and Modak Sagar have already overflown once this monsoon, in July. On September 13, BMC began to release water from Upper Vaitarna also, which currently has 99.3% water, as per BMC data. Water-level in Tulsi and Vehar lakes is at 100%, while it is at 99.14% for Tansa and 99.9% for Modak Sagar.Bhatsa dam in Thane district has 99.5% useful water content. Of its total capacity of 717,037 M Litre, 575,700 M Litre are allotted to Mumbai for use, and comprise over 40% of the annual water requirement of the city.

20-09-2021||Chandigarh||Develop a work culture that appreciates dignity of labour||Anaiyssa, my granddaughter, was three years old then. She was travelling from Seattle to New Delhi with Sawan and Tanu, my son and daughter-in-law. Carrying her haversack on the back, her doll in one hand, and her passport in the other, on seeing me she ran and landed in my arms, saying, “I did the immigration all by myself, Dadu!” She was proud of her achievement and the confidence was palpable. In the West, people build a work culture around for everyone to follow without feeling anything inferior or superior about the job at hand. Even the president of a country would take pride in sharing that he worked in a restaurant to earn his living as a boy or a girl. In our system, if someone goes to drop a child to school, often the bag is carried by the person himself and not the child. In the US and the UK, schoolchildren carry their stuff themselves. We have a different mindset. In fact, it’s feudal and caste and class based. One who comes from a so-called higher class, or a creamy layer, is not supposed to do certain tasks of cleaning, assigned since centuries to a particular caste of people. Mahatma Gandhi did break this age-old practice. I was surprised to see my host in London cleaning the commode himself. Otherwise, who would do it? Nobody does it for others, without charging a hefty sum. The good thing is that the job is not looked at being lowly. Dog lovers, when they walk their dogs, carry polythene bags to pick up the poop and dispose it in the bins kept for the purpose. As an Indian Police Service officer, I’ve always lived in bungalows with security personnel in tow. Having been transferred on deputation to the Government of India and staying in a two-room accommodation with a bathroom at Pragati Vihar Hostel in Delhi, I once mopped the floor of the bathroom with a wiper. My son, Sagar, ran to help me, making it obvious that I wasn’t given to doing my own work myself. I know I should have been wiser. We had a get-together at Sawan’s home in Seattle when some neighbours were also invited. I was introduced to our immediate neighbour, who was a multi-millionaire having retired after selling his company worth $800 million. The next day, I was surprised to see him going up his roof through a ladder and clearing it of leaves. He later fixed a window, carrying the handyman’s tools. We would depend on others to carry out such tasks. The point to underscore is a need to develop such a work culture and appreciate dignity of labour. During the Covid-19 lockdown, I saw neighbours carrying out household jobs themselves, be it pruning plants, mopping the floor, brooming the driveway, buying vegetables from vendors, attending to courier boys, passing on the garbage fills to the collector outside, etc. I’m sure, like me they help one another inside the house, too. Trust me, it’s fun to be doing one’s own jobs. I had always been driven by chauffeurs and surrounded by security men, but since the lockdown, when I started driving myself, I’m a man confident more than ever. rajbirdeswal@hotmail.com The author is a retired IPS officer and an advocate||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/develop-a-work-culture-that-appreciates-dignity-of-labour-101632141486651.html

His certificate shows so||The coronavirus vaccination certificate of a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut shows that he has received five doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, and is scheduled for his sixth jab between December 2021 and 2022. According to officials, however, this is a case of “mischief” and “conspiracy.”The “victim” in question is 73-years-old Rampal Singh from Sardhana area in the district. Singh, who is the president of booth number 79 of the ruling BJP, as well as a member of the Hindu Yuva Vahini, said he received his first jab on March 16 and the second one on May 8, thus completing his full vaccination course for the viral illness.However, upon downloading the certificate, Singh said he found that the document showed that he has received not two, but five doses, with a sixth scheduled as well. “The certificate showed that I was jabbed on March 16, May 8, May 15 and twice on September 15,” he added.Addressing the issue, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Akhilesh Mohan said district immunisation officer Praveen Kumar has been directed to probe the negligence. “This may be the first case of a person being registered more than twice for their inoculation. It is likely that some mischievous elements hacked into the online portal and did this,” Mohan remarked.Though the nationwide vaccination drive commenced on January 16 this year, beneficiaries aged 60 and above became eligible for it from March 1. Thus far, under the exercise, at least 808,568,144 doses have been administered, of which 3,778,296 were given in the last 24 hours, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare’s (MoHFW) dashboard.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-leader-in-up-got-5-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-certificate-shows-so-101632139993309.html

On August 28, emerging after a long meeting with the Congress high command on suggestions that he should move aside because of a reported two and a half year power-sharing agreement with colleague TS Singh Deo, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel seemed to have bought some time. He said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi would visit the state the next week, especially Bastar, to review the work that was being done. The next day, when Singh Deo returned, he said that he had spoken to the leadership too and they had kept a “decision safe”. In December 2018, in the aftermath of a dominant Congress performance where the party won 68 of 90 seats, even as the party’s Delhi leadership sought to put out leadership fires in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh emerged as a problem too. Four state leaders, Baghel, home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, speaker Charan Das Mahant and Singh Deo flew to Delhi, all eyeing the chief minister’s post. As Mahant settled for speaker’s post, friction between Baghel and Singh Deo meant that Sahu first emerged as the frontrunner, but pushed by the idea that a third leader would take the top position, Baghel and Singh Deo, along with Punia and Gandhi, reportedly arrived at a power-sharing arrangement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhattisgarh-health-minister-ts-singh-deo-on-another-personal-visit-to-delhi-101632139386934.html

He also sought an appropriate injunction against Reddy from making such defamatory statements and to take down all such false statements/accusations.“Today, I have invoked the legal process & filed a suit for defamation and injunction before the Hon’ble court. I am confident that the court process will clinchingly vindicate the falsity of the canards & lies spread against me and the culprits will be brought to book appropriately,” the minister posted on Twitter.Also Read | Time to liberate people of Telangana from TRS, says Amit ShahIn the petition, the minister said the PCC chief made various “baseless, scurrilous, and manifestly false statements and allegations” against him seeking to falsely link him with the investigation being conducted by the Enforcement Directorate against allegations of drug and psychotropic substances abuse by certain accused persons.He also sought adequate compensation for such serious and malicious acts of defamation and that further criminal proceedings be initiated.KTR’s petition was in response to the PCC president’s comment at a public meeting held in Gajwel on Friday that “the father (chief minister KCR) has become a brand ambassador for drunkards, while the son (KTR) is a brand ambassador for cinema stars, who are using drugs.”Reddy was referring to the ED questioning a host of Telugu film stars as part of investigation into their alleged link with drug peddlers. A special investigation team of the state excise and prohibition department busted the case in 2007 and questioned a few film personalities but has not yet filed a charge sheet.Continuing the tirade, Reddy on Sunday announced the launch of a social media campaign, #WhiteChallenge, to create awareness on increasing drug menace. He tagged KTR and former Congress MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy with his tweet.Stating that he was ready to take the first test for drugs and would give his blood and hair samples for the tests, the PCC chief asked KTR to come to Telangana Martyrs’ memorial in front of the state assembly on Monday afternoon to accept the challenge.While Vishweshwar Reddy arrived at the Gunpark, KTR did not turn up but tweeted that he was ready for the challenge. “I am ready for any test & will travel to AIIMS Delhi if Rahul Gandhi is willing to join. It’s below my dignity to do it with Cherlapally jail alumni (sic),” KTR tweeted, with an obvious reference to the PCC chief’s stint in the jail in the cash-for-vote case.KTR also sought to know whether Revanth Reddy would tender an apology and resign from his posts, if he (KTR) takes the test and gets a clean chit. He also asked whether the TPCC president was willing to undergo a lie detector test in the cash-for-vote case.Reddy shot back on Twitter, saying: “Indicate time and place @KTRTRS for the lie detector test along with KCR on CBI cases on corruption charges in Sahara Provident Fund and ESI hospital construction scandals. #WhiteChallenge.”Reddy alleged that KTR was making baseless statements to divert the attention of the people from the drugs issue. “I have not said KTR is taking drugs. I have only tagged him for my challenge, so that he would take steps to prevent the drug menace,” the PCC chief said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/telangana-it-minister-files-defamation-case-against-state-congress-chief-101632139266124.html

According to the forest authorities, villagers saw and filmed unidentified hunters shooting the protected species with an air gun while passing through the protected area in their vehicles on Saturday. Officials said some villagers had seen three persons in a vehicle kill a Chinakara deer with their airgun, while another eyewitness saw the second Chinkara being shot around 100 meters from the spot of the first kill.

Despite winning hard fought polls to become gram panchayat members, many GP and BDC members are resigning to help their kids bag the job of panchayat sahayak or panchayat assistant, the recruitment process of which is now underway.In Prayagraj alone, 35 panchayat members have tendered their resignations to facilitate their children’s eligibility to bag the job as a panchayat sahayak or panchayat assistant. The district has 19,820 posts of GP members and for which polls were held in April 2021. In Bulandshahr also four gram panchayat members have resigned while in Pilibhit 23 individuals, including 20 gram panchayat members and three BDC members have resigned even as 27 persons, including 16 BDC and 11 gram panchayat members have resigned in Badaun. In Bareilly, 40 gram panchayat members have relinquished their posts while in Lakhimpur Kheri maximum 160 gram panchayat members and 50 GP members in Shahjahanpur have also resigned from their posts for this very reason, confirmed officials of the state Panchayati Raj department. Post Panchayat elections in April 2021, the state government announced its decision to appoint panchayat sahayaks across the state, but for its appointment it also put forth a condition: Any relative of a serving gram pradhan, block development council member, gram panchayat member etc would not be eligible for the post. The government aims to appoint these panchayat sahayaks on a monthly salary of ₹6,000 stationed at mini sadans in villages. Here, the government proposes to have computer operators at panchayat bhawans where they would help the villagers avail the various e-services of the state government and its various departments. In Prayagraj district alone, these panchayat sahayaks are to be appointed in 1540 gram sabhas and for whom the educational qualification is Intermediate pass. The craze for the job is such that around 500 aspirants having MBA and B Tech degrees too have applied for it. Officials, however, have made it clear that while making the merit list only the high school and intermediate marks of a candidate would be taken into account. Among the applicants are also kin and kith of newly elected gram panchayat members who are now tendering their resignations to allow them to bag the jobs on offer. One such Gram Panchayat member is Nirmala Devi of Daurahara village of Handia development block. “My son has applied for Panchayat Sahayak post and he is in desperate need of a job. Therefore, I have tendered my resignation so that his candidature for appointment does not get affected because of me being a Gram Panchayat member,” shared Nirmala Devi. She is not the only one. “So far we have received resignations of 35 GP members from all over the Prayagraj district. These are the members whose children have applied for the post of panchayat sahayaks and the rules make it clear that they cannot be considered for the post if their parents or kin are elected members of Gram Panchayat or BDC etc,” informed district Panchayati Raj officer Alok Kumar. Officials said, the application process for the post of panchayat sahayaks has been completed and even the block-level committees have submitted their report in this regard to the district-level committee and the work of screening of applicants of gram sabhas is now underway. The DPRO said that the list of selected candidates would become public any day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-gram-panchayat-members-willingly-resigning-to-help-kin-get-panchayat-sahayak-job-101632137951061.html

On the last day of Ganesh festivities, from among the 3,567 antigen tests, only one returned positive on Sunday. One of the reason for low testing was also the disinterest shown by those fully vaccinated, claimed civic officials. From among the 8,997 antigen tests that were conducted at immersion sites, only eight were found positive. “The next two weeks are crucial for the city and the impact of the festivities will be understood then,” said municipal commissioner Vipin Sharma.

20-09-2021||Dehradun||Central Zoo Authority seeks report forest dept over ‘illegal cutting’ of trees in Corbett||Dehradun: Central Zoo Authority (CZA) issued a notice to chief wildlife warden Uttarakhand seeking report on allegations of illegal cutting of trees in Corbett Tiger Reserve’s Kalagarh division for the setting up of the Pakhrau Tiger Safari. The development follows legal notice sent by Gaurav Kumar Bansal, wildlife activist and advocate of Supreme Court, in which he has urged CZA and National Tiger Conservation Authority ( NTCA) to withdraw their “approval” for the establishment of the tiger safari in the Gujjar Sot, Pakhrau Block, Sonanadi Range, Kalagarh Division in Corbett Tiger Reserve. Bansal said in his notice he has stated that Forest Advisory Committee of Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change had recommended the proposal only after the written assurance from Uttarakhand Forest officials that only 163 trees will be felled for the setting up of the tiger safari. “However, in contrary of its undertaking, forest department officials have uprooted nearly 10,000 trees in the area”, he said. Sonali Gosh, Deputy Inspector General of Forests at CZI in her September 17 letter to principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and chief wildlife warden Uttarakhand has asked them to verify facts and submit their response for further action. Bansal said even director CTR has sought report from divisional forest officer Kalagarh on illegal cutting of trees for setting up of the tiger safari. The legal notice states that “grievance which applicant wish to highlight is that illegal felling of trees in the name of establishment of Pakhrau Tiger Safari and that too within Corbett Tiger Reserve, which is one of the best and oldest National Park in the Country, is not only against the statutory approvals granted by National Tiger Conservation Authority, Central Zoo Authority and Forest Advisory Committee but is also contempt of the order dated 09/04/2001 issued by Supreme Court of India in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 47 of 1998 titled as ‘Navin M Raheja Vs. Union of INDIA and Others’ wherein the apex court expressly observed that no tree whatsoever shall be felled in the Corbett Tiger Reserve by the State or anyone else”. When contacted PCCF Rajiv Bhartari said he had directed the PPCF wildlife JS Suhag to give a status report on the allegations, based on which the response will be sent to CZA. Rahul (who goes by his first name), director CTR, however, rubbished the allegations that 10,000 trees have been cut for the safari project. “Prima facie there are no irregularities in the construction of the tiger safari. We have all the required permissions. But still, I have sought a status report from DFO Kalagarh in the matter. This tiger safari project was conceived during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Corbett in February 2019,” he said. According to the minutes of the meeting of the forest advisory committee (FAC) held on September 21, 2020, the proposal for seeking prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2 of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for non-forestry use of 106.16 hectare of forest land Compartment No. 3 and 8 of Kalagarh Tiger Reserve Division of Pakhro Range, Pakhro Block of Pauri Garhwal district for the establishment of Tiger Safari was discussed. The FAC recommended the proposal on certain conditions that all statutory approvals obtained from NTCA and CZA would be complied and the state government would ensure the infrastructure of the tiger safari is created mainly from bamboo and other natural materials. The minutes stated that statutory approvals from NTCA and CZA have been obtained for the proposal, compensatory afforestation has been proposed over 16 hectares non-forest land which is equal to 15% of the forest land proposed for diversion. The minutes also noted that as the construction activity of over 4000 square metres will be carried out under the project, the proposal does not require Environment Clearance and consequent Wildlife Clearance from Standing Committee of the National Board for Wildlife.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/central-zoo-authority-seeks-report-forest-dept-over-illegal-cutting-of-trees-in-corbett-101632134585316.html

However, authorities at the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International (NSCBI) airport said that flight services were not affected.The weather department said that it had never rained as much in Kolkata on a single day in September in the last 14 years. Till 8:30 am, Kolkata received around 142 mm rain, the highest since September 25, 2007, when 174 mm rain was recorded.Several areas in the city such as Topsia, Ultadanga, Palmer Bazar, Ballygunge, Mominpur, Jodhpur Park, Chetla and Kalighat recorded more than 100 mm of rain since Sunday night, senior officials of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) said.Meteorologists have issued an orange alert in Kolkata for Monday and a yellow alert for Tuesday. Red alert is the highest category of alert followed by orange and yellow.On Tuesday, the western part of the state along with the coastal district of South 24 Parganas are likely to receive heavy rain.Officials of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional office in Kolkata said that a cyclonic circulation that had developed over the sea moved towards the West Bengal coast, triggering the heavy rain.“The situation is not good. It has been raining heavily since last night. Heavy waterlogging has been reported from several areas. What aggravated matters is that the city’s lock gates, which allow the storm water to drain out, had to be closed from 10:30 am to 3 pm as the high tide was coming in the Hooghly river. This resulted in more water logging,” said Tarak Singh, a member of the KMC’s board of administrators overseeing the drainage and sewerage department.At Lake Gardens in south Kolkata, TMC parliamentarian (MP) Saugata Roy was seen wading through water while taking stock of the situation in his locality. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had to cancel some of its organisational meetings due to the waterlogging.“I woke up and saw that the entire road in front of my house was under knee-deep water. I had two to three programs which I had to cancel,” he added.“There were no reports of any major breaches in river embankments or any untoward incidents from the districts apart from waterlogging. Last week we had to evacuate more than 120,000 people in two districts as river embankments were beached by heavy rains and large areas in Paschim Medinipur and Purba Medinipur were flooded,” said a senior official of the state’s disaster management department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/heavy-rains-lash-kolkata-large-parts-of-city-submerged-101632128285511.html

Thousands of police personnel are transferred during annual general transfers every year but the fund to ease their transfer burden is often delayed, defeating its very purpose.“It is observed that when an officer is transferred to another district then he/she immediately requires money to arrange accommodation, manage children’s school fees, spend money on travelling, etc. There is already a provision of immediate sanctioning of advance funds up to the limit of ₹25,000 to a police person so that he/she could manage his/her transfer- related expenses without any additional financial burden. But the processing of the said allowance generally takes a longer time. And as a result, the police personnel are forced to face financial challenges,” DGP Pandey’s order read.Many police personnel don’t even apply for the allowance because of the tedious process, said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity.Taking cognisance of the issue, the top cop has now directed for its immediate release to eligible personnel from the Police Welfare Fund. The unit commanders have been further directed to mention the details of the sanctioned advance in the last salary certificate of the said police officer. The new unit commander of the transferred police officer, in turn, has been directed to deduct the sanctioned advance from the cop’s salary only after three months, and in maximum 10 regular installments.“This is a positive directive issued by the head of the force and will prove beneficial for approximately 180,000-strong constabulary and over 10,000 junior officers across the state,” said another officer, requesting not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-top-cops-orders-immediate-payment-of-transfer-allowance-101632125766065.html

Time will,” actor Sonu Sood tweeted against the backdrop of the income tax raids at his premises and the department’s claim that the actor and his associates were involved ₹20 crore tax evasion and violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) while raising funds from abroad. The department carried out marathon searches at the actor’s premises for three consecutive days last week, suspecting huge tax evasion. On Monday, the actor posted in Hindi from his Twitter handle, “Sakht Rahon me bhi asaan safar lagta hai, Har Hindustani ki duaaon ka asar lagta hai (It must be the blessings of every Indian that the journey seems easy even in tough times).” Another of his post reads, “You don’t always have to tell your side of the story. Time will. I have pledged myself to the service of the people of India with all my strength and heart. Every rupee in my foundation is awaiting its turn to save a precious life and reach the needy.

The actor has 9.3million followers on Twitter. He has posted a similar statement on his Instagram and Facebook accounts where he has 13.7mililion and 18million followers respectively. On Instagram, his post was liked by 380,000 users, while on Facebook his post received over 43,000 likes by 12noon.The actor and his charity works were praised nationally after he arranged free transport through rail, air and road for migrant workers trying to reach their home states during the nationwide lockdown last year to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Sood recently became an ambassador of AAP’s mentorship programme meant for students. The I-T department, since September 16, has raided 28 premises belonging to Sood, his foundation, associates and a Lucknow-based real estate group in Mumbai, Lucknow, Delhi, Kanpur, Jaipur and Gurugram, during which they allegedly found incriminating evidence pertaining to tax evasion. The agency has claimed that Sood routed his “unaccounted income in the form of bogus unsecured loans from many bogus entities”. “Investigations so far have revealed the use of 20 such entries, the providers of which, on examination, have accepted on oath to have given bogus accommodation entries. They have accepted to have issued cheques in lieu of cash. There have been instances where professional receipts have been camouflaged as loans in the books of accounts for the purpose of evasion of tax. It has also been revealed that these bogus loans have been used for making investments and acquiring properties,” the CBDT said in a statement, adding that total tax evasion amounts to more than ₹20 crore, so far. Subsequently, the I-T department also alleged violation of the FCRA by the Sood Charity Foundation, a non-profit charity organisation established during the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak last year. According to the department, Sood’s organisation collected donations worth ₹18.94 crore since April 1, 2021. Of this, around ₹1.9 crore has been spent so far on various relief work, while the remaining ₹17 crore is lying unutilised in the bank account of the foundation, it added. “It is seen that funds to the tune of ₹2.1 crore have also been raised by the charity foundation from overseas donors on a crowdfunding platform in violation of FCRA regulations,” the CBDT statement said. AAP leaders, including Delhi CM Kejriwal, too have tweeted in support of the 48-year-old actor. Shiv Sena has also supported the actor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/time-will-tell-my-side-of-story-sonu-sood-tweets-amid-i-t-raids-101632125645516.html

The body of Madan Oraon, 45, was recovered a day later on Sunday evening following the arrest of 6 out of the nine accused.Deceased’s wife Sudeshwari Devi has named nine co-villagers for her husband’s murder.

In a tweet, he announced that he is resigning “due to the changed circumstances in the state”. Also read: Sunil Jakhar ‘baffled’ by Harish Rawat’s ‘Sidhu to lead Punjab polls’ statement Ajay refused to comment further or elaborate on the circumstances that led to his decision. A progressive farmer from Maujgarh village in Fazilka, Ajay is the grandson of former Lok Sabha Speaker Balram Jakhar and belongs to Abohar in Punjab. Ajay was appointed chief of the farmers’ commission by Captain Amarinder Singh in April 2017 soon after the Congress came to power. While Balram Jakhar was a veteran Congress leader who served as the Lok Sabha Speaker for two terms, his son and Ajay’s father, Sajjan Kumar Jakhar, remained a state minister. Ajay’s announcement came minutes after his uncle Sunil posted a tweet objecting to AICC Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat’s statement that the 2022 elections next year will be fought under the leadership of state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Sunil Jakhar termed the statement baffling and claimed that it undermines the authority of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. Under Ajay Vir’s command, the Punjab State Farmers Commission had drafted a farmers’ policy and submitted it to the state government in 2018. But the Captain government kept the report, aimed at strengthening the farm sector and improving the income of agriculturists of Punjab, pending for nearly three years. Ajay is the chairperson of a non-government organisation (NGO), Bharat Krishak Samaj, that was founded by Balram Jakhar in 1955.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sunil-jakhar-s-nephew-ajay-vir-quits-as-punjab-farmers-commission-chief-101632122765117.html

The police had to scan footage of over 150 CCTV cameras from Ghatkopar to Kandivli and then to Bhandup via Powai to nab the three women, who are sisters. According to the police, the complainant – Rohini Chandrakant Akhade – was travelling from Ghatkopar on a BEST bus last week. When she got off at Kandivli station bus stop, she noticed that the chain of her purse was open and her mangalsutra was missing.Akhade, a home maker, then lodged a police complaint against an unidentified thief.Also Read | BJP leader Kirit Somaiya detained at railway station ahead of Kolhapur visitThe police began to scan the footages of CCTV cameras installed along the bus route from Ghatkopar to Kandivli.“At Thakur Complex, we noticed three women alighting from the bus and then taking a rickshaw,” said senior inspector Anandrao Hanke from Samta Nagar police station.“As they seemed suspicious, the officers followed the route of the rickshaw through the CCTV recordings and noticed that it was plying towards Powai. We then tracked down the rickshaw driver using the vehicle’s number plate. The driver informed us that he had dropped off the three women at Bhandup. On getting the location of the drop off, our officers then pulled up the recordings of the CCTV cameras of the area and saw the three women disappear in a chawl,” said Hanke.The police then took the CCTV grab and circulated it around the locality and managed to trace the house of one of the accused – 55-year-old Anusuya Gaikwad, Hanke added.Gaikwad revealed that her sisters – Marubai Gaikwad, 50, and Baby Gaikwad, 52, were her other accomplices. The police arrested the three for theft under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code and recovered Akhade’s mangalsutra, worth ₹2.5 lakh.Investigating officers said that the accused have been committing thefts in local trains and buses from a long time. “While one of the women starts a conversation with their target, the other two open the chain of the commuter’s purse and steal valuables. The middle-aged women did not create any suspicion as they used to get friendly with their targets by pretending to be helpless and seeking help from fellow commuters,” said Hanke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/police-scan-cctv-footage-across-half-of-mumbai-to-nab-3-female-thieves-101632119164915.html

20-09-2021||Patna||Session to improve nutrition in Bihar, which has highest child mortality rate||The Bihar child rights protection commission is busy explaining the nutritional values of fruits, vegetables and rice starch to mothers and children during the ongoing ‘Poshan Maah’, or the month of nutrition in a state where the neonatal mortality rate is the highest in the country at 34.5, as per a Central government report.The commission held an interactive session a couple of days ago with a large number of women and children gathered in Patna district’s Anganwadi centres, explaining how to improve nutrition levels and physical fitness of children.As per the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS)-5 released in 2020, compared to Bihar’s neonatal mortality rate of 34.5, it was just 3.4 in Kerala. Even in not so developed states such as West Bengal, it stood at 15.5, less than half of Bihar’s figure. The neonatal rate is the number of newborns dying within 28- days per 1,000 births in an assessment year.Even the infant mortality rate-- the number of infants dying within one year of birth per 1,000 deliveries in a given year-- is at 46.8 in Bihar, the highest in the country. In comparison, Kerala’s infant mortality rate is 4.4, West Bengal has 22 and Gujarat has 31.8, as per NFHS-5.Bihar also has the embarrassing distinction of being the state with the highest mortality rate of children under five years of age at 56.4, compared to Kerala’s 5.2, Bengal’s 25.4, and Gujarat’s 37.6. As per the report, the problem is almost as severe in urban areas of the state with a 50 mortality rate compared to 57.4 in rural areas.“There’s an urgent need to improve the physical health of children. To get the desired results, we need to make their mothers aware about nutrition and proper diet. We explained to the women how important it is to make children eat nutritional food like fruits and vegetables,” Pramila Kumari, the Child Rights Protection Commission chairperson, said.Women were also told about inexpensive and easily available fruits and other high nutrition value food options. “They need not worry about costly fruits. Even the rice starch, which is easily available, has a high nutrition level and can be used for physical fitness,” she said.Besides, women were also explained the importance of breastfeeding and bottle-free rearing of kids.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/session-to-improve-nutrition-in-bihar-which-has-highest-child-mortality-rate-101632110764414.html

The number means that the Union Territory has vaccinated about 77% of the above-18 (or adult) population with either one or both doses.“J&K achieved a new milestone in Covid vaccination. Total doses administered has crossed the one-crore mark. It’s a momentous feat. Kudos to the medical fraternity for its tireless efforts,” J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha said. The official figures reveal that the UT has vaccinated 92.3 lakh citizens above 18 years till September 18, besides around 5.69 lakh field-level workers and 1.89 lakh healthcare workers.Dr Ashiq Rashid Mir, surveillance medical officer, WHO, Kashmir division and Ladakh, applauded the healthcare workers for the feat.“Special mention to those ground workers who have been vaccinating without off-days including Sundays, gazetted holidays (or) festivals, and (going) door-to-door and at odd hours. They have sacrificed a lot, especially their family time. Your work has been extraordinary,” he said.The highest percentage of vaccinated people was in Samba (100%) followed by Ramban (88.5%), Reasi (87.3%) and Poonch (87.1%). The districts with lowest percentage are Kishtwar, Anantnag and Srinagar with 66.9 %, 67.8% and 68.4%, respectively.

Please follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and also get vaccinated. Why to be in minority who risk their lives for unscientific reasoning,” said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, head of community medicine department and Covid in-charge at the Srinagar government medical college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/1crore-covid-vaccine-doses-administered-in-jk-101632093603418.html

20-09-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali fire wing once again hides apathy behind notice smokescreen||Municipal corporation’s annual charade to make Mohali appear safer from blazes has returned. Having not penalised even a single fire-safety violator, despite sending out 600 notices annually for the past three years, the fire department has once again issued notices for non-compliance of the no-objection certificate – this time to 43 violators.As has been the practice, this, too, will end up being a paper exercise, leaving structures vulnerable to major fires.Even in February this year, 600 notices were slapped on violators, with an ultimatum of 15 days, but six months later, no violating structure has been sealed.2020 survey had found widespread violationsThrough a survey last year, the fire department had identified various properties, including high-rise buildings and commercial establishments, that did not comply with fire-safety norms. The violations included presence of only a single entry and exit point, which could be dangerous in an emergency.Fire extinguishers were missing on many floors and those available did not have the ISI mark. Hose reels, smoke detection alarm system and illuminated exit signs were also found missing in most buildings. Most showrooms had loose electricity wiring.At several industrial units and housing societies, there was no underground static water storage tank of 75,000-litre capacity with pump, as required under fire-safety rules, and terrace water tanks with at least 10,000-litre capacity were also found missing. Absence of a fire control room and emergency lifts with firemen switch was also among the violations. MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said last year, action could not be taken due to the lockdown: “We are starting the drive this month and will seal the units that have not complied with safety norms.”Fire officer Mohan Lal Verma said, “We have started issuing fresh notices to violators, and in the past one week, 43 notices have been sent out.”Last year in March, a fire broke out in the basement of Vishal Mega Mart in Phase 5, turning readymade clothes worth lakhs into ashes. A factory on Barwala Road in Dera Bassi was gutted in December 2020. Earlier, 2019 had witnessed two major fires at industrial units in Dera Bassi, which had left 18 workers injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-fire-wing-once-again-hides-apathy-behind-notice-smokescreen-101632083225066.html
20-09-2021||Chandigarh||iSewa: Soon, hire a gardener, barber in Chandigarh with a click||From a gardener to a barber, soon a multitude of service providers will be a click away in Chandigarh.By month end, the municipal corporation will bring together service providers and city residents on a common platform – iSewa, a web-based solution.“Often residents, who need help don’t know where to get it. Similarly, the service providers don’t know where their prospective customers are located. iSewa, a free platform, will connect them both,” said Anindita Mitra, MC commissioner.Akin to yellow pages, the website, an open crowd source-based platform, will initially provide access to hair stylists, gardeners, laundrymen, tyre repair shops, cobblers and ambulances, and more will be roped in gradually.“Service providers trained under the National Urban Livelihood Mission will be listed on the web portal. We are on-boarding more and more service providers, and in a week’s time, we will be ready for a formal launch,” said Mitra.The portal is the brainchild of Ravee Singh Ahluwalia, chief functionary of NGO Patiala Foundation that holds a special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The website is already being used across various cities in India.More avenues for service providersService providers will have to register on the platform through a mobile number and OTP, with complete contact details.There will be no cost involved for registration, which is only mandatory for service providers and not customers. MC will not be involved in any financial transaction between the two parties. Sharing an example from Patiala, where she previously launched the initiative, Mitra said, “In Patiala, just one family still polishes copper utensils, but couldn’t get in touch with customers. But after registering on the platform, they got customers enough to open an exclusive shop.”The list of services depends on the city’s character and needs. “In Karnal, for instance, lots of dhaba owners registered themselves. In Ambala, there are lots of e-rickshaw service providers,” said Mitra. How it will work- Users will have to visit www.isewa.patialafoundation.orgTo start with, services of hair stylists, gardeners, laundrymen, tyre repair shops, cobblers and ambulances will be available- Under “Find an isewa to call at doorstep”, the user will need to choose the city, area and service - Thereon, a selection can be made from the list of service providers available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/isewa-soon-hire-a-gardener-barber-in-chandigarh-with-a-click-101632083224009.html

Commuters also struggled as long queues were seen along the under-construction freight corridor overbridge and underpass near Shastri Colony on the NH-44 in the Cantonment.Despite attempts to reach senior superintendent of police (SSP) Hamid Akhtar, he remained unavailable for comment. Meanwhile, several candidates complained about being assigned exam centres hundreds of kilometres away. Rachna Kanwar, an exam aspirant from a village near Hisar, claimed that the government did not fulfil its poll promise of ensuring that exam centres were within 50km of the examinees’ native place.Deputy commissioner Vikram, in a statement, said that officers on duty ensured that the guidelines laid down by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission were followed and the centres were monitored through CCTVs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-police-women-constable-exam-ambala-roads-choked-as-50-000-appear-for-two-day-exam-101632082990014.html

Bansal was addressing a Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee (CTCC) program on ‘’Housing Societies Pe Charcha” in Sector 49 here on Sunday. Talking about housing societies, Bansal said, “We are well aware of the problems being faced by residents. The Chandigarh MC has been in a paralysed state since BJP came to power, with no public welfare policies and plans in sight.” “The idea of setting up cooperative societies in Chandigarh was planned to settle the working class in the city, who put their hard-earned money into buying flats in societies. However, exorbitant rates of conversion of properties from leasehold to freehold were a big jolt to residents,” Bansal said. “After coming to power, Congress will work to resolve the residents’ problems on priority, along with ensuring the repair and maintenance of internal roads in societies by MC itself,” he maintained. Subash Chawla, city congress chief, said, “We have formed a team to chalk out the problems faced by society’s residents. We will make a comprehensive plan to solve them after coming to power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-polls-bansal-calls-upon-residents-to-end-bjp-rule-in-city-101632082862711.html

At least, 150 police personnel of different ranks had taken part in the police welfare meeting, including two police personnel from each police station and wings. When the commissioner asked the police personnel about the problems they were facing, no one dared to speak up. A police officer, requesting anonymity, said that many officers shirked from flagging several issues that had been plaguing the police force, fearing reprisal from seniors. “Most of us have to purchase fuel for our police vehicles from our own pockets as we do not get enough fuel from the department. We also have to arrange for stationery, and material to seize the recovered items without the department’s support.” Agreeing a second cop said undue pressure by seniors, interference of politicians, insufficient sleep and consequent health problems are also some issues, which should have been raised during the welfare meet, but no one dared to do so. Later, after the commissioner encouraged them saying that he “could only help them, if they spoke up,” did some personnel raise the issue of the acute staff crunch, and the police control room employees said that are forced to work 24-hour shifts.The commissioner of police said that after fresh recruitments, the police commissionerate will get new police personnel and private security guards will be roped in to guard markets, and industrial areas with help of NGOs, industrialists and traders associations.The police personnel also said they were having trouble withdrawing money from their employees provident funds and the commissioner assured them that the problem will be resolved at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fearing-reprisal-ludhiana-cops-clam-up-during-welfare-meet-101632082622762.html

20-09-2021||Chandigarh||NIRF grading: Punjab colleges fail to make it to top 100 for 5th consecutive year||Punjab’s higher educational institutes have performed poorly in the recent National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) grading yet again as none of the colleges could make it to the top 100 list in the category for the fifth consecutive year.This is in contrast to the state’s schools topping the national performance grading index of school education for 2019-20 released by the Union government in June this year.The NIRF rankings for higher educational institutes across the country given by the Union ministry of education are based on teaching, learning, and resources; research and professional practice, graduation outcome; outreach and inclusivity; and peer perception.As per the NIRF data, a total 1,802 institutes participated from different states for the 2021 grading, the highest number since 2017 when colleges were clubbed for national ranking.Punjab has 303 colleges, including 67 run by government, 135 aided privately managed and another 100 run under self-finance scheme category. Only 22 colleges came forward for NIRF assessment’s latest annual edition. When college rankings were rolled out in 2017, none of the colleges participated in it.But the state’s participation improved in the next four with 10 colleges applying in 2018; 12 in 2019 and 17 in 2020.Teachers and academicians admit that most colleges are aware they do not fulfill the basic criteria of assessment and hence they stay away from participation.Prof RK Kohli, former vice-chancellor of Central University of Punjab, says it is a cause of concern that education was not a priority for the political dispensations. It is discouraging that a faculty member in a government institute in Punjab gets paid less than a peon for a minimum period of three years, he added.“The government ranking exposes the standards of education in Punjab. Educational institutes are evaluated from the talent they produce and no government has formulated a policy to check brain drain,” Prof Kohli said. Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers’ Union (PCCTU) president Vinay Sofat blames lack of higher education policy in Punjab. “Governments are quick to announce new colleges but desist from appointing faculty members on regular basis. When a teacher is not paid well in government colleges and institutes run by social or charitable bodies are not supported financially how anyone could be motivated to participate in activities like NIRF,” said Sofat.Swaraj Raj, former head of English department at Government Mohindra College, Patiala, said the number of faculty members has reduced even as more colleges have been opened in the last three decades.“Government schools have seen an improvement in terms of infrastructure and number of teachers but the colleges continue to get step-motherly treatment. When I joined service in 1982, there were about 2,400 college teachers and the number was about 1,000 at the time of my retirement in 2015. One simply cannot expect qualitative education in the given circumstances,” he added.NIRF grading year College participants from India Punjab’s participation2017 535 NIL2018 1,087 102019 1,304 122020 1,659 172021 1,802 22||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nirf-grading-punjab-colleges-fail-to-make-it-to-top-100-for-5th-consecutive-year-101632082322751.html

A meeting was held on September 10, where all available information about the technology was shared with them. The matter has also been discussed with the UT chief architect and the hospitals have been permitted to install the plant on rooftops,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg. “Each private hospital should have sufficient oxygen cylinders, which is at least three times the daily requirement,” he added.“Oxygen supply pipelines and other equipment need to be tested immediately, and repaired if needed, to ensure there is no leakage. The staff should be trained to use oxygen optimally. Equipment like flow meters and other consumables should be available in sufficient quantity in case of an emergency. An oxygen audit team may be formed to check leakages and other discrepancies in oxygen flow systems and proper record must be kept of oxygen supplies and their utilisation,” said Garg.“As a backup plan and to reduce dependency on oxygen cylinders, there need to be an equal number of oxygen concentrators (10 litre capacity) as there are beds,” he added.“Since oxygen is highly combustible, an adequate number of fire-extinguishers and fire-hydrants should also be available. All private hospitals need to get a fire audit conducted within the next 15 days,” said the health secretary. There should be buffer stock of all critical medicines and a suggestive list may be obtained from the director of health services. “To meet the additional requirement of qualified manpower, tie-ups should be in place with a manpower supply agency,” directed Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/prepare-to-tackle-third-covid-wave-chandigarh-directs-private-hospitals-101632082087881.html

20-09-2021||Chandigarh||Charanjit Singh Channi is Punjab’s first Dalit CM||Punjab got its first Dalit chief minister on Sunday, with the Congress electing three-time MLA Charanjit Singh Channi as leader of the legislature party. His name was announced by Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat on Twitter after a series of meetings and direct feedback gathered by central observers Ajay Maken and Harish Chaudhary from MLAs. “It gives me immense pleasure to announce that Sh. Charanjit Singh Channi has been unanimously elected as the leader of CLP of Punjab,” Rawat tweeted. The new leader was named a day after Capt Amarinder Singh resigned from the post. “My best wishes to Charanjit Singh Channi. I hope he’s able to keep the border state of Punjab safe and protect our people from the growing security threat from across the border,” the former CM said, wishing his successor. Channi represents the Chamkaur Sahib constituency in the state assembly. Amarinder’s relations with Channi were uneasy throughout his tenure, and the latter was among the cabinet ministers who rebelled against him. Accompanied by Rawat, central observers and several ministers, Channi met Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Sunday evening at the Raj Bhavan in Chandigarh and staked his claim to form the government. “The oath-taking ceremony will be held at 11am on Monday,” Channi told reporters after the meeting. The Congress has also decided to appoint two deputy chief ministers. The names of Brahm Mohindra, a Hindu face, and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who is a Jat Sikh, are learnt to be more or less final for the deputy CM’s posts. Randhawa is also being considered for home and vigilance portfolios, according to sources. Both were minister in the Amarinder Singh cabinet. Earlier, former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, a key frontrunner for the CM’s post, was also offered one of these slots by two central leaders before the Channi’s name was made public. “First, one of the central observers phoned him to offer the deputy chief ministership, but he refused. Later, an AICC general secretary spoke to him, but the former PCC chief did not budge, telling them that he was not after any post, according to sources. His appointment is being touted by some party leaders as a “strategic move” to counter the attempts of rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) to woo Dalit voters. The BJP has already declared that if voted to power in the state in next year’s assembly elections, it will have a Dalit CM. The SAD has struck an electoral alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), with the promise to pick a deputy chief minister from the community if they get the numbers to form the government in 2022. At 32%, Dalits constitute almost a third of the state’s population—the highest anywhere in the country. The surprise announcement of Channi’s name came after hours of hectic parleys that saw the scales tilt in favour of different leaders in the party leadership’s quest for consensus, with some party MLAs, at one stage, even declaring cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa as the next CM. The past 24 hours were full of dramatic turns and twists as the name of former state unit president Sunil Jakhar was almost finalized on Saturday evening with the backing of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. However, the party did not announce it after some MLAs, who met Rawat and the two central observers on the sidelines of the CLP meeting on Saturday, pushed for a Sikh chief minister. Punjab has never had a non-Sikh CM since the reorganization of the state in 1966. A few others stressed that the new leader should be from among the MLAs. In the morning, Rajya Sabha MP Ambika Soni emerged as the frontrunner, but she opted out, saying that a Sikh leader should be made the chief minister. After the CLP scheduled at 11 am was cancelled for want of consensus, Rawat and the two observers called up MLAs to know their preference and cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa emerged as the favourite. Before his name was even announced, Congress MLAs had started reaching his official residence to congratulate him. “His name did not go down well with Sidhu who saw him as a competitor in future,” a party leader aware of the developments said. Later, the party leaders declared Channi, whose name was doing the rounds for the post of deputy chief minister, as the new legislature party leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/charanjit-singh-channi-is-punjab-s-first-dalit-cm-101632081902941.html

20-09-2021||Chandigarh||Infighting to polls: Channi faces tall task||Charanjit Singh Channi is the surprise pick of the Congress for the chief minister’s post in Punjab to succeed the party stalwart Captain Amarinder Singh, who has had an unceremonious exit barely five months before the state goes to the polls early next year. The state’s first Dalit chief minister, with a limited mass base and a pan-Punjab appeal, faces a host of challenges that will test not only his political acumen but also his administrative skills as the party races against the clock to offset the political damage ahead of the electoral slugfest, experts say. The aftereffects of a bitter showdown between Amarinder and Navjot Singh Sidhu are already casting a shadow on Channi’s tenure. He takes the onerous charge when incessant infighting – unlikely to ebb in the days to come – has sapped the party’s morale, making a rebound tougher. Working with a fractious frontline leadership, clearly divided between the Captain and Sidhu camps, will be a Sisyphean task, they suggest. Channi knows the challenges ahead only too well. For, he was among the disgruntled Congress leaders who were calling attention to problems, ranging from growing anti-incumbency, non-fulfilment of poll promises and insufficient bureaucratic accountability when Amarinder was at the helm. Channi will have to hit the ground running to fulfil the 18-point to-do list of pending promises that the high command handed to Amarinder three months ago for implementation before the state polls. The pending promises, particularly the delivery of justice in the 2015 sacrilege and police firing cases, action against “big fish” involved in drug rackets, scrapping “faulty” power purchase agreements with private generators – these contentious issues were at the heart of a bitter tussle between Amarinder and Sidhu-led dissenters, including Channi. “Now, the shoe is on the other foot,” said a senior Congress leader who asked not to be named. “The new CM will have to act quickly to turn the tide and avoid being accused of following in his predecessor’s footsteps.” Another challenge before the new CM will be to take everyone in the crisis-ridden state unit along by giving adequate representation to various social groups as well as warring factions who are pulling the party in different directions, in addition, to quickly putting together his team of officers and advisers. Also, he will have to find a way to reach out to his combative predecessor, who is sore over his “humiliation” by the leadership but still holds sway. It is an open secret that the power dice rolled in Channi’s favour after Sidhu backed him as part of the PCC chief’s well-crafted stratagem of edging out the heavyweight contenders Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Sunil Jakhar, who could have been potential challengers in the 2022 sweepstakes. Ashutosh Kumar, professor of political science, Panjab University, sees Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s hand behind Channi’s appointment. “It is not a masterstroke as is being made out, but a big gamble as there could be a flip side depending on how the Jat Sikhs react,” he said. “If he wants to do well, Channi will have to be his own man, act decisively and not worry too much about the sizeable egos,” he added. That may be a tall order as Sidhu is set to play a dominant role in the post-Amarinder power politics. Given the overwhelming challenges and expectations after the change of guard, a mild-mannered Channi has a lot to prove.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/infighting-to-polls-channi-faces-tall-task-101632081002477.html
20-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Legal clinic started for transgenders||The District Legal Services Authority, Chandigarh, in association with Chandigarh State Aids Control Society and its partner NGO, Association of Professional Social Workers and Development Practitioners (APSWDP), has started a legal aid clinic for transgenders, “Samta Nyay Kendra”, at New Indira Colony in Manimajra. The clinic will be functional on Wednesday and Saturday and panel lawyers and paralegal volunteers will be deputed on need-based assignments. Also, paralegal volunteers will be deputed from within members of the transgender community. The clinic was inaugurated on Sunday by Justice Jaswant Singh, judge, Punjab and Haryana high court-cum- executive chairman, State Legal Services Authority, Chandigarh. He said that in a case, the apex court declared transgender people as the “third gender”. Hence, it becomes imperative that all efforts be made to ensure that people from the transgender community have access to multidimensional services and feel included as part of mainstream society. He added that there is a need to sensitise all stakeholders including the judiciary about specific needs of the community. Through the clinic, people from the transgender community will be provided legal aid services, legal awareness training, linkages and capacity building services, he added. Gurbir Singh, district and sessions judge-cum-chairman, DLSA, said this clinic is a step towards ensuring that the fundamental rights granted under the Constitution of India are equally applicable and accessible to members of the transgender community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-legal-clinic-started-for-transgenders-101632080824862.html

20-09-2021||Chandigarh||KMSC announces ‘rail roko’ stir in Punjab from Sept 30||The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) on Sunday announced a “rail roko’ stir in Punjab from September 30 if their demands, including the repeal of three farm laws, are not met.The KMSC has a considerable hold in the Majha region of the state and some districts of Malwa. KMSC’s Punjab president Satnam Singh Pannu said: “We have planned to hold protests outside deputy commissioner offices in Punjab from September 28. If our demands are not met till then, we will be forced to take our protests to the railway tracks from September 30. We will also support the Bharat bandh call on September 27 in Punjab.” Earlier, the KMSC had blocked the Amritsar-Delhi and Tarn Taran-Ferozepur railway tracks for 169 days demanding repeal of three farm laws. The blockade was suspended in March. Besides repeal of farm laws, the KMSC is demanding a law ensuring minimum support price (MSP) of 23 crops, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report, waiving of farmers’ debt, and government jobs and compensation of ₹5 lakh each to families of farmers who died during the agitation against the three farm laws at the Delhi border. Farmers from different parts of the country have been protesting since November last year against the three farm laws, which the Centre has said are major agricultural reforms. However, the farmers fear that they will do away with the minimum support price or MSP system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The government and farmer leaders held more than 10 rounds of talks but have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.Meanwhile, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has issued guidelines for the September 27 “Bharat bandh” against the three farm laws and said it would be peaceful and farmers will ensure that people do not face any inconvenience. “The SKM has asked constituent organisations to appeal to all sections of society to join hands with farmers and publicise the bandh beforehand so that inconvenience to the public may be reduced. The bandh will be peaceful as well as voluntary and would exempt emergency services,” it said in the statement.Central and state government offices, markets, shops, factories, schools, colleges and other educational institutions will not be allowed to function during the Bharat bandh by farmers, which will start at 6am and remain in force till 4pm. Public and private transport will not be allowed to ply on roads, the umbrella body of more than 40 farmer unions said. No public functions will be allowed and only emergency services, including ambulances and fire services, can function during the bandh, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kmsc-announces-rail-roko-stir-in-punjab-from-sept-30-101632080222294.html
20-09-2021||Chandigarh||AAP’s CM candidate in Punjab will be pride of state: Chadha||The Aam Aadmi Party’s Punjab chief ministerial candidate will hail from the state and will be somebody who can be called the pride of the state, party leader Raghav Chadha said.With assembly polls in Punjab set for early next year, the AAP is going all out to win the battle and has already promised free 300 units of power to the people if it forms the next government.Chadha, the AAP’s Punjab co-in charge, told PTI in an interview that people of the state want to give the Arvind Kejriwal- led party a chance in the next polls as the Akali Dal has become “irrelevant”, while the Congress has been the most “nikammi sarkar” (useless government) ever in the history of electoral politics of Punjab. He said the chief ministerial candidate of the party for Punjab will be decided by the political affairs committee in due course of time.3 characteristics of the CM candidateOn chances of AAP’s Sangrur MP and party’s Punjab unit president Bhagwant Mann being chosen, he said at this point and time “I can only say three characteristics of the CM candidate of AAP. One is that he will hail from Punjab, he will be from the 2.8 crore population of Punjab and thirdly he will be somebody who can be called the ‘aan baan shaan’ (pride) of Punjab.SAD becoming ‘irrelevant’, Cong in self-destruction modeTalking about the political situation of Punjab, Chadha claimed that the Akali Dal is slowly becoming “irrelevant” because people have “utmost hatred” for the party of Badals. The Congress is on a “suicide mission and on self-destruction mode” and they do not need an opposition, he said. On the impact of the ongoing farmers’ protest on the polls, Chadha alleged that all three parties - BJP, Congress and Akali Dal - have “betrayed” the Indian farmers and “backstabbed” them. The BJP is not even a player in Punjab because of enacting these three laws, he added. Akali Dal is hated because they were the people who brought this law as Harsimrat Kaur Badal being the minister in the Union cabinet proposed this legislation and Captain (Amarinder Singh) is also hated because he was part of the drafting committee of these laws,” he said. Asked if the AAP will be benefited by the vote bank of Akali Dal, he claimed that everyone will be voting for the AAP not just those who are traditionally Akali Dal or Congress voters.Talking about the party’s vision for Punjab, Chadha said reforms that have been carried out in the national capital will also be carried out in Punjab. In 2017, the AAP had emerged as the main opposition party in the state after winning 20 out of the 117 assembly seats. The Congress had won 77 while an alliance of Shiromani Akali Dal and BJP won 18 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aaps-cm-candidate-in-punjab-will-be-pride-of-state-chadha-101632080162430.html
20-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ensure relief to kin of farmers who lost their lives in agitation: Capt to Channi||A day after he resigned as the chief minister of Punjab, capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday said he was sad that he would not hand over appointment letters to the families of 150 farmers “who had lost their lives” in the ongoing agitation against farm laws even though the government led by him had approved it. He said he was sad that the scheduled event to disburse the appointment letters had to be cancelled and hoped that Charanjit Singh Channi, who the Congress picked on Sunday as the next chief minister, will carry out the task at the earliest to provide relief to the affected families. According to a statement, Amarinder urged the CM-designate to ensure that the state government continues to stand with the beleaguered farmers of Punjab “who have sacrificed their lives in our collective fight for justice”. Amarinder made it clear that he would continue to support the farmers “in their battle for survival and justice”. “Every Punjabi, in fact every Indian, is morally bound to stand with the farmers in their hour of despair,” he said, asserting that even though he was no longer holding the state’s reins, his heart remained with the farmers and their families and he would do everything in his power to ensure that they get their due. According to the statement, Amarinder, whose government had also released over ₹14 crore as compensation to the next of kin of 298 deceased farmers, said he would not allow the sacrifices of India’s ‘annadaatas’ to go waste. “It is the responsibility of every government and political dispensation, be it in Punjab or any other state, as well as the Centre, to ensure that the farmers get their due,” he said. Amrinder resigned as the chief minister of Punjab with less than five months to go for the Assembly polls after a bruising power struggle with state party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, and had said that he felt “humiliated” over the way the party handled the protracted crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ensure-relief-to-kin-of-farmers-who-lost-their-lives-in-agitation-capt-to-channi-101632080042219.html

Nanda had defended Amarinder in a string of criminal cases registered against him during the Parkash Singh Badal-led Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP government between 2007 and 2017. “My appointment as advocate general was co-terminus with his (Amarinder) appointment, and also according to constitutional convention, I have tendered my resignation,” a message sent out by Nanda to the state’s law officers’ team said. Tenure mired in controversies Nanda’s stint as the advocate general has been mired in controversies as it was on his watch that the government suffered major legal setbacks on politically-sensitive sacrilege and police firing cases of 2015 and recently in cases against former director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini. He was criticised by the ruling Congress ministers and leaders, many of them Amarinder’s detractors, for steering clear of personally representing in the key cases in the Punjab and Haryana high court and instead hiring lawyers from Delhi. Both state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and party’s Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh had demanded Nanda’s resignation, accusing him of shoddy legal defence in critical cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/day-after-capt-s-exit-advocate-general-atul-nanda-resigns-101632079923668.html

20-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Twilight in the flyover||The rail tracks seem to extend to the point where the earth touches the sky. Though the earth is pitch dark at this moment in the evening. The sky however has disintegrated into various colours, each shade separated from the other, as if arranged one upon another. The dominantly dark blue is upon a band of light blue, blue is upon orange, orange is upon flaming red. And now an express train enters the scene. It chugs along the tracks, towards the elusive horizon, like a man rushing to claim the rumoured pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.Such are the 6.45 pm impressions you might gather while standing on the west side of the Barakhamba flyover in central Delhi. This vantage point directly overlooks the Shivaji Bridge railway station. Down below, you have a clear view of the six pairs of rail tracks approaching the station’s four platforms. This station is among the city’s smaller stops that hosts the suburban trains. Sometimes long-haul expresses are made to stop here until they are designated their arrival platform in the next destination, just a few minutes ahead—the all-important New Delhi railway station.Despite it being the capital’s heart, the perspective is of an open countryside. This feeling of spaciousness is puzzling, since the city here makes no attempt to hide itself. You clearly see the highrises that circle the Connaught Place shopping district, including the giant national flag fluttering in the Central Park. The tall Lalit Hotel looms next to the bridge. The Bhartiya Janata Party’s central office building seems an arm’s reach away. The bridge is a walking distance from cramped Old Delhi. Yet the area feels secluded. All because of the unhindered view of the sky, that lurks beyond the Shivaji Bridge station. The vastness is so huge that it seems to swallow everything into its nothingness.The unfolding twilight is the most dramatic. The sky colors gradually start to drip into each other. It’s like as if some supernatural being is artfully making an abstract painting more abstract by rubbing the wet canvas with invisible hands. Soon, it’s all dark. The city lights, including the red signals on the rail tracks, pale against the sky’s starless blackness. Some minutes later, one more train chugs in. It slowly comes to a halt at the station. The engine gives a long wail. The prolonged sound travels around, and dies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-twilight-in-the-flyover-101632079561835.html

A five-member committee, chaired by Neeru Katyal Gupta and consisting of general secretary, joint secretary, mess secretary, and finance secretary, was formed to take requisite measures to float the tenders and recommend the best bidder.The tenders were floated on August 26 and were opened in the presence of the five-member committee on September 6. “Later, on September 8, I received a letter signed by the general secretary, joint secretary, mess secretary, finance secretary, bar secretary, and sports secretary recommending the second-highest bidder M/S Daam Food. Thereafter, I received a note from Gupta, informing me that the mess tender committee had bypassed her while making their proposal, and the recommendation was for the lower bid,” said the DC.He added that thereafter, a show-cause notice was issued to all the six signatory executive members on September 9 to explain why they had bypassed the chairman of the mess tender committee and recommended a lower bid.“The replies were received on September 13, and on the request of most of them, a personal hearing was given on September 16 in the presence of the nominated members of the executive committee,” read the order.The order read that that M/s Daam Foods has given the work experience and financials of M/S Roche for their bid and M/S Roche, which served the club as a caterer from May 3, 2016, to November 10, 2018, and had an outstanding bill of ₹91,000, which was settled in ₹70,000, causing a financial loss of ₹21,226 to the club.As no bid was received for the first-floor catering services, the tender process will be repeated under the same committee.

However, this year the Ludhiana administration and police have decided to set up 10 additional temporary parking lots to beat the festive rush. The temporary parking sites were shortlisted by the police, Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA), and municipal corporation (MC) with the help of non governmental organisations and drone surveys. An official, privy to the decision, said temporary parking lots may be set up on vacant GLADA land opposite the Mini Secretariat, near the BL Kapur Memorial Hospital in Daresi, and the vacant GLADA land near the Old Session Chowk. Deliberations are on for the use of the land of the Ludhiana Improvement Trust at the Feroze Gandhi Market, the LIT Complex on Rani Jhansi Road, and the parking area of the LIT Market near Orient Cinema among other sites. Some parking sites are at a distance from the markets, but other means of transportation can be used to reach the shops and visa versa. The decision was taken during the meeting of the local MLAs with the commissioner of police and other administrative officials. Joint commissioner of police (city and traffic) Deepak Pareek said the 10 sites are being cleaned to establish the temporary parking lots. Typically, traffic snarls are witnessed at Model Town, Chaura Bazar, Ghumar Mandi, Daresi and Dugri markets during the festival season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10-temporary-parkings-to-be-set-up-to-beat-festival-rush-in-ludhiana-101632079388975.html

After publicising its schemes in question papers ahead of the upcoming elections, the state government has now inserted politico-religious questions in the Class-12 history exam, inviting flak from the Opposition. In the history exam, which took place on September 17, students were asked “Whose forefathers were blessed by Guru Har Rai?” Of the four options, three included the names of former chief minister of Punjab and Congress leader Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, Kapurthala MLA Rana Gurjit Singh, Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh, while the fourth option was ‘none of them.Politicians outraged Training his guns at state education minister Vijay Inder Singla, AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said he should tender an apology and the person who formulated the questions should be penalised. Taking a sarcastic dig at the ruling dispensation, the AAP leader asked “Why not ask students, which Congress minister was involved in illegal mining or which Congress women CM was booked in a corruption case?”SAD leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal also condemned the move. “The Congress is now resorting to dirty politics to project a clean image of their leaders, which is far from reality. We will stage a protest against this,” said Grewal. Meanwhile, Dharmjit Kohara, a history teacher at a government school and president of Master Cadre Union, Ludhiana, said, “The question is completely out of syllabus. The history syllabus for Class 12 includes events from 1469 to 1849. Exams should not be used as a political tool”. Govt ads in exam papers Teachers alleged that the state government was using school exams as a platform to further their political interests by printing government advertisements in question papers. Recently, an advertisement printed in a Class-5 Punjabi paper had highlighted the state government’s pension scheme and was followed by questions based on the advertisement. “It is surprising to see the government using education for political benefits. I have never seen such a thing in my career ,” said the head of a primary school. A former DPI, schools on the condition of anonymity, termed the act ‘ethically wrong’. Meanwhile, officials from the education department, including Krishan Kumar, secretary, school education, did not respond to several phone calls and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pseb-mid-term-exams-govt-using-question-papers-as-political-tool-teachers-irked-opposition-seeks-apology-101632079381537.html
20-09-2021||Bangalore||Inclusion in 2A category of BC list: Panchamasalis threaten to intensify stir||Leaders and influential seers of the Panchamasali, the largest sub-sect of the Lingayat community, on Sunday reiterated their threat to intensify their struggle to be included in the 2A category of the backward classes list to avail of reservation. Vijayananda Kashappanavar, former legislator and one of the leaders of the Panchamasali agitation, said that BS Yediyurappa lost the top chair because of the curse of the seer, Sri Basava Jaya Mruthyunjaya Swami of the Kudalasangama, who was made to walk over 700 kms for the demand. Kashappanavar is also the national president of the Akhila Bharatha Lingayata Panchamasali Mahasabha.“This is our final struggle,”Kashappanavar said, adding that the community would gherao or surround the Vidhana Soudha if need be to get the government accept to their demand. Yediyurappa had assured to look into the demands when he was chief minister and had sought time to review the matter. The leaders of the community had given the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government time till September 15 and have now said that the members of the community will intensify their struggle from October 1. The statements add to the challenges to the Basavaraj Bommai-led government who appear to have inherited the burden of promises made by his predecessor and have to now deal with rising tempers and manage expectations. “We will restart our satyagraha,” Kashappanavar said. He added that until now the community has continued its struggle in a peaceful manner. “Now our people should listen to us, no? Not everyone is under our control because they are fed up. We are Panchamasalis; if we lose our heads, then there is no listening to anyone,” he said, adding that the struggle could get more fierce. The reservation row in Karnataka has seen dominant and backward caste groups slug it out to get the government to heed to their demands. The Lingayats and Vokkaligas, believed to be the two dominant caste groups in the state, have demanded that the 2015 socio-economic and educational survey not be released. A newly created forum of the extreme backward classes has demanded that the exercise undertaken by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in 2015 be released and Panchamasalis be not included in the 2A list as it would further deprive marginalized groups of the quota pie. The group already nurses a feeling of neglect after the BJP chose Bommai, from the Sadar Lingayat sub-sect of the community, to replace Yediyurappa. The Lingayats have long stood behind the BJP and Yediyurappa but have now threatened to hold the party to its promises of better reservation status. Sri Basava Jaya Mruthyunjaya Swami, the seer of the Kudalasangama, hinted that it was Yediyurappa who deliberately sabotaged the chances of Murugesh Nirani, also a Panchamasali, to become chief minister.Nirani, a loyalist of Yediyurappa, was quick to dismiss the claim made by the seer. “To say that Yediyurappa made me miss a chance to become chief minister is far from the truth,” Nirani said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/inclusion-in-2a-category-of-bc-list-panchamasalis-threaten-to-intensify-stir-101632078962149.html

20-09-2021||Bangalore||Three held over remarks on Mahatma Gandhi||Mangaluru police on Sunday arrested three persons after a few people claiming to be from the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) said that ‘they didn’t even spare Mahatma Gandhi to protect Hindus’. “At the moment, three people have been taken into custody, including Dharmendra (the main accused) and an inquiry is being conducted,” N Shashi Kumar, the Mangaluru city police commissioner said. The arrests come a day after a few people, claiming to be from ABHM held a press conference in Mangaluru, about 351 kms from Bengaluru, where they came down heavily on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in the state for allowing the demolition of Hindu temples. “When we didn’t spare Mahatma Gandhi and killed him to protect Hindus, do you think we will spare you?” Dharmendra, the person who claimed to be the state general secretary of the right-wing group, had said in the address. The statements come days after a video showing the Mysuru district administration demolishing a temple went viral. The Karnataka high court had pulled up authorities for failing to take action against illegal structures built on government land, prompting the Mysuru district administration to act. Kumar said that a person named Lohit Kumar Suvarna had registered a complaint that there were some people who were misusing the name of the right-wing outfit, its letterhead and made controversial remarks against Gandhi and other constitutional authorities. “People who were removed from the group are claiming to be part of the outfit even today and indulging in illegal activities,” Kumar said, referring to the complaint registered by Suvarna. Kumar said that cases were filed under sections 153(A) promoting enmity between groups, 505(2) public mischief, threat to life, forgery, cheating and intent to malign reputation among other serious charges. Even those who attended the press conference would be contacted and their statements will be taken, the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/three-held-over-remarks-on-mahatma-gandhi-101632078843764.html
20-09-2021||Bangalore||On viral video, Sadananda Gowda says it's deep fake; complaint filed||Former union minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader DV Sadananda Gowda on Sunday said that his image was morphed into a video that was going viral online. He said he has filed a complaint with the cybercrime police. “Dear well wishers, a morphed (deep fake) video of mine has been making rounds on social media. I would like to inform that, it is not me in the video, it’s created to malign my impeccable image by my adversaries with vested interest,” Gowda said in his post on Twitter. The tweet comes after a video of a person who appears to be Gowda with an unnamed woman over a video call. Gowda, who is the member of parliament from Bengaluru North, is also the former chief minister of Karnataka. The video is the latest to torment the BJP in Karnataka and further entangling the government in a web of complications. Ramesh Jarkiholi, who had served as Karnataka’s water resources minister in the B.S.Yediyurappa-led government, in March resigned from the cabinet a day after allegations of sexual exploitation surfaced against the legislator from Belagavi. Jarkiholi too had secured an injunction from the courts against publishing, distribution and sharing the contents of a video and audio calls even though he had called it fake. In barely a few days of the Jarkiholi video surfacing, at least six ministers who had defected from the HD Kumaraswamy-led Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition secured injunctions against publishing, circulating or sharing any content which were obscene or derogatory. Dr K Sudhakar, one of the six who did secure an injunction, had later drawn ire from all legislators when he, in March, suggested that all 225 members of the legislative assembly face an inquiry into their personal lives. Fire-brand BJP leader Basanagouda Yatna, a fierce critic of Yediyurappa, had alleged that there were “CDs” of the 78-year-old. Even BJP leaders hit out at the suggestion of Sudhakar, further adding to the growing tensions within the party. Gowda was left out of the union cabinet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July. The former union minister said that he has filed a complaint with the cyber crime police and that he had faith that the culprits would be caught. “Also, as per the injunction order of the court, anyone forwarding/uploading the content will be punishable as per the relevant sections of the law. If you know of anyone doing the same, kindly inbox me,” he said in his post. Gowda had secured an injunction in July. One woman BJP worker had levelled allegations of sexual harassment against Gowda in 2018 at the height of the Me Too movement. Gowda’s son was also accused of rape in 2014 when an actress filed a complaint and a day later stated that the duo had married secretly and that the family accept her as the daughter-in-law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/created-to-malign-image-sadananda-rejects-viral-video-101632078842162.html

20-09-2021||Chandigarh||A grassroots leader who rose through the ranks rapidly||Congress leader Charanjit Singh Channi is set to be Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister, barely five months before the state assembly elections are due early next year. The three-time MLA from Chamkaur Sahib constituency is set to be sworn in on Monday morning.Channi was unanimously elected as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party of Punjab following a flurry of consultations throughout the day. The development comes a day after Captain Amarinder Singh’s sudden exit from the state’s top post, after months of infighting between him and Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.Channi was born in Punjab’s Bhajauli village near Kurali in 1963. His family was settled in Malaysia where his father worked, but they returned to India in 1955 and settled in Kharar town of SAS Nagar district of Punjab.A grassroots-level leader, Channi entered politics at the age of 20 and became a councillor for the first time in 1992.“Heartfelt gratitude and thanks to the top leadership for appointing me Chief Minister of Punjab...I will always work for the welfare of the people and to give new energy and momentum to the sustainable development journey of the state,” the 58-year-old said in a Twitter post.His political journey began in 2003, after he was elected as the president of the Kharar municipal council, and has since risen through the ranks. He first contested as an independent candidate in 2007 and won from Chamkaur Sahib assembly constituency. He joined the Congress in 2012 and was re-elected as legislator from the same seat.Channi was the leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly from 2015 to 2016 and was made a minister in the Amarinder Singh Cabinet in March 2017.The Congress’s decision to name Channi, who belongs to the Ramdasia Sikh community, assumes significance as poll-bound Punjab has a population of nearly 31.9% from the community.The Shiromani Akali Dal, which has joined hands with the BSP, has already announced that the deputy chief minister post will be given to a Dalit if it wins the assembly polls.The 58-year-old held the portfolios of Technical Education, Industrial Training, Employment Generation and Tourism and Cultural Affairs in the Singh-led cabinet.Passionate about bolstering his academic qualifications, Channi is currently enrolled for a doctorate course in Panjab University on the Congress party’s history and evolution and holds degrees in LLB, MBA.As a minister, Channi bemused everyone when he climbed an elephant in the courtyard of a government bungalow allotted to him, following the advice of an astrologer. Earlier, before taking over as a cabinet minister, he changed the direction of the entrance of the bungalow.He has also been a vocal critic of the government on the issues related to Dalits like the representation of Scheduled Caste in senior government posts.Channi was the first to articulate the Congress ministers’ grouse about bureaucrats’ dominance in the Amarinder-led government and seek a better representation of elected representatives. Three months ago, when the state’s case on the sacrilege and police firing cases of 2015 during the Akali-BJP rule fell through in the Punjab and Haryana high court, Channi made a common cause with Amarinder Singh’s detractors in the cabinet and demanded action against the perpetrators in the politically-sensitive cases as was promised by the Congress in the run-up to 2017 assembly polls. As the ranks of Amarinder-baiters grew, Channi firmly aligned himself with state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, who later became Singh’s nemesis and returned the favour by supporting Channi’s name as CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-grassroots-leader-who-rose-through-the-ranks-rapidly-101632078449664.html

We hope we will receive more vaccines from the union government tomorrow, and we will immediately distribute it to re-start vaccination.”In Chennai, vaccination was conducted in streets, beaches, shopping malls and public spaces. Simultaneously home vaccination for senior citizens above the age of 80 and people with disabilities also continued. Stalin inspected the drive in Chennai. Previously on September 12, a Sunday, Tamil Nadu had conducted a 12-hour mega vaccination drive on Sunday that surpassed its target to inoculate 20-lakh people, with 2.9 million people receiving a shot against the Covid-19 disease. At that time, the state had 2.9 million vaccines in hand and had conducted the drive across 40,000 camos. Tamil Nadu had hoped they could pitch this achievement to the union government to increase the supply of vaccines but that did not happen. This time it had only half the number of vaccine doses (about 11-lakh of Covishield and 5-lakh of Covaxin), and the state conducted only 20,000 camps, and the target was to administer vaccines to 1.5 million people. Last week, Subramanian had written to the union health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya seeking additional vaccines. He sought 5 million more vaccines for the past week--five-lakh vaccines a day for six days and 20-lakh for the mega drive on Sunday. The state health department is distributing vaccines to all districts based on their population and vaccination performance indicators. There is also a special focus along the 9 districts bordering Kerala which is seeing a high number of Covid-19 cases and is also dealing with Nipah and Zika, putting Tamil Nadu on alert. Tamil Nadu however is hovering around 1500-1600 new cases of Covid-19 daily but officials do not want to let their guard down. “Vaccination is the only way to prevent a third wave,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “As of today, in September alone we have crossed the milestone of vaccinating one-crore people. Since January, government facilities alone have vaccinated more than 4-crore people, added. “We are slated to receive the next batch of vaccines only on the 22nd, but we have approached the union government to send us supplies immediately tomorrow,” Radhakrishnan told reporters on Sunday. “But this is a good position to be in. From January to March, when we have vaccine stocks, the public wasn’t coming forward to take it. We have also asked for more vaccines based on our higher population as compared to the other states.”Tamil Nadu’s vaccination story started from absolute hesitancy due to fear of side effects, among other factors. The perception began to change only during May and June when the second wave of Covid-19 had peaked, and the state was under duress much like other regions due to a shortage in medical oxygen. But vaccination numbers were still low but this time officials said that it was due to a shortage in supply. But from July onwards, there has been a steady supply of vaccines from the union government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tnvaccinates-1-6-million-in-a-day-halts-drive-after-running-out-of-stock-101632078543542.html

Counting for the pending 88 ZPTCs and 1504 MPTCs was underway, when the reports last came in, according to the state election commission.The main opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) won only three ZPTCs and 675 MPTCs. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its alliance Jana Sena drew blank in zilla parishads, but won 23 and 85 seats in the mandal parishad elections.An official statement from the YSRCP said the results reflected the endorsement of people’s faith in the governance of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.The party said the ZPTC and MPTC results had also indicated doom for TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu in his assembly constituency Kuppam in Chittoor district. “The YSRC bagged all the four ZPTCs and 62 out of 65 MPTCs in Kuppam. In the gram panchayat elections held in February this year, too, YSRC had won 75 out of 89 gram panchayats,” the official statement said.State panchayat raj and rural development minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said the chief minister had gained the people’s trust once again by fulfilling election promises. “It clearly shows the TDP has lost the people’s support,” he said.However, TDP spokesman and former minister S Chandramohan Reddy ridiculed the claim of the YSRC stating that it had achieved a landslide victory. He reminded that the TDP had boycotted the local body elections after its representation against the election irregularities fell on deaf ears.“It is an open secret that the ruling YSRCP resorted to threats, intimidation and forced unanimous results in many places. They misused the police and the official machinery without any shame,” he said.There are in all 660 ZPTC seats and 10,047 MPTC seats in the state, of which around 126 ZPTC and 2,371 MPTC seats were elected unanimously in March 2020, when the election process to the local bodies commenced.The polling for the remaining seats, supposed to be held in the last week of March 2020, was put on hold by former state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar due to nationwide lockdown owing to the Coronavirus pandemic.The process for the conduct of elections to the remaining seats resumed on April 2 this year, a day after new state election commissioner Neelam Sawhney assumed charge.The polling for 515 ZPTC seats and 7,219 MPTC seats was held on April 8. In all, 12,955,980 voters exercised their franchise. The polling could not be held for eight ZPTC and 355 MPTC seats due to court cases, while it was withheld in 11 ZPTCs and 81 MPTCs due to the death of the candidates.The counting of votes for the ZPTC and MPTC elections was supposed to be held on April 10 but was stalled by a single-judge bench of the state high court acting on a petition filed by the TDP and Jana Sena parties.Later, on May 21, the bench ordered the cancellation of the ZPTC and MPTC, on the ground that the SEC had not followed the mandatory four-week model code of conduct to be in force between the date of announcement of schedule and the conduct of the elections, as per the Supreme Court directions.The SEC challenged the single-judge bench verdict before a division bench comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice N Jayasurya. The SEC argued that the Supreme Court rule for following a four-week model code of conduct cannot apply to the local body elections.It further contended that the four-week rule was not followed for municipal elections and gram panchayat elections held in April this year. For municipal elections, there was a gap of only 22 days and for panchayat elections, it was only 26 days.After hearing the arguments, the division bench of the high court on September 16 struck down the single-judge orders and permitted the SEC to go ahead with the counting of votes for the ZPTC and MPTC elections||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/landslide-victory-for-yscrp-in-andhra-local-body-polls-101632078542123.html

The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday had decided to continue to keep petrol and diesel out of the uniform national tax regime, besides taking a number of other taxation related decisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/petroleum-under-gst-panneerselvam-slams-dmk-govt-for-opposition-101632078484873.html

Speaking to this reporter over the phone from Delhi, Alphons said his observation is nothing to do with the Pala Bishop’s latest statement. “Appeasement politics is at its high in Kerala. Both fronts, ruling Left Democratic Front and opposition Congress-led UDF, turn a blind eye to growing Wahabism and Salafism in Kerala. All are after vote bank. If the situation continues like this little Kerala will be another Afghanistan in a decade or so,” said the bureaucrat-turned politician. He said radicalization of a section of a particular community is sowing seeds of such tendency in other communities also, and it is really dangerous. “Kerala always remained a global example of communal harmony. Different religions lived together for centuries without any rift or tension. But things are not rosy now. ‘We are right others are wrong’ tendency is fast catching up. What is disturbing is that saner elements are being silenced by extremist ideologies in the Muslim community,” he said. “I have many Muslim friends, and my two sons got married from different communities. Marriage is an individual choice. But if you marry girls from other communities feigning love and to push them to war-torn areas, it can’t be called brotherhood or amity, it is terror,” he said adding, he agreed that it is wrong to blame a community for the wrongdoings of a minuscule section. But he said, feigning ignorance and whitewash all such sinister activities are more dangerous. “It is true, Talibanization is taking place in certain pockets of Kerala. Even they changed the dress code of women in north Malabar. I was shocked to hear the way some leaders justified the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. Nobody is talking about the plight of women and children there. Millions of people are on the verge of starvation,” he said adding major parties are silent over radicalization fearing vote bank. He said when Pala Bishop Mar Joseph Kallaranghatt said about “narcotic jihad” all were busy attacking him and nobody asked him what prompted him to say this. “It is a fact radicalization assumed a dangerous proportion in Kerala. You can’t turn a blind eye towards it. Instead of addressing this, all are busy shooting the messenger,” he said. Addressing a religious congregation in one of the churches in Kottayam the Bishop had said Catholic girls and youth are becoming victims of “narcotic jihad” and decried authorities for turning a blind eye towards it. The Bishop’s controversial statement has triggered a war of words between different communities and political parties and they are yet to settle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-can-become-afghanistan-in-10-years-says-former-minister-alphons-101632078483512.html

The state reported 19, 653 fresh Covid-19 cases with a test positivity rate of 17.35 per cent and 152 fatalities, the health ministry said. The state decided to conduct a seroprevalence survey in the first week of August, and samples were collected from all districts to get an indication of the exact population exposed to the virus. According to the earlier survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research, Kerala has the lowest presence of antibodies at 44.4 per cent in comparison to Madhya Pradesh, where it stood at 75.9 per cent. The government has also decided to stop rapid antigen tests for Covid- 19 in private laboratories. They will be allowed to conduct in government laboratories only in an emergency at the discretion of a medical practitioner. The state completed 89 per cent Covid vaccination. “We have vaccinated 89 per cent with a single dose, and 36.7 got the second dose also. We are fast moving towards our goal of cent per cent vaccination,” said state health minister Veena George.

The well-planned, zero-waste discharge township is located in Greater Noida, along the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, said officials on Sunday.People can apply for plots under this scheme at www.iitgnl.com, they added.Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer (CEO) of IITGL, said, “People can download the application form from the official website and submit it after attaching documents mentioned in it. Eligible companies will get plots following a lucky draw.”Companies getting at least 60 out of 100 will be eligible to take part in the allotment process. The marks will be given on the basis of criteria fixed and mentioned in the brochure. Companies have to fulfill conditions such as financial strength, work experience in industrial projects, net worth, and turn over, among others, said the officials.It is an open-ended scheme and will continue till all the plots are allotted. The allotment process is scheduled from October 1 to October 16, 2021. “Plots allotted from October 1 to 16 will be removed from the list, and the remaining ones will be allotted then on.

A group of men on Saturday allegedly pulled down several such posters, soon after members of the Gurjar community claimed that Bhoj was a Gurjar king but the word ‘Gurjar’ was missing from all posters. Shyam Singh Bhati, GB Nagar president of Akhil Bharatiya Veer Gurjar Mahasabha, said everyone knows that Samrat Mihir Bhoj belonged to the Gurjar community. “There are several schools, colleges, and parks named after him. The UP chief minister is going to unveil a Bhoj’s statue at a Dadri college on Wednesday. But local MLA Tejpal Nagar and other BJP leaders had dropped ‘Gurjar’ from posters to appease a section of other community, who claims Bhoj was a Rajput king,” he said. Some people captured the pulling down of posters on camera and shared the video on social networking sites. The CM is expected to unveil the Bhoj’s statue at Mihir Bhoj PG College in Dadri on September 22.Dadri MLA Nagar has denied the allegations. “The CM will unveil a statue of Samrat Mihir Bhoj, and also lay foundation of a government girls inter college, a science lab at the Dadri college, and a community hall in the neighbourhood. Some people are involved in pulling down the posters. They will only comment on why they are damaging the posters. The statue’s name plate bears ‘Gurjar Samrat Mihir Bhoj’,” he said. Meanwhile, the Dadri police have registered two FIRs for allegedly bringing down the posters which bear photos of Samrat Mihir Bhoj, CM Yogi Adityanath, MLA Nagar, and others. According to Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer (SHO) of Dadri police station, Satyendra Kumar, a resident of Dadri, filed a complaint against a person for damaging the poster outside a school in Dadri on Saturday. Based on the complaint of local residents Lalit Nagar and Ravindra Kumar, another case was registered against five persons, including Shyam Singh Bhati, for damaging the posters, the SHO said, adding that nobody has been arrested.The cases have been registered under sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation, with intent to cause riot), 505 (1)(B) (public mischief) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code. “We are investigating the matter,” Tripathi said. Meanwhile, members of Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena on Sunday held a meeting in Piyawali village in Greater Noida where they claimed that Bhoj was a Rajput king. Sena’s UP unit leader Rana Brajesh Pratap Singh said that they will protest any name change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/row-erupts-over-king-mihir-bhoj-s-posters-in-dadri-ahead-of-cm-visit-101632077645662.html

These turtles were confiscated and two offenders detained in Hyderabad in early August. The arrested poachers had confessed to have poached these turtles from river Gomti near Lucknow. The recovered turtles were temporarily housed in Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad for safe custody till the legal proceedings got over. Pawan Kumar Sharma, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) of Uttar Pradesh, said that seeking technical assistance of TSA experts, the Telangana forest department was contacted to hand over the turtles to the state so that they could be rehabilitated in the wild without any delay and maximum survival could be ensured. Sharma then directed the chief conservator of forests( Awadh region) RK Singh and divisional forest officer (DFO) Lucknow Ravi Kumar Singh to complete the required paper work between both states, seeking assistance of TSA experts of which further coordinated with Wildlife Conservation Society- India Easternghat. Besides legal proceedings, a rapid health check-up, standard packaging and translocation of turtles were executed under technical supervision of TSA experts and they were airlifted to Lucknow through Air India, which has been the TSA’s trusted partner for translocating endangered wildlife for over 7 years.“Technical experts kept monitoring the health of the turtles during translocation,” shared Sharma. After a journey of 8 hours via Delhi, the turtles were received by Alok Pandey, sub divisional officer, Lucknow, range officer, city and Arunima Singh, biologist of TSA in Lucknow. DFO Ravi Singh shared that the turtles’ health would be assessed and they would be quarantined for 29 days at UPFD/TSA Laboratory for Aquatic Biology at Kukrail Gharial Centre before being rehabilitated at safer locations in the Gomti within Lucknow district in mid October. Dr Shailendra Singh, director, TSA India, Lucknow said that these species of turtles were poached to cater to the demand of illegal pet trade as they looked very pretty and people kept them in aquariums. Both species are sympatric, found in the Gomti river and associated wetlands. One prefers flowing water and the other stagnant pools near and within the river. Arunima Singh said that P tecta belonged to schedule 1 of India Wildlife Protection Act 1972. To note, the first such repatriation by the UP forest department and TSA was in 2015 when both organisations flew over 500 Spotted Pond Turtles from Maharastra for rehabilitation in the wild. Lauding the efforts of all officials, staff of the forest department and TSA experts, Sharma said that “such bold decisions and coordinated efforts between states will set good examples to timely repatriate rescued wildlife where origin is known.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rescued-turtles-flown-back-home-to-lucknow-for-rehabilitation-101632077522370.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||2 of alleged terror module were sent to Pak for training: Probe||Delhi Police officers investigating an alleged Pakistan-backed terror module, which was busted last Tuesday, have said that at least two of the six suspects were chosen for training in Pakistan owing to their good academic background.An officer who is privy to the investigation said Zeeshan Qamar and Osama alias Sami were sent to Pakistan to receive training in handling explosives and planning. Zeeshan was pursuing his MBA in finance through distance learning; and Osama was a final year graduation student at Allahabad University. The other four suspects were school dropouts or illiterates, which would have made it difficult for them to pass off as someone else in disguise, the officer said.On Tuesday, Delhi police announced the arrest six people -- Jaan Mohammad Shaikh (47), Osama alias Sami (22), Moolchand alias Saaju (47), Zeeshan Qamar (28), Mohamed Abu Bakr (23), and Mohammed Amir Javed (31) – and claimed to have averted serial blasts in at least three states and targeted killings. The six men were arrested on Monday from Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.“Only Zeeshan and Osama are educated and could pass off as different persons in disguise. Zeeshan completed his B Com from Allahabad University. He was married recently during the lockdown. Compared to the these two, Jaan Mohammad is Class 5 dropout; Abu Bakr studied up to Class 7; Moolchand failed in Class 12 and Amir Javed studied only Arabic till high school. It appears that these four were to be used merely as foot soldiers. Meanwhile Osama and Zeeshan were trained to make improvised explosive devices, conduct reconnaissance and plan the blasts, the first officer, who asked not to be named, said.Zeeshan’s father, Qamaruz Zaman in his statement to reporters a day after Zeeshan’s arrest denied that his son had gone to Pakistan. He also denied his son’s involvement with Pakistani agencies, and said that nobody in his family has any criminal record.Delhi Police on Tuesday claimed that Zeeshan and Osama were taken to Pakistan from Oman on April 22 via sea route. Police have claimed that the serial blasts were planned by Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence(ISI). Police alleged that the two men were trained in a town called Jioni (near Gwadar port, Pakistan). Police said that of the three men, there were two who wore military uniform.All the six men are currently in 14-days judicial custody. On Monday (September 20), it will be a week since police started questioning the six men.A second police officer, who too asked not to be named, said it appeared Delhi resident Osama is one of the key men among the six.“Osama’s uncle Baidur-Rehman was arrested in Uttar Pradesh. Osama’s father, who is not in India, too is a suspect. It was Osama’s uncle Baidur, who handed RDX to Zeeshan. Baidur and Zeeshan were also partners in the dates business that they had started recently. Osama and Zeeshan were also the only ones to be trained in Pakistan. Another arrested suspect, Amir Javed is also a relative of Osama. We have another week to interrogate them and get more details,” said a second officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/terror-module-two-educated-suspects-were-sent-to-pakistan-for-training-says-delhi-police-101632077405771.html

On September 6, the Delhi government confirmed that it will increase this funding to ₹2,000 per student this year as announced during the state budget in March this year.On Thursday, the state directorate of education (DoE) issued directives for teachers and principals on implementing the programme in the city’s public schools for higher secondary students. “All participating students can receive seed money of ₹2,000 per student. Teams will use this seed money with a clear objective to either earn profit or create social impact,” the department said in its circular.Schools have been asked to ensure that brainstorming, research, presentation of business ideas, and finalisation of projects are done according to the prescribed timetable, since the seed money disbursal process will be completed by October 15. While brainstorming and team formation should be done over one to two periods each, discussing business ideas should be completed in three to four periods, and developing the idea after research should be done in another three to four periods, according to the timetable. The project should be implemented in four weeks of receiving the seed fund.Students have also been asked to define if they are designing a product or a service, decide upon the budget, build the product, create a marketing plan, and prepare a presentation for a school panel.All Class 11 and 12 students will be eligible to participate and pitch their business ideas, after which 1,000 teams will participate in inter-school competitions at the district and state level. “The Top 100 projects are provided an opportunity to showcase their business ideas in an expo style exhibition. The top 10 teams will get to pitch their ideas to potential investors,” the circular added.The education department has also prepared videos to orient the students on different aspects of the programme including developing the business idea, initial presentation, refining and implementing it, and school-level presentation.Sapna Yadav, director of the EMC project, said, “During the pilot conducted earlier this year, we realised students have ideas for business-based profitable ventures and innovative ideas and services for social impact and change. We also saw that students had critical feedback on other projects which encouraged us to go for peer review model for their projects this time. We’ve also made videos explaining the idea behind these exercises and plan to share it with parents as well.”Students can form teams and pool their seed money to start the project. For now, a maximum of 10 students can come together as a team. After formation of team and selection of team leader by the students, these teams will work to come up with one business idea which needs to be “useful, practical, profit or social impact, and growth possible.”“Team will discuss these and shortlist two to three problems or needs, that the whole team would like to pursue. Teams can identify if they have any special talents and business ideas which can be built around them,” DoE circular said.After identifying the problem, students have been asked to identify the target group and “think of solutions (business ideas) to address the problems.” The team members have also been asked to discuss the solutions with the target group before working on it. The directive asks has a list of questions on the target groups and other areas that students need to answer to their teachers to achieve clarity on the project. After finalizing the business idea, students will be required to give a presentation on their idea to the class and receive feedback. Teachers have been instructed to allow two “positive” things about the presentation and “one area of improvement.”Schools have also been asked to ensure safety protocols. “Students should keep their parents and teachers updated about their movements and whereabouts. Students should not go to a stranger’s house or any other closed unfamiliar space. Limit your meetings to a public or familiar location,” the DOE directive stated.Heads of schools are also asked to orient parents on the programme and obtain NOCs from them by October 15. Principals can also rope in local entrepreneurs, alumni, and students pursuing management or entrepreneurship courses for their higher education as business coaches to guide the students||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-outlines-business-ideas-plan-for-students-in-delhi-public-schools-part-of-entrepreneuship-mindset-curriculum-101632077341985.html

20-09-2021||Delhi||Lenovo Smarter Ed Conclave: Technology a great enabler, will change education: Union education secretary Amit Khare||The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on education, the role played by technology in aiding learning, challenges of digital divide, and the changes envisaged by the National Education Policy (NEP) — these were some of the key issues that thought leaders, policymakers, educators, and industry experts deliberated upon during a two-day education conclave that ended on Friday. Focused on the road map for the future of learning with technology and the new order of education, the conclave saw wide-ranging discussions on a gamut of issues pertinent to the country’s education landscape. Presented by Hindustan Times, the Lenovo Smarter Ed Conclave saw discussions on the New Education Policy (NEP), the digital divide brought to the fore by the shift to online learning during the pandemic, developments in education technology, upskilling teachers, and encouraging interactions with decision-makers across schools and institutions of higher education. Policymakers and educators also discussed government policies, as they emphasised the need to focus on upgrading the education sector with innovative tools and ideas. Amit Khare, secretary, Union ministry of education, on Friday, said that the spread of technology usage during the pandemic had coincided with the introduction of the NEP and together, the two would aid the shift to a technology-based learning experience. Calling NEP a forward-looking policy, he said that it was being implemented gradually to avoid disruption, and would be rolled out based on the accreditation of universities and credential of institutes. “NEP came into action in July 2020, the pandemic was in the air, and a large wave of technology took over. Due to the pandemic, the use of technology has spread at a much faster rate. It’s a positive development and needs to be leveraged. NEP is bringing the government and the private sector together and is enabling teachers to adapt to technology,” he said. Khare said that while there were issues pertaining to the digital divide and the lack of devices, technology was a great enabler and would change the face of education. Calling NEP a transformative policy, Khare said that it encouraged critical thinking with a focus on employability and entrepreneurship. “Over the next few decades, the landscape will keep changing. The skills that we impart today may not remain relevant in the next decade. Therefore, a spirit of critical thinking is required and that is what the policy brings about. It will encourage innovation,” he said He said that the policy will empower citizens and while the results will take a few years to show, the policy was forward-looking. He said that the government was implementing NEP in a phased manner because it did not want disruptive change. Karnataka is the first state in India to implement the National Education Policy (NEP). State’s higher education minister Dr C N Ashwath Narayan said that the policy facilitates effective integration of technology in pedagogy. He said that while there were challenges, the state was well placed particularly after the Covid-19. “In the backdrop of emerging technologies and bridging digital divide, NEP was much awaited for the country and system, particularly to have a better future in the 21st century. There is a lot of lacuna in learning, because it is working in silos and we are not trying to integrate with the industry. There’s a disconnect between academics, industry and a complete mismatch particularly with regard to research and innovation. Probably, the one way it can happen is through education, innovation and technology,” said Narayan. While laying emphasis on the future of education, Richard Henderson, director, Global Education Solutions, Lenovo, said virtual education will be a key component of learning in future. He said that the remote and blended learning model required technology and thus, it was crucial to build tools that allowed continuous learning. “Immersive learning is here to stay and helps in engaging students. We need to re-train teachers and students to use different tools focused on education continuity,” said Henderson. Dr Rukmini Banerji, CEO, Pratham Education Foundation, said that besides technology-driven engagement in urban elite schools, it was important to increase engagement between parents and teachers in public schools and built a personal connection. Pointing out to the different experiences of teaching in private and government schools, she said that it was important to look at the present and the future simultaneously while taking cognizance of the challenges of the digital divide and accesses to devices. “We need to think about the issues of connectivity and devices in a more coherent manner as a country. In our experience, we have seen positive results where groups of children or communities have shared devices. In the future, we could imagine a library of shared devices which groups of children can access,” said Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lenovo-smarter-ed-conclave-technology-a-great-enabler-will-change-education-union-education-secretary-amit-khare-101632077102110.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||Key suspect arrested in murder of former J&K legislative council member Tarlochan Singh Wazir||New Delhi: Delhi Police on Sunday said they have arrested one of the two key suspects in connection with the murder of Tarlochan Singh Wazir, 67-year-old former member of Jammu & Kahsmir (J&K) legislative council and a senior National Conference leader from Jammu.Harmeet Singh,61, was arrested by the Delhi Police’s special cell from Jammu on Sunday morning. The officers said the other key suspect, Harpreet Singh Khalsa, is still at large. One pistol and a cartridge were recovered from Harmeet. The police also recovered a pen that Harmeet used to write a suicide note allegedly under pressure from Harpreet, the police said.Earlier, the police arrested two persons –Balbir Singh alias Billa,67, and Rajender Chaudhary alias Raju Ganja, 33, in connection with the murder of Wazir, whose decomposed body was found in Harpreet’s rented flat at Basai Darapur near Moti Nagar in west Delhi on September 9. All the three arrested men are from Jammu, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav.Although the motive behind Wazir’s murder is still unclear, and could be ascertained only after the arrest of Harpreet, initial interrogation of Harmeet has revealed that he was instigated by Harpreet to kill Wazir. Harpreet told Harmeet that Wazir planned to kill his son and other family members, and that he had already dispatched gangsters from Punjab and Haryana to Jammu to murder his kin. On Harpreet’s instigation, Harmeet shot Wazir in his head in the Basai Darapur flat. The gun used in the crime was also supplied by Harpreet, said DCP Yadav.Police said the murder took place on September 3, the day Wazir was scheduled to board a flight to Canada to attend a family function. He came to Delhi on a flight from Jammu on September 2, and was staying at Harpreet’s flat. Wazir’s decomposed body was found in the locked flat on September 9, after his family members in Jammu received a call from his mobile phone number with the caller claiming that he has killed the former politician. Thereafter, Wazir’s phone was switched off and its last location was traced to Delhi. Wazir’s family approached the Jammu police, who informed their counterparts in Delhi.A murder case was registered and the investigation was handed over to the crime branch. Since Harpreet was missing, he was on the list of suspects. The police spotted Harmeet, Balbir and Rajender in the CCTV footage from around the flat. .On Sunday, the special cell team stationed in Jammu got information that Harmeet will meet someone near the Jammu border. The team reached there and caught him. He is being brought to Delhi, officers said.Three years ago, a police officer said quoting Harmeet’s disclosures, differences arose between Wazir and several members of a local gurdwara over a calendar, which was slated to be launched with the photograph of Guru Naka Sahib. Harmeet was an office bearer, but was removed on recommendation of Wazir. This led to an enmity between Wazir and Harmeet, the officer said.On August 22, Harmeet came to Delhi to get his son’s Canada visa and stayed at Harpreet’s flat. Eight days later, Wazir called Harpreet and told him about his Delhi visit on September 2. Harpreet asked Harmeet to shift to a nearby hotel as Wazir may not like to live in the same flat with him.On September 3, Harpreet went to the hotel room and told Harmeet about Wazir’s plan to kill his son and other family members in Jammu. Harpreet said Raju Ganja heard Wazir planning the murders. Harpreet instigated Harmeet again the same evening, said DCP Yadav.“Both left the hotel room and reached the flat, where Harmeet hid inside a room. The other two men also arrived there. Wazir was sleeping when Harpreet gave Harmeet a pistol, and the latter shot him in the head. Thereafter, they locked the flat and fled,” added the DCP.On September 9, Harpreet and Harmeet reached Gurdwara Fatehgarh. Harpreet forced him to write a three-page suicide note, sign it and put a thumb impression. Next day, they reached Jammu, where Harpreet posted the note on Facebook, before they parted ways, the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/key-suspect-arrested-in-murder-of-former-j-k-legislative-council-member-tarlochan-singh-wazir-101632077041962.html

Last year Kerala was ranked second after Andhra Pradesh. According to the report of the CFPB, the state fingerprint bureau cracked 675 criminal cases followed by Karnataka 517 while Andhra Pradesh stood third with 412 cases. The report also carried a special mention about the brilliant work carried out by the state fingerprint bureau and police in cracking the sensational snake bite murder in Kollam in south Kerala last year. “It is ample proof of the hard work of the state fingerprints bureau backed by technology leveraged effectively for crime prevention and detection. Officers of the bureau assisted by the AFIS software put up a stellar performance in becoming the first,” said state additional director general of police Manoj Abraham, an expert in cyber security. The country has a Central Finger Print Bureau and every state has its state bureaus that help in the investigation process by using fingerprint science. Fingerprint evidence are most scientific and foolproof. The job of a fingerprint expert is to develop chance prints left by criminals at the crime scene and to match them with the fingerprints in the database of convicts. When the investigation begins at a crime scene, a finger expert is first to visit the spot to closely observe the site. The expert then develops the chance prints left by criminals at the scene. The collected chance fingerprints are then matched with the fingerprints database. This helps identify if the crime was carried out by someone who is already in the records of the bureau. There is also a National Automated Finger Prints Identification System (NAFIS) to streamline the countrywide process for the database. The report carried a special mention about the way the police team cracked the sensational murder of 25-year-old Uthra in 2020. Initially, it was dismissed as a mere snake bite case but police and parents got suspicious as this was the second snake bite that proved fatal. She received the fatal bite when she was undergoing treatment for the first bite. Later, police arrested her husband P Sooraj and a local snake handler who provided a cobra to him. During the investigation, it was found that Sooraj had bought a cobra from the snake handler after paying him ₹10,000. He also got the necessary training from the handler. He reportedly took it to Uthra’s house in Anchal, where she had been undergoing treatment at her parents’ place since the first incident. The police said after Uthra fell asleep, Sooraj allegedly took out the snake from the bottle and threw it on her. He kept awake all night to ensure that it did not bite him. He left the room in the morning and started reading a newspaper in the verandah. Uthra’s mother found her daughter unconscious in the morning. She was rushed to a hospital where doctors said she died of a snake bite. The case is on trial stage and police recreated the entire incident through digital and dummy presentation. The cracking of theft in India’s first indigenous built aircraft carrier INS Vikrant two years ago also found mention in the report. The accused, two painters working in the ship, were netted after matching their fingerprints taken at the time of employing them. The National Investigation Agency arrested them last year from north India.

20-09-2021||Gurugram||Naidu in Gurugram: Farming is backbone of our country, culture||There is a need for a continuous dialogue between the farmers and the government, and the interests of the agriculturists should never be mixed with politics, Vice-President (VP) M Venkaiah Naidu said during the launch of a set of works on the life and writings of prominent Haryanvi farmer leader, Sir Chhotu Ram. Naidu credited Ram for major agricultural reforms in the erstwhile province of Punjab. Referring to Sir Chhotu Ram’s contributions, Naidu said that he was instrumental in making laws that freed farmers from the exploitation of moneylenders, and vicious debt cycle. He also got the mandis formed at the local level so that farmers could set the right price for their produce, Naidu said. Naidu released five volumes, titled Sir Chhotu Ram: Writings and Speeches, brought out by the Haryana Academy of History and Culture, at the Apparel House in Sector 44. Addressing a gathering of around 300 people, due to restricted entry, Naidu said there is a need to develop an open market system to stop the exploitation of farmers. “We need to develop an integrated approach towards rural economy to ensure income security for everyone,” he said. Naidu also said that agriculture in India is not treated as a business, but as the basis of Indian culture and that the government is taking effective steps in the interest of farmers. “Farming is the backbone of Indian economy and if the villages remain underdeveloped, the country cannot progress,” he said. Naidu also said that Sir Chhotu Ram played a key role in setting up the Bhakra and Nangal dams, which have had a transformative effect on agriculture in this region. He also said that many freedom fighters and great leaders did not get due recognition and called for more efforts to spread their work. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, speaking at the event, said that to realise Sir Chhotu Ram’s dream of upliftment of farmers and poor, the Prime Minister has resolved to make agriculture profitable and make farmers prosperous. Sir Chhotu Ram’s grandson and former union minister, Birender Singh and former CM Om Prakash Chautala also attended the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/naidu-in-gurugram-farming-is-backbone-of-our-country-culture-101632076566716.html
20-09-2021||Gurugram||NH-48 in Gurugram: Over 3,000 truck drivers penalised for not adhering to lane driving||Over 3,000 truck drivers were penalised between September 3 and 18 in a special drive held by the Gurugram traffic police to enforce lane driving on National Highway-48 (NH-48) and ensure that heavy vehicles are driven on designated lanes, officials said. The drive was held on a 40-kilometre section of the highway, between Sirhaul toll and Bilaspur Kalan.Police officials said that this is the first such drive conducted to check lane driving.The deputy commissioner of police (DCP) for traffic, Ravinder Singh Tomar, said that the drive was held after it was observed last month that heavy vehicles, allowed to ply between 10pm and 6am, caused traffic jams on the highway by plying on all lanes of the main carriageway.According to Tomar, “practically, none of the heavy vehicle drivers were abiding with the left lane driving rule.” A violation of the rules invites a penalty of ₹5,000.“Our marshalls on ground realised that trucks, dumpers, mixtures and buses were not driving on the left-most carriageway as they do on the NH-48 part falling under Delhi. This was resulting in accidents and congestion. We first started with an awareness programme, erecting signs across the highways, after which the heavy vehicle drivers were penalised starting September 3, to ensure they maintain lane discipline in future,” Tomar said.Tomar said that the main rationale behind the drive was to check accidents, haphazard driving and ensuring traffic moves in a streamlined manner.“Since the launch of the drive, the situation on NH-48 has improved drastically. There has been 70-80% improvement in traffic movement. In the pilot phase of the drive, we are only covering the NH-48 stretch as it has the highest movement of heavy vehicles. From next month, we will cover other major roads across the city,” Tomar said.Tomar said that on all national highways, the leftmost lanes are reserved for the heaviest and slowest moving vehicles, the middle lanes for movement of light vehicles, while the rightmost lane is used for speeding vehicles and for overtaking.Around 12,000-15,000 heavy vehicles cross the Kherki Daula toll every day.Sewa Ram, an associate professor and urban transports systems design expert with the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi, said that to implement lane discipline, it is vital that road markings are proper and light vehicles taking a left turn, during the movement of heavy vehicles, are also aware of this rule.“For effective enforcement, the lanes should be properly painted, road signage properly erected, and not obstructed by trees and poles. Further, traffic police also need to educate and spread awareness among light vehicle drivers that the left-most lane carriageway is reserved for heavy vehicles, and they shouldn’t unnecessarily occupy that carriageway. Further, awareness will also assist light vehicle drivers in being wary, while taking a left cut on the highway,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/nh48-in-gurugram-over-3-000-truck-drivers-penalised-for-not-adhering-to-lane-driving-101632076565681.html

The pilot survey aims to find out causes for blindness among different age groups, starting from school-going children to senior citizens. Virendra Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said that 30 clusters have been identified in the district for the survey. This survey will also help to identify the number of people suffering from visual impairments in the district, he said.“In the country, it is believed that cataract is the primary cause of blindness in senior citizens, but there are several other causes for visual impairments that develop from childhood, due to lack of nutrition or other reasons. In this survey, named Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Visual Impairments, our teams will reach out to 1,200 people daily and cover a total of 6,000 people in the survey,” the chief medical officer said. He said that each team, including ASHA and ANM workers, would go door-to-door in the identified areas to get questionnaires related to visual impairment and blindness filled and conduct eye tests for residents. This data will be uploaded on a mobile application, RAA-VI, which has been specifically developed by AIIMS for the survey. Yadav said that after Gurugram, the survey will be conducted in other parts of the country. However, it is not known whether the results will be shared individually or together. Meanwhile, Covid-19 vaccination continued in the district on Sunday, with 19,341 people vaccinated at 88 vaccination centres. On Monday, vaccination will be held at 39 centres in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/aiims-health-department-to-ascertain-visual-impairment-causes-through-survey-101632076564415.html

Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was also present with Naidu at the event.Naidu said that the performance of players from the state was “phenomenal” and the contribution of such a small state in the medal tally was “unbelievable”. He also said that winning in Tokyo was not easy as the Olympics and Paralympics were organised in unusual circumstances and the training of players was also interrupted. “Achieving such a historical success in sports is not very easy. It is the continuous practice, dedication, and hard work a player puts during the process which makes them achieve the planned goal,” Naidu said. Addressing the gathering, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar said that the government is committed to supporting sportspersons by providing all the necessary help and development of sports infrastructure. “We have ensured that prize money reaches the sportsmen and there is no delay. We are also developing a Paralympic sports complex in Faridabad and it will also have a hostel,” he said, adding that more sports nurseries and stadiums will be developed across Haryana. Khattar also said that Haryana is the first state in the country to give maximum cash prizes to sportspersons who have won medals in the Olympics and Paralympics. In the Olympics and Paralympics, a cash prize of ₹6 crore was awarded to gold medallists, ₹4 crore to silver medallists and ₹2.5 crore to bronze medallists. Apart from this, ₹15 lakhs is also provided to each participant, Khattar said.Speaking on the occasion, Haryana sports minister Sandeep Singh said that these players have brought laurels to the state and the nation with their exemplary performances in the Tokyo Paralympics. “Our target would be to send 100 players to the next Paralympics and win more medals,” he said.

A team from the wildlife department also visited the area for an inspection and found that leachate was getting mixed with water in a watering hole set up for animals in the forest area. “The condition there is very bad, with dirty leachate water spilling into forest areas. There was leachate spilt in large quantities on the kuchha road (on the side of the landfill) that leads to the villages inside, through the forest area. Samples have been collected by the pollution control board, after which we will prepare a report and take action accordingly,” a wildlife official said, requesting anonymity. Vaishali Chandra, a city-based environmentalist, said, “Time and again, leachate is released into the forests near the landfill, polluting the soil and their drinking water sources. We found two pondages formed behind the landfill site filled with leachate and a third was a watering hole for the wildlife. If the wildlife is drinking water from there, their health will also get affected.” Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer of HSPCB, Gurugram North, said, “We have collected samples from three sites which have been sent for analysis. We will be taking action against the authorities concerned after the report is released within two weeks, combined with the findings of last month’s report.”Meanwhile, officials of Ecogreen Energy, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s concessionaire for waste management at the Bandhwari landfill, said that they would have to check if the water released is leachate or dirty water. Sanjeev Sharma, the spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy, said, “In our knowledge, there is no spillage of leachate from the landfill; we will have to see if it is dirty rainwater or leachate. The pollution control board can collect samples anytime, we do not interfere with that.” In the second week of August as well, the HSPCB had collected samples of leachate from the Bandhwari landfill, an analysis of which revealed that it contained chemicals over the permissible limits as well as toxic substances. According to the report, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), zinc, chloride, fluoride were all found to be significantly higher than permissible norms. The BOD level of the samples collected from a pond inside the forest area was 540 mg/l, while the COD was 1680 mg/l, chloride was 420mg/l and fluoride was 1mg/l. Experts had then said that elements such as fluoride, even in minuscule quantities, can be harmful as it affects bones in the human body. According to Central Pollution Control Board norms, BOD for a river or waterbody should be less than 30mg/l and COD should be less than 250 mg/l.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bandhwari-landfill-leachate-spills-again-pollution-board-collects-samples-101632076561917.html

The exam was conducted in 16 districts of the state including Prayagraj for filling up 1473 posts and for which a total of 4,91,370 candidates had registered but a mere 1,57,409 (32.03%) appeared in it, informed UPPSC officials. Though officials did not cite any reason officially for such a large number of candidates giving the recruitment exam a miss, aspirants pointed to exam centres being allotted away from their home districts as the main reason for it. For the exam, the UPPSC had allotted exam centres in different districts based on the subjects of the aspirants. For example, Prayagraj was made the centre for Hindi, Jaunpur for Geography, Sitapur for Education, Meerut for Biology and so on. Earlier, the commission had always been allotting home district or a nearby district for most candidates, especially women aspirants, claimed Avnish Pandey, president of Pratiyogi Chatra Sangharsh Samiti, a body representing students vying for government jobs. However, some officials of the commission cited poor preparation by aspirants for the recruitment exam as a possible reason for their skipping it. UPPSC official Jagdish said that the recruitment exam was conducted peacefully at 1055 exam centres from 11am to 1pm. Jaunpur district witnessed a maximum of 44.50% (10,625) of the total registered 23,875 candidates for Geography appearing in the exam. Sitapur that was the centre for Education subject saw the lowest presence of registered candidates with a mere 2420 (17.80%) of the total registered 13,593 for the subject appearing in the exam appearing in exam, he added.

20-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt names two roads in Patparganj after personalities from Uttarakhand||The Delhi government has named two roads in east Delhi’s Patparganj assembly constituency after Shaheed Kesari Chand, a freedom fighter from Uttarakhand, and Hir Singh Rana, a folk singer from the hill state. The announcement came on Sunday when chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal was visiting Uttarakhand ahead of the assembly polls scheduled to be held next year. Kejriwal announced that if elected to power in Uttarakhand, AAP will ensure employment in every household of the state (Har Ghar Rozgar) and provide ₹5,000/monthly stipend to unemployed youth. He also announced that AAP will provide 100,000 government jobs within six months of coming to power in the state.Patparganj is the assembly constituency of deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. Around 20% of the 240,000 voters in the assembly segment are migrants from Uttarakhand.“Two roads have been named in honour of two famous personalities of Uttarakhand -- Amar Shaheed Kesari Chand and famous folk singer Hira Singh Rana in Patparganj constituency. Famous folk singer Hira Singh Rana used to encourage people to face every challenge with bravery through his songs and would inspire generations to come,” said Sisodia in a press statement issued after an event organised in the assembly constituency.He further said, “The songs of Hira Singh Rana not only present the beauty of Kumaon, but also presents the struggles of life in the mountains. Saluting the brave fighter and soldier of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s Azad Hind Fauj, Amar Shaheed Kesari Chand sacrificed his life for the freedom of the country at the age of just 24. Amar Shaheed Veer Kesari Chandra Marg will inspire patriotism in the youth,” said the deputy chief minister.In July this year, Kejriwal had demanded that noted environmentalist from Uttarakhand Sundarlal Bahuguna -- who died of Covid-19 earlier this year -- be awarded the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award in the country. Later, the Delhi Assembly, which has 62 MLAs of the AAP and eight MLAs of the BJP, passed a resolution in this regard. Over the next few months, the Aam Aadmi Party will be contesting assembly elections in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-names-two-roads-in-patparganj-after-personalities-from-uttarakhand-101632076204591.html

20-09-2021||Delhi||Drug peddler at large for nine years arrested in Delhi||The Delhi Police’s narcotics cell arrested one of the most wanted drug traffickers of Bareily, Taimoor Khan alias Bhola (37), who was wanted in nine cases, from north-east Delhi’s Seelampur on Thursday, bringing down the curtain on a nine-year-long search operation that was spread over several parts of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, said senior officers of the narcotics cell on Sunday. The special cell and the crime branch of the Delhi Police conducted multiple raids in the past nine years to arrest Bhola, who carried a reward of ₹1.5 lakh on his arrest. Because of his Robinhood image among the people of his village (Behra in Bareilly) and the areas surrounding it, locals used to give him prior information about police movement, said deputy commissioner of police (narcotics cell) Chinmoy Biswal.“Bhola donated money to needy people with an open heart to gain their support. He had garnered such a strong support in 10-15 surrounding villages that if anyone noticed a vehicle bearing the registration number of Delhi or Haryana around his village, he used to get the information immediately and ample time to flee. Children in his village used to play a game named “Bhola bhaag gaya” by making two teams – one of narcotics cell and the other of special cell, as both the teams regularly conducted raids,” said Biswal.Around three months ago, the narcotics cell mapped the drug prone areas of Delhi and identified 14 hotspots, where sale and use of drugs were maximum. A crackdown followed and the interrogation of the arrested drug peddlers revealed that their source of heroin/smack was from Bareilly, Badaun, and Rampur in Uttar Pradesh. Total eight Bareilly-based drug suppliers were arrested. The last man to be arrested was Shahid Khan alias Chote Pradhan, who is the head (pradhan) of Padhera village in Bareilly. Bhola worked closely with Pradhan in the drug trafficking ring, said police. On September 16, the narcotics team received information that Bhola was coming to Seelampur in search of a safe hideout since he feared all his hideouts were exposed after Pradhan’s arrest. The team laid a trap and caught Bhola near Seelampur metro station. He was arrested for his involvement in a drug peddling case registered in 2018, in which 700 grams of heroin was seized from a drug peddler in Delhi identified as Vinod, who named Bhola as the supplier of the contraband, said the DCP. During interrogation, police said, Bhola revealed that after completing his graduation from Bareilly college, he took admission in a private university to pursue MBA as he aspired to work in a multinational company. However, because of financial crisis, he quit the course and joined a drug supplier in his village in 2007, who made him his carrier of the contraband. Bhola was paid ₹1,600 per trip for the carrying drugs to Delhi. He was first arrested with 670 grams of smack in Delhi in 2008 and remained in jail for seven months, after which he was acquitted in the case.After his release from jail, Bhola continued his illegal work as a drug carrier. He later formed his own gang of suppliers, carriers and clients. He also learnt the art of manufacturing heroin using crude opium top extracts and chemicals, whose supply was done by his contacts in Jharkhand, West Bengal and Manipur., said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/drug-peddler-at-large-for-nine-years-arrested-in-delhi-101632076024116.html

Responding to CM’s statement that he had full confidence that his government would retain power as the BJP would win over 350 seats in 2022 assembly polls, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav in a tweet in Hindi said: “BJP is done”.Akhilesh tweeted twice in the day wherein he said: “In UP, the BJP government has published a 16-page booklet all of which is an absolute lie...It looks as if the BJP has published a textbook for its ‘international lie training centre’. But the BJP’s ambassadors of lies will be able to run the textbook in their ‘online classes (social media)’ because they have no face to go among the people.”In another tweet, Akhilesh said: “Fifty-four months have lapsed, six are left of this arrogant government that did atrocities on farmers, poor, women, and youth and of the government that misled on employment, price-rise, economy; and the government of deception, betrayal, and rhetoric”. He ended the tweet with “Nahin chaahiye thug ka saath, thug ka vikas, thug ka vishawas, thug ka prayaas (Don’t want the government of cheats, progress of cheats, trust of cheats and efforts of cheats...BJP is done.”Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national president Mayawati in her tweet in Hindi said: “The advertisement and claims of ‘4.5 years of change’ of BJP government in UP are all baseless and are far from the ground realities. It is well known that because of the vast difference in BJP’s words and deeds, people are distressed under poverty, unemployment and price rise”.UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu tweeted: “Enough of tall claims...But the BJP government was least bothered about people dying of illnesses--be it encephalitis, Covid, or mysterious fevers...This government hovers helicopter (all over the state), gets photo-ops and hides accountability by lying.”In more tweets, Lallu attacked the state government on “farmers, unemployed, crop loss and damages, cane farmers’ dues, suicides in Bundelkhand”. The party’s UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in her tweet in Hindi rated the UP government as “Number one in malnourishment, crime against women, kidnappings and abductions, murders and crime against Dalits”.In another tweet, she said that on completion of 4.5 years, the government should have replied to peoples’ questions but instead of that the government “lied, lied and only lied”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-government-s-report-card-a-pack-of-lies-opposition-101632075665540.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi agencies work on preparing action plans to limit pollution||With a day to go for the Delhi government’s deadline for agencies in the city to submit their individual pollution management action plans, the departments concerned said they were ‘prepared’ with their recommendations and reports to prevent a repeat of the Capital’s annual pollution problem, said officials on Sunday.Senior officials from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), which is the nodal agency overlooking the pollution control measures taken by the three municipalities, said that municipalities have identified vulnerable spots for open garbage burning, have prepared mechanical sweepers and identified routes for them to operate every night.“We have prepared a list of hot spots where garbage is burnt regularly, and have asked teams to keep a close watch on these spots. We will also ensure roads are regularly swept using machines. A timetable of water sprinkling for areas across the city depending on their pollution levels at a given point of time are also being prepared,” said a senior SDMC official.East Delhi mayor Shyam Sundar Agarwal said the corporation is conducting regular meetings to come up with a plan on effectively controlling pollution in the region this year.“We are trying to come up with an innovative and effective plan this time so that pollution levels can be kept to a minimum this winter,” he said.State environment minister Gopal Rai in a meeting with all government agencies in the city last week, set a deadline for September 21 to submit individual action plans and recommendations based on which a consolidated winter action plan will be prepared by the government ahead of the pollution season, and released by September 30. This action plan promises to focus on ten key areas that are the largest contributors to winter pollution. These include, stubble burning, garbage burning, vehicular emissions, dust pollution etc.Every year starting October, Delhi witnesses an annual repeat of a steep spike in pollution levels, exacerbated by crop stubble burning in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, the city’s local pollution sources and cracker bursting during Diwali. As the temperatures become more frigid and winds change direction and slow down, the condition becomes worse, pushing the city’s air quality to hazardous levels.Apart from the municipalities, other agencies that participated in the government’s meeting last week are working to ensure that any pollution source that gets triggered within their jurisdiction is controlled.Delhi traffic police officials said that they are preparing a list of all congestion hot spots in the city, where snarls could possibly lead to higher vehicular emissions. Along with this, the department is also repairing all traffic signals that were identified as non-functional.“We regularly update the list of congestion points across the city for our own use, so that we can manage traffic in these areas. For this season, we are evaluating the stretches afresh and will submit a list of roads where holdups tend to happen consistently, and the waiting time is over 20-25 minutes,” a senior traffic police officer said.The official said that the department is also identifying all the major stretches where roads are unpaved or ridden with potholes, which lead to dust pollution and also slows traffic down.“We will put forward our suggestion that the agencies concerned fix these roads ahead of the pollution season,” the official added.Rai said that Delhi’s environment department has been appointed the nodal agency to oversee the city’s winter action plan and has been tasked with coordinating with various agencies and communicating with the governments of neighbouring states to keep a check on the impact of stubble burning in Delhi.“Once the agencies present their plans we will have a larger winter action plan. However, the progress on these individual action plans will also be tracked simultaneously. We will be taking regular action-taken reports from all of these agencies once the winter season begins and pollution levels start rising,” a senior official of the environment department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-agencies-prepared-to-meet-sept-21-deadline-for-individual-pollution-action-plans-101632075422069.html
20-09-2021||Other||ATS arrests woman mastermind of fake currency racket||Lucknow : The Uttar Pradesh Anti Terrorism Squad arrested a woman, who was the mastermind of an international fake currency racket, from West Bengal on Sunday after a hunt of around 12 months, officials said. She was carrying a reward of ₹50,000 on her arrest. The accused Mumtaz Bano was in hiding in Bali Banga area under Kaliachak police station of West Bengal. Her name cropped up as the mastermind of the racket following the arrest of two other accused, Tahsin Khan and Mohammad Wasim, by the ATS in September last year. According to a press statement issued by the ATS, the duo informed that Mumtaz Bano, a resident of Madhya Pradesh, ran the fake currency racket in several states of the country. “The fake currency notes were smuggled into India from Bangladesh and routed to Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana on the directions of Mumtaz Bano. She ran the entire operation with help of operatives spread across theses states,” read the press release. Reportedly, Bano took over the operations from her husband Sadar Ali who was arrested by the ATS a few years ago, also in connection with the fake currency racket. Sadar Ali is currently lodged in Lucknow jail. After the arrests made by ATS last year, Bano (who till then ran her racket from Madhya Pradesh), shifted her base to West Bengal. There she changed her name and took over a false identity. ATS officials got a tip-off from local intelligence that she was currently living with her son Kabir under a false name and operating from West Bengal. Acting on this intelligence input, the ATS team managed to arrest Bano. She was presented in a local court in Malda by the ATS, seeking transit remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ats-arrests-woman-mastermind-of-fake-currency-racket-101632075192102.html
20-09-2021||Kolkata||Babul Supriyo doesn’t want to campaign for Mamata Banerjee in bypoll||A day after joining the Trinamool Congress (TMC), former Union minister Babul Supriyo on Sunday said he would not like to campaign for chief minister Mamata Banerjee for the September 30 assembly bypoll in Kolkata’s Bhawanipore.Asked whether he would campaign against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate, lawyer Priyanka Tibrewal, Supriyo, said at a press conference that he will request the TMC leadership not to put him in an embarrassing situation.“I know Priyanka’s family very well. She handled the cases filed against me. I found her to be a good lawyer. Mamata Banerjee does not need me to campaign for her. I will request the party not to put me in an embarrassing position,” Supriyo said in the presence of TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy and the party’s leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien. The latter, said Supriyo, worked as a catalyst in his joining the TMC.Reacting to Supriyo’s decision to stay away from campaigning in Bhawanipore, Tibrewal said, “A brother has responded to the wishes of his sister. Relationships come before politics.” Banerjee is facing the polls as she lost to her protege-turned-adversary, BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari, at Nandigram in East Midnapore district. Throughout the press conference, which was held at a hotel, Supriyo maintained that he would not say anything offensive against the BJP leaders who have targeted him since Saturday.Asked whether he wants to see Banerjee topple the Narendra Modi government in 2024 and become the next prime minister, Supriyo said, “In 2014, Modi was the hope. The massive mandate people of Bengal ensured for her (in the recent assembly polls) has a great value. There is no doubt that Mamata Banerjee is in a great position. That is why she and leaders of other opposition parties are in touch with each other.”“I want to see the most popular person as the PM and there is no doubt that Mamata Banerjee is one of them. There is no doubt that she will be at the top of the list of hopefuls,” he added.Asked whether he felt bad that no BJP Lok Sabha member from Bengal was ever made a cabinet minister, Supriyo, who served as minister of state despite winning the Asansol seat twice since 2014, did not give a direct reply.“The question has the answer,” he said.“It is natural that the BJP will now call me a traitor. Even the TMC and CPI(M) called their leaders traitors after they switched sides. In reply to (BJP leader) Tathatagata Roy’s tweet, I wrote he has the right to disagree with someone’s decision but he must respect that person and his decision. I don’t want to make any unsavory comments,” said Supriyo.“I am honoured to be a part of a team. What happens in future will unfold in time,” he said, ducking questions on whether he would like to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha seat recently vacated by TMC’s Arpita Ghosh.He said he will go to Delhi on Wednesday and tender his resignation from the Asansol Lok Sabha seat.“When I was in the BJP, I gave a lot to the BJP and worked for Bengal’s development,” Supriyo said.“I always want a level playing field. Future will show what I will give to the TMC. People can write on Facebook whatever they want,” he added.Asked about the allegations TMC national general secretary and the chief minister’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee and he exchanged in recent years and also during the March-April state polls, Supriyo said, “Abhishek attacked me too. We will return to each other the boxes of letters we wrote. Just because I have changed parties does not mean the grammar of politics will change. I will not delete my old social media posts.”“In politics, even the fiercest rival is not your enemy. I am not creating any history by changing parties. A lot of people are ridiculing me. I was aware that this would be coming,” said the singer-turned-politician. He said if the situation demands, he will meet BJP MPs from Bengal.“Babul is welcome to our family. I have seen him in Parliament for seven years. I am a fan of his songs. His joining has enthused our workers. He is easily accepted by Bengalis. Mamata Banerjee will meet him tomorrow,” said Saugata Roy.“In the next couple of months, I want to meet people in the districts. I will study the party’s structure and meet workers at the grassroots level,” Supriyo added.While campaigning for Tibrewal in Bhawanipore, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said, “He is a political tourist. He left because he was not made a minister once again.”Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya described his party’s tryst with Supriyo as a “closed chapter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/babul-supriyo-doesn-t-want-to-campaign-for-mamata-banerjee-in-bypoll-101632074882559.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s shop owners struggle to get ownership rights||Two years after the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) decided to adopt the Delhi Apartment Ownership Act, 2009, to facilitate conversion of commercial properties from leasehold to freehold, shop owners in commercial complexes developed by private builders on land auctioned by the land-owning agency in Nehru Place, Dwarka, Pitampura and in a host of other areas are still struggling to get ownership of their properties. Inder kohli, a shop owner in Nehru Place and a member of the Nehru Place Welfare Association, said, “We have been running from pillar to post for the past two years to get ownership of our property. The government has simplified the process of giving ownership to those living in unuauthorised colonies. But, we are still struggling, despite buying the property legally . We can’t take bank loans against our property. Several shop or office space owners have applied for freehold, but no application has been processed till date.”Sewak Ram Nautiyal, who owns an office space in Nehru Place, said, “I applied for conversion in December last year. But I’m yet to hear from DDA about the status of my application.”DDA officials said that in several cases, lease of the buildings (in which shops are located) have been cancelled due to misuse. “We can’t initiate the freehold process of shops if the lease of the building has been cancelled. We have to first get the lease restored and then process the applications for freehold,” said an official aware of the development.In the last four decades, the land-owning agency has auctioned thousands of plots in Nehru Place, Rajinder Place, Dwarka, Pitampura, Janakpuri etc for development of planned commercial centres. But since the DDA sold these plots on leasehold basis, the builders could sell the shops and office spaces on sub-lease under a builder-buyer agreement. The builder had to maintain a record and inform the DDA every time a property transaction took place, said a DDA official.DDA officials admitted that there have been several cases where the developers of the buildings are missing or not helpingshop owners get their property converted. This is why the DDA revised the policy for conversion of such commercial properties in 2019. It adopted the Delhi Apartment Ownership Act, 2009, for commercial complexes to allow owners of shops or offices spaces to get freehold rights over their properties. Vice-chairman of DDA Anurag Jain said that the conversion of commercial property from leasehold to freehold is slightly complicated. “In cases where the lease of the building has been cancelled, shop owners’ application for freehold of their individual units can’t be processed until and unless the lease is restored. If there is misuse of property or illegal construction, then the penalty has to be paid either fully by the builder/lessee or the shop owners/space buyers on a pro-rata basis for his/her unit. We are in the process of further simplifying the process.”Jain said processes of citizen centric services, like conversion, have been computerised end to end. “Ever since we have made the conversion process online, the number of applications we have received is manifold. Now we are getting about 600-700 applications every month against 1,500-2,000 we received in a year.”Property owners want the DDA to expedite the process and simplify it further. Robin Sharma, president of Dwarka Vyapar Mandal who has been pursuing the matter with DDA since 2004, said, “The DDA should accept our property documents and not ask for additional papers. The process should be expedited. This will help DDA earn a lot of revenue from conversion charges.”The land-owning agency is making efforts to streamline the process. Jain said in the housing department, DDA has achieved the benchmark of keeping no case pending for more than two months, barring those where discrepancies have been communicated to the applicants.“Now, efforts are being made to expedite the conversion process of commercial properties and ensure that no conversion case remains pending for more than three months. We are expecting to achieve this benchmark by the end of September this year ,” said the DDA vice-chairman. In 1994, the then urban development ministry started the property (both commercial and residential) conversion process in Delhi. For this, it had set up the Urban Development Fund (UDF) for collection of proceeds from one-time conversion charges.Shop owners also demand that cases where the property has been sold multiple times should also be considered for freehold. Yashpal (identified by a single name), executive member of the DDA Market Joint Action Committee, said, “As these markets were developed in the past four decades, the shops have been sold multiple times. But DDA is not accepting applications where there have been multiple transactions. The people, who are currently occupying the properties in the buildings, are its rightful owners. Currently, they are not allowed to apply. We want the DDA to recognise all such property owners.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-shop-owners-struggle-to-get-ownership-rights-101632074701809.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: BJP expels 3 councillors over ‘excess financial corruption’ for 6 years||The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday expelled three municipal councillors from the party’s primary membership for six years over complaints of “excessive financial corruption”, seven months ahead of the crucial municipal elections in the national capital.Hours after the expulsion letters were made public, one of the three councillors, Pooja Madan, joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) that launched a scathing attack on the BJP and demanded why it did not order a proper investigation into alleged corruption charges against the councillors.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta expelled councillors Rajni Bablu Pandey (New Ashok Nagar ward in East Delhi Municipal Corporation), Sanjay Thakur (Said-ul-Ajaib ward in South Delhi Municipal Corporation) and Pooja Madan (councillor from Mukherjee Nagar ward under North Delhi Municipal Corporation).In his letters to the councillor, Gupta wrote, “Due to several complaints of excessive financial corruption from the people, you have been suspended from Bharatiya Janata Party’s membership for a period of six years.”Gupta said these people were informed about the complaints and told to take corrective measures. But as there was no improvement, the party decided to expel them, he said in the letter.Municipal elections are due to be held in Delhi in April next year. Currently, the BJP rules all the three civic bodies -- EDMC, SDMC and North DMC -- with the AAP as the main opposition in all the three corporations. The AAP has been carrying out a persistent campaign against the BJP’s rule in the three civic bodies, alleging rampant corruption and financial mismanagement in the corporations -- charges that the BJP has consistently contested and denied.Saurabh Bharadwaj, AAP’s chief spokesperson, on Sunday asked what was the BJP waiting for despite getting complaints against the three councillors, as mentioned in the expulsion letter issued by Gupta. “What’s worth noticing is that the letter which Adesh Gupta has written to EDMC’s Ragini Bablu Pandey and SDMC’s Sanjay Thakur stated that they have received multiple complaints of financial corruption against the councillors. Also, they were warned but since they were not complying, they were expelled from the party for six years. When Adesh Gupta had complaints of financial corruption against these councillors, what were they (BJP) waiting for? The BJP has CBI, ACB, Vigilance department of the MCD, the entire central government and even the LG. Even then, they haven’t submitted even a single complaint to the authorities. Even today, the BJP is sitting as a mute spectator and not complaining against them. After five years of governing the MCD, the BJP is now initiating a cosmetic action against these councillors which is a farce. They are deceiving the people of Delhi. A real action would constitute getting them investigated.”Pandey and Thakur said they will take up the matter with senior party leaders, but Madan said that she was expelled because she had decided to quit the party.Madan said, “If the party thinks I am corrupt, why senior BJP leaders have been calling me for the past two or three days. They expelled me as they got to know about my decision to join the AAP. I wanted to work for the people, but the local BJP unit was just not supportive, and it had become impossible to get work done in the corporation.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor has said that Madan’s inclusion in the AAP has exposed the “dual standards” of the ruling party on corruption.“For last three months Delhi BJP was receiving complaints of corruption against Madan and she was repeatedly warned. The party at last had to expel her. Soon after her expulsion from BJP, the AAP admitted her into their party fold and it seems AAP has a washing machine to wash and purify tainted councillors. Soon, we may see AAP admitting the other two tainted councillors, who were expelled from the party along with Madan.”Thakur and Pandey refuted reports of them joining the AAP, and said that they are trying to talk to senior BJP leaders to address the issue.Thakur said, “I got to know about it from social media, though I’m yet to receive an official communication from the party. I have worked very hard to get where I am today. I have actively worked for the party. I will take up the matter with party seniors. I am not joining the AAP. This is a rumour.”Rajini Pandey said that there has been a misunderstanding. “I will always remain with the party (BJP). I will meet party leaders tomorrow to discuss the matter. There has been some misunderstanding. But I will accept whatever the party decides.”With municipal elections scheduled early next year, senior BJP leaders said that this will send a strong message to party members and people that the party will not tolerate corruption.Jai Prakash, former mayor of the North corporation said, “We are here to work for the people and this decision shows that we have a zero-tolerance policy for corruption.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-expels-three-councillors-over-excess-financial-corruption-for-6-years-101632074342608.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s revamped Chandni Chowk holds different meanings for its many residents||Rida Ansari , a resident of Ballimaran in the walled city is a diabetic. Her doctor recommended an hour’s daily walk , but she failed to follow his advice for years because she says, she had no place to walk in the congested old Delhi. But two months back, she decided to explore if she could go for a walk in the revamped Chandni Chowk. Now, every day the 48-year old, can be seen taking a stroll both in the morning and the night , along with her friends, in the redeveloped Mughal-era market .“These regular walks have made a great difference to my life. Earlier I was just confined to my home the whole day and felt suffocated, now I feel better mentally and physically. You have to have lived in the walled city to understand what the revamped Chandi Chowk means to hundreds of women like me here,” says Ansari.But Anil Pershad, 77, whose family has lived in Chandni Chowk for over 175 years in Chunnamal haveli, the most famous residence in the walled city today, says that the 9am to 9pm ban on motorised vehicles has only complicated life for him and his family. “There should have been a provision for parking for at least the residents of Chandni Chowk. I have a knee problem and it is unfair to expect me to first walk and then hop onto a cycle rickshaw every time I need to venture out of my home,” says an agitated Pershad, sitting in the grand high-ceilinged drawing-room of his haveli.The redeveloped Chandni Chowk, which was inaugurated by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on September 12, mean different things to different residents of the walled city. There are hundreds of people living in the congested old Delhi, who say that revamped Chandni Chowk has changed their lives for the better. Every day close to mid-night , it is festival-like atmosphere in the market, with hundreds of men, women and children, all locals, taking a stroll, cycling, playing badminton, having leisurely conversations over ice creams. But then there are many others like Pershad also who feel that redeveloped Chandni Chowk has only added to their problems.Pershad’s daughter-in-law describes the revamped Chandni Chowk as a “theatre of the absurd”, its cast of characters changing throughout the day. “Early in the morning, you can see children skating on the broad footpath in front of our house; around 9am there is a scramble among the vehicles to move out. Around noon shopkeepers and shoppers take over. In the night, you can see a lot of vehicles parked on the roads and labourers sleeping on the new footpaths, ” says Swetcha Pershad, a life coach, standing in the balcony of her grand haveli, pointing to the spot where children come for skating—and where the labourers sleep in the night.In fact, one can also see children skating on a stretch near Ballimaran and quite a few cyclists too in the middle of the night. “ Earlier, we would cycling at Rajghat with friends, now many prefer Chandni Chowk, ” says Abdullah Saad , 24, a local resident. Our conversation is interrupted by a loud squeal from a group of children playing badminton on the footpath, their mothers engaged in conversation.Muhammad Naeem, a local resident and civil society leader, says the walled city has been a ‘disabled city’ because of the absence of any civic infrastructure, and the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk, has given the residents a reason to cheer. “While revamped Chandni Chowk has not solved most of our problems, it has given people here a bit of reprieve from the claustrophobia of the congested lanes they live in. Lakhs of people sold their homes and left the walled city over the years because of the chaos created by crass commercialization and unauthorized construction,” says Naeem.In the 1980s, many residents started leaving the walled city areas such as Sitaram Bazar, Nai Sarak, and Chandni Chowk. “Those who were rich moved to Civil Lines; others moved to Patparganj, and Daryaganj and other places,” says Ashok Mathur, a walled city resident, who lives in his ancestral haveli on Nai Sarak.Mathur says that the walled city has witnessed a big demographic shift over the decades. “Those who came here in the 1940s post- Partition integrated well with local culture. But most of those who bought their houses here in the past three decades only had commercial objectives, and no interest in preserving the heritage and culture of the walled city,” he says.Sudhir Nigam who left his ancestral house in Sitaram Bazar in 2016, agrees. Old havelis and houses, he says, have been destroyed to make flats, godowns and shops, without caring for provisions such as lack of parking space. “ The builders are irreversibly changing the character of the place. We left because of the chaos caused by crass commercialization,” says Nigam, who shifted to Indirapuram in Ghaziabad. He recently visited Chandni Chowk after many months. “ It was quite an experience walking in the middle of Chandni Chowk without worrying about being hit by vehicle. But I am not sure if this change is enough to stop the exodus of old residents or bring back those who left, ” he says.Abu Sufiyan , a local who runs, Purani Dilli Walon Ki Baatein, a digital platform, which has over 200,000 followers and aims to tell lesser-known stories about the walled city, its people and culture, says that being able to walk leisurely in the redeveloped Chandni Chowk offer many hidden benefits.“In the past couple of months while walking in Chandni Chowk I have discovered some buildings with heritage facades that I never spotted before. Earlier, the maddening traffic chaos here did not allow that , ” says Sufiyan. “I think revamped Chandni Chowk will lead to a better appreciation of the walled city’s heritage and a desire to preserve it. Already, many local youngsters are planning to open cafes with interiors in sync with the heritage of the walled city.”Mathur says he would like to wait and watch before commenting on the impact of the revamped Chandni Chowk’s on local residents’ lives. “It has certainly given breathing space to people, but it is too early to assess its real impact. I hope that traffic in internal roads such as Nai Sarak and Ballimaran is not barred permanently. It will cause a lot of hardships to the residents,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-revamped-chandni-chowk-holds-different-meanings-for-its-many-residents-101632073925425.html
20-09-2021||Delhi||Railways job scam: EOW arrests man from Greater Noida||The Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) has arrested a 43-year-old man from Greater Noida last week, for his alleged involvement in a job scam, in which he and his associates allegedly duped more than 40 job aspirants of around ₹2.44 crore by promising them jobs in the Indian Railways.Police said the members of the gang issued fake appointment letters to the candidates, conducted their medical examinations and organised a three-month long job training in Uttarakhand’s Dehradun to make the entire selection procedure look genuine. Two members of the racket--Brij Kishore (34) and Sachin Kumar (36)--were arrested last month in the case. “One of the two posed as a senior IAS officer and claimed of having links in the railways recruitment board to win the confidence of the candidates,” said additional commissioner of police (EOW) R K Singh.The EOW, Singh said, received complaints from job aspirants, who alleged that after completing the training at Dehradun, when they went to their first posting at a railway office in Jharkand’s Jamshedpur, they were told that the railway board had not released any advertisement about vacancies. A case was registered with the EOW in January this year based on the complaints of the job seekers--many of whom are from villages around Agra and Hathras in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar’s Patna.“Since most of the victims come from very humble backgrounds, they were examined for the job at their respective villages only. The victims had no idea about the whereabouts of the suspects. They only had their phone numbers. They used to meet the suspects at hotels in Paharganj and near Rail Bhawan. We identified two suspects with the help of manual and technical investigation and arrested them in August,” said Singh.During interrogation, police said, the suspects named one Mohammad Raghib Firoz, a resident of Greater Noida, who was absconding. The investigating team collected information about Firoz’s whereabouts and nabbed him from Greater Noida last week. Firoz is a post graduate in psychology and also holds a diploma in mass communication and journalism, said police. “In the present case, Firoz coordinated all the activities, including collecting money from the candidates, filling various forms related to their appointment and training, apart from managing other affairs in the commission of the economic offence,” said Singh.Police said the suspects did not publish any advertisement regarding the job vacancies. They spread information through word of mouth that they had solid links in the railways department through which they can secure jobs for interested candidates.“We have learnt that the number of victims is not less than 100. While 40 of them have been identified and approached, efforts are on to find others,” said an investigator, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/railways-job-scam-eow-arrests-mastermind-from-greater-noida-101632055619604.html
20-09-2021||Dehradun||Central Zoo Authority seeks report from over illegal felling in Corbett||The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has issued notice to the chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand on allegations of illegal cutting of thousands of trees in the Corbett Tiger Reserve in Kalagarh division for the Pakhrau Tiger Safari. The development follows legal notice sent by Gaurav Kumar Bansal, wildlife activist and advocate of Supreme Court, in which, he urged the CZA and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to withdraw their “approval” for the establishment of the tiger safari in Gujjar Sot, Pakhrau Block, Sonanadi Range, Kalagarh Division in Corbett Tiger Reserve. Bansal said in his notice he has stated that the Forest Advisory Committee of the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change had recommended the proposal only after the written assurance from Uttarakhand forest officials that only 163 will be felled for the setting up of the tiger safari. “However, in contrast to its undertaking, forest department officials have uprooted nearly 10,000 trees in the area,” he said. Sonali Gosh, Deputy Inspector General of Forests at Central Zoo Authority in her September 17 letter to the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and chief wildlife warden Uttarakhand asked them to verify facts and submit their response for further necessary action. Bansal said even the director of CTR has sought a report from divisional forest officer Kalagarh on the illegal felling of trees for setting up the Tiger Safari. The legal notice states that “grievance which applicant wishes to highlight is that illegal felling of trees in the name of establishment of Pakhrau Tiger Safari and that too within Corbett Tiger Reserve, which is one of the best and oldest National Parks in the country, is not only against the statutory approvals granted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, Central Zoo Authority and Forest Advisory Committee but also contempt of the order dated 09/04/2001 issued by Supreme Court of India in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 47 of 1998 titled as ‘Navin M Raheja Vs. Union of INDIA and Others’ wherein the apex court expressly observed that no tree whatsoever shall be felled in the Corbett Tiger Reserve by the State or anyone else”. When contacted, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) Rajiv Bhartari said he had directed PPCF wildlife JS Suhag to give a status report on the allegations based on which the response will be sent to CZA. Rahul (who goes by his first name), director CTR, rubbished the allegations that 10,000 trees have been cut for the safari project. “Prima facie there are no irregularities in the construction of the tiger safari. We have all the required permissions. But still, I have sought a status report from DFO Kalagarh in the matter. This tiger safari project was conceived during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Corbett in February 2019,” he said. According to the minutes of the meeting of the forest advisory committee (FAC) held on September 21, 2020, the proposal for seeking prior approval of the Central government under Section 2 of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for non-forestry use of 106.16 hectares of forest land Compartment No. 3 and 8 of Kalagarh Tiger Reserve Division of Pakhro Range, Pakhro Block of Pauri Garhwal district for the establishment of Tiger Safari was discussed in the meeting. The FAC recommended the proposal on certain conditions that all conditions in the statutory approvals obtained from NTCA and CZA would comply and the state government would ensure the infrastructure of the tiger safari is created mainly from bamboo and other natural materials. The minutes stated that statutory approvals from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) have been obtained for the proposal, compensatory afforestation has been proposed over 16 hectares of non-forest land which is equal to 15 per cent of the forest land proposed for diversion. The minutes also noted that as the construction activity over 4000 square metres is carried out under the project, the proposal does not require environment clearance and consequent wildlife clearance from the standing committee of the National Board for Wild Life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/central-zoo-authority-seeks-report-from-over-illegal-felling-in-corbett-101632053701524.html
20-09-2021||World||Over 20 US citizens, 48 lawful residents leave Kabul airport in evac flight: US||A Qatar Airways flight with as many as 21 American citizens and 48 lawful permanent residents departed from Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport on Sunday, the US State Department said in a statement on Monday.This marks the second evacuation flight in nearly two weeks from Afghanistan, which is now under the control of the Islamist militant group Taliban. On September 11, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken took to Twitter to post a series of tweets on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 terrorist attacks.One of the tweets was regarding the evacuation of 21 US nationals and 11 Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) from the war-gripped country. While 19 Americans were airlifted on Qatar Airways, the remaining two and all the lawful permanent residents were taken out of Afghanistan via an overland route, Blinken’s statement read.“We continue to work to uphold our commitment to assist departures for those to whom we have a special commitment,” the US Secretary of State’s Twitter post added.An additional two U.S. citizens and 11 Lawful Permanent Residents departed Afghanistan today overland, while another 19 U.S. citizens traveled out on Qatar Airways. We continue to work to uphold our commitment to assist departures for those to whom we have a special commitment.Kabul airport returned to action on September 9 with the evacuation of some 200 foreigners, including several US citizens, on the first flight flying out of the Hamid Karzai airport since the US and its allied forces departed Afghanistan after a war of two decades. After the last soldier of US-led forces left the Kabul airport, the Taliban burst firecrackers to celebrate independence.Among the 200 foreigners, were an Afghan-American dual citizen, who said that he was told by the US State Department on September 9 morning to reach the Kabul airport. “We got in contact with the State Department, they gave me a call this morning and said to go to the airport,” the father of the citizen, who requested anonymity, told the old news agency AFP.Blinken had been constantly hedging on enabling charter flights from Hamid Karzai Airport, even saying earlier this month that the US has been in contact with the Taliban for the same – stressing on the fact that the Islamist group had reiterated to permit Afghans to “freely leave” their homeland.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-20-us-citizens-48-lawful-residents-leave-kabul-airport-in-evac-flight-us-101632161408589.html
20-09-2021||World||Indian PM Narendra Modi to address UN General Assembly on Sept 25||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on September 25 as the first speaker of the day.Narendra Modi last addressed the UNGA in-person 2019 as the 2020 meetings were held virtually amidst a raging Covid-19 pandemic, that had hit the New York state and city the hardest in the United States at the time turning them into ground zero of the worst public health crisis, faced by the world in more than 100 years.Narendra Modi will arrive in New York late on September 24 after what is likely to be a hectic schedule of meetings in Washington DC, where he will join Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga for the first in-person summit of the Quad group of countries being hosted by US President Joe Biden at the White House. They had last met in March, but virtually.Modi is also expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Joe Biden and meet vice-president Kamala Harris, the first Indian-American to hold America’s second highest political office.These will be Narenda Modi’s first in-person meetings with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. He had met Joe Biden before, on his first visit to the US as prime minister in 2014. Joe Biden was vice-president at the time, in the administration of President Barack Obama. Narendra Modi and Kamala Harris have never met, but have spoken on phone before.The prime minister’s engagements in New York are still being worked out though he is expected to leave for India just hours after his speech on September 25. His remaining schedule for the rest of the day is unlikely to be as expansive and busy as in previous years, which would be packed with bilateral meetings with counterparts from around the world and sessions with business leaders, American politicians and the diaspora.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is arriving in New York on Monday for a series of UN and related meetings, including those that are held almost every year on the sidelines of the general assembly, such as the G-4. India, Brazil, Germany and Japan, are seeking permanent seats in an expanded UN Security Council in long overdue reforms of the world body.S Jaishankar will also participate in a meeting of the foreign ministers of the G-20 countries on Afghanistan. Both the G-4 and G-20 meetings are scheduled for September 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-pm-narendra-modi-to-address-un-general-assembly-on-sept-25-101632161227703.html

Following a sudden surge in cases in India, the airline had earlier in April suspended India operations.Replying to multiple users on the microblogging site Twitter, Air Canada confirmed that its flight to Delhi is resuming. In one such tweet asking about the resumption of direct flights to India between Toronto and Delhi, Air Canada replied, “Yes they are, however it is subject to change depending on the Canadian Government.”Further, the company also notified the passengers of the Covid-19 testing requirements for flights from India. It said that a negative RT-PCR test or a rapid PCR test, not older than 18 hours before departure, from the testing centre at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi is necessary.Also read | Working with India, says UK on recognising Covishield vaccine certificate“Please note that Air Canada’s requirements for boarding the flight from India to Canada have now changed. The only accepted COVID-19 tests are an RT-PCR test or a rapid PCR test that must be taken no more than 18 hours before your departing Air Canada flight to Canada from the COVID-19 Testing Centre & Lounge across from Terminal 3 at Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi,” the airlines said.It also noted that no other tests would be accepted even in the case of flyers coming in from other cities in India. “Air Canada requires either of these specific tests as no other test from any other clinic within India will be accepted, even if you are connecting from a different city,” it added. “You may also be able to travel if you provide proof of a certified positive PCR test result taken between 14 and 180 days before your scheduled departure flight to Canada,” it further said.As far as vaccinations are concerned, four shots, namely those of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Vaxzevria and Covishield by AstraZeneca and Janssen by Johnson and Johnson are accepted currently in Canada, according to the government’s Travel and Tourism website.

20-09-2021||World||Conservative leader Erin O’Toole among the early voters in Canada elections||Canadians started voting on Monday in the country’s 44th elections, following a 36-day campaign. Among the early voters was Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole, who voted at a polling station in the town of Bowmanville in Ontario. However, it’s the person he’s attempting to unseat, incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who has the definite edge in the contest.The elections were called on August 15 and Justin Trudeau’s objective was to secure a majority to govern the country. He may well return to the helm in Ottawa but the likelihood of a minority government is far higher, though, if his ruling Liberal Party performs optimally across close contests, a majority cannot be considered impossible.As per the latest data from the tracking website 338 Canada, the Liberals had 31.9% vote share translating to 148 seats, while their principal rival Conservatives had 31.4% support equal to 125 seats. The outlet CBC’s poll tracker gives the ruling party a 57% chance of forming a minority government but just 17% for a majority.The majority mark in the House of Commons is 170 and the ruling party captured 157 seats in 2019 with the Tories at 121.The campaign has been described by many analysts as the most divisive in recent times, witnessing noisy protests at Justin Trudeau’s rallies over vaccine mandates, including one in Ontario where gravel was tossed at him.The Covid-19 pandemic may well be the main factor as people vote, though the economy, with inflation at a three-decade high and issues like climate change and indigenous rights will also count.Approximately, 6.3 million Canadians have voted prior to Monday, at advance polls that spanned four days and through mail-in ballots.The contest is extremely tight and the suspense may well stretch on for a couple more days. While results are normally announced the same night of the elections, Elections Canada has said it will only start counting mail-in ballots on Tuesday morning after verifying those using that option had not voted in person as well. With over a million such votes to be tallied, results for seats with narrow margins may remain in doubt.The ruling Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau is pitching its management of the Covid-19 pandemic and leveraging the wedge issue of vaccine passports against the Conservatives, as its leader Erin O’Toole has opposed imposition of mandatory vaccination. That single issue has bolstered Justin Trudeau’s campaign, and indications on the eve of the election are that he may even have an outside chance at capturing the majority he craved for while precipitating snap elections on August 15.With Western Canada, particularly the province of Alberta, suffering from the fourth wave of the coronavirus, Justin Trudeau has, with some success, linked that to the failure of the provincial governments which are all run by right-of-centre parties and their ties to Erin O’Toole. He has described the fourth wave as one of the unvaccinated, criticising Erin O’Toole for indulging anti-vaxxers. Canada, he said, at a campaign event on Sunday, was “at a crossroads, at a moment where we have to make a really important choice”. That single factor may have given Justin Trudeau’s party enough impetus for a majority, which may have been unthinkable a week back.Erin O’Toole, meanwhile, is also making this a referendum, not just on Trudeau but also on his “selfish” call for elections in the midst of the fourth wave, an issue that continues to resonate with voters. “Now is the time for Canadians to make a choice. We can choose to settle for second-best - for a party that hardly tries and barely delivers. Or we can choose to believe in a brighter, better, more united future,” he said.Both leaders spent some of the last day campaigning in Canada’s most populous province Ontario, which could prove crucial in determining the shape of the next Government.Turnout amid voter malaise could be the X-factor in the final outcome. The agency Ipsos Canada forecast a “photo finish” to the contest. Its CEO Darrell Bricker tweeted, “Here’s what I’m seeing. It’s very close. Tory vote a bit more certain, energetic than LPC vote but incumbents have built in advantages. Do they cancel out? Hard to gauge.”It’s really that uncertain, but the advantage definitely lies with Justin Trudeau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/conservative-leader-erin-o-toole-among-the-early-voters-in-canada-elections-101632153487082.html

The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.According to the reports, the new rule will open the door to fully vaccinated passengers and also those in clinical trials for vaccines not yet approved in Britain -- a policy applying to about 40,000 people.Currently only US citizens, residents and foreigners with special visas are allowed to enter the United States from most European countries.The restriction has deeply irked EU and British authorities. On Monday, the European Union recommended that member states reimpose restrictions on American travelers who had earlier been free to enter if vaccinated.Biden's reported move would come on the eve of the UN General Assembly in New York, where the pandemic is due to be the headline issue.The report also comes as Washington and Paris spar bitterly over Australia's sudden announcement that it will be getting US nuclear submarines, ditching a previous French contract for conventionally powered submarines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-lift-covid-travel-ban-for-vaccinated-eu-uk-passengers-reports-101632148528977.html

It is found to have compressive strengths as high as 25Mpa (megapascals) similar to that of ordinary concrete (20Mpa to 32 MPa).However, the scientists have also found that by incorporating urea, the compressive strength could further be increased by over 300% with the best performing material having a compressive strength of almost 40 MPa, substantially stronger than ordinary concrete. Urea is a biological waste product that the body produces and excretes through urine, sweat and tears.The new technique holds considerable advantages over many other proposed construction techniques in the moon and Mars, said Dr Aled Roberts from the University of Manchester who worked on the project. “Scientists have been trying to develop viable technologies to produce concrete-like materials on the surface of Mars, but we never stopped to think that the answer might be inside us all along,” he said.Over 500 kg of AstroCrete could be produced over the course of a two-year mission on the surface of Mars by a crew of six astronauts, the scientists calculated. “If used as a mortar for sandbags or heat-fused regolith bricks, each crew member could produce enough AstroCrete to expand the habitat to support an additional crew member, doubling the housing available with each successive mission,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-create-concrete-like-material-from-extra-terrestrial-dust-and-blood-sweat-and-tears-of-astronauts-101632147819570.html

A Reuters reporter saw heavy smoke coming from the volcano and houses burning.Officials said they were hopeful they would not need to evacuate any more people."The lava is moving towards the coast and the damage will be material. According to experts there are about 17-20 million cubic metres of lava," regional president Angel Victor Torres told Cadena Ser radio.The lava flow has destroyed about 100 houses so far, Mariano Hernandez, president of La Palma's council, told Cadena Ser.About 20 houses were engulfed in the village of El Paso along with sections of roads, Mayor Sergio Rodriguez told state broadcaster TVE. The lava was spreading through neighbouring villages, putting hundreds more at risk, he said.A group of 360 tourists were evacuated by boat to Tenerife from the beach resort of Puerto Naos, ferry operator Fred Olsen said, and more could be transferred later in the day.Despite the destruction, Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto told Canal Sur radio the eruption should be seen as an opportunity to entice visitors to the island."The island is open, if your hotel is affected we will find you another one," she said. "Make the most of this opportunity to enjoy what nature has brought us."Volcanologist Nemesio Perez said there were unlikely to be fatalities as long as no-one behaved recklessly.La Palma had been on high alert after thousands of tremors were reported over a week in Cumbre Vieja, which belongs to a chain of volcanoes that last had a major eruption in 1971 and is one of the Canaries' most active volcanic regions.One man was killed in 1971 as he took photographs near the lava flows. A submarine eruption occurred about 10 years ago close to the islands but caused little damage.Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez arrived in La Palma on Sunday to coordinate with regional authorities and said citizens could "rest easy." He will visit affected areas later on Monday.Emergency services said it was unclear what path the lava would take to the ocean. Authorities had evacuated people with mobility issues from several coastal towns, including the Puerto Naos resort.Airspace around the Canaries remained open with no visibility problems, the Enaire civil air authority said. Local airline Binter cancelled four flights but said it would resume its service later on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-100-houses-damaged-so-far-after-volcanic-eruption-in-spain-s-la-palma-101632136100661.html
20-09-2021||World||'Hotel Rwanda' hero Paul Rusesabagina convicted on terror charges||Paul Rusesabagina, the "Hotel Rwanda" hero who became a fierce government critic, was found guilty on Monday on terror charges after what his supporters say was a politically motivated show trial.He was convicted of backing a rebel group blamed for deadly gun, grenade and arson attacks in Rwanda in 2018 and 2019."He founded a terrorist organisation that attacked Rwanda, he financially contributed to terrorist activities," Justice Beatrice Mukamurenzi said at the end of a seven-month trial.Rwandan prosecutors have sought a life sentence for Rusesabagina, the 67-year-old former hotelier credited with saving hundreds of lives during the 1994 genocide, and whose actions inspired the Hollywood film.Neither he nor his lawyers were in court for the verdict, although the 20 other defendants in the case attended.Rusesabagina, who used his fame to denounce Rwandan leader Paul Kagame as a dictator, was arrested in August 2020 when a plane he believed was bound for Burundi landed instead in the Rwandan capital Kigali.His family say Rusesabagina was kidnapped and had rejected the nine charges against him as payback by a vengeful government for his outspoken views.Earlier this month, Kagame had dismissed criticism of the case, saying Rusesabagina was in the dock not because of his fame but over the lives lost "because of his actions".The trial began in February but the Belgian citizen and US green card holder boycotted it starting in March, accusing the court of "unfairness and a lack of independence".The United States -- which awarded Rusesabagina its Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 -- along with the European Parliament and Belgium were among those to raise concerns about his transfer to Rwanda and the fairness of his trial.Conflicting testimonyRusesabagina was the former manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali, where he sheltered hundreds of guests during the genocide that left 800,000 people dead, mostly ethnic Tutsis.A decade later the American actor Don Cheadle played Rusesabagina, a moderate Hutu, in the Oscar-nominated blockbuster that brought his story to an international audience.Rusesabagina soon became disillusioned with the new Tutsi-dominated government led by Kagame, the rebel leader-turned president whose forces ended the mass killings.He accused Kagame of authoritarian tendencies and left Rwanda in 1996, living in Belgium and then the United States.Abroad, he used his global platform to crusade for political change in Kigali, and developed close ties with opposition groups in exile.Kagame's government accused Rusesabagina of supporting the National Liberation Front (FLN), a rebel group blamed for the attacks in 2018 and 2019 that killed nine people.Rusesabagina denied any involvement in the attacks, but was a founder of the Rwandan Movement for Democratic Change (MRCD), an opposition group of which the FLN is seen as the armed wing."MRCD-FLN commited terror acts. MRCD cannot be separated from military acts" of FLN, said the judge, Mukamurenzi.Prosecutors in June said Rusesabagina "encouraged and empowered the fighters to commit those terrorist acts".But his co-defendants gave conflicting testimony about the level of Rusesabagina's involvement with the FLN and its fighters.His family, who have campaigned globally for his release, say Rusesabagina is a political prisoner and accuse the Rwandan authorities of torturing him in custody.The Hotel Rwanda Foundation, which supports Rusesabagina, said in a statement earlier this month it was a "show trial" and that the government had failed to provide any credible evidence against him.In July, meanwhile, a media investigation claimed that Rusesabagina's daughter Carine Kanimba was spied on using Pegasus malware developed by Israeli company NSO.Investigators confirmed that a cell phone belonging to Kanimba, a US-Belgian dual national, had been compromised multiple times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hotel-rwanda-hero-paul-rusesabagina-convicted-on-terror-charges-101632135860117.html

The shots were given 21 days apart.The 10 microgramme dose was "carefully selected as the preferred dose for safety, tolerability and immunogenicity" for that age group, the statement said.- Under-5s before year-end -The side effects were "generally comparable to those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age", it added.Among the most commonly reported side effects in the past have been pain and swelling at the injection site as well as headache, chills and fever.Israel has already given special authorisation to vaccinate children aged 5-11 who are "at significant risk of serious illness or death" from Covid, using the Pfizer jab at the lower dosage.Pfizer and BioNTech are also trialling their vaccine on infants aged six months to two years, and on children aged two to five.The topline results for those trials are expected "as soon as" the fourth quarter of this year, the companies said.All together, up to 4,500 children aged six months to 11 years have enrolled in the Pfizer-BioNTech trials in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain.Like its Moderna rival, the Pfizer jab is based on novel mRNA technology that delivers genetic instructions to cells to build the coronavirus spike protein, in order to evoke antibodies when bodies encounter the real virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clinical-trial-results-show-pfizer-covid-19-jab-safe-for-children-aged-511-101632135552955.html

Amaaq News Agency said that “three separate bomb attacks" targeting three "Taliban vehicles" in Jalalabad on Saturday, and another "bomb attack" Sunday on "a Taliban vehicle". "More than 35 Taliban militia members were killed or wounded, in a series of explosions that took place," it said.Local media reported that a pickup truck carrying Taliban fighters was the target of a bomb in the eastern city of Jalalabad—the capital of Nangarhar province, the heartland of the Islamic State group's Afghanistan branch—on Sunday. Witnesses also told local media that several wounded Taliban fighters were taken to hospital after the explosion, which one journalist said happened near an interchange for transport to and from Kabul. At least two people were killed on Saturday in a series of blasts in the area, the first deadly blasts since the last US forces withdrew from Afghanistan on August 30.Also watch | Taliban officials killed in blast in Afghanistan's Jalalabad: ReportsThe Taliban have not commented about the death toll in the city. Nangarhar, which borders Pakistan, is the only province where the Taliban are being targeted by IS after they recaptured Afghanistan in August. Some districts of Nangarhar and Kunar provinces were the heartlands of IS during the previous Afghan government and the gourd ruled those districts for five years. They were finally driven out by Afghan forces, the people uprising and the Taliban.Both IS and the Taliban are hardline Sunni Islamist groups, but they differ on the issues of religion and strategy, which has led to bloody fighting between the two. The Taliban and IS were enemies before foreign troops left Afghanistan. The Taliban have focused on taking control of Afghanistan, while IS affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere call for global jihad. As the Taliban face major economic and security challenges in trying to govern Afghanistan, IS attacks will further complicate those efforts.IS-K also claimed responsibility for a bloody attack that killed more than 160 Afghans and 13 US troops at Kabul airport at the end of August as tens of thousands tried to flee the Taliban.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-25-taliban-killed-is-claims-attacks-in-afghanistan-s-jalalabad-101632133181525.html

20-09-2021||World||Satellites spot methane plumes floating above Lahore||Satellites spotted a large plume of methane leaking from one of Pakistan’s largest cities last month.The cloud was seen over Lahore on Aug. 6 and had an emissions rate of about 126 metric tons of methane an hour, according to an estimate from geoanalytics firm Kayrros SAS. That amount of the greenhouse gas would have roughly the same short-term climate warming impact as the annual emissions of 6,200 cars in the UK. A second, smaller plume was seen above the city on Aug. 31, emitting about 39 tons of methane an hour. Methane is a super-potent greenhouse gas, with more than 80 times the warming impact of carbon dioxide over two decades. That’s one reason scientists have been calling for rapid cuts to methane emissions in a bid to slow down climate change.While many large methane leaks come from a relatively easily identified source, such as oil and gas infrastructure, it’s difficult to pinpoint the origins of the ones in Lahore. Other sources of methane include cattle farming, rice production and waste management.“These kinds of events around cities are very difficult to find the origin of,” said a spokesperson for Kayrros. “Most of the time, it’s different sources that accumulate into methane clouds.”Lahore has a history of these kinds of leaks. Since the beginning of 2019, Kayrros has analyzed dozens of methane clouds spotted around the city. Kayrros uses data collected by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P satellite. One potential source could be the Lakhodair landfill in the northeast part of the city, said Bram Maasakkers, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Space Research who also uses Sentinel 5-P’s data to hone in on global methane hot spots. Landfills can produce methane when the waste deposited in them decomposes without the presence of oxygen. The methane can build up for a time until it escapes to the surface and up into the atmosphere.Following Maasakkers’ work, geoanalytics firm GHGsat, which offers higher resolution detection, captured a large methane plume on July 1 from Lakhodair landfill. The rate of release was about 4 tons per hour, which GHGSat captured using its own commercial satellites. The landfill operators didn’t reply to a request for comment.Still, a cloud as large as the one detected in Lahore in August likely comes from multiple sources. Leaky cities will have to better understand and account for these emissions in order to limit their impact on the climate. Scientists consider reduction of methane leaks one of the lowest-hanging climate solutions. Satellites are helping spot these leaks, including from landfills in Bangladesh and Argentina, and highlighting the regions of the world where more action is needed.Last week, major economies, including the US and European Union, agreed to reducing methane emissions by at least 30% relative to 2020 levels before the end of this decade. The countries are now calling on others to join the voluntary pact in a bid to help the world reach climate goals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellites-spot-methane-plumes-floating-above-lahore-101632128486525.html
20-09-2021||World||China launches unmanned spacecraft with supplies for under-construction space station||China on Monday launched a second unmanned cargo spacecraft, which will join the core module of the country’s under-construction space station carrying supplies for future missions, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said.The robotic Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecraft was launched at 3pm (China time) on a Long March 7 carrier rocket from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in south China’s Hainan province. “China launched cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-3 on Monday to deliver supplies for its under-construction space station,” the official news agency Xinhua said, quoting CMSA.The Tianzhou-3 is carrying supplies including water and propellant to sustain missions in the future and will dock with China’s Tianhe space station, which is expected to become operational in 2022. The Tianzhou-3 mission is the fourth of 11 missions designed to build China’s space station, Tiangong or “Heavenly Palace”.The combination of the Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecraft and a Long March-7 Y4 carrier rocket was transferred to the launching area of the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site last week. “On September 18, Tianzhou-2, the predecessor of Tianzhou-3, separated with the space station’s core module, conducted a fly-around and docked with the space station core module’s front-facing port,” China’s official English broadcaster, CGTN said in a report on Monday.Monday’s launch comes days after China concluded its Shenzhou-12 manned mission on September 17 with three Chinese astronauts returning to Earth after completing their three-month mission including two spacewalks and setting the Chinese record for the longest crewed spaceflight mission. On June 17, China had launched the Shenzhou-12 mission carrying three astronauts to stay at an under-construction space station.The return capsule of the Shenzhou-12 spaceship, carrying astronauts Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo, touched down at the Dongfeng landing site in north China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Its successor, the Shenzhou-13 spaceship will carry another three astronauts to the space station, who will stay six months in orbit, the CMSA had said. Tianzhou-3 is carrying the supplies for the crew of Shenzhou-13, which is scheduled to be launched in October.In late April, China had sent to space Tianhe, the management and control hub of Tiangong, the permanent space station, which it plans to complete by 2022 as part of its ambitious space programme.Once built, China’s space station, Tiangong or “Heavenly Palace, will be the only alternative to the two-decade-old, US-led International Space Station (ISS), which may be retired in 2024, Reuters news agency had reported earlier.The ISS - from which China is excluded - comprises Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and 11 member states of the European Space Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-unmanned-spacecraft-with-supplies-for-under-construction-space-station-101632127325450.html

But he was deemed fit to receive a license for the semi-automatic shotgun he used in the attack.On the day of that attack -- one of the worst in recent Russian history -- President Vladimir Putin called for a review of gun control laws.In November 2019, a 19-year-old student in the far eastern town of Blagoveshchensk opened fire at his college, killing one classmate and injuring three other people before shooting and killing himself.In October 2018, another teenage gunman killed 20 people at a Kerch technical college in Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.He was shown in camera footage wearing a similar T-shirt to Eric Harris, one of the killers in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in the US, which left 13 people dead.The Crimea shooter was able to legally obtain a gun licence after undergoing marksmanship training and being examined by a psychiatrist.The country's FSB security service says it has prevented dozens of armed attacks on schools in recent years.In February 2020 the FSB said it had detained two teenagers on suspicion of plotting an attack on a school in the city of Saratov with weapons and homemade explosives.Authorities have claimed that young Russians are being increasingly exposed to negative influences online, especially from the West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-8-dead-in-russian-campus-shooting-second-deadly-attack-in-months-101632125914788.html

Under that agreement French defense contractor Naval Group would build 12 submarines.The blindside led to the angry diplomatic response from Paris.French President Emmanuel Macron and Biden are expected to discuss the matter in the coming days.Continued tension on the Korean PeninsulaThe soured relations among Western allies comes amid a number of missile tests conducted by the Korean neighbors.North Korea test-fired two ballistic missiles last week. A few days before that state media reported the successful launch of a new long-range cruise missile capable of hitting targets 1,500 kilometers (932 miles).South Korea meanwhile successfully fired a submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM).The North didn't appear to be too impressed with Seoul's technology advancements.The head of Pyongyang's defence science agency Jang Chang Ha, called the effort, a "clumsy piece of work," adding, "the homegrown SLBM unveiled by South Korea will not be able to serve as an effective means of attack at war."While Jang said the South's SLBM test was rudimentary it did display level of intent."The South's enthusiastic efforts to improve submarine weapons systems clearly presage intensified military tension on the Korean peninsula," Jang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-warns-of-arms-race-in-france-australia-submarine-row-101632125338729.html

Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said that the administration will be created in the framework of Islamic principles and there is no need to give it the name of a ministry or its sub-division, reported The Khaama Press News Agency.The Khaama Press said Mujahid, who is also the Taliban deputy minister of information and culture, has said in his recent interview said that the women’s ministry of the previous government did nothing for the betterment of the lives of Afghan women. Despite the existence of the ministry, the women in the rural areas of Afghanistan were not given their basic rights, Mujahid added.Also read | ‘Afghanistan's future depends on…’: Unesco urges reopening girls' schoolsLast week, the Taliban replaced signs for Afghanistan’ women's ministry with those for their moral police in the capital city of Kabul. Reuters reported citing photographs and witnesses that the sign for the building was covered by a replacement in a mixture of Dari and Arabic, reading "Ministries of Prayer and Guidance and the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice" on Friday. Women staff said they were told to go home after they tried to return to work at the ministry for several weeks since the Taliban takeover last month.When the Taliban were last in power from 1996 to 2001 girls were not allowed to attend school and women were banned from work and education. The ministry for promotion of virtue and prevention of vice during their last regime became known as the group's moral police. The ministry’s interpretation of Sharia included a strict dress code and public executions and beatings. However, Taliban officials have said they will not return to their earlier fundamentalist policies, including banning girls from receiving an education.Also read | No respect: Afghan rights commission says Taliban using its cars, other assetsAs the Taliban announced the list of cabinet posts earlier this month it included an acting minister for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice but made no mention of a women's minister. And, last week a senior Taliban leader said women would not be allowed to work in government ministries with men. The latest comment by the Taliban also comes as the girls have not been allowed to attend secondary and high schools.On Sunday, dozens of women activists protested outside the women's ministry on after it was closed by the Taliban. "The ministry of women's affairs must be reactivated. The removal of women means the removal of human beings,” Baseera Tawana, one of the protesters outside the building, told Reuters. Another protester, Taranum Sayeedi, said “the woman of Afghanistan today is not the woman of 26 years ago."

20-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Indo-Canadian MPs in Justin Trudeau cabinet expected to retain their seats||All the Indo-Canadian ministers in incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet appear to be retaining their seats in the House of Commons while New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh is comfortably ahead of his closest challenger.Between them, the three main parties, the ruling Liberals under Justin Trudeau, the principal opposition Conservatives and the NDP, have fielded as many as 54 Indo-Canadian candidates. The Liberals have 20 such nominees, the Conservatives 18 and the NDP 16.The community could be eyeing a record number of seats in the House of Commons. In 2019, as many as 23 Indo-Canadians were victorious in the Federal elections, besting the mark established in 2015, when there were 21 MPs elected.The four most prominent candidates including minister of national defence Harjit Sajjan, minister of public services and procurement Anita Anand, minister of diversity and inclusion and youth Bardish Chagger and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. The latter pair is most comfortably positioned to retain their seats. Jagmeet Singh retained the Burnaby South riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) in the province of British Columbia with 37.7% of the vote in 2019, but has since expanded his support and is polling at 44%, according to the figures available at the tracking website 338 Canada. Similarly, Bardish Chagger is almost certain of being re-elected as she is receiving support at nearly the levels that saw her win the Waterloo in Ontario in 2019, which is around 49%.Bardish Chagger’s two Indo-Canadian Cabinet colleagues are facing closer contests but both are leading. Harjit Sajjan is recording around 42% of support, around the same level as in the previous federal elections and with votes being split between his Conservative and NDP rivals, he will be tipped to win again from Vancouver South in British Columbia. Anita Anand, meanwhile, is enjoying approximately 43% support, three points lower than when she first entered Parliament in 2019 from Oakville in Ontario but still three points ahead of her Conservative opponent.Perhaps the most high-profile Indo-Canadian trailing is former minister of state in the Conservative government of PM Stephen Harper, Tim Uppal. Uppal won from Edmonton Mill Woods in Alberta with over 50% of the votes cast in 2019, but is only at 35% in this cycle, two points behind his Liberal Party rival.Areas dominated by Indo-Canadians, including the Greater Toronto Area, Metro Vancouver and sections of the cities of Edmonton and Calgary will be critical in defining the overall outcome of the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-indo-canadian-mps-in-justin-trudeau-cabinet-expected-to-retain-their-seats-101632117304917.html
20-09-2021||World||Justin Trudeau vs Erin O’Toole: Who will Canadians vote for?||As Canadians head for voting booths few hours from now, the race for the 44th federal elections has turned into a battle between contrasting views of Liberal Party leader and incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his bête noire Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole on the management of Covid-19.Justin Trudeau is pitching its management of the Covid-19 pandemic and leveraging the wedge issue of vaccine passports against the principal opposition Conservatives, as its leader Erin O’Toole has opposed imposition of mandatory vaccination. That single issue has bolstered the campaign of incumbent Justin Trudeau to return to power in Ottawa, and indications on the eve of the election are that he may even have an outside chance at capturing the majority he craved for while precipitating snap elections on August 15. But to secure that, his party will require optimum results across marginal contests.With Western Canada, particularly the province of Alberta, suffering from the fourth wave of the coronavirus, Justin Trudeau has, with some success, linked that to the failure of the provincial governments which are all run by right-of-centre parties and their ties to Erin O’Toole. He has described the fourth wave as one caused by the unvaccinated while accusing Erin O’Toole for indulging anti-vaxxers. Canada, Justin Trudeau said, at a campaign event on Sunday, was “at a crossroads, at a moment where we have to make a really important choice”. That single factor may have given Justin Trudeau’s party enough impetus for a majority, which may have been unthinkable a week back.Erin O’Toole, meanwhile, is also making this a referendum, not just on Justin Trudeau but also on his “selfish” call for elections in the midst of the fourth wave, an issue that continues to resonate with voters. “Now is the time for Canadians to make a choice. We can choose to settle for second-best - for a party that hardly tries and barely delivers. Or, we can choose to believe in a brighter, better, more united future,” Erin O’Toole said.Both leaders spent some of the last day campaigning in Canada’s most populous province Ontario, which could prove crucial in determining the shape of the next government.Surveys on the last day continue to predict that the Liberals will not garner a majority. The CBC Poll Tracker placed the ruling party’s vote share at 31.3%, translating to 155 seats and the Conservatives at 30.9% and 119 seats. If that holds, both parties will lose two seats from their 2019 tally in the 338-seat House of Commons.Turnout amid voter malaise could be the x-factor in the final outcome. The agency Ipsos Canada forecast a “photo finish” to the contest. Its CEO Darrell Bricker tweeted, “Here’s what I’m seeing. It’s very close. Tory vote a bit more certain, energetic than LPC vote but incumbents have built in advantages. Do they cancel out? Hard to gauge.”It’s really that uncertain, but the edge definitely lies with Justin Trudeau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-vs-erin-o-toole-who-will-canadians-vote-for-101632115145042.html
20-09-2021||World||‘Afghanistan's future depends on…’: Unesco urges reopening girls' schools||Days after the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan ordered only boys and male teachers to come back to schools, restricting entry of girls, the United Nations (UN) said that doing so violates the fundamental right to education, the Tolo News reported on Sunday.The Taliban allowed boys from classes 6-12 to and male teachers to attend schools from September 18. “All male teachers and students should attend their educational institutions,” a statement from the education ministry said ahead of classes resuming.After the Islamic Emirate's violent takeover of Afghanistan last month, some schools reopened for girls up to class 6 and women were also allowed to visit universities, Hindustan Times reported last week. However, high schools still remain closed for girls.In a statement, Audrey Azoulay, the director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco), warned about the "irreversible consequences" if girls are not permitted to resume schools at all levels of education swiftly.“In particular, the delayed return of girls to secondary school may risk them being left behind in education and ultimately, in life. It increases the risk of dropping out from education altogether and exposes them to negative coping mechanisms such as child marriage,” Azoulay said.The top Unesco official pointed out that the learning disparities between boys and girls would widen and would also hinder the latter's access to higher education and life opportunities.According to Unesco, Afghanistan has made crucial gains in the education sector in the last 20 years with female literacy doubling up from 17% to 30% since 2001, the Tolo news report said.The number of girls in primary schools surged from zero in 2001 to a massive 2.5 million in 2018. The number of girls in high educational institutions in Afghanistan also went up from 5,000 in 2001 to 90,000 in 2018, the report added.Urging all relevant stakeholders in the war-ravaged country to ensure that all children have unhindered access to education within the framework of the gradual reopening of schools, Audrey Azoulay said that the future of Afghanistan depends on the educated girls and boys and the right to education must be upheld at this critical period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistans-future-depends-on-unesco-urges-reopening-girls-schools-101632104812102.html

The mountainous Panjshir province in the northeastern part of Afghanistan held on for the longest time, with the support from resistance leader Ahmad Massoud and former vice president Amrullah Saleh.And it was not just the men who hit back. "I fought them with stones," 24-year-old Lailuma told New York Post. She said her whole family - husband, brothers, cousins, father-in-law, mother-in-law - was fighting the Taliban.Scores of other women too joined Lailuma and said they fought the Taliban with stones.Also Read | In new diktat, Taliban ask Kabul's women workers to 'stay at home'She is now living in a displacement camp in national capital Kabul after fleeing Panjshir. Armed with enormous weapons arsenal seized from the Afghan army, Taliban fighters continued their relentless advance and captured the Panjshir valley.Another resident of the province told the Post that the fighting is still on in Panjshir. Murtaza was hiding in the mountains for day before being found by the Taliban and stuffed into the overcrowded Kabul camp.Lailuma, meanwhile, vowed to "follow Massoud till my last breath". She hopes to go back to her home some day.Panjshir fighters earned a legendary reputation for resistance, defending their mountain homes first from the Soviet military for a decade, throughout the following civil war, and against the first Taliban regime from 1996-2001.The 115-kilometre (70-mile) valley surrounded by jagged snow-capped peaks offers defenders a natural advantage.But two decades since the late veteran fighter Ahmad Shah Massoud led the Panjshiris to victory, the province is no longer as isolated.On August 30, the Taliban launched a multi-pronged offensive - with some residents claiming the Panjshiri fighters were outnumbered three-to-one.

There is a lot at stake for Canada's Liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau whose popularity has plunged majorly, placing him in a tight race with Conservative leader Erin O'Toole.According to the Canadian government data, over 27 million people are eligible to vote in this year's general elections. Approximately 5.78 million ballots have already been cast in advance polls.As per the pre-poll survey, neither the Liberals nor the right-leaning Conservatives have the 38% public support needed for a majority.Trudeau called the vote two years early to seek approval for his left-of-center government's handling of the pandemic and regain the Parliamentary majority he lost in 2019. His initial healthy lead in the race vanished amid unhappiness with the early call.Here key things to know about the snap elections:> Canada is a parliamentary democracy and Monday's vote will decide the 338 seats at the lower house of the Parliament, the House of Commons.> A party needs to secure a majority of 170 seats to successfully form their government.> The polls booths will open and close at staggered times across Canada due to the several time zones across the country. The last polls will close at 7pm (local time) on the country’s west coast.> The federal election campaign comes at a time when the country is going through a Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to this, issues like climate crisis, healthcare, housing and economy are also at the centre stage.> The outcome of Monday's vote is wholly unpredictable as the two main parties who've ruled Canada since its confederation in 1867 are neck and neck, with about 31 per cent of poll respondents saying they intend to vote for each.> According to experts, in case Trudeau does win the polls, it would most likely be a minority government, which would leave him dependent again on other parties to govern.> Besides Trudeau and O'Toole, other leaders of smaller factions include the leftist New Democratic Party's Jagmeet Singh, Yves-François Blanchet of separatist Bloc Quebecois and the Green's Annamie Paul.> The final results are expected to be delayed as mail-in ballots which are expected to number in the hundreds of thousands, will be counted.> Forty-seven-year-old O’Toole is a military veteran and former lawyer. He served as a member of Parliament for nine years.> Trudeau gambled that Canadians would reward his adept handling of the pandemic and smooth vaccine rollout by returning him to Ottawa with a strong majority that would allow him to pass his agenda without opposition support. Whatever the outcome, the election will almost certainly be deemed a failure for Trudeau, as it has weakened his political standing.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-polls-today-key-things-to-know-about-trudeau-vs-o-toole-battle-101632097102753.html

Here's what's on agenda||The 76th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) is set to kick off its high-level week, where discussions will be held on expanding access to Covid-19 vaccines and confronting the rising dangers of climate change. After being held virtually last year due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the event will see physical participation of leaders from members states in New York.It will go on till September 27 and the entourage accompanying the visiting leaders won't be as large as in the past due to Covid-19 restrictions. Delegations will be limited to four members each in the main UN hall, while side events will be mostly virtual.Here are the key points about the UN event:• More than 100 world leaders are expected for the annual UN General Assembly.• Heads of state scheduled to attend the event include US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.• Russia's Vladimir Putin, Chinese president Xi Jinping, France's Emmanuel Macron and Ebrahim Raisi, the new president of Iran will be among the no-shows.• The UN wants diplomats to have the face-to-face time they need to address crisis issues. However, a cap has been put on the size of entourage etc to prevent it from becoming a super-spreader event.• On climate change, Johnson will call upon world leaders to take a "concrete action". His visit is seen as an important precursor to the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) UN climate summit, to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow in November.• US President Joe Biden will focus on ending the Covid-19 pandemic, combating the climate crisis and defending human rights, democracy and the international rules-based order in his first address as the US President to the high-level UN General Assembly session next week.• UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will meet Biden on September 20 in New York City. Biden will address the General Debate on September 21, the first address of his presidency to world leaders from the iconic General Assembly hall.• He is also likely to speak about the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan after the Taliban seized Kabul. Biden will seek to assure the world that America is still a reliable leader on the multilateral stage despite its rushed withdrawal.• Foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - US, Russia, the UK, China and France - are expected to discuss the situation in Afghanistan in a meeting on Wednesday.• The week will end with the leaders of some of America's closest allies in Asia - Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga - heading to Washington for the first in-person meeting of the Quad bloc on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/actionpacked-week-of-un-general-assembly-to-begin-here-s-what-s-on-agenda-101632101667026.html

The photo, which shows her standing between two painted wings, was captioned with a broken heart and the words: "She touched the world."Laundrie has been named a "person of interest" in the case but has not been seen since leaving his family's home in North Port, Florida, last Tuesday. North Port is on the west coast of Florida, some 70 miles (112 km) south of St. Petersburg.Before disappearing, Laundrie had refused to speak with investigators and retained a lawyer.‘Heartbroken’North Port police said they only learned from Laundrie's family on Friday that he had been missing for three days. They have since been combing a nearly 25,000-acre (10,000-hectare) wilderness preserve near North Port for him, without success."Saddened and heartbroken to learn that Gabby has been found deceased," North Port police said on Twitter. "Our focus from the start, along with the FBI, and national partners, has been to bring her home. We will continue to work with the FBI in the search for more answers."Petito and Laundrie left her home state of New York in June, heading west in the van with plans to visit national parks along the way and documenting the trip on social media.Petito posted her last photo on Aug. 25. Her family believes she was headed to Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming when they last heard from her. She was last seen walking out of a hotel in Salt Lake City on Aug. 24.Last week, police in Moab, Utah, released body camera footage of an Aug. 12 encounter two of their officers had with the couple during a traffic stop.In the video, Petito is sobbing as she describes a quarrel with Laundrie that she says became physical at times. The officers did not detain the couple but insisted they spend that night separately, Petito in the van and Laundrie at a hotel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-says-body-matching-description-of-missing-gabby-petito-found-in-wyoming-101632100464989.html

We do not expect it to happen often, its a fluke."There were also dead bees on the scene," he told AFP by telephone.The protected birds, found on Friday, were from a colony at Simonstown, a small town near Cape Town.The area is a national park and the Cape honey bees are part of the ecosystem."The penguins... must not die just like that as they are already in danger of extinction. They are a protected species," said Roberts.The South African National Parks said the birds were taken to the foundation for post-mortems and samples sent for disease and toxicology testing."There were no external physical injuries found on any of the birds," a parks statement said.The post-mortems showed all the penguins had multiple bee stings.African penguins, which inhabit the coast and islands of southern Africa, are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list, meaning they face a high risk of extinction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bees-kill-63-endangered-penguins-in-a-beach-outside-south-africa-s-cape-town-101632099818133.html
20-09-2021||World||India upset with UK’s fresh vaccine-linked travel curbs||The latest changes in the UK government’s Covid-19-related travel restrictions have upset the Indian side as travellers who have got both doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine will be considered “unvaccinated” and will have to undergo 10 days of quarantine.The new rules, which were unveiled on Friday and will become effective from October 4, were described by the UK as an attempt to change the current “red, amber, green traffic light system” to a single red list of countries and “simplified travel measures” for arrivals from around the world.Under these rules, only people who have got both shots of a double-dose vaccine such as Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna or the single shot Janssen vaccine “under an approved vaccination program in the UK, Europe, US or UK vaccine programme overseas” will be considered fully vaccinated.The rules also consider who have received jabs under public health bodies in Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahrain, Brunei,Canada, Dominica, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea or Taiwan as fully vaccinated.Effectively, this means even Indians who have received both doses of Covishield, the local version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and one of the two main vaccines being used for the domestic immunisation programme, will be considered unvaccinated. The Indian side is especially upset as the issue of vaccination-related travel restrictions has been repeatedly taken up with the UK at the highest levels, including by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and external affairs minister S Jaishankar, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.During his visit to the UK in July, foreign secretary Shringla called for early removal of travel restrictions for Indians and the mutual recognition of vaccination certificates during his discussions with British interlocutors. He pointed out that France had cleared travellers from India without quarantine if they were fully vaccinated and had a negative test. “The ministry of external affairs has been working on solving the issue,” a senior central government functionary said on condition of anonymity.The European Union (EU) has left it to individual member states to decide on acceptance of Indian vaccination certificates and more than a dozen members have recognised Covishield.The people cited above said the change in UK rules will mostly affect students, who are now returning in large numbers to British universities or travelling to Britain to start new courses. The change will mean they will have to pay extra for more tests and to quarantine.The Indian side has also been insisting on mutual recognition of vaccination certificates in negotiations with other countries. The people said New Delhi will be in a better position to press this issue once travel to India also starts opening up.Another person aware of the matter said New Delhi will be in a better position to press this issue once travel to India also starts opening up. Apart from the a digital vaccination certificate, India recently launched a new application programming interface (API) to easily verify whether a person is vaccinated against Covid-19 or not using the CoWIN platform.Besides India, several other countries are upset by the change in the UK’s travel restrictions, including countries in Africa, South America and West Asia that have been using the Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that are also used in Britain.In August, the UK had eased travel restrictions on India, and at that time, travellers from the country were no longer needed to undergo 10-day mandatory hotel quarantine. The move benefited thousands of Indians, mainly students, professionals and those who have family in the UK, who had been effectively barred from travelling to Britain after the second wave of infections in India.With inputs by Rhythma Kaul||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-upset-with-uk-s-fresh-vaccine-linked-travel-curbs-101632077253049.html
20-09-2021||India||Govt may investigate Amazon bribery charges||India may investigate allegations that lawyers representing Amazon bribed officials, provided there is some evidence to that effect, two government officials said, asking not to be named. The officials were reacting to a report published on Monday by the website The Morning Context, which said the US-headquartered e-commerce firm had opened an investigation after a whistleblower said lawyers associated with the company bribed officials. “The online retailer is looking into the conduct of its legal representatives in India after allegations of corruption come to light,” the report said.Reacting to the report, Amazon India on Monday said it has zero tolerance for corruption, and it takes appropriate action against any such practice after an investigation. “We have zero tolerance for corruption. We take allegations of improper actions seriously, investigate them fully, and take appropriate action,” a spokesperson said when asked to comment on the report, without offering details. “We are not commenting on specific allegations or the status of any investigation at this time.” The whistleblower pointed to the role of an independent lawyer hired by the company, The Morning Context report said, citing unnamed people aware of the matter. The legal fees paid to the lawyer was in part “funnelled into bribing government officials”, the report said, citing the whistleblower. A senior corporate counsel at Amazon’s in-house legal team has been suspended, the website reported. The government is yet to receive any information or formal complaint on the matter, one of the government officials said. “Even the news report does not provide any specific detail about the alleged bribe, such as which era, which state, and who were the recipients of illegal gratification,” the official pointed out. The involvement of the central government on operational matters is minimal, as its job is to frame policy and rules, the official said, explaining that the actual business activities, such as warehousing, take place in the states. The government will certainly take action against any corporate entity indulging in any illegal activity as per the law of the land, but action will have to be based on facts and not media reports, the official added. The government is aware of unconfirmed reports and appropriate agencies may take up the matter after ascertaining facts, a second official said. There are reports that Amazon has been spending more than ₹2,000 crore in legal fees. “It’s time to think where all of this is going,” the official said.The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of the US is stringent on such matters, according to an industry expert who has been engaged by a US firm. The law prohibits American firms and individuals from paying bribes to foreign officials, and prominent instances involving its violation have in the past led to settlements running into hundreds of millions of dollars. The expert requested anonymity.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which represent about 70 million domestic retail stores, said it will approach Gary Genseter, chairman, the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), which is the repository body of FCPA, and also the corporate governance committee of Amazon Board, demanding a “fair and independent probe” into the matter. The lobby group has written to Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal, urging him to institute an enquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The latest allegations add to the legal problems Amazon has faced in India. These include a bruising fight with Future Retail after the latter signed a deal with a Reliance Industries subsidiary, a Competition Commission of India investigation into alleged collusion between Amazon and its principal e-commerce rival Flipkart, and even police complaints that were filed relating to shows on Amazon’s Prime Video platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-investigate-amazon-bribery-charges-101632162487024.html

20-09-2021||India||Channi takes over, but Congress drama continues||Chandigarh: Charanjit Singh Channi was sworn in as the Punjab chief minister on Monday, becoming the state’s first Dalit CM, even as a political controversy over the change of guard just months ahead of assembly elections in the state grew with changing power dynamics within the ranks of the Congress.In his first comment after taking oath, Channi promised free water supply to smaller homes, a reduction in power tariff and a transparent government for the “common man”, and urged the Centre to repeal the three “black” farm laws.With under five months to go for the state elections, Captain Amarinder Singh resigned on Saturday after the Congress summoned a meeting of its lawmakers in the state, saying that he felt “humiliated”, but adding that he won’t accept newly appointed party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu as the next CM or the party’s face in the coming polls.Hours before the swearing-in ceremony on Monday, the Congress’s Punjab incharge Harish Rawat said the upcoming state elections will be fought under the leadership of Sidhu. Calling the statement “baffling”, former state unit chief Sunil Jakhar said it could “undermine” the authority of the new CM.Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni, both ministers in the Amarinder cabinet, were sworn in as deputy chief ministers at the ceremony, which was also attended by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Amarinder skipped the swearing-in ceremony.At his first press conference as the CM, Channi, 58, teared up and described himself as an “aam aadmi (common) man”, while thanking the Congress leadership for picking him for the post. The chief minister said his would be a “government of the poor, for the poor and with the poor”.There will be no water and sewage charges for houses up to 150 or 200 square yards in urban areas, he said. The government will also reduce the electricity tariff, Channi said.“My wife is a doctor, my brother is a doctor. There are employees in my house. When the power bill comes, my wife tells me that the money goes from her pocket… these bills will be reduced,” the three-time MLA from Chamkaur Sahib said.While Channi did not divulge the details of the schemes, his promises in the poll-bound state appear to rival those announced by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has pitched itself as the main Opposition party in the state.Channi also urged the Centre to repeal the three contentious farm laws which have led to months-long protests across the country. Asserting that the Congress supports the agitating farmers, Channi said: “Together, we have to make Punjab prosperous. Punjab is primarily an agrarian state. This government is pro-farmer.”Hundreds of thousands of farmers, largely from Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, have been protesting since last November, seeking a repeal of the farm laws. Several rounds of consultations with the central government have failed to resolve the deadlock.Besides Rahul Gandhi, Rawat, party leader Ajay Maken, former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, Punjab Congress chief Sidhu, and Manpreet Singh Badal also attended the ceremony at the Raj Bhawan.After Channi’s election as the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader, the appointment of Randhawa, a Jat Sikh, and Soni, a Hindu, is being seen as an attempt by the Congress to balance the caste equations ahead of the polls and counter the attempt of rival parties to woo Dalit voters.While the Bharatiya Janata Party has declared that if voted to power, it will have a Dalit CM, the Shiromani Akali Dal has tied up with the Bahujan Samaj Party, with the promise to pick a deputy CM from the community. At 32%, Dalits constitute almost one-third of the state’s population – the highest anywhere in the country.After Rawat’s remark appeared to suggest that Sidhu will lead the efforts of the Congress for the assembly elections, Jakhar tweeted: “On the swearing-in day of Sh @Charnjit_channi as Chief Minister, Mr Rawats’s statement that ‘elections will be fought under Sidhu’, is baffling. It’s likely to undermine CM’s authority but also negate the very ‘raison d’être’ of his selection for this position.” Jhakhar was removed from the post of the state unit president to make way for Sidhu’s appointment.Soon, the Congress went into damage control, saying that Channi and Sidhu will both be “our” faces for the Punjab elections in 2022.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the next Punjab assembly elections will be fought under the leadership of both Channi and Sidhu, and attacked the BJP, Akali Dal, BSP and Aam Aadmi Party for allegedly insulting a Dalit chief minister.He also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP leadership on why they had not named any Dalit as their chief minister and why they and other leaders of the BSP, AAP and Akali Dal were undermining the young Congress Dalit leader.“Our faces will be Charanjit Singh Channi and Navjot Singh Sidhu as also ordinary Congress workers and leaders who will be supporting them. If anybody says one or the other will be the face, intentionally or otherwise, it is being misinterpreted by the media,” he told reporters.Channi is the chief minister and Sidhu is the organisation head of the Congress in Punjab, and the next elections will be fought under both of them, he added.Channi is learnt to have started consultations with the state president and other senior leaders for the expansion of his cabinet. There are indications that several new faces, including the leaders who rebelled against Amarinder Singh, may be inducted to make a clean break from the previous administration. Punjab Congress working president Sangat Singh Gilzian has sought due representation for backward classes in the cabinet. “OBCs constitute 31% of the state’s population. Their concerns need to be addressed,” he told reporters on Monday. Calling Channi’s appointment a mere “election stunt”, opposition parties hit out at the Congress on Monday.The BJP fronted its Dalit leaders to target the Congress and dared the party to make a public promise that Channi will be its chief ministerial face in Punjab if it was sincere about its move.BJP general secretary Dushyant Kumar Gautam, who is the party’s incharge for the state, said, “This is an old habit of the Congress. It believes that it can capture Dalit vote bank by making a Dalit chief minister for a few months. A conspiracy is being hatched in Punjab to grab Dalit vote bank.”BSP chief Mayawati, meanwhile, said that the Congress is rattled by the SAD-BJP alliance for the Punjab Assembly polls.“Congress still does not have faith in Dalits. Dalits need to be very alert to their double standards. I have full faith that Dalits will not fall for this stunt,” Mayawati said.Channi was elected the CLP leader on Sunday, a day after two-time chief minister Amarinder Singh stepped down, capping a long-drawn and bitter tussle in the Congress state unit. Channi, Randhawa and Soni were among the cabinet ministers who rebelled against Amarinder Singh amid his power struggle with party leader Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was appointed the state unit president last month despite Amarinder’s opposition. While Amarinder did not attend the swearing-in ceremony, Channi called him a “protector of water rights”. The new CM said his government will remain committed to the Congress leadership’s 18-point agenda for the state and the previous election promises will be fulfilled. “We will ensure a transparent government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/channi-takes-over-but-congress-drama-continues-101632162247044.html
20-09-2021||India||Banks themselves will drive bad bank, says Nirmala Sitharaman||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said that she was confident the National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL), effectively a bad bank, will work because “this entire mechanism is driven by the banks”. Last week, the finance minister announced ₹30,600 crore in government guarantees that will back the securities issued by NARCL to acquire bad loans worth ₹2 lakh crore. NARCL will buy these loans that are fully provided for by banks; the move will reduce bad loans on the books of banks, she announced. “Because this entire mechanism was driven by the banks; many of these big-ticket exposures are through consortia; unless all banks agree, no resolution is possible. Now because it’s through IBA (Indian Banks’ Association) it’s for them to constantly keep moving towards better resolution, towards consensus,” Sitharaman said in an interview with Hindustan Times. When asked if enough had been done for the telecom sector as part of a relief package announced recently, she said: “Definitely. The way in which the package has come – it also brings in reforms. It removes a lot of anomalies, and constraints. Business has been given space to breathe. Government wants that sector to be run in a free manner and also have more than two or three players. For free and fair competition, markets should be given play; and customers will benefit.” A four-year moratorium on dues, and the option for the government to convert dues into equity after the moratorium period expires, and prospectively redefining how adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues are computed were key elements of the relief package approved by the Union Cabinet. During last week’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting, it was decided that the time was not appropriate for moving fuel under GST. On when such a move would be ideal, she said: “To a large extent, that depends on states feeling comfortable. States feel that they have very few items on which they can have a consideration to increase or decrease tax. Tax on fuel, liquor are in their hands. They feel that at this time they need to have revenues, and reach a level where they can let it go. I wouldn’t want to push states at a time like this.” Amid the growing hold of cryptocurrencies across the world and suggestions that India could develop its own digital currency, Sitharaman said such a decision has to be thought through. “We have to evolve something suitable for our systems. India has the strength of the technology; fintech gives us the command over the instrumentalities with which you can play; our economy is full of possibilities. So we have to be cautious; but we have to think it through.” The finance minister also said she felt reassured about where the Indian economy stood currently. “Indians have faced it all (because of Covid), have suffered, and have shown grit to come out of it. How much ever you do — and our government tried doing as much as it could – will not be enough. This is the kind of pandemic the world has not seen before, so I am willing to hear everything people say of what we could have done [better] and so on. But I am immensely grateful to the people of India. And looking at the way the vaccination drive is progressing, I feel we will come through it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banks-themselves-will-drive-bad-bank-says-nirmala-sitharaman-101632162127031.html
20-09-2021||India||SC stays ₹15,000 payout for viewer who did not find trailer song in film||The Supreme Court on Monday stayed an order directing production house Yash Raj Films to pay a compensation of ₹15,000 to a viewer who felt cheated for not finding a song, publicised in the trailer of the 2016 Bollywood movie “Fan”, while watching the film at the theatre.The court stayed the order of the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC), which was passed on February 18, 2020, but questioned the production house for marketing the film with the song that wasn’t in the movie.A bench of justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian said, “The problem is that you (production house) show something else in the trailer which is not there in the movie. When the trailer is released it is a trailer of the movie. Why were you marketing your movie with the song when you knew it was meant to be for promotion of the film?”The song in question was “Jabra Fan” composed by Vishal Dadlani along with Shekhar Ravjianii. In 2016, Afreen Fatima Zaidi, a teacher from Maharashtra’s Aurangabad, heard the song and went to watch the film starring Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan. After the movie, a disappointed Zaidi filed a complaint before the district consumer court, which rejected her petition. She later approached the Maharashtra Consumer Commission, which held on September 22, 2017, that Yash Raj Films was liable to compensate Zaidi a sum of ₹10,000 along with litigation expenses of ₹5,000. This order was upheld in 2020 by the National Consumer Commission. On Monday’s hearing, Yash Raj Films -- represented by advocate Naomi Chandra -- argued it was common practice in the industry to feature songs in trailers, and not in the final movie. “The order of the National Consumer court must be stayed as it has far reaching consequences on the entire film industry,” Chandra said. “If there is a common practice in the industry that does not mean that the practice should continue,” the bench observed, issuing a notice to Zaidi and staying the consumer commission’s order. The question to be decided is whether the producer of a movie can be said to be a service provider as a movie ticket is a contract between the person who buys it and the cinema hall owner who exhibits the film. “You need to give plausible explanation,” the bench said. The order released on the court’s website did not specify when the matter will be heard next. The National Consumer Commission, in its 2020 order, had agreed with Zaidi that there was reason for her to feel cheated and that the decision to not feature the trailer song in the movie amounted to “unfair trade practice”.The commission had said that “if a person likes the song shown in the promo and based upon such liking decides to visit a cinema hall for watching the said movie for a consideration, he is bound to feel deceived, disappointed and dejected if the song shown in the promo is not found in the film. The practice of including a song in the promo of a film shown widely on TV Channels but excluding the said song while exhibiting the movie, in my opinion, constitutes an unfair trade practice”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-15-000-payout-for-viewer-who-did-not-find-trailer-song-in-film-101632162067016.html

20-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Sept 21, 1955 — East Germany becomes sovereign state, treaty with Russia signed||Moscow – Arshal Bulganin, Soviet Prime Minister, and Herr Otto Grotewohl, East German Premier, today signed a treaty restoring sovereignty to East Germany. The pact was signed in the Kremlin after four days of talks between top-ranking delegations from the two Governments. The new agreement follows the sovereignty given to the West German Government by the Western Big-Three Powers. Soviet troops will remain in East Germany as long as British. American and French forces stay in West Germany but the treaty provides that they shall not interfere in the internal affairs of East German Democratic Republic. The pact will be valid until the restoration of the ur.ity of Germany or until the two parties come to an agreement on an alteration or annulment of it. It will come into force with the exchange of documents of ratification which will take place in Berlin shortly. Yesterday Marshal Bulganin announced that all decisions and laws passed by the former Allied Control Council as they applied to East Germany between 1945 and 1948 were invalidated. REUNIFICATION The East German Government would in future be responsible for the control of its own frontiers. Dr Lothar Bolz, East German Foreign Minister, submitted the draft of the treaty of friendship to a meeting of the two delegations, Tass reported yesterday. Soviet policy that it is the two Germanys which must settle the question of reunification and a strong denunciation of N.A.T.O. were features of a statement made by Mr Khurschev, First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, at yesterday’s talks with the East German Government delegation visiting Moscow. Speaking of next month s meeting of the Big-Four Foreign Ministers in Geneva, Tass reports, Mr Khruschev said: “Out of the four States which will be represented by the Foreign Ministers in Geneva, three belong to the North Atlantic bloc and one State does not belong to this bloc. The Governments of three Powers, together with the Government of the German Federal Republic would like to reunite Germany on their conditions, and want the united Germany also to become a member of N.A.T.O. I am of the opinion that such a solution does not correspond to the interests of the German people, the interests of the security of the European people and the easing of international tension. SERIOUS OBSTACLE “It is quite obvious that the coming into force of the Paris Agreements has created a serious obstacle in the settlement of the German question. We propose the only correct way-the solution of this question (reunification of Germany) should be transferred into the hands of the German people.” After speaking of the recent talks between Dr Adenauer, West German Chancellor, and Russian Government leaders in Moscow leading to agreement on resumption of diplomatic relations, the Soviet Communist Party Chief said: “On our part we shall do everything so that relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal German Republic should develop successfully.” Next he came to the treaty between Russia and East Germany and said: “Our joint decision to retain Soviet troops on your territory is a temporary measure.” He added: “We are ready to withdraw our troops from Germany provided our partners in the war against Hitlerite Germany will withdraw their troops.”-||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-sept-20-1955-e-germany-becomes-sovereign-state-treaty-with-russia-signed-101632156788438.html

The UK will continue to review scientific evidence on other vaccines and keep health measures under regular review, the people said.Visa applications for all categories from Indian nationals continue to be processed and people do not need to be vaccinated to travel to the UK, they added.Regardless of an Indian national’s vaccination status, the person must take a pre-departure test and a Covid-19 test on or before day two of the visit, and on or after day eight, and self-isolate for 10 days. Travellers can opt to shorten their home quarantine to around five days under the UK’s “Test to Release” service.The Indian side was especially upset by the new rules as vaccination-related travel restrictions had been repeatedly taken up with the UK at the highest levels, including by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Shringla, during his visit to the UK in July, called for theearly removal of travel restrictions for Indians and the mutual recognition of Covid-19 vaccination certificates. He had pointed out that France was clearing travellers from India without quarantine if they were fully vaccinated and had a negative test.The new UK rules are expected to mostly affect students, who are now returning in large numbers to British universities. The change will mean they will have to pay extra for more tests and to quarantine.India has been pushing for mutual recognition of Covid-19 vaccination certificates in negotiations with countries around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/working-with-india-says-the-uk-on-recognising-covishield-vaccine-certificate-101632156727527.html
20-09-2021||India||A Dalit chief minister in Punjab: Political masterstroke by the Congress?||Charanjit Singh Channi, who has replaced Amarinder Singh as the chief minister in Punjab, is the first Dalit to hold this office in the state. Punjab is the state with the highest share of Dalits, or Scheduled Castes (SC), in its population. But it is also clear that by selecting a Dalit for the top political job in the state, the Congress is trying to send a larger political message beyond the state’s borders. Kanshi Ram, who was among the tallest Dalit leaders in post-independence India and founded the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), was also a Dalit from Punjab. How successful will this strategy be? Here are four charts which try and answer this question.Not all of Punjab’s SC population is SikhSCs account for 38% of Punjab’s population, the largest among all states in the country. However, not all SCs in Punjab are Sikhs, although the latter are dominant among the state’s SC population. The share of Sikhs belonging to the SC category in Punjab is 27%, while the remaining 11% of the SC population is Hindu. But even 27% is quite high if one compares the share of SC population across states.What is the socio-economic status of Dalits in Punjab?Whichever indicator one takes to look at the socio-economic status of SCs, they are at the bottom of the economic hierarchy in India. Does this also hold true for the SC population in Punjab?This question is worth asking because Punjab is among the richest states in India. In 2018-19, the latest year for which per capita GSDP numbers are available for all major states, Punjab was ranked 10th among 19 major states in the country, and its income was 1.2 times the national per capita income average.India does not even have income statistics; leave alone income statistics across social groupings. So, there are no straight forward answers to the question of well-being levels of SCs in Punjab vis-à-vis the rest of the country. However, there is some statistical evidence on asset levels at the social group levels to answer this question.The 2015-16 round of the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) -- this is the latest period for which data is available for Punjab -- allows classification of households belonging to broad social groups by wealth. Over two-thirds of SC households in Punjab were in the top two quintiles (top 40%), which is significantly higher than the national average, where only 27.2% of the SC population belongs to the top 40% .But the NFHS wealth rankings might not capture rural realityTo be sure, the NFHS classification of household wealth might not capture the reality in rural areas. This is because the NFHS looks at household ownership of consumer goods (such as televisions or cars) and the characteristics of their house (such as source of drinking water, toilet facilities, even the flooring).Things change once ownership of land is taken into account, which is an important determinant of socio-political power in India’s villages. The All-India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS) in 2018-19 collected data on value of land, building, livestock, transport, agricultural equipment, non-farm business equipment and financial assets. An HT analysis of unit-level data of AIDIS shows that the average worth of these assets for an SC household in Punjab was ₹871,386 as on June 30, 2018. This is 87% of the assets owned by an average Indian SC household: ₹996,088.The reason SC households in Punjab do badly compared to their peers in other states in the AIDIS, is (lack of) land ownership. Once land and buildings are taken out of the equation, the results resemble the NFHS trends, and SC households in Punjab are better off compared to those in other states.This also underlines a potential source of tension between the Dalit and non-Dalit population in rural Punjab. Despite lagging behind on land ownership, SCs have made advances as far as their living standards are concerned, which can possibly generate social-political tension.

As many as 23,995,651 people (89.84%) have been given the first dose and 9,975,323 have been inoculated with both doses, she said. Further, 33,928,182 doses of the vaccine have been administered so far in the state, which is one among the worst affected by Covid-19 in India.In a post on the social media platform Facebook, George made the announcement. Moreover, she also said that the Wayanad district in Kerala has already achieved the target and other districts like Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta, Idukki and Ernakulam are moving towards achieving the target.Congratulating the health workers in these districts for their efforts, the minister also called upon the remaining people to get themselves immunised soon. She appealed to the people to shed any hesitancy about the vaccine, noting that the majority of people who lost their lives to the disease were unvaccinated and said that the vigilance against Covid-19 should continue in the state. She also stressed on the need to wear a face mask and maintain social distance and avoid public programmes, gatherings and large crowds.Also read | Kerala says stringent lockdown measures in areas with critical Covid spreadEarlier on August 16, Wayanad, an important tourist destination in the state, became the first district in Kerala where all eligible adults were inoculated with the first dose of the vaccine. Further, the state has set a deadline of September 30, by which all adults should be administered at least one dose of the vaccine. The announcement from the minister came with 10 more days left for the state’s target.Also, the announcement also comes as the Kerala government has announced dates for the reopening of educational institutes in the state. While higher education institutes would resume physical classes by October 4, schools for classes 1 to 7 and classes 10 and 12 would resume from November 1.George reassured that the state ministries of health and education would jointly meet and evaluate the preparations on this front. The evaluations would also factor in the sero prevalence survey report expected by this month’s end, the minister added. She urged students to take their full dosage of vaccines at the earliest.Mentioning about the spread of Dengue virus in the state, the minister asked the public to not worry and said, the propaganda that Dengue 2 is new is “baseless.” She said that Dengue virus has four variants and all have been reported from all states in India including Kerala.On Monday, Kerala continued with its trends of declining daily Covid-19 infections after 15,692 people tested positive for the disease in the last 24 hours. Also, 92 more people succumbed to their illness. With this, the state’s tally reached 4,524,158 and the death toll rose to 23,683, a bulletin from the state government showed. The active caseload was recorded at 167,008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/90-beneficiaries-receive-single-covid-19-vaccine-dose-in-kerala-state-health-minister-lauds-health-workers-101632154737614.html

20-09-2021||India||Afghanistan, China: Harsh Shringla pins down India’s big security challenges||New Delhi: The situation in Afghanistan and the border standoff with China are among the security challenges confronting India, which is concerned about the recent changes in Kabul and their implications for the region, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Monday.While India’s immediate focus has been evacuating its nationals from Afghanistan, the country has backed efforts to ensure that Afghan soil isn’t used for sheltering terrorists or planning terror attacks, Shringla said while addressing JP Morgan’s India Investor Summit.Speaking on the theme “India’s foreign policy and its strategic imperative: The way forward”, he said, New Delhi has told Beijing that peace in the border areas is essential for developing bilateral ties in the wake of Chinese attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) over the past year. Harsh Shringla said India is “naturally concerned about the recent changes within Afghanistan and their implications for us and the region”. He noted the recent UN Security Council resolution 2593 that Afghan territory should not be used for “sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist acts”, and specifically refers to terrorists proscribed by the UN, including those from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). Most Indians were able to leave Kabul in August, and a number of Afghans, including minorities, who wanted to travel to India, have also been able to do so. “However, this process could not be completed due to the security situation at the airport. Resumption of flights from Kabul airport is, therefore, a priority,” he added.India is also monitoring developments related to the humanitarian needs of Afghanistan.“In UNDP’s assessment, there is an imminent threat of poverty levels rising in Afghanistan. There is also a threat of an imminent drought and a food security crisis. It is important for the humanitarian assistance providers to be given unrestricted and direct access to Afghanistan,” Harsh Shringla said. The distribution of humanitarian assistance has to be done in a non-discriminatory manner to all sections of Afghan society, and India’s approach to Afghanistan is guided by the civilisational relationship with the Afghan people, he said.He recalled India’s development aid worth $3 billion and more than 500 projects spread across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan and said these initiatives had earned the country tremendous goodwill.Shringla listed the standoff with China and the situation in Afghanistan among the geopolitical challenges in India’s immediate neighbourhood. These situations were a reminder that traditional security challenges remain even while new realities are making themselves felt.“Chinese attempts over the last year to unilaterally alter the status quo in Ladakh have seriously disturbed peace and tranquillity in the border areas. These acts are in violation of our bilateral agreements and have inevitably impacted other aspects of the bilateral relationship,” he said. “We have made it clear to the Chinese side that peace and tranquillity in border areas are essential for the development of our relationship. Development of India-China relationship can only be based on ‘three mutuals’ – mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests,” he added.Harsh Shringla reiterated India’s stated position that the largely positive trajectory of India-China ties in the past 40 years was largely due to the agreement between the two sides to ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas. India has insisted that the overall normalisation of relations with China is linked to disengagement and de-escalation at friction points on the LAC. On the other hand, Beijing has said New Delhi should take forward relations in other areas while dealing with the border standoff separately.Shringla listed several “megatrends” the country is contending with, including a rebalancing in which global activity is moving towards Asia, the rise of China, the pressure on international systems, the vulnerability of global supply and value chains, emerging technologies, and “a battle between schools of thought”.“The pandemic and its fallout pose the most serious challenge to policymakers in a generation and more. Governance structures, national and international, have been and are being subjected to unprecedented stresses,” he said.India is seeking strategic autonomy, but this does not mean “seeking self-centred arrangements or turning the country inwards”, and the country will work for a less skewed distribution of economic activity by “making Indian businesses and the Indian economy more globalised”, he pointed out.Harsh Shringla said India is set to participate in the first in-person Quad Summit in the US next week and the four members of the grouping are engaged on issues of connectivity, infrastructure, emerging technologies, climate action, education and Covid-19 responses, including vaccine collaboration and resilient supply chains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-china-harsh-shringla-pins-down-india-s-big-security-challenges-101632150486907.html
20-09-2021||India||Covid-19 may be heading towards endemic stage in India, says virologist Gagandeep Kang||Top virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang said on Monday that the coronavirus pandemic in the country may be heading towards endemic stage, adding that a third wave, if it does take place, is likely to be due to local flare-ups that would be smaller and spread wider across the country.Also Read | 'If new variants are more infectious...': Virologist Gagandeep Kang on Covid 3rd wave threat“When you have something that is not going away in the near future, then it is heading towards endemicity. Right now, we are not looking at eliminating SARS-CoV-2. This means that the virus has to become endemic,” Dr Kang, who teaches at Vellore’s Christian Medical College, said in an interview with PTI. An endemic stage is one when a disease or illness, instead of going away, is regularly found in a particular region, meaning that people there have to learn to live with it.Explaining further, the vaccinologist said, “There have been several endemic diseases, such as influenza. But there can also be a pandemic layered on top of an epidemic disease. Thus, if there is a new variant, which totally escapes the immune response, there could be yet another pandemic. However, that doesn’t mean that SARS-CoV-2 is only a pandemic, and has stopped being endemic.”A potential third wave, Dr Kang projected, would not take place on a scale as big as that during the previous two waves. “What we would see are local, smaller flare-ups that would be spread wider across the country. Together, these may form a third wave if there is a lot of behavioural change during the festive season. However, its scale won’t be anything like what we saw before,” she said.She also called for development of better vaccines to deal with new, emerging variants of Covid-19. “Our vaccines are based on the ancestral variant of Sars-CoV-2. Are these the best that we have? I think that we need to develop new variant-based and new platform vaccines, and then test very carefully in clinical trials to maximise the values that these bring,” Dr Kang proposed.India logged 30,256 fresh infections of Covid-19 and 295 related fatalities in the last 24 hours, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare’s (MoHFW) dashboard. The total case count stands at 33,478,419, including 32,715,105 recoveries, 445,133 deaths and 318181 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-may-be-heading-towards-endemic-stage-in-india-says-virologist-gagandeep-kang-101632149317589.html

Know which nation received most doses||Union minister for health and family welfare Mansukh Mandaviya announced on Monday that India will resume export of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines and its contribution to COVAX from October onwards.Mandaviya highlighted that the surplus supply of vaccines will be used to fulfil India’s commitment to the global fight against Covid-19 vaccines. COVAX is an initiative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines across all nations with focus on impoverished nations. The initiative is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO.India supplied vaccines to 95 nations before the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic struck, according to the Union ministry of external affairs. India supplied 10.75 million Covid-19 vaccine doses as a grant to 46 countries out of which 200,000 vaccine doses were also given to UN Peacekeeping Forces. India commercially exported 35.79 million vaccine doses, according to data shared by the Union ministry of external affairs.Bangladesh received at least 3.3 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine under the grant system and was among the highest recipients of vaccines under commercial agreement of 7 million vaccine doses. Brazil and Morocco also received 4 million doses and 7 million doses, respectively, under this agreement. Among other countries who received more than 100,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses under grant system were -- Mauritius, Fiji, Paraguay, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, Mongolia, Barbados, Afghanistan, Oman, Bahrain, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar and Bangladesh.Several other African countries as well as island nations in the Caribbean and Oceania also received vaccine doses under the grant system.Other than Morocco and Brazil, South Africa also received a million vaccine doses under commercial agreement. The United Kingdom received 5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines while Saudi Arabia received 4.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Neighbours Myanmar and Nepal received 2 million doses and 1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, respectively.India donated 19.86 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine under the COVAX initiative to several impoverished countries. According to the data, India so far has exported 66.36 million doses of vaccines while administering 800 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to its own citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-resumes-export-of-vaccine-doses-know-which-nation-received-most-doses-101632148104022.html

Judev, 39, belonged to the erstwhile royal family of Jashpur in Chhattisgarh. He was the youngest son of BJP's influential leader Dilip Singh Judev, who died in in 2013. “Yudhvir had been suffering from a liver-related ailment since a long time. He had undergone treatment at a hospital in Delhi, from where he was shifted to Bengaluru hospital, where breathed his last at around 4 am on Monday,” said Ranvijay Singh Judev, his cousin and former BJP Rajya Sabha member. The body will be brought to Jashpur on Tuesday where the final rites will be held, he said. Yudhvir Judev is survived by mother Madhvi, wife Sanyogita and a daughter, he said. He was first elected as an MLA in 2008 from Chandrapur constituency and for the second consecutive time in 2013. In the 2018 Assembly polls, his wife Sanyogita was fielded as a BJP candidate from Chandrapur, but she had lost the election. Yudhvir Judev had also served as the chairman of the state's Beverage Corporation during his second tenure as an MLA. The Judev family is said to have a considerable influence in Chhattisgarh's northern part, particularly in Jashpur and Janjgir-Champa area. Chief Minister Bhupesh Bahghel expressed deep grief over Yudhvir Judev's death. He prayed for the departed soul to rest in peace and for the bereaved family to get enough strength to bear the irreparable loss, an official statement said. State BJP chief Vishnudeo Sai described Yudhvir Judev's demise as an "irreparable loss" for the party organisation and the region. Other BJP leaders, including national joint general secretary (organisation) Shivprakash and state in-charge D Purandeswari, also condoled his demise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarhs-ex-bjp-mla-yudhvir-singh-judev-dies-aged-39-101632146353395.html
20-09-2021||India||Why promote song in trailer, edit it out in movie, SC asks Yash Raj Films||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a consumer tribunal order directing film production house Yash Raj Films to pay ₹15,000 to a Maharashtra teacher who felt cheated because a song, ‘Jabra Fan’, used to promote the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer movie ‘Fan’ in the trailer, was edited out of the film.The two-judge bench of justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian, however, questioned the production house for marketing the film with the song that was excluded from the movie.“The problem is that you (production house) show something else in the trailer which is not there in the movie. When the trailer is released, it is a trailer of the movie. Why were you marketing your movie with the song when you knew it was meant to be for promotion of the film?” the bench asked while hearing an appeal by the production house.Afreen Fatima Zaidi, a teacher in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad, complained in 2016 that she went to watch the movie with her family after seeing the song, ‘Jabra Fan’ and felt cheated and deceived when they didn’t find the song in the film.The district consumer redressal forum rejected her complaint. But she filed an appeal and convinced the state consumer disputes redressal commission. In 2017, the state commission ordered Yash Raj Films to pay ₹10,000 in compensation and ₹5,000 as litigation costs. The production house challenged the decision at the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.On February 18, 2020, the national commission upheld the findings of the state commission and concluded that there was reason for Zaidi to feel cheated and the decision not to use the song shown in the movie’s trailer amounted to “unfair trade practice”.In its appeal before the Supreme Court, Yash Raj Films, represented by Naomi Chandra, said it was common practice in the industry to use songs in the trailer that necessarily do not feature in the movie. “The order of the National Consumer court must be stayed as it has far reaching consequences on the entire film industry,” Chandra said.The judges responded, saying, “If there is a common practice in the industry that does not mean that the practice should continue”.The bench said the question to be decided is whether the producer of a movie can be said to be a service provider since the movie ticket is a contract between the person who buys it and the cinema hall owner who exhibits the film.“You need to give a plausible explanation,” the bench added, as it issued notice to the teacher as well.In its 2020 verdict, the national commission reasoned that it was not necessary that the consideration for purchasing goods or hiring or availing services must necessarily be paid directly to the person who sells the goods or renders services to the consumer. “The consideration may also flow to the seller of the goods or the service provider as the case, may be through an intermediary,” the commission said, underlining that the price of the ticket received by the exhibitor, a cinema hall, was shared between the exhibitor, distributor and producer of the movie. “Therefore, it cannot be accepted that the complainant was not a consumer of the petitioner,” the nation commission said in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-promote-song-in-trailer-edit-it-out-in-movie-sc-asks-yash-raj-films-101632147786772.html

Calling Channi’s appointment to be “shameful”, Sharma said the new chief minister needs to be held “accountable and should resign from the post.” “We do not want another woman to go through the same experience and endure the same harassment that the IAS officer would have faced,” the NCW chief added. The Indian Administrative Service officer accused Channi of sending inappropriate texts to her, but no formal complaint was registered and the issue was resolved following intervention by the former chief minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh. However, the case was reopened in June this year after Punjab Women Commission chairperson Manisha Gulati sought a reply from the Punjab government. This move became an issue within the state Congress circles with ministers supporting Channi calling it a ‘witch hunt’ by the Captain camp.After Channi’s appointment, Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) IT cell head mockingly said “well done, Rahul” to address Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. He referred to the #Metoo allegations against Channi.Also Read | #MeToo and illegal mining allegations cast a shadowOn Monday, Sharma said that she was shocked and “utterly disappointed” to find Channi being appointed to the top post of the state. “One can only imagine what would be the state of women's safety in [Punjab] given the one at the helm of affairs is himself accused of threatening women security,” she added.The NCW chief also stated that if an IAS officer has been denied justice in the state, how can the ruling dispensation make sure that “common women” of Punjab would be safe. “Despite being a woman herself, the Congress chief (Sonia Gandhi) did not consider the #Metoo allegations made against Channi and appointed him the CM,” Sharma noted.Earlier in the day, BJP’s Punjab in-charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam took a jibe at the Congress party, saying that the only reason they picked Channi is that they want to win Dalit votes. Channi has become the first Dalit leader to be appointed as the chief minister of Punjab. Punjab will go into the polls in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shocked-ncw-chief-demands-channi-s-resignation-as-punjab-cm-over-metoo-case-101632145222950.html

The government has taken a decision to give 500,000 tourists free visas. Travel and tourism stakeholders will be given loans of up to ₹10 lakh with a 100% guarantee by the government. Tourist guides are being given the facility of taking a loan of up to ₹1 lakh,” he said.Foreign tourists travel in larger groups and stay for a longer time, often the average duration of stay is between 14-21 days.

There is no agitation by farmers. The protesters are not farmers, they are people from political parties who are motivated by 'Sikhistan' and Pakistan,” Gond was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Gond said money to fund the protests is coming from Canada and is intended to fund terrorist activities. “Money is coming from foreign countries including Canada. This money is for terror funding and agencies are probing it,” Gond said.Gond said that if ‘real farmers’ would have protested then the nation would have seen a shortage of foodgrains, dairy products and fruits and vegetables.“If the real farmers were protesting, then there would have been a shortage of food items. Vegetables, milk, food grains, and fruits would not have reached the markets,” Gond added, claiming that people know the true nature of the protesters.Gond was speaking at an event commemorating the four and a half years anniversary of the Bharatiya Janata Party government led by the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath.The chief minister in a press release claimed that his government devoted itself towards uplifting the agricultural sector and livelihood of the farmers in the state. Yogi Adityanath listed achievements like timely payment to sugarcane farmers and revival of old sugar mills while opening new ones, government procurement of crops during the rabi and kharif while removing middlemen and farm loan waiver worth ₹ ₹36,000 crore to help at least 86 lakh farmers get back on their feet as major achievements of his regime.Adityanath also said that his government transferred ₹37,388 crores to more than 2.54 crore farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana along with hiking the amount of MSP in order to give a boost to the sector.Earlier on Monday, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai slammed the Congress, saying that the party, along with ‘foreign agents’, are sponsoring the protests against the three farm laws. “It is Congress or foreign agents in the country who are the sponsors of the protests by the farmers which are happening in the borders of Delhi and other places,” Bommai was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Congress leader Dinesh Gundu Rao condemned Karnataka chief minister’s statements and said the statement is an insult to the protesting farmers. “If they have any proof, they should arrest those who are sponsoring it,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tikait-a-dacoit-bjp-mp-says-protesters-are-not-farmers-101632134949688.html

According to the police, the class 7 student came in contact with two other minors and a 21-year-old youth while playing online games on a mobile phone. All of them were residents of Sivasagar district. “It appears that the minors and the 21-year-old were able to get the online banking details of the class 7 student’s father and transferred ₹19 lakh from the account in several transactions,” said Rakesh Raushan, superintendent of police, Sivasagar. The student’s father, who works as an engineer in a private oil-drilling company, had no knowledge of the transactions since the sms (short message service) alerts from the bank were received on his wife’s phone and deleted immediately by the student. Police didn’t explain immediately why transaction alerts from banks were being sent to the boy’s mother’s phone. When he finally saw that money had gone missing from his account, the student’s father lodged a complaint at the Joysagar police outpost last week. Based on the case lodged under sections 420 and 406 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that relate to cheating and criminal breach of trust, the police detained the student, the two minor brothers and Nipuraj Gogoi (21) on Saturday. “The details of what exactly transpired and how the amount was transferred from the victim’s account would be known after further investigations. There could be some others involved in the racket,” said Raushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-online-gaming-leads-teen-friends-to-siphon-rs-19l-from-father-s-account-101632135965929.html

This stipulated that in future, any equipment connected to the Indian telecom network by the Telecom Service Providers (TSP) has to be a trusted product and the telecom license conditions have been accordingly amended,” he said.“...Despite the problems due to the pandemic, we have accomplished our first mission in the desired time frame and the portal was launched on June 15, 2021.”Also Watch | Decoding Modi govt’s telecom sector relief. What it means for youThe verification process is done online on the portal is www.trustedtelecom.gov.in. The process starts with the telecom service uploading the details of the product and its Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).“We first check the antecedents of the OEM and then request them to give details of the components up to active semiconductor level and their sources. This data is verified by a team of government officers from various ministries. Their recommendations are put up to the NSCT which also includes industry and academia members. Approvals of the NSCT are conveyed to the particular TSP who had initiated the request. The entire process has its checks and balances to avoid any mistakes and ensure total secrecy in handling the vast amount of data,” he said.The development comes in the wake of the government trying to reduce India’s dependence on Chinese telecom products, ever since the clash in Galway Valley in June last year. The safety and security of the country’s data have been among the foremost concerns.“We are the only nation in the world that decided to implement a positive list of trusted telecom products. A team of about 40 engineers has worked for six months in creating this portal,” Pant said. “The portal also takes into account the source of all the active components inside the equipment and you can imagine the effort we need to put in. The first challenge of the portal being launched on time has been achieved, and we are resolved in making this Directive a success to ensure national security. The world is keenly watching this unique initiative of India.”He added that the major vendors and their products will be verified and the first list of trusted sources and products is expected to be out in first half of October. After that it will be updated on a monthly basis.Pant also stressed that any equipment required for maintenance of the existing network is not covered by this directive, dispelling any concerns regarding delays in the sector. “The operators have nothing to worry and even we are concerned not to create any disruptions or impact the ease of doing business in any way...we are also giving one-time exemptions for any urgent cases and the TSPs are satisfied with these actions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1st-list-of-trusted-telecom-sources-to-be-out-in-oct-cyber-security-coordinator-101632133565981.html

After what can be justified as a roller-coaster of political events in Punjab, the Congress party on Sunday chose Charanjit Singh Channi to become the 16th chief minister to succeed Captain Amarinder Singh—who quit after claiming he “felt humiliated”.“This is an old habit of the Congress. It believes that it can capture the Dalit vote bank by making a Dalit the chief minister for a few months. A conspiracy is being hatched in Punjab to grab Dalit vote bank,” Gautam, who also belongs to the community, said. “The Congress has humiliated Dalits innumerable times,” he added.Emphasising his point, the BJP leader said that Congress in the past had made a similar move in Maharashtra and Rajasthan as well. Gautam pointed out that Congress made Dalit leader Sushil Kumar Shinde the chief minister of Maharashtra in 2003, only to replace him with Vilasrao Deshmukh when the party won the assembly elections in 2004.Also Read | Why will Charanjit Singh Channi have two deputies?

On Sunday, BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya tweeted that Channi faces action in a Me Too case after the three-time MLA allegedly sent an inappropriate text to a woman IAS officer in 2018. “It was covered up but the case resurfaced when the Punjab Women’s Commission sent notice. Well done, Rahul (Congress leader Rahul Gandhi),” Malviya added in his post.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday took to the micro-blogging site to congratulate Channi for swearing-in as Punjab’s chief minister. “Will continue to work with the Punjab government for the betterment of the people of Punjab,” PM Modi tweeted.Notably, Punjab will go into elections next year. Channi was unanimously chosen for the charge after Amarinder Singh quit following four-and-half years of reign in the state. Singh’s departure was a culmination of the constant scuffle between him and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/old-habit-bjp-says-congress-made-channi-punjab-cm-to-win-dalit-votes-101632131762531.html
20-09-2021||India||Peace in border areas essential for bilateral ties with China: Shringla||India has told China that peace in the border areas is essential for developing bilateral ties in the wake of Chinese attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) over the past year, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Monday. As an immediate neighbour of Afghanistan, India is also concerned following the Taliban takeover of the country and its implications for the region, Shringla said while addressing JP Morgan’s India Investor Summit. Shringla, who was speaking on the theme “India’s foreign policy and its strategic imperative: The way forward”, listed “megatrends” the country is contending with, including a rebalancing in which global activity is moving towards Asia, the rise of China, the pressure on international systems, the vulnerability of global supply and value chains, emerging technologies, and “a battle between schools of thought”. Also Read | China launches unmanned spacecraft with supplies for under-construction space stationHe described the standoff with China and the situation in Afghanistan among the geopolitical challenges in India’s immediate neighbourhood. These situations were a reminder that traditional security challenges remain even while new realities are making themselves felt. “Chinese attempts over the last year to unilaterally alter the status quo in Ladakh have seriously disturbed peace and tranquillity in the border areas. These acts are in violation of our bilateral agreements and have inevitably impacted other aspects of the bilateral relationship,” Shringla said. “We have made it clear to the Chinese side that peace and tranquillity in border areas is essential for development of our relationship. Development of India-China relationship can only be based on ‘three mutuals’ – mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests,” he said. Shringla also reiterated India’s stated position that the largely positive trajectory of India-China ties in the past 40 years was largely due to the agreement between the two sides to ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas. India has insisted that the overall normalisation of relations with China is linked to disengagement and de-escalation at friction points on the LAC. On the other hand, Beijing has said New Delhi should take forward relations in other areas while dealing with the border standoff separately. Shringla said India is “naturally concerned about the recent changes within Afghanistan and their implications” for the region. While the immediate focus has been on evacuating Indian nationals from Afghanistan, he noted the recent UN Security Council resolution 2593 demands that Afghan soil should not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing terror acts and also specifically refers to terrorists proscribed by the Security Council, including those from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). Most Indians were able to leave Kabul in August, and a number of Afghans, including minorities, who wanted to travel to India, have also been able to do so. “However, this process could not be completed due to the security situation at the airport. Resumption of flights from Kabul airport is, therefore, a priority,” he added. India is also monitoring developments related to the humanitarian needs of Afghanistan. “In UNDP’s assessment, there is an imminent threat of poverty levels rising in Afghanistan. There is also a threat of an imminent drought and a food security crisis. It is important for the humanitarian assistance providers to be given unrestricted and direct access to Afghanistan,” Shringla said. The distribution of humanitarian assistance has to be done in a non-discriminatory manner to all sections of Afghan society, and India’s approach to Afghanistan is guided by the civilisational relationship with the Afghan people, he said. Shringla also recalled India’s development aid worth $3 billion and more than 500 projects spread across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, and said these initiatives had earned the country tremendous goodwill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peace-in-border-areas-essential-for-bilateral-ties-with-china-says-shringla-101632132067056.html

Speaking further about his meeting with the CM in Kolkata, Supriyo said she urged him to continue with his musical endeavours even during the upcoming Durga puja festival.He further thanked Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek, who now heads the party as the national general secretary, for welcoming him into the TMC family with much warmth and affection.Also read | ‘Wait and watch’: TMC says more leaders to join after Babul Supriyo’s entry“I'm very happy to meet her (Banerjee). The affection and warmth with which she welcomed me to the TMC family...She asked me to work with all my heart and sing with all my heart which I think is an icing on the cake. She said 'Pujor samayo tumi gaan karo' (sing even during the Puja),” Supriyo was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“We had a very musical talk. At the same time whatever she said was really music to my ears. I want to thank Didi and Abhishek for welcoming me so affectionately and warmly to the TMC family,” he added.On Sunday, Supriyo said he would not wish to campaign for Banerjee for the upcoming bypoll in Bhabanipur slated to be held on September 30.Regarding his decision to switch loyalty to the Trinamool Congress, of which he had been a vocal critic, the former Union minister of state for environment said he had been in politics for seven years now and felt it was a good opportunity for public welfare.Supriyo was stripped off his portfolio during the recent Cabinet reshuffle at the Centre following which he had announced to “quit” politics in July. However, he later decided not to reliquish his membership of the Parliament where he represented the Asansol constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babul-supriyo-says-mamata-banerjee-s-word-music-to-his-ears-101632131481680.html
20-09-2021||India||I have a weakness for pizzas and chocolates: Pankaj Advani||A game of billiards might not sound like a very strenuous sport to most, however physical fitness and flexibility play an important role in it. In a candid chat, 23-time billiards and snooker world champion Pankaj Advani debunks such assumptions and opens up about his diet and fitness mantra.Born in Pune, Advani started playing cue sports when he was 10 years old. “Back then, people used to make fun of my height and not take me seriously as I was always the youngest and shortest player. Years of hard work and practice helped me deliver performances that are appreciated by all,” says the 36-year-old.The athlete, who was also into badminton, cricket, basketball and table tennis during his school days, says cue sports have always been his favourite. “Once I got introduced to billiards and snooker, I was obsessed. The thrill of competing and evolving as an athlete keeps me going,” he says.The recipient of the Arjuna award (2004), Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award (2006) and Padma Shri award (2009), believes in remaining physically fit for good performance. “Professionally, I have a gym routine for alternate days, almost 3 to 4 times a week as working on one’s core, flexibility and stability is key to performing efficiently at the highest level,” he shares. On other days, he prefers going for walks and an occasional run to increase his cardiovascular capacity.When it comes to his diet, the athlete sticks to healthy options. “I like keeping my stomach light and not overeating, especially during training or tournaments. I am a vegetarian and love my fruits, fruit juices and veggies. Having said that, I do have a weakness for pizzas and anything to do with chocolates so I indulge in them, occasionally,” he says, adding, “My mantra is simple: Everything in moderation.”Billiards is a game of finesse and control whereas snooker is about power and hitting. Maintaining consistency in both is not an easy feat. “Nothing comes to us easily in life. One has to learn to deal with both success and failure in a mature way. Sports psychology is very essential in developing athletes mentally, emotionally and spiritually. I’m lucky to have my brother, Shree, take care of that as he is a sports psychologist,” he says.Ask him about his favourites at the Tokyo Games this year, he is quick to answer, “They all gave it their best at the Olympics and the results showed us that we can be the best if we believe in more and dream big. Lovlina (Borgohain), Aditi Ashok and our women’s hockey team were my heroes this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-have-a-weakness-for-pizzas-and-chocolates-pankaj-advani-101632129665639.html

Under the exercise, at least 808,568,144 doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the country till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-response-on-plea-seeking-priority-covid-19-vaccination-for-pregnant-women-101632127047691.html

We hope we will receive more vaccines from the Centre tomorrow so that the process can be re-started.”Previously on September 12, again a Sunday, Tamil Nadu conducted a 12-hour mega vaccination drive, and managed to inoculate 2.89 million people. At that time, the state had 2.9 million doses in hand and had conducted the drive across 40,000 camps. This time it had half the number of vaccine doses (about 1.1 million of Covishield and 500,000 of Covaxin) and the state held only 20,000 camps with the target of administering 1.5 million doses. The state health department is distributing vaccines to all districts based on their population and vaccination performance indicators. There is a special focus along the nine districts bordering Kerala which is witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases and is also dealing with Nipah and Zika, putting Tamil Nadu on alert. Also Read | Tamil Nadu government’s preventive measures kept Zika, Nipah virus at bay: SubramanianThough Tamil Nadu’s tally is hovering around 1,500-1,600 new cases daily, officials do not want to let their guard down. “Vaccination is the only way to prevent a third wave,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “As of today, in September alone we have crossed the milestone of vaccinating 10 million people. Since January, government facilities alone have vaccinated more than 40 million people. “We are slated to receive the next batch of vaccines only on September 22 but we have approached the Centre to send us supplies tomorrow,” Radhakrishnan told reporters on Sunday. “But this is a good position to be in. From January to March, when we have vaccine stocks, the public wasn’t coming forward to take it. We have also asked for more vaccines based on our higher population as compared to the other states.”Tamil Nadu’s vaccination story started from absolute hesitancy due to fear of side-effects among other factors. The perception began to change only during May and June when the second wave of Covid-19 peaked. But vaccination numbers were still low. July onwards, there has been a steady supply of vaccines from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tnexhausts-stock-vaccination-halted-today-after-sunday-s-1-6m-inoculations-101632126545370.html

She also hit out at the Congress over Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat’s reported statement that the next assembly election in the state would be contested under party president Navjot Singh Sidhu.The 58-year-old Channi, who was sworn-in by governor Banwarilal Purohit at a simple ceremony in the Raj Bhavan, became the first Dalit Sikh to head the state. Channi's name was announced by the Congress a day after Amarinder Singh put in his papers citing humiliation following months of power-sharing tussle.Mayawati said the Congress’ move to contest the state polls under a non-Dalit meant the grand old party did not fully trust the community. Also, it revealed the Congress was apprehensive of the alliance the BSP had formed with the Akalis.Also read | PM Modi congratulates new Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi“I congratulate Charanjit Singh Channi on becoming Punjab CM. It would have been better if he had been appointed as CM earlier,” the BSP head was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“I have also come to know through media that the next Punjab assembly elections will be fought under the leadership of a non-Dalit. This means the Congress still does not fully trust the Dalits. Congress is also scared of the SAD-BSP alliance in Punjab,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said.In June this year, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BSP joined hands for the 2022 Assembly election in the state with leaders of the two parties calling it a “historic” move that would usher in inclusive development in the state.Earlier in the day, veteran Congress leader and former state unit chief Sunil Jakhar said he was baffled by Rawat’s statement that election in the state would be led by Sidhu. He said Rawat’s announcement coming on the day of Channi's swearing-in could undermine the latter’s authority while also justify his selection for the position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mayawati-says-congress-yet-to-trust-dalits-fully-as-channi-becomes-punjab-cm-101632121757812.html

20-09-2021||India||Vice President calls for modernising agriculture to boost farmers’ income||Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu has called for modernisation of agriculture to boost rural economy. Speaking at an event in Gurugram on Sunday, Naidu said, “Building on our past experiences, we must regularly revisit and renew our strategies on agriculture and rural development and introduce new technologies as part of our efforts to build a self-reliant India.”He said agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy and the country cannot progress if the villages remain underdeveloped. Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of India’s population, according to a report by IBEF. The Vice President underscored the need to guarantee income security for the nation’s farmers and to unshackle the latent potential of India’s rural economy. He said, “Doubling the farmers’ income should be our endeavour. Along with this, the quality of life of people in rural areas should be improved.”While there is no official data on the rural household income for recent years, the Reserve Bank of India data on agricultural wages, an important component of the rural income, illustrates a decreasing rate of growth between 2014 and 2019.In the traditional village economy, a MGNREGS worker is considered as the poorest. However, as reported last week by Hindustan Times, the latest Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) shows that for all but five states in India, average income from cultivation per agricultural household is actually less than what MGNREGS work would theoretically pay in 365 days. This illustrates the urgent need to improve agricultural incomes in the economy. Naidu’s comments come in the backdrop of the farmers’ agitation that has continued for more than ten months with hundreds of farmers agitating against the controversial farm laws. The protest has caused obstruction of traffic and road blockades in multiple regions of Delhi-NCR, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and in a smaller measure across other states, leading to a disruption of supply chains which had already been under pressure post-lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vice-president-calls-for-modernising-agriculture-to-boost-farmers-income-101632120244961.html

20-09-2021||India||UP CM Yogi Adityanath says Ambedkar taught Rashtra Dharma, not caste politics||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that previous governments had paid lip service to the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and the backward classes, and the Bharatiya Janata Party government, in comparison, had been busy renovating and beautifying memorials of iconic personalities from these communities.Speaking as the chief guest at the concluding session of the national executive of BJP’s Scheduled Caste (SC) Morcha in Varanasi on Sunday, Adityanath said that it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who finally launched the ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ in 2014 after other governments had failed to deliver any substantial benefits for the backward communities. Adityanath said that due to the Swachh Bharat Mission, toilets were built in the homes of 100 million people across the country and 95% of the beneficiaries were from the SCs, STs and the Other Backward Classes (OBCs). A total of 26.1 million people were given assistance to build toilets in Uttar Pradesh, he added.Yogi also said that the Swachh Bharat Mission brought unprecedented improvement in the lives of people and changed India’s image in the world. Listing other welfare schemes started by the BJP-led Central government, Yogi said houses were given to 25 million people under the ‘PM Awas Yojana’ in the country. In Uttar Pradesh, 4.2 million people were given houses after 2017, he said, adding that free ration was being given to 800 million people in the country including 150 million people in Uttar Pradesh.Yogi alleged that during the Samajwadi Party’s rule, deaths due to starvation were reported from Sonbhadra, Kushinagar and Chitrakoot districts because the free ration meant for the poor was getting cornered by SP workers instead. He said that the fraud ended following a probe-- ordered by the BJP government after assuming power in the state in 2017—which found 4 million fake ration cards.Yogi said that during the Covid-19 pandemic, no one was left to die of hunger as free ration was ensured for all the poor people.Listing several projects to beautify and renovate memorials for icons from the backward communities, Yogi said Sant Ravidas temple was being made at Seer Govardhan in Varanasi, a memorial to Maharaja Suheldev was being built in Bahraich, apart from a national memorial to Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar in Lucknow. He said people who were in power earlier should be asked as to why this work was not done during their tenure. In poll bound Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP aims to return to power by overcoming identity politics among the Hindu population, CM Adityanath recalled Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar’s philosophy. He said that Ambedkar was revered due to his work for social justice, equality and Indian values and tradition. He claimed that Ambedkar’s contemporary Jogendranath Mandal was forgotten soon since he favoured the creation of Pakistan and worked against Rashtra Dharma (duty towards the nation) and those who were opposed to the Rashtra Dharma today will meet the same fate.“Remember, we have no caste..., we have only one religion that is Rashtradharma. The one who follows rashtra dharma and works for rashtra dharma will be revered. The society will offer him respect,” Yogi said. Asserting that the BJP did not do caste politics, he said, the party worked to bring harmony in the society. He claimed that the BJP governments had implemented many public welfare schemes to realise the dreams of Ambedkar to bring about a radical change in the standard of living of the underprivileged.Speaking of other welfare schemes run by the Central government, he pointed out that 500 million people had benefited from the ‘Ayushman Bharat’ health insurance scheme which guarantees free treatment up to ₹5 lakh/ year for poor people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cm-yogi-adityanath-says-ambedkar-taught-rashtradharma-not-caste-politics-101632116944720.html

Addressing the event in Unnao on Sunday, Dixit said if one could become great just by dressing scantily, then Bollywood actor "Rakhi Sawant would have become greater than Mahatma Gandhi".He later clarified on Twitter that the remarks were twisted out of context. The remarks were made at 'prabuddh varg sammelan' (meeting of intellectuals) organised by the BJP in the Bangarmau assembly constituency."In our opinion, no one has become an intellectual by writing a book on any topic. If that was the case for so many years, I have read at least 6,000 books," the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said."Gandhiji used to dress scantily. He used to wrap just a dhoti. The country called him Bapu. If somebody could become great just by taking their clothes off, then Rakhi Sawant would have become greater than Mahatma Gandhi," he added.After a video clipping of his speech went viral on social media, Dixit issues clarification on Twitter and claimed that he is being quoted out of context. "Some friends on social media are showing the clip of a video of my speech which conveys a different meaning," Dixit wrote in Hindi on the micro-blogging site. "This was the part of my speech at the 'prabuddh sammelan' in Unnao, in which the moderator of the 'sammelan' introduced me saying that 'I am an enlightened writer'," he added.

20-09-2021||India||Punjab turmoil may have ripple effect in Rajasthan||The change of guard in Punjab, with the Congress replacing Captain Amarinder Singh with Charanjit Singh Channi as chief minister, may have a rippling effect on Rajasthan politics too where another Congress government has been battling factional rivalry. For a year, chief minister Ashok Gehlot and former deputy CM Sachin Pilot have been at loggerheads. A compromise formula worked out by the party’s central leadership is yet to bring in a thaw in the relationship, with many lawmakers upset about a promised cabinet reshuffle, which is the lynchpin of the compromise formula, taking longer to materialise. For now, the Pilot camp is chuffed by the Punjab development. “We expect good news soon,” said a Congress leader close to Pilot on condition of anonymity. He added that Pilot has already had meetings with senior Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, over the week and was confident that the party will take an “assertive” decision in the coming weeks. Also Read | Don’t take any step to harm Congress, Rajasthan CM Gehlot urges Amarinder SinghBut political watchers say that the ground situation in Rajasthan is different from Punjab as Gehlot still has control over the party, unlike Amarinder Singh, who lost control over Punjab Congress when Navjot Singh Sidhu was appointed its president. Unlike Punjab, where assembly elections are in March 2022, the state polls in Rajasthan are still more than two years away in December 2023. “Gehlot is also very close to the Gandhi family,” political analyst Manish Godha pointed out, suggesting that a repeat of Punjab in Rajasthan is unlikely. He, however, warned that the “party leadership will have to work on pacifying the dissidents as time is running out”. A second senior Congress leader said after Punjab, Rahul Gandhi is expected to focus on Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where chief minister Bhupesh Baghel may be replaced by health minister T S Singhdeo. He said Pilot met Rahul on Friday evening and had a long discussion, triggering expectations of a cabinet reshuffle and political appointments. Pilot did not respond to HT’s text messages or calls. “What the party leadership has done in Punjab has boosted our confidence that changes would happen here too,” said another legislator close to Pilot — the third to talk about imminent change in Rajasthan government. “The changes are more for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls where the Congress is looking at a three-figure mark,” said the second leader quoted above. Those considered close to Gehlot said there was a huge difference between Amarinder and Gehlot. “Amarinder wasn’t the choice of Delhi for chief ministership, whereas Gehlot was called to Delhi and announced as the CM. In addition, Gehlot enjoys the support of more than 100 MLAs in the state,” said a state cabinet minister considered close to Gehlot. Soon after the Punjab development on Saturday, Gehlot’s officer on special duty (OSD) Lokesh Sharma had remarked on microblogging platform Twitter that when a strong person gets forced and an insignificant person gets an ego massage, then nobody can save the crop from getting eaten by the fence itself. The tweet was seen as a comment on the Congress high command’s handling of the Punjab crisis and sparked controversy, forcing Sharma to resign on Sunday. He, however, claimed that the tweet was not directed at the party high command. On Sunday morning, Gehlot also defended the party high command and added that those in the party who get upset about losing power should listen to their conscience. “I personally believe that the Congress president chooses the CM at the risk of inviting displeasure of several leaders who are in the race for chief ministership. However, when the same chief minister is changed, he/she is displeased and holds the decision wrong. One should listen to one’s inner voice in such moments,” Gehlot tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-turmoil-may-have-ripple-effect-in-rajasthan-101632108544400.html

The government has asked people to maintain law and order and communal harmony during the time of the festivals.The guidelines are also significant in view of the warnings from health experts about the third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), for which the Centre too has raised concerns.Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (Home) Avnish Kumar Awasthi said while granting permission for the establishment of Durga Puja Pandal and Ramlila stage, care should be taken that public traffic is not affected.The idols should be installed in the traditional but empty space, their size should be kept as small as possible and there should not be more people than the capacity of the ground, the guidelines said.As much as possible small vehicles should be used for the immersion of idols and the minimum number of people should be involved in the programme.The state government has also paid special attention to public facilities like electricity, drinking water and cleanliness.This comes on a day when the Yogi Adityanath government relaxed the restrictions on wedding ceremonies. It said that the number of daily cases of Covid-19 have been falling in the state. However, the guidelines for festivals have been issued in order to ensure that the infection doesn't rear its head again.According to revised rules for gatherings, maximum number of people allowed at weddings and other celebrations has been increased to 100. Earlier, this limit was capped at 50, for events taking place in both closed and open locations.The state government order has mandated that a distance of six feet must be maintained while planning the seating arrangement for the guests at the venue of the event.Also, a Covid-19 help desk should also be set up at the entrance of the location, the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-issues-guidelines-for-navratri-dussehra-and-chehallum-details-here-101632106599801.html

It is likely to be completed by March 2023. The Expressway is being built as part of Phase-1 of the Centre’s Bharatmala Pariyojana.Livemint report carried a 90-second video uploaded on YouTube on September 16, in which Gadkari is seen inspecting an empty stretch of the expressway in a Kia Carnival car and was seated in the front passenger seat.Upon entering the expressway, the car’s speed went up to around 170 kilometres per hour (Kmph), and it was moving smoothly. Though the Livemint report said that top speed on the expressway has been limited to 120 Kmph.During the video, Gadkari could also be heard saying that a small aircraft could land on the expressway.Previously, the Union minister had conducted an aerial survey of the expressway and said it will cut travel time between Delhi and Mumbai to 12 hours, adding that it will also help in saving crores of litres of petrol and diesel.“Once the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is completed and opened for the public, we will get at least ₹1,000-1,500 crore as toll revenues every month,” Gadkari was quoted as saying by news agency PTI on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-inspects-delhi-mumbai-expressway-car-clocks-170kmph-101632100362393.html
20-09-2021||India||‘Amarinder Singh’s resignation sign of Congress’ decline in Punjab’: Opposition||Captain Amarinder Singh’s (retd) resignation as Punjab chief minister on Saturday has brought the focus back on infighting in the Congress party with experts and political rivals suggesting the move could hurt the grand old party’s prospects in the upcoming assembly elections in the state.Considered by many to be the Congress party’s principal challenger in 2022 Punjab polls, the Aam Aadmi Party said the Congress was similar to a “sinking Titanic ship”. In a video message posted on Twitter, AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said, “Governance in the state of Punjab has been the biggest casualty in the Congress’ Game of Thrones.”AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh claimed the Congress was near its “end” in Punjab, and that AAP will be the biggest beneficiary of this possible outcome, India Today reported.He also mocked the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress for recent changes of chief ministers in party-ruled states. “We change our politics; BJP, Congress change their chief ministers,” he said.BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh said Amardinder Singh’s resignation was result of a “panic reaction” by the Congress brass to salvage the party’s situation ahead of the Assembly polls next year. “The Congress in Punjab is licking the dust to revive itself,” he stated.“The mafia raj of the Congress in Punjab would prove to be the last nail in its coffin in Punjab,” Chugh added.Union minister and BJP MP from Punjab Som Prakash said Singh’s resignation showed that the Congress was “desperate”. “The Congress is in decline, Akalis have lost the trust of people, so we are hopeful that people of Punjab will give opportunity to the BJP which can give a stable and progressive government in the state,” PTI quoted him as saying.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) (Sanyukt) leader Parminder Singh Dhindsa said Singh was made a “scapegoat” by the Congress to save the party from allegations of non-fulfilment of promises. “The whole drama was only to put the blame of non-fulfilment of promises on Amarinder Singh,” he said.Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah took to Twitter to criticise the Congress. “I guess it’s too much to expect [from] the Congress to take the fight to the BJP when its state leaders are too busy fighting amongst themselves,” he wrote. He added, “Ordinarily, I wouldn’t give a toss about the fratricide in the Congress party - their party, their business. However, what the Congress does has direct fallout for every political party outside the NDA orbit because almost 200 Lok Sabha seats see a direct BJP-Congress fight.”Haryana health minister Anil Vij went on to blame Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu for Amarinder Singh’s resignation and claimed “its script was written the same day Navjot Singh Sidhu entered the Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-s-resignation-sign-of-congress-decline-in-punjab-opposition-101632102604204.html

Here's what's on agenda||From Monday, nineteen opposition parties will hold protests and demonstrations across the country against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre. The protests will go on till the end of September. Opposition leaders said that the form of these protests will be decided by the respective state units of their parties, depending on conditions of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) norms in their states.At a virtual meeting in August, the opposition parties stressed on unitedly moving forward to defeat the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The leaders of these parties also issued an 11-point charter of demands before the Centre. “We will jointly organise protest actions all over the country from 20th to 30th September, 2021,” the leaders said in a joint statement after the virtual meeting convened by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.The demands include a repeal of the three new farm legislations, a Supreme Court-monitored investigation into the Pegasus hacking controversy, early elections in Jammu and Kashmir and release of all political detainees there and a high-level probe into the Rafale deal.“We, the leaders of 19 Opposition parties, call upon the people of India to rise to the occasion to defend our secular, democratic, republican order with all our might. Save India today, so that we can change it for a better tomorrow,” the opposition leaders said in a joint statement.The leaders blamed the Centre for an abrupt end of the monsoon session of Parliament, accusing it of not holding talks on the Pegasus issue, new farm legislations, inflation, price rise, unemployment and also the alleged management of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. They demanded an immediate speeding up of the vaccination drive against Covid-19 to prevent the third wave of the pandemic.“Apart from denying the Opposition their right to raise crucial issues concerning the country and the people, the government steamrolled legislations through the din of the disruption caused by its handling of both Houses of Parliament,” the leaders further said in the statementThe opposition leaders also strongly criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on Independence Day (August 15), by saying it was full of rhetoric, empty slogans and disinformation and was a repackaging of speeches given in 2019 and 2020.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-parties-11-day-protest-against-centre-begins-today-101632097918751.html

20-09-2021||India||Govt announcement on international tourism likely in 10 days: Officials||Government officials are considering whether India can reopen its doors to international tourists as countrywide cases of Covid-19 have largely remained stable over the last few weeks, according to people aware of the matter, who said the announcement may be made within the next 10 days.Visas for foreign tourists have not been issued for the last one-and-a-half years, since the first outbreak of the infectious disease in the country.The move to reopen is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement on Saturday that the government is planning to allow foreign tourists into Goa. “Tourism can resume in the coming tourism season just like before. We are planning to allow foreign tourists to come here... This will be possible when we give as much importance to corona precautions as much as we have given for vaccinations. It is our duty,” he said during an interaction with Goa health care workers.Senior officials of the Union home ministry are in discussions with stakeholders on the expected date to reopen the Indian economy for tourism, among other factors.Discussions are also on to waive off visa costs for the first 500,000 foreign tourists who apply. The free visa scheme will be applicable till March 31, 2022, or before if the 500,000-mark is crossed first. The total financial implication for this would be ₹100 crore, one of the ministry officials said.PM Modi too had spoken of the free-visa scheme on Saturday, saying that the central government was taking steps to “welcome foreign tourists back”.This will help revive the tourism, hospitality and aviation sectors that have been badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic since March 2020, when the first nationwide lockdown was announced, the official said.The cost for a month-long e-tourist visa is country-specific, but ranges around $25 ( ₹1,842). A year-long multiple entry tourist visa charge costs around $40 (approximately ₹3,000).Ministry officials also said they are considering the conditions for approval of foreign travel — for instance, whether visas should be allowed only for vaccinated travellers, and if tourists from countries battling Covid-19 outbreaks should be barred. All scheduled international flights have been suspended in India since March 2020 but special flights under bilateral “air bubble” arrangements -- through which carriers of two countries can operate flights -- are being run.A second official aware of the matter hinted that the reopening of foreign tourism may be phased out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-announcement-on-int-l-tourism-likely-in-10-daysofficials-101632080516944.html
20-09-2021||India||Survey shows income of farmers has risen: Agriculture secretary||Amid continuous protests against the contentious farm laws, a Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of Agricultural Households, Land and Livestock Holdings of Households of Rural India, 2019, conducted from January to December 2019 revealed a 59% surge in farmers’ incomes that are not adjusted for inflation, on a nominal basis. The survey also showed that farmers’ incomes adjusted for inflation -- which economists call real income -- have risen by about 2%. However, when the inflation-unadjusted incomes are distributed among the number of farming households to derive per capita farmers’ incomes, one gets a figure of ₹27 a day, as reported by HT earlier. In an emailed interview to HT’s Zia Haq, Union agriculture secretary Sanjay Agrawal answers key questions on the survey.1. This survey is a departure from previous situational assessment surveys in that it accounts for earnings from land holdings and livestock, not just crops. The parameters of the two surveys are different. What’s the rationale for this? That’s correct. The National Statistics Office (NSO) of Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPYI) carried out a survey on “Land and Livestock Holdings of Households and Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households” in the rural areas of India with an integrated schedule of enquiry. Prior to this, Land and Livestock Holding Surveys (LHS) and Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of Agricultural Households used to be conducted as separate surveys. The idea is to take a holistic view of a farmers’ income. There is no sense in doing separate surveys to assess incomes from dairy and livestock, for instance, because dairying is a major area of farming activity. 2. What is the average monthly income of an agricultural household according to this survey? Can you explain in full all the sources of income that were taken into consideration?Sure. At the all-India level, an average monthly income per agricultural household during agricultural year 2018-19 is ₹10,218. Out of the total average, income from wages is ₹4,063, followed by cultivation /net receipt from crop production ( ₹3,798), net receipt from farming of animals ( ₹1,582), net receipt from non-farm business ( ₹641) and income from leasing out of land ( ₹134). Out of the total income earned by agricultural households, 39.8 % of income is earned from wages followed by cultivation/net receipt from crop production (37.2 percent), farming of animals (15.5%), and income from non-farm business (6.3%). 3. So, the survey includes non-farm wages too? Yes, the objective of the survey is clear. It is to capture the current income situation of an agricultural household at a holistic level and not leave out any source of income. That’s how we can know what their total income situation is. SAS definition of cultivator is any household who gets output worth ₹4,000 a year and is self-employed in agriculture as main or subsidiary occupation. So, if one keeps one goat just to get little milk for tea, etc, and gets, say, 150 litres of milk a year, and is engaged in non-agriculture activity as the main occupation, he becomes a cultivator based on this definition. Thus, going by the definition, this 37.2 % from crop production is not the right reflection of income from cultivation by land-owning farmers.4. Can you clarify how the survey arrives at the average monthly income of ₹10,218 and its methodology? Sure, I am happy to explain. An agriculture household earns income from different sources as evident from the survey report. Members of an agriculture household may be pursuing various agriculture and non-agricultural activities. It reveals that wages comprise the maximum share of the income of an agriculture household followed by income from crops. Wages can be from different sources like agriculture wages for a variety of farm activities and also MGNREGS. If the average monthly income of the agriculture household is ₹10,218 as mentioned in the report, then the average daily income would be 10,218x12/365= ₹336. Even if we take the monthly income from the crops alone (Table 1) which is ₹3,798, then the daily income would be 3,798/30 = ₹126 which is much higher than ₹27 projected by a section of the media.Table 1. Average Monthly Income per Agricultural Average  Monthly Income in Rs. Household Percentage 1. Income from wages ₹4,063 39.8% 2. Income from crop production ₹3,798; 37.2%3. Income from farming of animals Rs. 1,582; 15.5% 4. Income from non-farm business ₹641; 6.3% 5. Income from leasing out of land ₹134; 1.3%Average monthly income ₹10, 218(Source: NSS Report No. 587: Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India, 2019) From the above table, it is evident that the average monthly income of an agricultural household is ₹10,218. Out of which, income from wages ₹4,063 (39.8%) income from crop production ₹3,798 (37.2%), income from farming of animals ₹1,582 (15.5%), income from non-farm business ₹641 (6.3%), income from leasing out of land ₹134 (1.3%). Source: NSS Report No. 587: Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India, 2019 5. The survey shows an inflation-unadjusted increase in total monthly incomes of about 59%, if one compares the current income level of ₹10,128 with ₹6,426 from the previous 2012-13 survey. But part of the increase is because of accounting of non-farm income such as land lease? But part of the increase in farm income is because the survey accounts for non-farm incomes too, such as land lease?As I said, the idea is to measure an agricultural household’s total income situation. The title of the survey itself suggests so. There is no reason at all to do separate surveys of dairy and livestock income. The objective is to get a comprehensive idea about the income situation of an agricultural household. Let me re-emphasise that even if we talk of income from crops alone, that works out to be ₹126 per day, not ₹27 or so as some media reports say. Beside the increase in income of agri households, they benefited from increase in real prices of agriculture commodities. The WPI for agri in these six years increased from 111 to 134 and the WPI for non-agri increased from 106 to 116. Thus, the terms of trade index moved in favour of agri from 104 to 120, an increase of 16 per cent between 2012-13 and 2018-19. Source: Niti Aayog. 6. Don’t you think farmers need even higher incomes, adjusted for inflation, because they are still affected by poor realisations as markets are always uncertain? Of course. That is why there has been an unprecedented enhancement in budget allocation. In the year 2013-14, the budget allocation for the department of agriculture was only ₹21,933.50 crore. This has been increased by more than 5.5 times to ₹1,23,017.57 crores in 2021-22. A total of ₹1.58 lakh crore has been released so far to 11.37 crore farmers’ families through direct transfer into their bank accounts under the PM-KISAN scheme. The recently enacted farm law related to Trade & Commerce of Farmers Produce creates an ecosystem for sale of scheduled agriculture commodities at farmgate level, which shall create opportunities of value addition at the village levels, leading to further enhancement of agricultural household’s income. Further, this will accelerate more investment in marketing and supply chain infrastructure, including storage facilities near to farm gate, creating more employment opportunities for rural areas. The farm law related to the Farming Agreement shall support farmers, especially small and marginal farmers, with a legal framework to produce high value crops, which shall be instrumental in additional income from cultivation. The fixation of MSP at one-and-a-half times the cost of production and ensuring enhanced procurement has been a major focus as well. The institutional credit for farmers has increased from ₹7.3 lakh crore in 2013-14 and has reached over ₹16.6 lakh crore in 2020-21 The government has approved ₹1 lakh crore Agriculture Infrastructure fund for building post-harvest and other agriculture-related infrastructure near the farm gate. The government has been actively promoting Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) for better bargaining power with the market and to get good prices for their produce.7. Do you think there is any improvement in the situation of farmers between the two surveys 2012-13 to 2018-19? Yes. The viability of agriculture has improved, the overall indebtedness has come down and appetite for risk mitigation has improved. Viability of agriculture The number of rural households getting primary income from agriculture has gone up from 54% in 2013 to 58% in 2019. That is agriculture assumes more economic importance to more rural households. The income of agricultural households increased in nominal terms by 59% between 2013 and 2019 (from 6,426 to 10,219). The Consumer Price Index (rural) increased by 35% (from 105 to 142) during the same period, suggesting a real income increase of 24% to agricultural households. The share of income from crop production of agricultural households in the lowest size class of land possessed (having < 0.01 hectares or landless) has increased from 1% to 15% between 2013 to 2019. Their income from farming (including livestock farming) has increased from 27% to 34%. Overall indebtedness of agricultural households has come down The percentage of agricultural households indebted has come down from 52% in 2013 to 50% in 2019. The percentage decrease is substantial in agricultural households having less than 1 acre of land. In land size class < 0.01, the decrease is 3.4% (from 41.9% to 38.5%) and in the next lowest size class (having <0.04 hectare (one acre)) the decrease is a maximum of 6.5% (from 47.3% to 40.8%). The amount of outstanding credit has come down substantially in the lowest land size class that is from ₹31,100 to ₹26,883.The decrease in nominal terms is 14%, adjusting for inflation the decrease is more than 50%. Crop insurance (risk mitigation) has gone up The percentage of crop-producing households insuring their crops has substantially increased, which indicates more farmers are adopting risk mitigation measures. During July-December, while 8.3% households insured paddy in the present survey, the percentage is 4.8% in the corresponding half of 2012-13, for soyabean 27.5% and 14%, for cotton, 25.4% and 10.4%. During January-June, those insuring paddy are 13.9% in the present survey and 3.9% in the corresponding half of 2012-13; for rapeseed/mustard, it is 8.9% and 5.1% ; for cotton, those insured are 28.8% and 14.9%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survey-shows-income-of-farmers-has-risen-agriculture-secretary-101632080224290.html
20-09-2021||India||Don’t rely on Modi wave to win state elections: Yediyurappa||Former Karnataka chief minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said the Narendra Modi wave would help win Lok Sabha elections easily, but party leaders and workers need to put in the effort to win state elections, retracting his earlier statement that the prime minister cannot alone help win elections. “Let us not be under some notion. In the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it is easy to win the Lok Sabha elections. But by not only stating Modi’s name to win elections, but we should also put in efforts and by helping development works reach the people we should win elections,” Yediyurappa said on Sunday in Davangere, about 260 km from Bengaluru. The statements come when Karnataka is preparing for several elections at zilla and taluk panchayats levels, MLC polls and other polls in the coming year under chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. The Bharatiya Janata Party in Karnataka has seen significant changes in leadership with Yediyurappa forced to step down and Bommai replacing him as the chief minister, much to the discontent of several senior leaders in the party overlooked for the top job. Yediyurappa recently lavished praise on governance by his successor Bommai.“Mr. Bommai is running the administration well,” Mr. Yediyurappa said, before adding, “The Government under Mr Bommai is giving a good administration. Even the people of the state feel the same. I am sure, the government will do better in the coming days”, he said.The BJP has intensified its outreach to muster support from the grassroots-level workers to strengthen its base ahead of the 2023 assembly elections. Several leaders of the saffron outfit spoke in the BJP working committee meeting in Davangere. He added that the party should be strengthened by bringing in more leaders from the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and other backward classes into the BJP fold that would help strengthen the party and the organisation. Yediyurappa asked BJP legislators and leaders not to take the opposition parties lightly. He said that the opposition parties have their calculations and strength. It is no secret that Yediyurappa and the BJP’s national leadership under Modi and Amit Shah was strained and the latter being forced out two years before his term could end. Speaking to reporters later, Yediyurappa said that the meaning of what he said was that the party should win 140 plus seats (in 2023) based on the blessings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and our special efforts. He also said that state Congress president DK Shivakumar was trying to contact BJP legislators and that there was no chance of anyone from the saffron fold leaving. He said that there was a higher chance of Congress leaders coming to the BJP. Yediyurappa is also planning to undertake a state-wide tour to build the party, adding to apprehensions of the BJP’s top leadership, which have so far been unable to replace the stature of the 78-year-old. Yediyurappa has built his career on caste-based politics as against the BJP, which is trying to infuse Hindutva, adding to the contrasting approaches to help the saffron outfit return to power. People aware of the developments said that the BJP is anxious about Yediyurappa’s upcoming tour. However, Arun Singh, the national general secretary of the BJP, in charge of Karnataka on Sunday, said that Yediyurappa does not need any green signal from the party for his tour. “There is no need for a green signal. BS Yediyurappa is the tallest leader amongst all parties in the state. If he tours (the state), it will be beneficial for the party and inspire workers,” Singh said. Meanwhile, chief minister Basavaraj S Bommai on Sunday exhorted party leaders and workers to gear up for the upcoming bypolls and Bengaluru municipal elections and said the party has to win all the elections.“There are two Assembly bypolls (Hanagal and Sindagi constituencies), legislative council elections and a few panchayat elections. We, seniors, have discussed about them. We will take every election seriously right from the local-level elections to Parliamentary elections,” he said at the inaugural session of the BJP’s State core committee meeting.He shared his joy over the BJP’s victory in the Belagavi municipal election for the first time.“We started with conquering Mysuru municipal corporation by having our own Mayor and now we have won the three municipal corporations in north Karnataka (Belagavi, Hubballi-Dharwad and Kalaburagi),” Bommai said.He said the party has to gear up for the upcoming Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) election. He said he was confident of the BJP getting full majority in the BBMP poll.The Chief Minister reiterated his commitment to serve the people. In this connection, he recalled the mega inoculation drive carried out to celebrate the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Seva Samarpan Divas (Dedicating Services Day).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-rely-on-modi-wave-to-win-state-elections-yediyurappa-101632078963803.html
20-09-2021||India||Kerala Police top list in tracking offenders using fingerprint analysis||Kerala police ranked first in the country in tracking offenders through the use of fingerprints, according to the 2020 report of the Central Finger Prints Bureau (CFPB). Last year Kerala was ranked second after Andhra Pradesh. According to the CFPB report, the Kerala fingerprint bureau cracked 675 criminal cases followed by Karnataka with 517 and Andhra Pradesh came third with 412 cases. The report carried a special mention about the work carried out by the state fingerprint bureau and police in cracking the sensational snakebite murder in Kollam in south Kerala last year. “It is an ample proof of the hard work of the state fingerprints bureau backed by technology leveraged effectively for crime prevention and detection. Officers of the bureau assisted by the AFIS (automated fingerprint identification system) software put up a stellar performance in becoming the first,” said state additional director general of police Manoj Abraham, an expert in cyber security. The country has a Central Finger Print Bureau and every state has its bureaus which help in the investigation process by using fingerprint science. Fingerprint evidences are most scientific and foolproof, according to experts. The job of a fingerprint expert is to develop chance prints left by criminals at the crime scene and match them with the fingerprints in the database of convicts. When investigation begins at a crime scene, a fingerprint expert is first to visit the spot to closely observe the site. The expert then develops the chance prints left by criminals at the scene. The collected chance fingerprints are then matched with the fingerprints database. This helps identify if the crime was carried out by someone who is already in the records of the bureau. There is a National Automated Finger Prints Identification System (NAFIS) to streamline the countrywide process for database. The report carried a special mention about the way police team cracked the sensational murder of 25-year-old Uthra in 2020. Initially it was dismissed as a mere snakebite case but police and parents got suspicious as this was the second snakebite that proved fatal. She received the fatal bite when she was undergoing treatment for the first bite. Later police arrested her husband P Sooraj and a local snake handler who provided a cobra to him. During investigation it was found that Sooraj had bought a cobra from the snake handler after paying him ₹10,000. He also got necessary training from the handler. He reportedly took it to Uthra’s house in Anchal, where she had been undergoing treatment at her parents’ place since the first incident. The police said that after Uthra fell asleep, Sooraj allegedly took out the snake from the bottle and threw it on her. He kept awake all night to ensure that it did not bite him. He left the room in the morning and started reading a newspaper in the verandah. Uthra’s mother found her daughter unconscious in the morning. She was rushed to a hospital where doctors said she died of snake bite. The case is on trial stage and police recreated the entire incident though digital and dummy presentation. The cracking of theft in India’s first indigenously built aircraft carrier INS Vikrant two years ago also found mention in the report. The accused, two painters working in the ship, were arrested after matching their fingerprints taken at the time of employing them. The National Investigation Agency arrested them last year from north India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-police-top-list-in-tracking-offenders-using-fingerprint-analysis-101632078422758.html
20-09-2021||India||Amarinder Singh expressed ‘personal anguish’ to Sonia Gandhi in letter before resignation||Hours before he resigned as the Punjab chief minister, Amarinder Singh wrote a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, expressing “personal anguish” at the decision and hoped that it doesn’t damage the “peace and development in the state”.“Notwithstanding my personal anguish, I hope this will not cause any damage to the hard-earned peace and development in the state, and that the efforts I have been focusing during the last few years, would continue unabated, ensuring justice to one and all,” Singh wrote in the letter on Saturday as he informed the party president of his decision to step down, barely five months before the state assembly elections are due early next year. Singh's decision came after months of infighting and dissidence, which escalated after the promotion of Congress leader Navjot Sidhu to the position of the state unit chief. Without mincing words, Singh said that he felt “humiliated” by the recent developments in the state party unit and sensed a lack of trust in him on part of the Congress high command.In the letter, Singh said: “The people of Punjab are looking up to the Indian National Congress for its mature and effective public policies, which not only reflect upon good politics, but also address the concerns of the common man that are specific to this border state.”Listing out the achievements of his government over the last few years, notwithstanding “numerous challenges”, he said: “My government fulfilled 89.2% of the promises, while work is in progress on the remaining commitments.”Tensions between Singh and Sidhu, simmering since 2019, mounted in May after the Punjab government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 case of police firing on a crowd protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book.Sidhu and some leaders publicly accused Singh of corruption, prompting the Congress to set up the three-member panel. The panel met around 150 functionaries – including Singh twice -- and submitted its report to Gandhi on June 10. The panel recommended that Singh retain the charge but Sidhu be accommodated in a key role. On July 18, Congress appointed Sidhu as the president of its Punjab unit.On the issue of the sacrilege cases and the subsequent police action of 2015, for which his government came under criticism not only from the Opposition but some leaders from the party’s state unit questioning him for not doing enough, Singh said the government which he earlier headed was committed to ensuring justice in the matter. “Criminal proceedings in these cases are currently underway and I am sure that justice will be done in due course,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-expressed-personal-anguish-to-sonia-gandhi-in-letter-before-resignation-101632077881878.html
20-09-2021||India||Charanjit Singh Channi appointment doesn’t hurt Sidhu’s CM prospects in Punjab||The Congress’s Punjab plan went off smoothly with the removal of Captain Amarinder Singh as CM and finding a suitable replacement in Charanjit Singh Channi, 58, who was picked to lead the border state on Sunday, party insiders said.Two senior leaders told HT that while the high command took the final call that the Congress government in Punjab required an urgent reshuffle at the top, the leadership was also clear that it should preferably be someone other than state party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.This arrangement, however, is temporary, according to Congress functionaries and doesn’t discount the possibility of Sidhu becoming CM if Congress wins the assembly elections next year.“In our meetings, we had discussed plans for Amarinder’s replacement. We found it wouldn’t be suitable to appoint Sidhu as it would be like rubbing it on Amarinder and his loyalists,” said a senior leader involved in the Punjab plan.The Congress looked at three choices: a Dalit, a Hindu or a Sikh leader as Singh’s successor.“Our choice included Channi and Sunil Jakhar”, said the leader cited above. Channi was the minister for technical education Jakhar was the predecessor of Sidhu in the PCC.While Channi’s name found lot of support a section of the party opposed Jakhar’s name. We even got threats from a former PCC chief that he will quit the party with his followers if Jakhar is made the CM,” said the leader cited above.The option was to anoint a Dalit leader—the state has about 32% Dalit (both Hindu and Sikh) population that constitutes a strong vote bank— was also an attempt to reach out to a wider voter base.But after Amarinder quit, a section of Sidhu’s followers started demanding that he be made the CM.“The instruction is given from Delhi to Harish Rawat, general secretary in charge of the state, and party general secretary Ajay Maken, was to secure the consent of all MLAs to let the high command decide the new chief minister. They convinced all MLAs and a unanimous decision was taken to let Congress president Sonia Gandhi decide the new CM,” said the second leader.Singh, 79, resigned on Saturday months before the Punjab election as the party wanted a new face to fight anti-incumbency after ground reports suggested that he had lost popularity. The Congress leadership also secured signatures of more than 60 MLAs demanding Singh to be removed.Singh cautioned the party against the appointment of Sidhu as the CM. “I will never allow him (Sidhu) to come,” Singh said in a few media interviews and alleged, “He is an anti-national element. I will not allow him.” Singh alleged that Sidhu was a friend of Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan and chief of army staff, Qamar Javed Bajwa.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala later tweeted, “INC creates history by appointing Punjab’s first Dalit CM in Sardar Charanjit Channi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/charanjit-singh-channi-appointment-doesn-t-hurt-sidhu-s-cm-prospects-in-punjab-101632077645143.html
20-09-2021||India||Women may lead BRO projects along border||The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) plans to create four women-led road construction companies (RCC) to handle projects in forward areas along the India-China border, officials familiar with the development said on Sunday. Two women-led RCCs each will come up in the western and the north-eastern sectors, the defence ministry said in a statement.The announcement comes weeks after BRO appointed a woman officer, Major Aaina Rana, as the commanding officer of the 75 RCC at Pipalkoti in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli. She will be responsible for providing forward connectivity along the India-China border. Rana’s RCC is the BRO’s first women-led RCC as all three platoon commanders under her are women engineers.“As India celebrates 75 years of Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, it also celebrates the ongoing efforts of our nation towards women empowerment…By empowering them with the tools of authority, responsibility and respect, BRO firmly believes that women will always be active participants in the endeavour of nation building,” the statement said.In April, BRO’s Vaishali S Hiwase took over as the first woman commanding officer of an RCC responsible for providing forward connectivity along the India-China border in the northern sector.BRO is building strategic roads in Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim and plans to complete all 61 strategic roads along the China border by December 2022 to allow swifter mobilisation of troops and stores to forward areas.The move to create women-led RCCs comes at a time when new avenues are being opened for women in the armed forces and those wanting to join the armed forces.Last month, the Indian Army promoted five women officers to the time-scale rank of colonel after the completion of the mandatory 26 years of service. That was the first time that women officers were promoted to the rank outside the medical, legal and education wings of the army.The development came 18 months after the Supreme Court ruled that women officers, who joined the Indian Army through short service commission (SSC), were entitled to permanent commission and command roles.The doors of the of the National Defence Academy (NDA), thus far a male preserve, are also being opened to women. Women were allowed to serve in select branches of the three services as SSC officers almost three decades ago. The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened to them at a steady pace. As of February 2021, there were 9,118 women serving in the army, navy and air force.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the Indian Air Force decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Women are now being assigned to warships too, but tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-may-lead-bro-projects-along-border-101632076881307.html
20-09-2021||India||200k volunteers, 400k workers drafted to fight Covid in rural areas||A portal set up in June to track how Covid-19 is being managed in the rural areas now shows that four lakhfrontline workers and two lakh volunteers have been drafted to fight the pandemic at the grassroots level. Called the Covid-19 dashboard and managed by the Panchayati Raj ministry, the portal has data of the over 2.5 lakh panchayats that India has and shows that 45% of them have set up health and sanitation committees. The dashboard was set up after the second wave of the pandemic with the idea to prevent another devastating wave from wreaking havoc. “Different states have adopted different strategies to manage Covid. Even within the state, districts have taken different approaches. Similarly, at the panchayat level, some have focused on handwashing campaigns, others may have resorted to creating WhatsApp groups or wall paintings to make people aware about social distancing,” said a senior official of the Panchayati Raj ministry, on condition of anonymity. Another senior official of the ministry said the dashboard helps track Covid-related activities in every panchayat. “Such granular data was not available last year. This helps us to be prepared and step up efforts where needed,” he said. To be sure, the government has panchayat-level data for several other programmes under rural development. During the last five years, it even started the satellite mapping of rural assets and public programmes. The dashboard also shows that over 86,000 panchayats have conducted Covid-awareness campaigns while 84,000 have updated community preparedness checklists.It also shows that 57,000 panchayats have been able to identify high-risk populations in their areas, and more than 1.5 lakh home isolation kits—basic medicines and thermometers—have been distributed in rural India.But ministry officials say the penetration of Covid-related activities could be much deeper in the rural areas as states operate differently. “After all, we can’t impose anything on the states as panchayat is a state subject. We are here only to help,” said the first official. At present, the dashboard uploads data every fortnight. “But if the cases increase, we also have the provision to upload data in real-time,” said the second official.On September 15, the country registered 30,570 new casesin the rural areas, mostly in the southern states with Kerala topping the list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/200k-volunteers-400k-workers-drafted-to-fight-covid-in-rural-areas-101632076861903.html
20-09-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination drive scaled up in poll-bound states||Administering at least one Covid vaccine dose to the entire eligible population in election-bound states such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand is a priority for the government, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.Also, the target of a landmark one billion Covid vaccine doses is likely to be achieved by the second week of October, officials from the central government said.“We are looking at giving at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine to all eligible beneficiaries in states that are going to have assembly elections soon. States such as Goa and Himachal Pradesh have already seen 100% first-dose coverage, and then there are states such as Punjab and Uttar Pradesh where assembly elections are to be held next year and we shall ensure at least first dose is given,” said a senior government functionary aware of the development, on condition of anonymity.Goa and Himachal Pradesh have already administered at least one dose of the vaccine to their entire eligible population.The Centre has been stressing the need to avoid crowding as far as possible to curb disease transmission; and if there is a need to step out at public places where there is a possibility of having a heavy crowd then it should be done only by those who are fully vaccinated.“The vaccines that we have are disease modifying, which means we know that vaccines prevent severe disease and death,” said Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), during a media briefing on Covid-19 updates recently.“...mass gatherings should be discouraged, particularly in the upcoming festival season because we still have few districts which are having the problem; and full vaccination should be a pre-requisite if it is absolutely essential or it becomes critical to have a gathering of some people,” he added.Cumulative Covid vaccine doses administered in the country crossed 800 million on Saturday. The government said 20% of India’s adult population has been fully vaccinated and 62% has got at least one dose.Of all the vaccines used, around 89% have been the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covishield. At least 10% have been Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and about 1% the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine.At least 50% of the beneficiaries have been administered the first dose in Uttar Pradesh. The target is to cover 100% of the eligible population with at least one shot before the polls, a senior official said.Commenting on the delay in the availability of Pfizer and Moderna’s Covid vaccines in India, the official said changes in the demands of manufacturers from time to time were responsible. “We already have given permission for emergency use and the rest of the formalities are being taken care of,” the official added.The Centre is also focusing on increasing vaccination coverage at tourist hot spots in the country.On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that tourist destinations were prioritised for vaccination during an interaction with health care workers and vaccine beneficiaries in Goa.He said that states and Union territories such as Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Chandigarh, and Lakshadweep have administered at least one dose of the vaccine to its entire population. He added that Sikkim, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Kerala, Ladakh, Uttarakhand, and Dadra Nagar Haveli were not far behind.“India has given a lot of priority to states with potential tourism sector in the vaccination campaign. It is very important that our tourism destinations reopen. Himachal Pradesh and Goa are some examples; everyone has received their first dose already. Tourists can visit these places with a feeling of safety,” said Modi.Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, also asked 11 states that are reporting a more dangerous type of dengue to take steps to ensure early detection of cases, start fever helplines and stock adequate amount of testing kits, larvicides, and medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jab-drive-scaled-up-in-poll-bound-states-101632076801296.html

20-09-2021||India||YSRCP sweeps Andhra Pradesh local body elections||The ruling YSR Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh secured a landslide victory in the elections held to Zilla Parishad and Mandal Parishad (block parishads), the counting for which was held on Sunday.The YSRCP won 547 out 553 Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituency (ZPTC) seats and 7,284 out of 8,063 Mandal Parishads Territorial Constituencies (MPTC), results for which were declared till 7.30 pm.Counting for the pending 88 ZPTCs and 1,504 MPTCs was underway, when the reports last came in, according to the state election commission.The main opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) won only three ZPTCs and 675 MPTCs. While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its alliance partner Jana Sena drew a blank in Zilla Parishads, it won 23 and 85 seats in the Mandal Parishad elections, respectively.State panchayat raj and rural development minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said the poll outcome proved that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had gained the trust of the people by fulfilling the election promises. “The results clearly show that the TDP has lost the people’s support,” he added.In a statement, the party claimed that the ZPTC and MPTC results suggested TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu’s downfall in his own assembly constituency Kuppam in Chittoor district. “The YSRCP bagged all the four ZPTCs and 62 out of 65 MPTCs in Kuppam. In the gram panchayat elections held in February this year, too, YSRC had won 75 out of 89 gram panchayats,” the statement read. However, TDP spokesman and former minister S Chandramohan Reddy dismissed YSRCP’s claims that it had achieved a landslide victory in the polls. He reminded the ruling party that the TDP had boycotted the local body elections after its representation against the election irregularities earlier fell on deaf ears.“It is an open secret that the ruling YSRCP resorted to threats, intimidation and forced unanimous results in many places. They misused the police and the official machinery without any shame,” he said.In all, there are 660 ZPTC seats and 10,047 MPTC seats in the state, of which as many as 126 ZPTC and 2,371 MPTC seats were elected unanimously in March last year, when the election process to the local bodies commenced.Polling for the remaining seats, which were initially scheduled for sometime later that month, was put on hold by former state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar in view of the nationwide lockdown imposed due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.The process for the conduct of elections to the remaining seats resumed on April 2 this year, a day after new state election commissioner Neelam Sawhney assumed charge.Polling for 515 ZPTC seats and 7,219 MPTC seats was held on April 8. In all, 12,955,980 voters exercised their franchise. Voting could not be held for eight ZPTC and 355 MPTC seats due to court cases, while it was withheld in 11 ZPTCs and 81 MPTCs due to the death of the candidates.Counting of votes for the ZPTC and MPTC elections was supposed to be held on April 10, but was stalled by a single judge bench of the state high court following a petition filed by the TDP and Jana Sena parties.Later on May 21, the bench ordered cancellation of the ZPTC and MPTC polls on the grounds that the SEC had not followed the mandatory four-week model code of conduct to be in force between the date of announcement of schedule and the conduct of the elections, as per the Supreme Court directions.The SEC challenged the single-judge bench verdict before a division bench comprising chief justice Arup Kumar Goswami and justice N Jayasurya. The SEC argued that the Supreme Court rule for following four-week model code of conduct cannot be applicable to the local body elections.It further contended that the four-week rule was not followed for municipal elections and gram panchayat elections held in April this year. For municipal elections, there was a gap of only 22 days and for panchayat elections, it was only 26 days.After hearing the arguments, the division bench of the high court on September 16 struck down the single-judge’s order and permitted the SEC to go ahead with the counting of votes for the ZPTC and MPTC elections||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysrcp-sweeps-andhra-pradesh-local-body-elections-101632076568969.html
20-09-2021||India||‘Survey shows farm incomes have risen’||Amid continuous protests against the contentious farm laws, a Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of Agricultural Households, Land and Livestock Holdings of Households of Rural India, 2019, conducted from January to December 2019 revealed a 59% surge in farmers’ incomes that are not adjusted for inflation, on a nominal basis.The survey also showed that farmers’ incomes adjusted for inflation -- which economists call real income -- have risen by about 2%. However, when the inflation-unadjusted incomes are distributed among the number of farming households to derive per capita farmers’ incomes, one gets a figure of ₹27 a day, as reported by HT earlier.In an emailed interview to Zia Haq, Union agriculture secretary Sanjay Agrawal answers key questions on the survey.This survey is a departure from previous situational assessment surveys in that it accounts for earnings from land holdings and livestock, not just crops. The parameters of the two surveys are different. What’s the rationale for this?That’s correct. The National Statistics Office (NSO) of Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPYI) carried out a survey on “Land and Livestock Holdings of Households and Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households” in the rural areas of India with an integrated schedule of enquiry. Prior to this, Land and Livestock Holding Surveys (LHS) and Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of Agricultural Households used to be conducted as separate surveys. The idea is to take a holistic view of a farmers’ income. There is no sense in doing separate surveys to assess incomes from dairy and livestock, for instance, because dairying is a major area of farming activity.What is the average monthly income of an agricultural household according to this survey? Can you explain in full all the sources of income that were taken into consideration?Sure. At the all-India level, an average monthly income per agricultural household during agricultural year 2018-19 is ₹10,218. Out of the total average, income from wages is ₹4,063, followed by cultivation /net receipt from crop production ( ₹3,798), net receipt from farming of animals ( ₹1,582), net receipt from non-farm business ( ₹641) and income from leasing out of land ( ₹134). Out of the total income earned by agricultural households, 39.8 % of income is earned from wages followed by cultivation/net receipt from crop production (37.2 percent), farming of animals (15.5%), and income from non-farm business (6.3%).So, the survey includes non-farm wages too?Yes, the objective of the survey is clear. It is to capture the current income situation of an agricultural household at a holistic level and not leave out any source of income. That’s how we can know what their total income situation is. SAS definition of cultivator is any household who gets output worth ₹4,000 a year and is self-employed in agriculture as main or subsidiary occupation. So, if one keeps one goat just to get little milk for tea, etc, and gets, say, 150 litres of milk a year, and is engaged in non-agriculture activity as the main occupation, he becomes a cultivator based on this definition. Thus, going by the definition, this 37.2 % from crop production is not the right reflection of income from cultivation by land-owning farmers.Can you clarify how the survey arrives at the average monthly income of ₹10,218 and its methodology?Sure, I am happy to explain. An agriculture household earns income from different sources as evident from the survey report. Members of an agriculture household may be pursuing various agriculture and non-agricultural activities. It reveals that wages comprise the maximum share of the income of an agriculture household followed by income from crops. Wages can be from different sources like agriculture wages for a variety of farm activities and also MGNREGS. If the average monthly income of the agriculture household is ₹10,218 as mentioned in the report, then the average daily income would be 10,218x12/365= ₹336. Even if we take the monthly income from the crops alone (Table 1) which is ₹3,798, then the daily income would be 3,798/30 = ₹126 which is much higher than ₹27 projected by a section of the media.From the above table, it is evident that the average monthly income of an agricultural household is ₹10,218. Out of which, income from wages ₹4,063 (39.8%) income from crop production ₹3,798 (37.2%), income from farming of animals ₹1,582 (15.5%), income from non-farm business ₹641 (6.3%), income from leasing out of land ₹134 (1.3%). Source: NSS Report No. 587: Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India, 2019The survey shows an inflation-unadjusted increase in total monthly incomes of about 59%, if one compares the current income level of ₹10,128 with ₹6,426 from the previous 2012-13 survey. But part of the increase is because of accounting of non-farm income such as land lease? But part of the increase in farm income is because the survey accounts for non-farm incomes too, such as land lease?As I said, the idea is to measure an agricultural household’s total income situation. The title of the survey itself suggests so. There is no reason at all to do separate surveys of dairy and livestock income. The objective is to get a comprehensive idea about the income situation of an agricultural household. Let me re-emphasise that even if we talk of income from crops alone, that works out to be ₹126 per day, not ₹27 or so as some media reports say. Beside the increase in income of agri households, they benefited from increase in real prices of agriculture commodities. The WPI for agri in these six years increased from 111 to 134 and the WPI for non-agri increased from 106 to 116. Thus, the terms of trade index moved in favour of agri from 104 to 120, an increase of 16 per cent between 2012-13 and 2018-19. Source: Niti Aayog.Don’t you think farmers need even higher incomes, adjusted for inflation, because they are still affected by poor realisations as markets are always uncertain?Of course. That is why there has been an unprecedented enhancement in budget allocation. In the year 2013-14, the budget allocation for the department of agriculture was only ₹21,933.50 crore. This has been increased by more than 5.5 times to ₹1,23,017.57 crores in 2021-22.A total of ₹1.58 lakh crore has been released so far to 11.37 crore farmers’ families through direct transfer into their bank accounts under the PM-KISAN scheme. The recently enacted farm law related to Trade & Commerce of Farmers Produce creates an ecosystem for sale of scheduled agriculture commodities at farmgate level, which shall create opportunities of value addition at the village levels, leading to further enhancement of agricultural household’s income.Further, this will accelerate more investment in marketing and supply chain infrastructure, including storage facilities near to farm gate, creating more employment opportunities for rural areas.The farm law related to the Farming Agreement shall support farmers, especially small and marginal farmers, with a legal framework to produce high value crops, which shall be instrumental in additional income from cultivation. The fixation of MSP at one-and-a-half times the cost of production and ensuring enhanced procurement has been a major focus as well. The institutional credit for farmers has increased from ₹7.3 lakh crore in 2013-14 and has reached over ₹16.6 lakh crore in 2020-21 The government has approved ₹1 lakh crore Agriculture Infrastructure fund for building post-harvest and other agriculture-related infrastructure near the farm gate.The government has been actively promoting Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) for better bargaining power with the market and to get good prices for their produce.Do you think there is any improvement in the situation of farmers between the two surveys 2012-13 to 2018-19?Yes. The viability of agriculture has improved, the overall indebtedness has come down and appetite for risk mitigation has improved.Viability of agricultureThe number of rural households getting primary income from agriculture has gone up from 54% in 2013 to 58% in 2019. That is agriculture assumes more economic importance to more rural households. The income of agricultural households increased in nominal terms by 59% between 2013 and 2019 (from 6,426 to 10,219). The Consumer Price Index (rural) increased by 35% (from 105 to 142) during the same period, suggesting a real income increase of 24% to agricultural households. The share of income from crop production of agricultural households in the lowest size class of land possessed (having < 0.01 hectares or landless) has increased from 1% to 15% between 2013 to 2019. Their income from farming (including livestock farming) has increased from 27% to 34%.Overall indebtedness of agricultural households has come downThe percentage of agricultural households indebted has come down from 52% in 2013 to 50% in 2019. The percentage decrease is substantial in agricultural households having less than 1 acre of land.In land size class < 0.01, the decrease is 3.4% (from 41.9% to 38.5%) and in the next lowest size class (having <0.04 hectare (one acre)) the decrease is a maximum of 6.5% (from 47.3% to 40.8%).The amount of outstanding credit has come down substantially in the lowest land size class that is from ₹31,100 to ₹26,883.The decrease in nominal terms is 14%, adjusting for inflation the decrease is more than 50%.Crop insurance (risk mitigation) has gone upThe percentage of crop-producing households insuring their crops has substantially increased, which indicates more farmers are adopting risk mitigation measures.

20-09-2021||India||Jaishankar discusses Afghanistan situation with Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal||The developments in Afghanistan and other regional issues figured in discussions on Sunday between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his visiting Saudi Arabian counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan al Saud.Prince Faisal is the first Saudi minister to visit India since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out last year. Strategic and security cooperation between the two countries have grown in recent years and they held their first naval exercise in August.“Very useful exchange of views on Afghanistan, the Gulf and the Indo-Pacific,” Jaishankar said in a tweet after the meeting. He added that he and Prince Faisal had discussed “cooperation in the political, security and socio-cultural pillars of our strategic partnership”.India has urged the world community not to rush into recognising the Taliban setup in Kabul, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointing out last week that the new regime in Afghanistan is not inclusive and was formed without negotiations.The discussions between the two ministers on Sunday will help shape the way forward on Afghanistan, including the issue of recognising the setup created by the Taliban after they took over the country on August 15.Prince Faisal had recently said Saudi Arabia hopes the Taliban’s interim cabinet will help Afghanistan to achieve stability and overcome violence and extremism. He also said that Saudi Arabia will support “the choices the Afghan people make regarding the future of their country, away from external interference”.The external affairs ministry said in a statement that the two ministers also discussed all issues related to bilateral relations and regional and international issues of mutual interest. They reviewed the implementation of the Strategic Partnership Council Agreement signed by the two sides during Modi’s visit to Saudi Arabia in October 2019.“They expressed satisfaction at the meetings held under the Agreement and progress achieved. Both sides discussed further steps to strengthen their partnership in trade, investment, energy, defence, security, culture, consular issues, health care and human resources,” the statement said.The ministers also discussed bilateral cooperation at multilateral forums such as the UN, G20 and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).Jaishankar tweeted that he had urged Prince Faisal for the “early resumption of direct flights to Saudi Arabia”, and that the two sides had agreed to “work closely on all Covid-related challenges, including to travel”.The external affairs ministry said Jaishankar had appreciated Saudi Arabia’s support for the Indian community during the pandemic and urged Saudi Arabia to further relax restrictions on travel from India.In addition to being one of India’s largest energy suppliers, Saudi Arabia is home to 2.6 million Indians, the largest expatriate community in the kingdom and one of the biggest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia.Last month, Saudi Arabia relaxed travel restrictions for Indians who have received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine in the kingdom. Under new guidelines, Indians who travel to India after receiving both doses in Saudi Arabia will be able to directly return to the kingdom without having to quarantine in a third country. The move benefited Indians who work in Saudi Arabia and were stuck in the country because of strict travel restrictions.Prince Faisal is scheduled to meet the Prime Minister on Monday before he departs for New York to participate in the UN General Assembly session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-discusses-afghanistan-situation-with-saudi-counterpart-prince-faisal-101632076205680.html
20-09-2021||India||Monsoon deficiency drops to 4% due to September rains: IMD||There has been a 4% deficiency in monsoon rains till Sunday in comparison to the 9% deficiency at the end of August, even as more showers are expected till the end of this month, India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s extended range forecast revealed.Currently, the monsoon is in the “normal” category which is 104% to 96% of the long period average.Monsoon rains have been extremely skewed this year with 9.6% excess at the end of June, 6.8% deficiency in July, 24% deficiency in August and 28.7% excess in September till Sunday. Instead of July and August, September has been the most active monsoon month this year.According to the north Indian Ocean’s extended range outlook, a cyclonic circulation is likely to form over east-central Bay of Bengal around September 23-24 with a near similar pattern of movement as the one that is presently over Madhya Pradesh. The cyclonic circulationlikely to form over Bay of Bengalis expected to bring widespread rains over central and parts of northwest India.“The monsoon trough is very active right from the northern parts of the country to the western Pacific. The favourable position of Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is supporting convective activity. Though a cyclonic circulation is weaker in intensity than a low pressure system, it is likely to bring rainfall over many parts of the country till the end of the month,” Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD, said.The MJO is an eastward moving disturbance of clouds, rainfall, winds and pressure that traverses the planet in the tropics and returns to its initial starting point in 30 to 60 days on average, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Its location and amplitude strongly modulates the intensity of tropical convection and features like low pressure systems over the north Indian Ocean.In September, the monsoon season changed so abruptly that districts which were “severely” and “extremely” dry as per the IMD’s drought monitoring from June to August, have now turned “mildly dry” as per the standard precipitation index (SPI).The SPI is an index used to monitor drought -- it is negative for drought and positive for wet conditions.For the period June to August, 129 districts were found to be in moderately/severely/extremely dry conditions or moderately/severely arid conditions, and 43 districts under dry conditions in all the three drought indices (rainfall, aridity and SPI monitored by IMD). These 43 districts remained under severe water-stressed conditions till the end of August.The maximum number of districts which faced dry/arid conditions were in Gujarat, but are now in wet condition following widespread and heavy rain this month. Almost all of northeast India and Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh continue to remain dry.“There is a sudden revival in the dry states which is good because there were drought conditions in Gujarat and parts of Odisha. This will help in groundwater recharge ahead of winter crops,” Pulak Guhathakurta, head of climate research division at IMD Pune, said.“Power of the #monsoon! Rainfall deficit at the end of August (left) turning to rainfall surplus in mid-September (16th, right). Red colors showing drought and green wet areas! Entire scenario changed due to rainfall in a few days! Regions face both drought and wet extremes!!” tweeted Vimal Mishra, associate professor, civil engineering and earth sciences at IIT Gandhinagar, with maps of soil moisture.Normally, five to six depressions form during the monsoons (June- September) whichenhances rain in the core monsoon zone when they travel in the west-northwest direction. However, the first depression of this monsoon formed in September over northwest Bay of Bengal. It intensified into a deep depression on September 13 and moved across Odisha and north Chhattisgarh during September 13 and 14, and weakened into a well-marked low pressure area over northeast Madhya Pradesh on September 15. A cyclonic circulation also formed over east central Bay of Bengal on September 16 which moved to Odisha and another cyclonic circulation was over south Gujarat at the same time.“A cyclonic circulation formed yesterday, which is lying over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining areas of north Odisha-West Bengal-Bangladesh coasts, will travel and bring rain. Another is expected to form next week. There is likely to be active monsoon conditions till the end of month. This is mainly because of the location of MJO and active northwest Pacific. The remnants of systems forming in the Pacific also help in development of low pressure areas and cyclonic circulations over Bay of Bengal. We had forecast this early this month,” IMD director general M Mohapatra explained.The withdrawal of monsoons from northwest India has already been delayed by three days. The IMD’s extended range forecast indicates widespread rainfall till October 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-deficiency-drops-to-4-due-to-september-rainsimd-101632075484953.html
20-09-2021||India||3,000kg drugs worth ₹21,000 crore from Afghanistan seized at Gujarat port||In possibly the biggest ever single seizure of drugs in India, the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) has recovered 3,000kg of Afghan heroin worth approximately ₹21,000 crore in the international market from two containers at Mundra port in Gujarat, people familiar with the development said on Sunday.The consignment, originating from Afghanistan, now under Taliban rule, was shipped to Gujarat on September 13-14 via Iran’s Bandar Abbas Port and was hidden inside the containers of semi-processed Afghan talc, imported by a firm based in Andhra Pradesh.A Chennai-based couple has been arrested and several Afghan nationals from the Delhi-National Capital Region have been detained by agencies. They are being intensively interrogated for possible Taliban-ISI link, said an official, requesting anonymity.The DRI on September 16 and 17 searched the two containers, exported by a Kandahar-based company, on the basis of specific intelligence inputs upon which it found 1,999.58kg of heroin packed in two bags in one container and 988.64 kg heroin in one bag in another container. It was layered between the talc to avoid detection by security and customs officials.Experts from the Gandhi Nagar Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) examined the substance and found it to be “very high quality” heroin that likely originated in Afghanistan. Officials have estimated the worth of heroin at ₹7 crore per kg in the international market, which makes it the largest seizurein India ever.Following the recovery, searches have been carried out at several places, including Delhi, Ahmedabad and Gandhidham in Gujarat and a few places in Andhra Pradesh.Several Afghan nationals have been “picked up” and are being questioned about suspected links with the consignment/its smugglers,the officials cited above said.Intelligence agencies believe that Pakistan and anti-India elements in the Taliban together are trying to push Afghan heroin into India to shore up finances for terror activities.There have already been multiple meetings among central agencies to discuss the impact in terms of drugs smuggling, infiltration of foreign terrorists and terror activities in India following the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul on August 15.The Afghanistan government had briefly banned the export of talc in 2015, which are a major source of funding for both Taliban and Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) as they get $10 to $12 per tonne mined talc, used in baby powder, in Nangarhar, Sherzad and Achin areas, said a counterterrorism official who asked not to be named.Officials said there could be several more arrests in this case as it has larger international ramifications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3000kg-drugs-worth-21-000-crore-from-afghanistan-seized-at-gujarat-port-101632074400922.html
20-09-2021||India||UP man shot by son he pestered to study||A 19-year-old man allegedly shot at his father after being asked to study in the Chinhat area of Lucknow on Sunday, officials said. While the accused, Aman Yadav, is absconding, his father, Akhilesh Yadav, 45, is undergoing treatment at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences hospital in Lucknow, the officials said. According to officials, Akhilesh, a private security guard, was returning home after a morning walk on Sunday when he spotted Aman at a shop near their house. He scolded his son about his performance in school exams and asked him to study. Aman is a student in Class 10.“Enraged over being reprimanded, Aman rushed home, got a double barrel gun and shot at his father when Akhilesh was entering the house,” assistant deputy commissioner of police SM Qasim Abidi said. “The bullet hit Akhilesh in the thigh. Aman then fled the scene,” Abidi said.A police team rushed to the scene after the victim’s neighbours alerted them, and took Akhilesh to a hospital, the official said. He is reported to be out of danger, he said. “The gun used in the crime was registered in Akhilesh’s name,” he said. Chinhat police have filed a case under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 307 (attempt to murder) in connection with the incident and a probe in the matter has begun, he said. “Two police teams have been formed to search for and arrest Aman Yadav who is absconding. We have also sought help from his family members and relatives in tracing him,” said Abidi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-man-shot-by-son-he-pestered-to-study-101632074340969.html
20-09-2021||India||Monsoon normal despite heavy rainfall in September||Only about two weeks remain in the 122-day-long June-September monsoon season. Given this, cumulative monsoon rainfall this season is likely to remain in the normal zone. This is despite the fact that there were days in the last two weeks when the departure of daily rainfall from past averages was higher than any other day this monsoon. Such days, as has been the pattern this season, only made up the deficit which was created due to dry patches in previous weeks. However, rainfall in the last two weeks has ended the deficit in the 130 main reservoirs of the country.High rainfall in the past two weeks has only reduced deficitThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) analyses trends in rainfall for any interval by comparing it with the average of rainfall for that interval in the 1961-2010 period (called the Long Period Average or LPA). As of 8.30am on September 18, cumulative rainfall’s departure from the LPA for this monsoon season was a deficit of 0.1% according to IMD’s gridded rainfall dataset, which is within the normal range. IMD considers a deviation of up to 20% on either side of LPA as normal, a positive deviation of 20% or more as excess, and a negative deviation of 20% or more as deficient rainfall.IMD’s broad categories, however, do not detail how rainfall has varied this season. Cumulative rainfall remained in the normal range throughout since June 29, but has also varied within this range. On June 30, there was a 15.2% surplus in cumulative rainfall. This changed to a 2.21% surplus on July 31 and a 5.48% deficit on August 31, before arriving at the 0.1% deficit on September 16.These changes in cumulative rainfall’s deviation from LPA have taken place on the back of wide variation in daily rainfall. In June, the daily rainfall was above the LPA on 18 of 30 days. Such days decreased to 14 in July and only 9 in August. The regular rainfall in September – 13 of 18 days have seen above LPA rainfall – has therefore only managed to make up for the deficit at the end of August.

20-09-2021||Today's||With Channi’s elevation, the Congress has an opportunity in 2022. But it won’t be easy||What guided the Congress’s choice of the new chief minister (CM) in Punjab? The fact of Charanjit Singh Channi being meritorious or was it just caste that clinched the issue? Regardless of the factors that weighed on the leadership’s mind, the party has, in its troubled times, scored a socially creative first — that of giving the state a Dalit Sikh CM.The new incumbent, who also practices Hindu rituals, is from the electorally significant Ramdasiya (Chamar) community, which is different from the Mazabhi (Balmiki) Sikhs. Ramdasiyas are concentrated primarily in Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and Kapurthala districts of the Doab between the Sutlej and Beas rivers. The region sends 23 legislators to the 117-member assembly, compared to 26 from Majha and 68 from Malwa.There is another first within the first in Channi’s surprise elevation. Giani Zail Singh, who served as Punjab’s first other backward class (OBC) CM in the 1970s, had accorded equal SC reservations to the two groups. But, for some inexplicable reasons, the Ramdasiyas never got to see power at the Centre. Be it under the Congress or the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), coveted political offices in Delhi went to Mazabhi Sikhs — former home minister Buta Singh; former deputy speaker CS Atwal and Dhanna Singh Gulshan, a minister in Morarji Desai’s Janata regime. The ministerial stints of Channi’s clansmen have been restricted to the state. Besides him, the other SC minister in the Amarinder Singh dispensation, Aruna Chaudhary, was also a Ramdasiya.In realpolitik terms, the freshly minted CM, albeit a three-time legislator from Chamkaur Sahib, lacks the political heft of his predecessor. That’s more so with the media painting him as a camp-follower of the Punjab Congress chief, Navjot Sidhu, rather than a leader in his own right, say, like Sukhjinder Randhawa or OP Soni, who took oath with Channi. A Hindu face from Amritsar, Soni is opposed to Sidhu in the local and state politics. The quick-fix media narrative has been fuelled further by the central leadership’s pointsperson for Punjab, Harish Rawat, whose remarks giving primacy to Sidhu appeared to undermine the CM’s authority at the start of his innings. Former state party president Sunil Jakhar wasn’t off the mark while pointing it out in a sharp rejoinder. But if the Congress wins elections under the new CM, Sidhu will have to remain content as the state unit committee chief, for it isn’t going to be easy for the party to anoint a Jat Sikh over a Dalit Sikh who helped it retain power.Much will depend, however, on Channi’s conduct as the CM, and his acceptability in the Jat Sikh-driven polity, which is very much linked to the promise of action on sacrilege cases against the Akali leadership. His target constituency should be the 60%+ OBC-Hindu-Dalit voters. The challenge for Channi is to be acceptable to the Hindus, if there is resistance from Jat Sikhs who wield way more clout than their 19% demographic share. For the present, the Congress, by projecting Channi, has upended the Aam Aadmi Party and the SAD-Bahujan Samaj Party alliance which was gaining ground in Doab. It, nevertheless, will be an uphill task for the faction-ridden party to translate into political support the euphoria over its seemingly bold social initiative.If the Congress fights the polls as one team, Channi’s Dalit appeal can be enchased across Punjab. His constituency, Chamkaur Sahib, is in Ropar district, which straddles Doab and the larger Malwa region on the political map. But he won’t succeed unless the Gandhi family has his back.The so-called high command would be defeating its own cause if it promotes any parallel centre of power in the run-up to the polls. The arc-lights have to be on the CM who has to reach out to all groups to garner support. In the short term, Sidhu’s personalised feud with the Captain has resulted in the equal and mutual destruction of ambition. He would do well to wait his turn, and reconcile to being a facilitator rather than a competitor in the larger goal of the party retaining power. vinodsharma@hindstantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/with-channi-s-elevation-the-congress-has-an-opportunity-in-2022-but-it-won-t-be-easy-101632149888180.html
20-09-2021||Today's||Afghanistan: Don’t sacrifice women’s rights at the altar of geopolitics||Afghanistan was, and remains, a poster child of the landmark United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security. It has demonstrated that women’s voice, participation and leadership in peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building is indispensable to achieve sustainable peace, development and just societies. Conversely, because women’s rights have been systematically violated and women have been excluded from governance, peace and nation-building, conflict has become endemic.
20-09-2021||Today's||Beyond Quad, the quest for multi-alignment||During times of global fluidity, it is customary to look at realigning diplomatic equations. Several Indian thinkers advocate this. Some desire “strategic autonomy”. Others call for “non-alignment 2.0”. There is talk of “multi-alignment”. Conceptually, all this makes sense. It is appealing too. Despite differences, there is a common quest to realign in the light of changing dynamics. Precepts are also being put into practice. From the Pacific to the Caribbean, India has established institutional linkages. Ties with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) and the Gulf States have strengthened.
20-09-2021||Today's||The grim reality of women prisoners in India||The Covid-19 pandemic has been particularly unkind to women. Among the most adversely affected have been India’s women prisoners. Though they constitute a small proportion of the prison population, their conditions — hardly conducive at the best of times — have gone largely unnoticed.
20-09-2021||Editorials||The churn in Dalit politics||The appointment of a Dalit leader, Charanjit Singh Channi, as Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister — albeit only till elections early next year — comes at a critical moment in the evolution of Dalit politics. Beyond Punjab, this will lead to a renewed debate on the politics of Dalit representation in the country. The fact that Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati has already criticised Mr Channi’s elevation is not just because her party is a contender in Punjab in alliance with the Akali Dal — it is because there is currently an intense battle to win over the Dalit vote in the country.
