Similarly, a doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) lost ₹4.90 lakh to cyber criminals in June, after he clicked on a link of a text message, which he received on his phone, that said his internet banking application was blocked. Although Saxena and the AIIMS doctor, who asked not to be named, were conned in separate ways and probably by different cyber gangs, what is common between them is that they both got a part of their stolen money credited into their accounts within hours of reporting the crime to Delhi Police’s cyber crime helpline ‘155260’. While Saxena got back ₹2.25 lakh, ₹3.15 lakh was reverted to the doctor’s account. HT spoke to many officers in the cyber crime unit, who confirmed that of every 100 people who are duped online, only about 10 get their money back. But even these 10% victims getting their money back was made possible only after the national helpline ‘155620’ came into effect in Delhi in April this year. On June 17 this year, the Centre, under its scheme ‘Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System’, operationalised the helpline in some states for reporting all kinds of cyber crime and preventing loss of money in cases of cyber frauds. According to data by the Delhi Police’s Cyber Prevention, Awareness and Detection (CyPAD) Centre, the Delhi Police received total 3,112 complaints of cyber financial frauds on the helpline between April and August. The total amount siphoned off from the accounts of the victims, whose complaints were found to be genuine after verification, was nearly ₹14 crore. “Nearly 10% ( ₹1.42 crore) of the total defrauded amount was returned to the victims as they had alerted about the cyber frauds on the helpline on time and cyber cell officials could block the suspects’ accounts with the help of the concerned banks, online wallet firms and payment gateways,” said deputy commissioner of police (CyPAD) Anyesh Roy. Of the 3,112 complainants, nearly 800 people prevented the money from reaching the wrong hands by timely reporting about the frauds to the helpline. Around 300 of the nearly 800 victims got the stolen money credited to their bank accounts. For the rest, the refunds are partial and under process for reversal by the respective banks, merchants, online wallets and payment gateways, show CyPAD’s data. Earlier, victims of cyber frauds had to run from pillar to post to register their case and get their stolen money back. While there was hope of getting the stolen money back when the cases were solved and the suspects arrested, reversal of the amount was a tiresome and time-consuming task, said cyber experts and police officers HT spoke to. But, that has changed now. With the launch of the cyber crime helpline, the police, in coordination with the financial institutions, immediately crack down on the cyber criminals by blocking the accounts into which the defrauded money gets transferred or cancelling the delivery of the goods that the suspects order using the stolen money, said cyber security expert Amit Dubey. “By blocking their accounts, the agencies prevent the defrauded money from reaching the fraudsters,” said Dubey, who works as a resource person with 16 states police, including Delhi Police and Uttar Pradesh police, in solving cyber crimes. Officials say that many complainants could not get their money back because either they contacted the helpline late or their defrauded money had turned “irreversible” by the time police took action. DCP Roy said, “In case of cyber frauds, timely reporting of the crime is the key. Almost all the cases, where the victims’ money was retrieved, were reported within 24 hours of the crime. The chances of recovering the cheated money are certain till the illegal transactions don’t become irreversible, meaning the amount is either withdrawn in cash or reaches a stage where it is immediately not possible for the concerned financial institution to block the account.” Police officers said the quick reversal of the transaction in cyber frauds has become possible only after the helpline became functional. Earlier, people only had the option of filing their cyber crime complaints through emails or complaints at the police stations. Since converting the complaint into an FIR and beginning the investigation was a time-taking process, victims got their money only when the suspects were caught or cases were solved. “The victims got their money back only through the courts. There was nothing called immediate respite in terms of crediting back the defrauded amount,” said an officer posted in the cyber cell of east district. Rakshit Tandon, another cyber expert, believes that although the cyber crime helpline has been productive in terms of helping victims of cyber frauds, digital policing is the need of the hour keeping in mind the steep spike in such crimes. Lack of awareness among the public regarding cyber frauds and how and where to report about such cases on time is the main reason why people fall prey to such frauds and lose money. “Providing a safe and secure eco-system for digital payments is the objective of all financial institutions; no company wants their reputation to be compromised because of cyber criminals. It is important to have an extensive network of digital policing to safeguard money transactions. And for that, the agencies should ensure that no SIM card or bank account is activated without full proof verification. If these two areas are brought under check, cases of cyber frauds will certainly come down,” said Tandon. How cops act after receiving cyber fraud complaints on the helpline As a person informs the helpline about a cyber fraud, the policeman attending the call fills an online form using personal and transaction related details provided by the complainant. Once the form is submitted, the system generates a ticket for the complainant and sends an alert to the concerned banks, merchants, payment gateways or online wallets, where the stolen money gets transferred. The concerned financial institutions immediately block the money and return it to the complainant after verification. In Saxena’s case, the suspects had ordered three high-end iPhones costing over ₹3 lakh through an e-commerce site and the delivery address was in Patna. The cyber cell officers alerted the company, which cancelled the order and returned the money to Saxena’s account. “We have only got ₹2.25 lakh out of the ₹6.20 lakh that we lost. Although, we faced problems getting in touch with the cyber cell officers through the helpline, their response was quick once they received our complaint. My mother was in complete shock but she got some respite when some amount was reversed,” said Saxena’s daughter Ruchika Saxena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-cyber-crime-helpline-receives-over-3-000-complaints-since-its-launch-in-april-101632075190882.html
19-09-2021||Bangalore||‘None of you should take the opposition lightly’: Yediyurappa||Former Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Sunday cautioned his party colleagues against taking the opposition lightly in the upcoming elections. "I have a suggestion to all of you. None of you should take the opposition lightly. They have their own calculation and strengths," Yediyurappa said at the BJP Core Committee meeting here. The Lingayat strongman claimed that a few Congress leaders are in touch with some BJP leaders. "You need to tread with confidence without giving chance to such incidents (defection). We have to make a sincere effort for the BJP to come back to power with 140 seats in the next assembly elections," Yediyurappa, who stepped down as the Chief Minister on July 26, said here. He said the party can be strengthened by inducting into the BJP leaders from SC/ST and OBC communities. Further, he asked to include a team of 20 to 25 women and the BJP youth wing leaders at the booth level organisation. Yediyurappa also appealed to the party functionaries to make the welfare programmes of the Centre and the state government reach every household. He also told the gathering that he would take up a state-wide tour shortly to strengthen the party base. Yediyurappa reminded the core committee members that the BJP has to win both Hanagal and Sindagi assembly bypolls because its failure will send the wrong signals. "No one here should assume that Hanagal and Sindagi are easy turfs," Yediyurappa said. Speaking about the demolition of temple in Nanjangud in Mysuru recently, which drew widespread criticism, Yediyurappa said a decision has been taken not to allow destruction of any temples anywhere. He also said that the BJP government will file a review petition in the Supreme Court seeking "correction" in the judgment. "Whatever has happened is now over. It will not be repeated. Those party workers who are upset should take note of this," Yediyurappa said. BJP state chief Nalin Kumar Kateel and BJP national general secretary and Karnataka in-charge Arun Singh too addressed the gathering. In his address, Kateel took a dig at Congress leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah regarding his criticism of temple demolition in Nanjangud. He said this is one instance which occurred without the knowledge of the government but the Congress government turned a blind eye to the attacks and murders of many BJP workers in Karnataka. Senior party functionaries such as union ministers Pralhad Joshi, Shobha Karanjlaje and D V Sadananda Gowda, Karnataka ministers, former chief minister B S Yediyurappa, his son and BJP state vice-president B Y Vijayendra, BJP MLAs, MLCs, MPs and district level BJP functionaries are attending the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/none-of-you-should-take-the-opposition-lightly-yediyurappa-101632072838236.html
19-09-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath says govt raised farmers' income, removed middlemen||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath attacked the former governments and chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh claiming that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government under his leadership did more to uplift the conditions of farmers than previous governments.Speaking in Lucknow’s Lok Bhawan, Adityanath claimed that the UP government led by him ensured timely payment to the sugarcane farmers and revived old sugar mills while opening new ones. He said that farmers were dying due to hunger before the Adityanath government came to power and the BJP ensured adequate support.“The previous governments did the work of ruining the condition of farmers where they were forced to commit suicide. Our government revived all the shut sugar mills and even set up new ones. With this, our government also ensured timely payment to the sugarcane farmers,” Yogi Adityanath said.The chief minister also claimed that during the rule of the BJP sugarcane farmers received twice the amount of money than they received during the earlier regimes. “It is noteworthy that during Mayawati's tenure from 2007-2012, 30 lakh cane farmers were paid ₹52,131 crore and during the Akhilesh regime from 2012-2017, a payment of ₹95,215 crore was made to 33 lakh farmers. The payment made by the BJP-led UP government is twice the amount that was made by the former Bahujan Samajwadi Party government and 1.5 times more than the Samajwadi Party government,” the government highlighted in a press release.Yogi also said that the government procurement of crops during the rabi and kharif season increased under his government. He said that the government was focused on removing middlemen and purchasing directly from farmers.“During 2016-17, only 6 lakh metric tonnes of paddy was procured through the middlemen, and not directly from the farmers. The farmers did not get the benefit of the MSP. Even during the Covid period, more than 66 lakh metric tonnes of paddy were purchased from the farmers at MSP by our government,” he said.He further added that the government procured at least 56 lakh metric tons of wheat directly from the farmers.Direct Benefit TransferThe chief minister said that the state government transferred ₹37,388 crores to more than 2.54 crore farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana along with hiking the amount of MSP.Adityanath said that the government waived ₹36,000 crore of about 86 lakh farmers to help them get back on their feet. “The pro-farmers approach of the state government played a huge role in the production of 2,399 lakh MT of food grains during the past four and a half years. Furthermore, the government has also provided compensation of ₹2,376 crore to the farmers under Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana,” the chief minister said.The government in the release also said that it paid over ₹4.72 crore to farmers as crop loans, made at least 45 agricultural produce free from mandi duty, set up 220 more markets for the sale of farmers' crops, modernised 27 old mandis, reduced mandi duty by 1% and also established 291 e-NAM mandis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-says-govt-raised-farmers-income-removed-middlemen-101632072568824.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Anandpur Sahib sacrilege: Expose the conspirators, says SAD chief||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday slammed the Congress government for its failure to expose and act against conspirators behind the recent sacrilege at Takht Kesgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib. In a statement, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief said it was condemnable that the conspirators behind this heinous crime were not being brought to book. “No attempt is being made to investigate the antecedents of the culprit and find out whether he was instigated to commit this ghastly act to spoil the peace of the state,” he said. Sukhbir added that it was unfortunate that the police had not acted in the matter even five days after the sacrilege of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. “Incidents of sacrilege are taking place on a regular basis, but the police are not able to uncover the conspiracy,” he said. The SAD president said that even earlier peace and communal harmony of Punjab was destroyed through acts of sacrilege in both gurdwaras and temples. “This time, too, the Congress government is failing to prevent these planned incidents of sacrilege, which have the propensity to lead to communal clashes and spoil the peace and communal harmony of Punjab. If this conspiracy is not nipped in the bud, then the state could go back to the dark era,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/anandpur-sahib-sacrilege-expose-the-conspirators-says-sad-chief-101632069961063.html

I don’t have any interest to remain in this government if I am not allowed to work for the people of my constituency,” he added.On being contacted, Gollen said that the officers were not giving importance to the MLAs. He also alleged corruption in police stations and tehsils. He said that he will soon take up this issue with the chief minister.In July, Randhir Singh Golan, along with his two sons and wife, was allegedly booked for dowry demand and harassment on the complaint of his daughter-in-law.Gollen was earlier associated with the BJP but he left the party and contested independently from the Pundri assembly seat as the party did not give him a ticket and fielded Advocate Ved Pal. Reacting to a video in which he was heard saying that he will not hesitate to come out from the government if his concerns were not addressed, Gollen told HT that he has threatened to leave chairmanship and other facilities provided to him if the action was not taken on the concerns he raised.“The chief minister is an honest person but there are problems at the ground level, especially in tehsils and police stations,” he added. He, however, did not disclose the names of any officer involved in corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/alleging-negligence-by-officers-haryana-mla-threatens-to-withdraw-support-101632069122884.html

The CM also said that his government has reinforced the rule of law in the state and provided good governance in a transparent manner.“We delivered on all the promises we made before coming to power in 2017 catering to all the sections including youth, women, farmers, poor without any discrimination on caste or religion basis,” said Adityanath and further claimed that every individual is happy in the state because of the transparent development model. Further, he also said that it was because of this that his party was confident of winning more than 350 seats in the upcoming UP assembly elections next year. He made the claims during an event to celebrate the completion of four and a half years of his government.While slamming the previous regime for frequent riots in the state between 2012 and 2017, Adityanath also claimed that there were no riots under his rule. “My government may well boast of having no single riot during the last four and a half years, the criminals were shown their place and the property of mafias, acquired through unscrupulous manner, worth over ₹1800 crore was either seized or demolished,” he said.“The habitual criminals and mafia were directly under government patronage during the previous regime and the period between 2012 and 2017 witnessed riots every three-four days,” he had also said.‘UP now second largest economy’Claiming that Uttar Pradesh, which used to be the sixth largest economy, has now become the second, the CM said that over three lakh crore rupees have been invested in the state after his government held the investor summit in 2018.Also, the CM said that the state used to be at 14th position in the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ rankings in 2016 and has now reached the second rank. “With a conducive environment created by the government in terms of controlled law and order, transparent processes and prompt decision-making, it came as no surprise that even the companies from China relocated their businesses in Uttar Pradesh,” the CM said.“We have reached the position where the exports are at 1.61 lakh crore making Uttar Pradesh as the export hub while the MSME sector which was lying in the dumps during the previous government has become growth engine of the economy with the flagship scheme One District One Product (ODOP), promoting the traditional crafts and craftsmen, has been a grand success,” he added.Covid-19 managementAdityanath also said that the health infrastructure in UP was created during the most trying times and his government’s Covid-19 management was a “torchbearer” for many states. He also claimed that the relief given during disaster situations could not reach the beneficiaries for months, but his government enabled providing instant relief to those in crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-cm-confident-of-winning-350-seats-in-2022-assembly-elections-lauds-his-govt-s-pro-business-stance-covid-efforts-101632068701398.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: Hours before resigning as CM, Amarinder expressed anguish in letter to Sonia||Hours before he formally resigned as the Punjab chief minister on Saturday, Captain Amarinder Singh wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, expressing “anguish” at the political events of the past five months, which he said were “not based on understanding of the national imperatives of Punjab and its concerns”. “Notwithstanding my personal anguish, I hope this will not cause any damage to the hard-earned peace and development in the state, and that the efforts I have been focusing during the last few years would continue unabated, ensuring justice to one and all,” Amarinder said in the letter, while informing Sonia about his decision to relinquish office. Also Read: Amarinder Singh extends best wishes to Charanjit Singh ChanniAt the same time, he expressed satisfaction at having done his best for the border state that has many geo-political and internal security concerns. “The people of Punjab are looking up to the Indian National Congress for its mature and effective public policies,” he said, while listing his government’s achievements in the past four-and-a-half years. Amarinder said he had worked wholeheartedly for the welfare of the people of Punjab, the state he loves from the core of his heart. “This was satisfying for me because I won eight out of 13 seats in the Parliament elections of 2019 (besides winning) panchayat and urban local bodies elections decisively,” he said. ‘Fulfilled 89% promises’The two-time chief minister claimed that his government had fulfilled 89% of the promises while work was in progress on the remaining commitments. “The state is today nearly free from the pandemic, and efforts are continuing to improve health infrastructure and provide care to the deserving people free of cost to prevent the anticipated third wave,” he said, adding that Punjab was fully geared to meet the future challenges.On the sacrilege cases and subsequent police action of 2015, Amarinder said his government had established a judicial commission of inquiry, whose report was received on August 16, 2018. The report was accepted and full legal action was taken thereon, he said. With regard to the controversial power purchase agreements (PPAs) that were signed during the Akali regime, Amarinder said his government had invested ₹3,709 crore in electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure and released about ₹11,000 crore per annum for the benefit of 22 lakh scheduled caste and backward class consumers and 14 lakh farmers. “For the first time, we supplied subsidised power to the industry at an annual cost of over ₹2,000 crore,” he said, adding that the review of PPAs was underway. Talking about agricultural sector, Amarinder wrote that his government had provided debt relief of ₹4,624 crore to 5.64 lakh farmers and ₹526 crore to 2.68 lakh farm workers. Referring to his promise to break the back of drug peddlers and smugglers in the state, he said he had done so relentlessly by establishing a special task force that led to 62,744 arrests. He noted that with the revamp of the mining policy in 2017, the state’s yearly revenue had increased from ₹35 crore to ₹300 crore. Amarinder also drew Sonia’s attention to the fact that Punjab had been ranked at top in school education by the ministry of human resource development. He said of 19,000 schools in the state, 14,000 had been developed as smart schools, while the work is underway in the remaining 5,000 schools. “We have also started eight new universities in private and public sector, and established 19 new government colleges and 25 new ITIs,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-hours-before-resigning-as-cm-amarinder-expressed-anguish-in-letter-to-sonia-101632068761014.html

After we got his consent, we went to thank him,” said vice-chancellor Dr Ramesh Chandra Srivastava under whose guidance the Sukhet model was started and is now set to expand to various districts of the state and outside.Created in 2016 by converting the erstwhile Rajendra Agricultural University into a central university, the institution was recently in the news after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Mann Ki Baat programme, appreciated its ‘Sukhet Model’ initiative -- which incentivises waste management in rural management by making available organic fertilisers to farmers and providing assistance for the purchase of LPG cylinders, thus dealing with the problem of pollution and encouraging organic farming.The VC said that the model has huge potential to transform villages and also generate plenty of resources for the villagers, besides incentives in the form of money for cooking gas cylinders and encouragement for organic farming.The university has already started preparation for the convocation. The students have to apply by September 15 for obtaining a degree in person. Nearly 750 students are expected to receive their degree in person, said the VC.“Dr GR Chintala, chairman of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), is also set to visit the university to discuss the Sukhet model and how it could be funded for adoption in other places. Some entrepreneurs and non-government organisations have also evinced interest and want to adopt the Sukhet model. Some people also want to use funds under Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) for this. We are setting up units in seven more districts (Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, East and West Champaran, Gopalganj, Siwan and Saran) except Supaul and Mokama where the units are already working,” said Srivastava.At the first convocation of RAU in 2018, President Ram Nath Kovind had delivered the Convocation Address and underlined the growing need to modernize agriculture to face the emerging challenges both on the climate and productivity fronts. In 2019, the university had planned to invite Prime Minister to the convocation, but due to political developments, it could not materialise while 2020 was lost due to Covid disruption.Kovind had, in his address, exhorted the university administration to take the students to the birthplace of India’s first President Dr Rajendra Prassad at Jeeradei in Siwan district to draw inspiration from the personality of great freedom fighter.Srivastava said a Kisan Mela was organised at Jeeradei in Siwan after that. A big project is also in the pipeline for the place, he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/vice-president-to-be-chief-guest-at-2nd-rpcau-convocation-101632065762731.html
19-09-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan education dept issues advisory for parents, teachers against online games||Parents and teachers in Rajasthan have been advised not to let children become addicted to online games in order to avoid what is known as “gaming disorder”. In this age of technology, online gaming is very popular among children. The closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the use of mobile and internet among children, due to which the trend of online gaming among children has also increased rapidly. These online games are easily available to children and are played on devices like computers, tablets, and mobile phones, a release issued by the education department stated. These games are designed in such a way that they excite the player to the extent of passion to play further. This is the reason why players become addicted to it and eventually suffer from gaming disorder due to which the educational and social life of the child is adversely affected, said the release.In order to prevent the increasingly negative effects of online gaming in children and to make parents and teachers aware in this regard, an advisory has been issued by the Rajasthan School Education Council in which effective ways to overcome the ill effects of online gaming have been shared. The advisory contains the do’s and don’ts for parents and teachers to protect their children from online gaming addiction. “The parents and teachers are asked to keep a watch if the child is behaving abnormally and whether they are mostly involved in online activities. They must also watch out for a sudden increase in time spent online, especially on social media or if they switch the screen or the window on being or turn aggressive after using the internet,” the advisory stated. Child specialist, Dr Ashok Gupta said too much screen view is increasing among children which has resulted in physical and mental illnesses such as obesity, depression, anxiety, insomnia, sleep, and stress disorders. “We need to make proactive intervention, control and move them from online to real-time. The children need to be associated with sports,” he said. Rajasthan Teacher Association (Shekhawat), spokesperson, Prakash Mishra said children are into mobile and screen for a long these days which not only affects their eyes but also their attention and development of the brain – this leads to irritation and aggressive nature. Due to the pandemic, they were into mobiles. In school, they play together, study, and eat together, which strengthens their social behaviour,” he added.A mother of a 9-year-old boy, Poonam Dhaiya, said, “due to the pandemic, the children who used to spend more time in playgrounds are now spending most of their time using mobile phones or laptops. They are only supposed to attend online classes but there are chances that they may dive into other activities like gaming, instead of completely focusing on class. The parents cannot watch their children all the time and this creates a scope for children to get engaged in other activities without any monitoring of elders,” she said. Keep an eye on reducing grades and social behaviour of the child, and inform the school authorities. Establish an internet gateway at home that will help in effective monitoring, logging, and use of content by the child, the advisory said. Ensure that the child uses a computer that is placed in the family space. The advisory directs parents to use antivirus and firewall programs and configure the browser safely. “Take a screenshot (pressing print screen on keyboard) if something goes wrong while playing the online game and ask children to use a screen name instead of the real name. Inform if a stranger initiates inappropriate talks or asks for personal details”.The guidelines suggest asking children not to use a webcam, personal messaging or online chatting with strangers as it increases the possibilities of threat and misbehaviour from other players.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-education-dept-issues-advisory-for-parents-teachers-against-online-games-101632062582137.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: Illegal sand mining racket busted in Moga district||An illegal sand mining racket has been busted with the arrest of eight men in Punjab’s Moga district, police said on Sunday.The men were carrying out illegal sand mining on the Sutlej riverbed at Sherpur Taiba village, said police. Eight vehicles, including five tractor-trailers and tippers loaded with sand and three earthmoving machines, were also recovered.Dhruman H Nimbale, senior superintendent of police, Moga, said a police team raided the site on a tip-off and caught the accused red-handed. “Mining activities are prohibited, even at authorised sites, in Punjab due to the monsoon.

19-09-2021||Dehradun||Char Dham yatra leads to surge in pilgrim footfall in Haridwar, over 5k arrive daily||With the High Court allowing Char Dham yatra with Covid-19 curbs, pilgrim influx in Haridwar has suddenly witnessed a major spike. On a daily basis, over 5000 pilgrims and tourists are arriving at Har-Ki-Pauri with many of them heading towards Char Dham situated in Chamoli, Rudraprayag, and Uttarkashi districts. Owing to Haridwar falling in Garhwal division and being the entry point of the revered Char Dham shrines of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath along with, Hemkund Sahib, pilgrims from other states start their journey from Haridwar. From ancient times, taking sacred Ganga dip prior to going on Char Dham pilgrimage is considered auspicious. Booking and occupancy in hotels, guest houses, lodges, dharamshalas and ashrams have increased manifold in just two days after the opening up of Char Dham shrines for devotees. Ganga ghats at Har-Ki-Pauri, along with hotels and dharamshalas, are witnessing a major rush as just less than 45 days are left for the closure of the Char Dham portals. Travel Association of Haridwar general secretary Sumit Shrikunj pointed that already a large number of enquiries and bookings by pilgrims and tourists from neighbouring states are being received. “We have sent people on Char Dham pilgrimage with adherence to Covid-19 guidelines. There is much relief that finally the High Court and the state government has allowed the annual Char Dham pilgrimage which is linked to the livelihood of thousands of people here,” said Travel Association general secretary Shrikunj. Hotelier Neeraj Kumar said that the previous year, Char Dham pilgrimage also got affected due to Covid-19 which resulted in a major loss to the hotel industry in the state. Hoteliers have also started calling additional staff to cater to the rise in the number of bookings on a daily basis. Hotel rooms as low as ₹500 to 5000 are available in Haridwar with the majority of hotels complying with Covid-19 SoP. Tour Traveler Association is charging 3.90 lakh for 10 days for a 27 seater tempo traveller and 75,000 for a five-seat car for nine days of Char Dham pilgrimage from Haridwar. Mansarovar Vyapar Mandal president Rakesh Khanna thanked chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami for presenting the legal as well as the religious, spiritual and economic aspect of the opening of the Char Dham pilgrimage. “Allowing Char Dham pilgrimage is a welcome step. Traders are a happy lot as for the past 20 months, the trader fraternity has got severely affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is a good indication that pilgrims are flocking to the Garhwal region for religious and adventure tourism,” said City Trader Union president Kamal Brijwasi. Saint community has also urged pilgrims to arrive for Char Dham pilgrimage adhering strictly to Covid-19 guidelines and preventive measures. “Had met CM Pushkar Singh Dhami twice in this regard. He had given assurance and now finally Char Dham pilgrimage has once again restarted,” said Mahamandaleshwar Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhada Swami Yatindranand Giri While chief medical officer Haridwar Dr Shambhu Kumar Jha said that Covid-19 testing has been increased in view of the opening-up of Char Dham pilgrimage and Haridwar being the entry city for the revered shrines. “Vaccination, as well as Covid-19 testing facility, is in place and we are also urging pilgrims to maintain social distancing, wear face masks and adhere to Char Dham specific Covid SoP,” said CMO Haridwar Jha. Senior Superintendent of Haridwar police Yogendra Singh Rawat said that at Har-Ki-Pauri and border entry points, police personnel are also generating awareness about Covid-19 guidelines and Char Dham-specific SoP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/char-dham-yatra-leads-to-surge-in-pilgrim-footfall-in-haridwar-over-5k-arrive-daily-101632054059473.html

19-09-2021||Delhi||BJP expels three councillors on allegations of corruption, extortion||Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Adesh Gupta on Sunday expelled three municipal councillors from the party for six years on allegations of corruption. Gupta warned that if any other lawmakers are found involved in financial irregularities they will not be spared.Gupta’s action comes months ahead of the municipal elections in the three municipal corporations early next year. Gupta said that even officers of the civic bodies will not be spared if they are found involved in corruption. “Not just councilors but officers of the municipal corporations (MCDs) will also not be spared if they are found involved in corruption”, Gupta was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Saidulajab councillor Sanjay Thakur in South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), New Ashok Nagar councillor Rajni Babloo Pandey in East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) and Mukherjee Nagar councillor Pooja Madan in North Delhi Municipal Corporation were removed from the BJP.“You are informed that due to numerous complaints of corruption against you, you are removed from the primary membership of the party for six years. You were many times made aware of this and asked to mend your corrupt behaviour but to no avail. You are removed from the party for six years with immediate effect,” the expulsion letters sent to the councillors read.Delhi’s three civic bodies are governed by the BJP while the government is led by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). The AAP is the primary opposition party in these three MCDs. The AAP and Congress plan to use the corruption in these civic bodies in the upcoming civic body polls.The BJP in the 2017 civic polls did not give nomination tickets to any of the councillors as they faced allegations of corruption. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal over the past years alleged that corruption and mismanagement in civic bodies by BJP councillors led to poor financial situation of the three municipalities.Notably, AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj accused ousted BJP councillor Sanjay Thakur of having a nexus with local builders and extorted money from individuals in April this year. AAP leader Durgesh Pathak too complained in August that ousted councillor Rajni Babloo Pandey and her kin was involved in extorting money from people who were involved in illegal constructions in the area.The party released an audio recording between a builder and the councillor's brother-in-law where a person said he gave money to civic officials and also to the councillor's brother-in-law but the construction was stalled, news agency PTI reported. HT could not verify the authenticity of the audio clip. Both the councillors in respective occasions called the allegations ‘baseless’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-expels-three-councillors-on-allegations-of-corruption-extortion-101632052036936.html
19-09-2021||Delhi||Court slams culture of ‘backdoor entry’, says it insults meritorious students||The Delhi high court observed that it is necessary to stop the practice of backdoor entries in all categories of educational institutions. The court said this practice demeans millions of students across the nation who work hard and toil to secure admissions on the basis of merit.“It is high time that such backdoor entries in educational institutions, including medical colleges, should stop. Lakhs of students all over the country work hard and toil to secure admissions to educational institutions on the basis of their merit,” a bench headed by Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh said.The observation made by the court came while it dismissed an appeal by five students who were granted admission in 2016 by Bhopal's LN Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, but did not undergo the centralised counselling conducted by the Department of Medical Education (DME), which is a prerequisite set by the Supreme Court for admissions in all government and private medical colleges. The counselling is done on the basis of the NEET examination results.The Medical Council of India (MCI) sent several letters of discharge to the students and the medical college but neither party paid any attention to them. Instead of discharging the students, the college treated the petitioners as students and allowed them to attend the course, sit for exams and also get promoted.The students filed a petition seeking quashing of the discharge communications issued by the MCI and for a direction that they be permitted to continue their studies in the medical college as regular medical students. The petition was dismissed by a single judge which was challenged by the students. It was later quashed again by the Delhi high court when a bench led by justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh observed that the appeal lacked merit.“To permit any backdoor entry to any educational institution would be grossly unfair to those who are denied admission, despite being more meritorious, on account of the seats being taken and blocked by such backdoor entrants,” the bench observed. The bench also said the petitioners are responsible for the mess they find themselves in. The court said that if the students would have paid heed to the letter and acted according to the discharge instructions in April 2017 then they could have saved four years of their lives. “They did not, and acted recklessly. Despite not having any interim orders in their favour in their writ petition, they continued to attend the course – obviously, at their own peril,” it said.The MCI counsel T Singhdev said that no party paid heed to the warnings despite the authority issuing discharge letters as early as April 2017. He said that they continued to ignore it even after repeated communications. He also highlighted that the petitioners did not obtain any interim order from the court and continued to take admissions in subsequent years.Singhdev said that they took examinations in the college at their own peril. He said that the petitioners were aware that their admission to the college was ‘irregular and illegal, being in the teeth of the judgement of the Supreme Court.’The counsel for the petitioners requested that some leniency be given to them and contended that they ranked higher in the NEET examination than even those who were granted admission through the central counselling conducted by the DME in relation to the medical college.The court said that if the medical college informed the DME on time regarding the vacant positions, the body would then have conducted further counselling and sent names on merit on the basis of the NEET examination conducted in 2016. “It is quite possible that the names of other candidates, more meritorious than the five petitioners, may have been sent,” the court said.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-slams-culture-of-backdoor-entry-says-it-insults-meritorious-students-101632050529767.html

19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Taking a plunge to glide over my fear of heights||Acrophobia, the fear of heights, has haunted me ever since childhood. I remember being afraid of standing near the parapet or the railing of a bridge. I don’t know where the fear of heights stemmed from, but it certainly grew with age. I avoided elevators, high-rise buildings, standing in the balcony or for that matter even driving in the hills gave me anxiety attacks. But somewhere in my heart, I nurtured a wish to break the shackles of my fear. Whenever I watched people paragliding in the hills, I yearned to fly like a bird, too. But I couldn’t gather the courage to take the plunge. This summer, I decided to give wings to my desire and fly over the steep hills of Bir-Billing in Himachal Pradesh. When I shared my yearning, my wife laughed it off. “Leave aside the jump from the top of the hill, I doubt if you’ll even make it to the hilltop without a panic attack,” she chided. Somehow, I persuaded her to accompany me to the haven of paragliders. A friend provided me with the contact number of an expert at tandem paragliding. An amiable and energetic guy, he assured us of a safe and smooth sailing and lodged us and the paragliding equipment in an SUV before taking us on a 12-km perilous ride through the dense forest to reach the highest peak of Billing. A thick canopy of clouds and the lush surroundings at the height of 8,000 feet were absolutely surreal. A paragliding wing and harness were tied to my waist and a selfie stick with a camera was handed over to me to record my adventure. When the pilot paraglider was apprising me of the dos and don’ts, I went numb with fear. I was supposed to run down towards the edge of the hill for my paragliding wing to trap the wind in its sails to help me fly over the hills. While the pilot was urging me to run with the maximum strength, my heart was thumping aloud, and I was sweating profusely in the freezing cold. I found it hard to take even a single step towards the edge of the cliff. “Okay dear, I quit. I will come back tomorrow,” I pleaded with my mentor. “No sir! This is an adventure sport. If you don’t do it today, you won’t be able to do it ever again. Remember ‘darr ke aage jeet hai’,” he said before giving me a gentle push towards the valley. With my heart in the mouth, I gingerly darted towards the gorge. A trot of merely 10 steps and a strong current of the wind filled the canopy and took control of the paraglider. There I was! Sailing over the clouds and verdant hills dotted generously with Rhododendrons, deodars and oaks, like a bird. In the blink of an eye, I was in serene heaven and my fear of heights had vanished into thin air. A smooth landing after half an hour of flying was the icing on the cake. I bade farewell to my paragliding pilot, Yash Thakur, with the promise to return in winter to fly over the snow-laden hills to experience the sublime divinity, once again. rajivsharma.rs201067@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/taking-a-plunge-to-glide-over-my-fear-of-heights-101632047398971.html
19-09-2021||Dehradun||Kejriwal promises job to each family, ₹5000 to unemployed Uttarakhand youth||Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced that if elected to power in Uttarakhand, AAP will ensure employment in every household of the state (Har Ghar Rozgar) and provide ₹5,000/monthly stipend to unemployed youth. He also announced that AAP will provide 100,000 government jobs within six months of coming to power in the state.Kejriwal, who is on a day-long visit to Haldwani in Nainital, said his party will provide 80% reservation for Uttarakhand residents in the jobs in the state.“An online job portal will be launched on the lines of Delhi. It will contain the data of both the job provided and those who get jobs. When such a portal was started in Delhi, more than 1 million people got employment”, he said.Kejriwal said apart from this, a ministry of employment and migration affairs will be formed in the state. “This separate department will make effective policies only for employment generation and checking of migration from the hill state” he said.Taking a dig at the frequent change of chief ministers in Uttarakhand in the last few months, the AAP national convenor said if people vote for the BJP, they will get a new CM every month. “If they vote for AAP, they will get a CM who will give employment for five years”, he said.On the question of the feasibility of providing free power when the economic condition of Uttarakhand was weak, he said, “Government should have the will power. And we showed it by giving free electricity in New Delhi.”Kejriwal also said that there were good people in many parties including the BJP and the Congress, who were feeling suffocated there. “Such good people were welcome in AAP, ‘’ he said.Later, Kejriwal took out a roadshow and also held a public meeting at Ramlila Maidan in Haldwani.This is Kejriwal’s third visit to the hill state this year. On his last visit on August 17, Kejriwal announced Colonel Ajay Kothiyal’s (Retd) name as party’s chief ministerial candidate for the 2002 assembly polls and promised to make Uttarakhand the spiritual capital for the Hindus across the world if elected to power.During his visit on July 11, Kejriwal announced 300 units of free electricity to every household if AAP was elected to power here. Talking about replicating AAP’s Delhi model of governance in Uttarakhand, he had said that the party will bring a major change in the schools and health infrastructure if voted to form the government.With less than a year left for the next state assembly elections, AAP is aggressively busy in poll preparations. Over the last eight to nine months or so, it has been attacking the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on various issues including alleged corruption, unemployment and on the front of health infrastructure.In July, the AAP state unit also launched ‘Kejriwal Muft Bijli Guarantee Card’, under which party’s 10,000 workers will visit households in all the 70 assembly constituencies and urge residents to register for free electricity and give them the Kejriwal card as a token of guarantee for free power if the party is voted to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/kejriwal-promises-job-to-each-family-rs-5000-to-unemployed-uttarakhand-youth-101632045658567.html

19-09-2021||Kolkata||Three iconic Kolkata restaurants get heritage tags||Three iconic Kolkata restaurants — Mocambo, Kwality, and Trincas —are set to receive the prestigious Indian Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage’s (Intach) heritage tag this Sunday. These popular Park Street eateries will have a heritage plaque by their entrances letting patrons and passers-by know that they have existed for at least six decades and are embodiments of the spirit and culture of the city.Intach awarded them the honour in December 2019, along with 13 other Kolkata eateries, but the plaque unveiling ceremony was delayed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. “Fifteen restaurants had been given the heritage tag but due to the pandemic, the ceremony was delayed. Now that restaurants have opened, we felt it was the right time to celebrate the industry and boost morale,” GM Kapur, Intach Calcutta convenor, told reporters in early September.The City of Joy’s (as Kolkata is historically known as) first three restaurants to receive the honour have been in operation for over 60 years, and their menus have remained more or less unchanged, with a few additions over the years. Both Kwality and Trincas changed their menus, with Trincas introducing live musical performances and a full menu in 1959 and Kwality introducing a range of north Indian delicacies to its menu a few months after starting operation in 1952. Mocambo, however, has remained unchanged, both in terms of menu and its decor.Trincas shares a close associations with singers and performers like Usha Uthup, Biddu Appaiah, Savages, Flintstones, Checkered Tricycle—a band that had as drummer Indian rock music veteran Nondon Bagchi—Beat Four, Benny Rozario, Toto Wallang, Eve, Jenny, Linda and Flora. On Mocambo’s menu, the word ‘H’ can be found next to some dishes, such as Devilled Crab, Chicken ala Kiev and Chicken Tetrazzini, which stands for ‘Heritage’ and signifies dishes which date back to when the restaurant opened in 1956.These restaurants in Park Street have also been credited for introducing legions of Indians to the wonders of Jazz music through their live performances. Park Street, the popular Kolkata destination which houses all three restaurants, has been widely portrayed in films and televisions.

Also read: ‘I believe Punjab CM should …’: Ambika Soni after refusing to hold top postNanda, a senior advocate in the Supreme Court, was Capt Amarinder’s first choice for his government’s top law officer in 2017 as he was considered a “family friend” and had defended him in criminal cases registered during Parkash Singh Badal’s tenure as chief minister. Says appointment co-terminus with Capt’s “My appointment as advocate general was co-terminus with his (Amarinder) appointment and also according to constitutional convention, I have tendered my resignation,” a message sent out by Nanda to the state’s law officers’ team said. Nanda termed the present team of law officers as “the best the AG office has had in recent times” and said that he got immense support from younger and senior law officers. He thanked the members of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association stating that he was initially thought to be an outsider, but later welcomed as a friend and made a member of their family. Tenure mired in controversies Nanda’s stint as AG has been mired with controversies even though he tried to steer clear of representing the state on contentious issues. He roped in senior lawyers from Delhi in the politically sensitive 2015 sacrilege cases and recently in cases pertaining to former director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini. But with him being the top law officer, whenever the court decisions came against the state government, his office was criticised and on a number of occasions, the demand for his resignation came from senior leaders such as former Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief Partap Singh Bajwa and incumbent Navjot Singh Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/day-after-capt-amarinder-s-exit-punjab-advocate-general-atul-nanda-resigns-101632041158519.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||BJP counters Congress' claims of Amarinder Singh's waning popularity||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Pralhad Joshi hit out at the Congress over Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s resignation, alleging that Singh’s growing popularity was the reason behind his “removal”.“They've (Congress) removed him because they were apprehensive that he was growing more popular than Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi,” Joshi told reporters on Sunday.Singh resigned from the post of the chief minister on Saturday evening, just five months before Punjab heads for polls. Contrary to what Joshi claimed, sources within the Congress told Hindustan Times that Singh’s waning influence among party MLAs and his former advisor Prashant Kishore’s warning to Congress on the party tailing Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab influenced the Grand Old Party’s decision to make changes in the order of business. Singh, the source claimed, has also become unpopular among the farmers in Punjab.Singh has also been locked in a tussle with former BJP legislator Navjot Singh Sidhu, and experts opined that Sidhu’s appointment as the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief in July despite Singh’s strong objection signalled the former chief minister’s influence was waning.Joshi also criticised Congress for questioning the ruling party, insisting that responding to their questions is not worth it. “People who're stuck in such a deep mess are questioning us. It's not worth reacting to them,” he added.News agency ANI reported on Sunday that veteran Congress leader Ambika Soni was offered the post of the chief minister but she turned it down citing health issues. Sidhu, former Punjab Congress unit chiefs Sunil Jakhar, and Pratap Bajwa are currently the top choices in the race to replace Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-counters-congress-claims-of-amarinder-singh-s-waning-popularity-101632040561877.html
19-09-2021||Mumbai||Do’s and Don’ts for Mumbai on Ganesh idol immersion day||For the second year in a row, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has imposed restrictions on immersion of Ganesh idols, to ensure social distancing and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, as hundreds of Ganeshotsav mandals head to immersion points across Mumbai city. Devotees are not being allowed to enter the water at immersion sites to immerse the idols, and have to instead hand over the idols at BMC helpdesks, which will immerse them into the sea, or at lakes, or in artificial immersion ponds. Not more than ten people are allowed at the time of immersion of public Ganesh idols, and not more than five people are allowed at the time of immersion of household Ganesh idols. In addition, those gathering at such immersion spots should be fully vaccinated, and 15 days should have passed since their second dose, according to the guidelines issued by the BMC. It also makes it compulsory to wear a face mask, and maintain social distancing. While urging children and senior citizens not to be a part of such processions, BMC has appealed to public Ganesh mandals to give priority to the nearest artificial immersion sites, set up at 173 places apart from the 73 natural immersion spots across the city. Harshad Kale, deputy municipal commissioner overseeing these arrangements said, “More artificial immersion sites have been set up this year, to avoid overcrowding, in light of Covid-19.” BMC has also directed Ganesh mandals to minimise use of garlands and flowers, to minimise generation of ‘nirmalya’ to be disposed of. The BMC guidelines also urged households to immerse their idols in buckets at home if possible, or prioritise the nearest artificial sites for immersion. Household idols in entire buildings or chawls should not be taken together to such immersion sites to avoid overcrowding at the site, it said.The guidelines also requested that the devotees should perform the final ‘Aarti’ at home, so that minimum time is spent at the immersion sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dos-and-don-ts-for-mumbai-on-ganesh-idol-immersion-day-101632039358120.html
19-09-2021||Jaipur||Gehlot’s OSD resigns following tweet seen as criticism of Congress brass||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s officer on special duty (OSD) Lokesh Sharma submitted his resignation after a tweet he posted on Saturday was seen as a comment on the Congress high command’s handling of the crisis in its Punjab unit leading to Captain Amarinder Singh’s resignation as chief minister, triggering a row. Amarinder Singh later said he felt he had been “humiliated” thrice by Congress leadership and added that he won’t accept Punjab Congress unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu as the party’s face in the coming polls. Sharma, who is OSD in charge of IT-cell, tweeted two lines in Hindi, “Majboot ko Majboor, Mamuli Ko Magroor Kiya Jaye...Baad hi Khet Ko Khaay, Us Fasal Ko Kaun Bachaye!!”. When loosely translated, the verse means that when a strong person gets forced and an insignificant person gets an ego massage then nobody can save the crop from getting eaten by the fence itself.After his tweet raised eyebrows within the Congress circles with some reading it as a cryptic comment on the party high command’s handling of the Punjab crisis, Sharma sent his resignation to Gehlot late on Saturday night with an apology. Sharma has been associated with Gehlot for over a decade now and has been looking after his social media. He was made the OSD after Gehlot came to power in December 2018. Offering an explanation on his tweet, Sharma said he had been active on the micro-blogging site since 2010 and had never crossed party lines or made “wrong” comments about any leader of the party. He also claimed that he had stopped posting political tweets after becoming the CM’s OSD. However, he offered an apology if his tweet had unintentionally hurt either the party, or the government or the party high command in any way. Like Punjab, discontent is simmering within Rajasthan Congress too, with many wondering if the uneasy truce between factions lead by CM Gehlot and his one-time deputy Sachin Pilot will last long. It was also reported earlier that CM Gehlot was not fully in favour of the solution suggested by the party high command for power sharing in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/gehlots-osd-resigns-following-tweet-seen-as-criticism-of-congress-brass-101632033777554.html

Since Sidhu heads the state unit, the choice for the CM has narrowed down to Soni, Jakhar and cabinet minister Brahm Mohindra for the Hindu CM face,” according to party leaders familiar with the developments.While Congress president Sonia Gandhi is learnt to have thrown her weight behind Rajya Sabha MP Ambika Soni, her son and former chief Rahul Gandhi is backing Jakhar. Soni opted out of the race and reportedly told the Congress leadership that a Sikh should be made the chief minister. “With a Hindu CM, the party may also go in for two deputy CMs – a Jat Sikh and a Dalit leader,” one of the persons quoted above said. However, some MLAs, who met Rawat and the two central observers on the sidelines of the CLP meeting on Saturday, pushed for a Sikh CM.Punjab has never had a non-Sikh CM since the reorganisation of the state in 1966.Sidhu, who was named the state unit president two months ago, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa and cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa are among the Sikh leaders whose names are doing the rounds in party circles. A few MLAs conveyed their preference for Sidhu as the leader of the CLP. Randhawa and Sidhu are learnt to have conveyed their preference for Soni in case the party decides to opt for a Hindu chief minister, the person quoted above said.However, a few others stressed that the new leader should be from among the MLAs. Soni, Jakhar and Bajwa are not MLAs.Capt not going to take ‘humiliation’ lying downChief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was pushed to resign from the post after the Congress central leadership summoned a meeting of the party MLAs, saying that he feels “humiliated”.He had submitted his resignation along with that of his council of ministers to governor Banwarilal Purohit at Raj Bhawan half an hour before the CLP meeting. “This is the third time they (Congress high command) have called the MLAs. Apparently, they do not have confidence in me and didn’t think I could handle my job. But I felt humiliated at the manner in which they handled the whole affair,” the two-time former CM told reporters outside the Raj Bhawan after submitting his resignation on Saturday evening, dropping enough hints that he is not going to take his humiliation lying down.The governor accepted the resignation of Capt Amarinder Singh as chief minister and that of his council of ministers. He asked Amarinder and his council of ministers to continue in office, for transaction of routine business, till alternative arrangements are made, according to an official statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-set-to-get-new-chief-minister-today-101632023456470.html

Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of UP, will be felicitated in Lucknow on Sunday by the farmers' wing of the BJP to mark the completion of 54 years of his rule in the state.

Having observed my mother, mother-in-law, two sisters and wives of some dear friends after they lost their husbands, I feel Indian wives are able to deal with the loss of their spouse in a more composed and dignified manner as compared to their husbands. After the birth of a child, a woman’s love gets divided between her husband and offspring. The laws of Nature dictate that she gets more attached to the children as she feeds them and gets engrossed in ensuring their general wellbeing. As the children grow, this bond becomes stronger. During this evolution, a woman’s love for the husband transforms and takes a back seat. So, when the husband is not on the scene, she finds solace and happiness in her children and grandchildren. Her life is consumed by their love till she herself bids goodbye to the world. In our patriarchal society, a husband is expected to be the breadwinner and remains busy with money making, sorting out household problems such as constructing a house, paying the bills and managing workplace relationships. When he loses wife, he is generally no more required to perform the routine role he had been used to and is uncomfortable in his new position without work and authority. Another reason of a woman’s composed behaviour after the loss of her husband is the change in her status from the dignified position she occupied in ancient India when gender equity was not a mere fantasy and present days when she is still fighting for parity with men. An ordinary woman understands her vulnerable position in absence of her husband and is prepared to accept it as her fate. She has often treated as inferior to her husband and her physical exclusion in the society was obvious to her. She is more open to sharing her grief believing that grief shared is grief halved. Most men consider sharing grief and shedding tears unmanly and prefer to put up a stoic front in presence of others while going through emotional upheavals. Over the years she develops unbound patience not as a virtue but as a necessity. Yet another reason is that most women are level-headed, which is why they make great managers. Also, their threshold to bear is much higher having gone through the physical and emotional pain of childbirth. Their empathy, sharing nature and patience makes acceptance of reality much easier for them. Since they are sensitive in perception and ‘feelers’ by nature, it is easier to communicate, persuade and motivate them into their changed role and they learn to lead a balanced life.colcheema1942@gmail.com(The writer is a Panchkula-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-women-are-better-at-coping-with-loss-of-spouse-101632003640289.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Once a soldier always a soldier||The Punjab government has hiked the annuity payable to armed forces’ gallantry and distinguished service awardees by 80%, which is commendable as the state is already paying the highest annuity to its awardees. This is testament to the government’s respect and honour for soldiers. Besides, a considerable amount of time had passed since the last hike. I was reminded of December 16, 1971, the day ceasefire was announced in the war against Pakistan. All those who were involved actively in combat, heaved a sigh of relief for having come out unscathed. Soon the first list of gallantry award winners was published. In the general euphoria that prevailed in the country for a grand victory, politicians also decided to make hay while the sun was shining. States like Punjab and Rajasthan were quick to announce cash and land rewards for gallantry award winners. A soldier goes into battle to fulfil the contract that he makes the day he puts on the uniform. On the day of reckoning, a soldier has to defend the territorial integrity of the country and be prepared to make any sacrifice, including his life. That is the deal. Besides, no one goes into battle thinking that he will get a gallantry award for it. You go and do what you have been trained for to the best of your ability because defeat is not an option. If your superior officer is impressed with your performance and writes a citation for a gallantry award, it is taken as something that just happened while you did what you had to. If the Centre and state government decides to reward him,he just accepts it gracefully. He also expects that the governments will honour their commitment. In fact, it took 14 years for the Punjab government to honour the commitment, albeit partially. In lieu of the promised irrigated land, it gave ₹5,000 per promised acre. So, that was the end of it. A few years later the Punjab government started an annuity scheme for the gallantry award winners and their widows. It was a paltry sum of a few hundred rupees paid every quarter. Around that time, a pan-India organisation called ‘ The War Decorated’ was formed to mainly take care of the widows and elderly parents of deceased gallantry award winners. It interacted with the central and state governments to get certain benefits like free train travel, annuity and jobs for the children of the deceased soldiers. Punjab did better than other states but still it was nothing substantial. Then came the soldier politician, outgoing Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who served in the premier battalion of the Sikh Regiment. He served for a short period of three years in the ‘2 Sikh’. Despite his short service in the army, soldiering was in his blood. He kept in close touch with his battalion. He initiated a string of measures for the welfare of retired soldiers and the widows of deceased soldiers. The government job quota was earmarked for needy widows and their children. He also gave a substantial increase in the annuity being paid to the gallantry award winners of the state as also the widows of the deceased. It was raised to ₹23,100 for the Param Vir Chakra (PVC ), ₹17,556 for the Maha Vir Chakra( MVC ) and ₹10,165 for the Vir Chakra ( VrC ). A similar increase was made in the annuity of other gallantry award winners. Further, his government decided to give a substantial one-time lump sum award to new gallantry award winners varying from ₹25 lakh to ₹1 crore. Needless to say, it has been a big morale booster for ex-servicemen, especially the next of kin of the deceased gallantry award winners of the state. On September 15, the Punjab government doubled the lump-sum for the gallantry award winners. So, a PVC will get ₹2 crore, MVC ₹1 crore and a VrC ₹50 lakh. It is impossible to make up for the loss of family member. However, the financial and other help provided by states like Punjab helps to assuage the grief. The Capt-led government has set the benchmark in welfare of ex-servicemen for others to emulate. As the adage goes, ‘ Once a soldier, always a soldier’. bullysangha@gmail.com ( The writer is a Chandigarh-based defence veteran and Vir Chakra awardee.

No casualty was reported and the reason behind the collapse is not known so far.

With the PSPCL seeking submission of bank guarantees and installation of electric infrastructure in the colony for providing the NOC, developers are contending that they have applied for regularisation under the policies floated by state government in 2013 and 2018, and they need not to apply for an NOC from the PSPCL, separately.Parvinder, a plot holder at the Smart City Enclave on Pakhowal Road, says,”The developer got the colony regularised by submitting a fee under the regularisation policy, and now that we have built the house, the PSPCL is denying us a power connection.We are unable to shift into the new house because of this deadlock between the developer and the PSPCL.”One Sarvjit of Gauri Enclave near Ladian village said that they have sent a legal notice to the PSPCL as they cannot deny basic services to residents. “The PSPCL has provided power connections to other plot holders and house owners in the same area in the past, but now they are denying us a power connection,” said Sarvjit.Developers say that as per the regularisation policies floated by government, plot holders can also get their individual plots regularised, if the developer is not getting the colony regularised.Punjab Colonisers and Property Dealers Association president GS Lamba said, “The issue has been going on for the last few months. The regularisation policy says that the government will provide basic facilities to colonies, if the developer submits the regularisation fee under the policy. Now, the PSPCL is asking the developers to apply for an NOC separately, which is not acceptable.”“We have taken up the issue at state level as not only developers, but individual plot holders are also on the receiving end. Authorities have assured us that the matter will be resolved soon,” said Lamba.Attempts to reach PSPCL chief engineer, Ludhiana, Bhupinder Khosla, were unsuccessful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/plot-owners-a-harried-lot-amid-pspcl-s-deadlock-with-colony-developers-101631996737324.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder resignation Congress’ admission of failure, says Sukhbir Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday said that Captain Amarinder Singh’s resignation as Punjab chief minister was an admission on the part of the Congress of its failure to perform in the state as it had nothing to show during its tenure of more than four-and-a-half years. In a press statement, the SAD chief said Amarinder had been “punished by nature” for lying while taking an oath on the Gutka Sahib and that every member of the Congress will suffer the same fate. “A mere change of guard will not save the Congress’ sinking ship in Punjab. The entire state cabinet as well as the ruling party MLAs are neck deep in corruption and are running sand, liquor and drug mafias. The ruling party cannot hope to save its incompetent government and befool Punjabis with change of a face, he claimed. “The devious ploy of the Congress high command to avert a backlash against the party by putting the blame on one person alone will not succeed. Punjabis know that the party has become synonymous with loot and lawlessness. Its ministers and MLAs patronised gangsters. They failed to undertake any development or infrastructure projects in the state,” the SAD chief alleged. Also, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra cannot not escape the blame of making Punjab suffer for more than four-and-a-half years, he said. “First of all, Sonia and Rahul were the force behind the Congress’ 2017 election manifesto. The Gandhi family not only kept Capt Amarinder Singh in power but also failed to move against any of his corrupt ministers. They also failed to prevail upon Amarinder to fulfill the promises made to the people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-resignation-congress-admission-of-failure-says-sukhbir-badal-101631996196844.html

Addressing a press conference in Amritsar, Kaur said, “The government’s intention in this case is not clear and that is why the conspirators are not being brought to the fore even as the connection of the arrested suspect, Paramjit Singh of Ludhiana, with Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda has been exposed.” Kaur said though more penal sections were added against the accused in the case at their request, the real culprits behind the incident are not being identified yet. “I have written to the Punjab chief minister and the director general of police (DGP) in this regard,” the SGPC chief added. Expressing dissatisfaction over the police action taken so far in the case, Kaur said, “No concrete information about the conspiracy behind this incident has been released by the police several days after the incident. All those involved should have been behind the bars by now. The incidents of sacrilege are constantly taking place in Punjab and the government machinery is caught sleeping.”She also raised questions on the working of government intelligence agencies. “Despite a large network of agencies, incidents that are detrimental to the peace of Punjab are taking place openly,” said Kaur.On a letter written by the Golden Temple manager to police seeking deployment of cops in the shrine complex, she said, “I am not aware of this but the SGPC is competent to guard the shrine on its own.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/anandpur-sahib-sacrilege-sgpc-demands-narco-analysis-test-brain-mapping-of-accused-101631995727064.html
19-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to make grain-based alcohol must for producers?||Citizens in Maharashtra may soon be able to say “cheers” to an enhanced taste of their favourite brand of liquor as the state government is planning to make it mandatory for liquor manufacturers to blend a certain percentage of grain-based alcohol in their products.While boosting the dormant grain-based alcohol industry in Maharashtra, the state is looking at overcoming likely fluctuations in supply of molasses-based spirit for liquor manufacturers owing to distilleries diverting their stocks to oil marketing companies (OMCs) for blending ethanol in petrol.Grain-based spirit is usually manufactured from maize and poor-quality or broken rice and jowar in Maharashtra. The proposed policy will cover country liquor (CL) and Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL).“Most of the grain-based distilleries in Maharashtra are shut. To revive them, we are planning to make it mandatory for liquor manufacturers to blend a certain percentage of grain-based spirits. The import duty on grain-based alcohol imported from other states will also be increased from the present ₹2 per litre to boost local industry,” said a senior state government official.Of the 34 grain-based distilleries in Maharashtra, only around nine are operational. Compared to the installed capacity of around 40 crore litres, the production averaged at about 8-8.5 crore litres.At present, manufacturers blend around 10% of grain-based spirits in their products, usually in premium brands, and the state plans to eventually increase this to around 40-50%.“With sugar mills and distilleries getting good rates from OMCs for ethanol blending in petrol, and the cyclical nature of the sugarcane crop, it is necessary to push the production of grain-based alcohol in Maharashtra,” the official explained. He added that though liquor prices could increase marginally, state excise revenues would also rise as the duty formula is based on cost of manufacturing. Farmers can also get better prices for their produce.“Increasing the blending of grain-based alcohol will improve the taste and quality... It will reduce our dependence on molasses and help launch new brands,” said a liquor manufacturer. He added that as of now only a couple of multinationals manufacture their entire portfolio using grain-based spirits.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator Mansingrao Naik, who controls a co-operative sugar mill and operates a private grain-based alcohol unit in Sangli, said only around three grain-based distilleries were operating at optimum capacity due to lack of demand. “Unlike foreign countries, where liquor is distilled from grain, India has molasses-based products. Grain-based liquor is considered to be healthier than that using molasses,” he explained.He added that sugar factories found it remunerative to sell molasses for fuel blending, and hence, the demand for grain alcohol was likely to rise in the future. But the prices of molasses-based alcohol sold to liquor manufacturers were marginally lower, around ₹50 per litre, compared to around ₹53-54 for grain spirits.However, manufacture of grain-based spirit is a controversial issue in Maharashtra. The erstwhile Vilasrao Deshmukh government had launched a short-lived scheme—Food Grain-Based Distillery and Integrated Unit Financial Aid, 2007— to promote grain-based distilleries. This had raised the hackles of activists, who questioned the logic of diverting food-grains for producing liquor in a state that is food-deficit with endemic malnutrition and drought. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had also red-flagged lacunae in the scheme.Valsa Nair Singh, principal secretary, state excise, denied comment on the contours of the policy. In 2020-21, around 320 million litres of CL were sold in Maharashtra, followed by beer (300 million litres), IMFL (200 million litres) and wine (7 million litres).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-make-grain-based-alcohol-must-for-producers-101631995657930.html

19-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees 50% spike in Covid cases in September but fatalities down by 38%||Though cases in Maharashtra might have gone down in the first half of September as compared to those registered in August, Mumbai has witnessed an opposite trend. The city has witnessed spike of 50% in the number of cases reported in the first 17 days of September as compared to those recorded in August. However, the number of deaths in Mumbai has come down by 38% in September as compared to August’s fatalities.According to data, between September 1 and 17, around 7,407 Covid-19 cases were reported in the city – 50% more than the 4,943 cases recorded during the same period in August. Similarly, in the past one month, the number of active cases has also gone up from around 2,600 to 4,600 cases.Across Maharashtra, the cases have gone down. The state had recorded 57,120 cases from September 1 to 15, as compared to 88,664 infections recorded during the same period last month. This is a decline by 35%.Further, between September 1 and 17, the city reported 58 deaths due to Covid-19, which is 38% lesser than the 95 deaths recorded during the same period in August.Along with the 50% spike in the cases, the city has also witnessed a marginal surge – of around 13% – in the number of tests conducted. This indicates that the positivity rate in the city has increased. Between September 1 and 17, the city had conducted 601,438 tests, of which around 7,407 came positive and the city’s positivity rate reached 1.23%. In comparison to this, 521,721 tests were conducted during the same period in August, of which 4,943 came positive (0.94% positivity rate).The city reported 478 cases and six deaths on Saturday, taking the Covid-19 tally to 737,678 and toll to 16,048. The city’s recovery rate is 96% with 713,458 recoveries and the fatality rate is 2.17%. There are 5,719 active cases in the city.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said they are constantly monitoring the situation. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani on Friday said, “The period till October 5 will be crucial considering the effect of those coming to Mumbai after travelling for the Ganesh festival will be evident. We are targeting more such citizens and also appealing them to get tested.”Meanwhile, Dr Madhav Sathe, former microbiology professor at BYL Nair Hospital, said, “As far as I understand virology, I don’t think there will be a third wave or even if there will be, it will be very mild. The fifth sero survey by BMC has shown over 80% antibodies in citizens, and this is enough to conclude that even if there’s a third wave, it will be mild.”Dr Sathe added, “Right now, the surge we are seeing is due to the relaxations and unlocking. Hence, I say that a spike is possible but not a third wave. We are also having citizens who are vaccinated now and one sign that vaccine works is that the deaths are going down despite the rise in cases.

We condemn this sick mentality of Delhi Govt & demand @ArvindKejriwal Ji to take strictest action against concerned DC & SDM Geeta Grover.” Sirsa added that the order was issued to close the gurdwara, which has helped many people during the Covid-19 second wave and lockdown by organising “langar” (free food service) and setting up beds for patients.The Chanakyapuri SDM office, however, said whatever has happened is according to the DDMA order, and refused to comment further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/admn-orders-closure-of-gurdwara-bangla-sahib-over-covid-norms-violation-101631995056724.html

19-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra demands for its share of ₹50,000 crore from excise, cess levied on fuel||The cash-strapped Maharashtra government has demanded its share of more than ₹50,000 crore from the additional excise duty as well as the agriculture and road cess levied by the Central government on diesel and petrol. The demand was raised during the Maharashtra government’s meeting with the Niti Aayog earlier this week. The basic price of petrol in Maharashtra is ₹40.97 per litre, on which Centre levies excise duty and cess of ₹32.90, while state government imposes ₹30.28 as value-added taxes (VAT) on every litre, taking the price to more than ₹107 a litre that includes the petrol pump’s commission of ₹3.86. Similarly, diesel’s base price is ₹41.79 per litre, on which the Central excise and cess of ₹31.80 is added along with ₹21.28 as state government’s VAT and ₹2.58 as petrol pump’s commission. Out of the excise and cess on the fuel, the basic excise is just ₹1.40 and ₹1.80 a litre on petrol and diesel, respectively, while the remaining is additional excise and agriculture-road cess levied by the Centre over the past four years. “The state governments gets share only in the basic excise, which is a little over 1% of the taxes collected by the Centre. The total excise duty and cess collected from Maharashtra by the Centre in 2020-21 was ₹46,464 crore including ₹32,432 crore from diesel and ₹14,032 crore from petrol. Against this amount, the Centre gave us ₹383 crore and ₹138 crore for diesel and petrol in devolution of taxes,” said an official from the finance department. The state government’s debt is estimated to rise to more than ₹6.15 lakh crore. The state’s dues against the compensation for the losses of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from the Centre have crossed ₹30,000 crore. The Central government has increased the additional excise duty and road-agriculture tax in the past few years by keeping the divisible component (sharing with the states) as low as around 1%. The excise and cess on fuel have been increased multi-fold in the past few years. The Central government’s collection from the excise duty and cess in 2020-21 was more than ₹3.3 lakh crore, of which Maharashtra’s contribution was 11.65% and 11.25% for diesel and petrol respectively. “The devolution of the additional excise and road-agriculture cess on the fuel to states should be in the spirit of cooperative federalism,” the state government said. Manoj Saunik, additional chief secretary, finance, said, “This has been demanded by all the states, but the Centre is not agreeing to devolve the collection. States get very meagre amount of the collection.” The state has also requested the Centre to continue the GST compensation for three to five years more to make up for the losses Maharashtra has suffered because of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. The five-year period during which the Centre has been compensating the states for their losses due to the roll out of the GST regime from July 1, 2017, is ending on June 30 next year. “The end of the compensation will result in revenue deficit of ₹50,000 crore to the state exchequer. It would be difficult to cope with the gap, unless the transition period of the five years in increased further by three to five years,” the state has said. Another official from the finance department said, “Out of ₹46, 464 crore collected from Maharashtra in the form of central duty and cess in 2020-21, only ₹521 crore were devolved back to the state which is little over 1%. Its expected to go over ₹50,000 crore in 2021-22. When the cess is collected in the name of agriculture and road development, the state has every right over the collection and we expect it to increase it to at least 3%. Instead of bringing petrol and diesel under GST, the Centre should first reduce the excise duty and the cess which will help in bringing down the prices significantly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-demands-for-its-share-of-50-000-crore-from-excise-cess-levied-on-fuel-101631994816616.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Governance biggest casualty in Cong’s ‘Game of Thrones’: AAP||Governance in Punjab has been the biggest casualty in the Congress’ “Game of Thrones”, the opposition AAP said on Saturday after chief minister Amarinder Singh resigned following months of a power tussle in the ruling party. In a video message, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the issues of Punjab have been put on the back burner amid a power struggle in the ruling party. “Congress has cheated the people of Punjab. They do not care about the welfare of Punjab, but their own personal happiness. Congress is a drowning Titanic that neither has vision nor commitment or performance,” Chadha said in Punjabi. “Governance in the state of Punjab has been the biggest casualty in Congress’s ‘Game of Thrones’,” Chadha tweeted after Congress veteran Amarinder Singh resigned as chief minister declaring that he felt “humiliated”. AAP MLA and Leader of Opposition in Punjab Harpal Singh Cheema said the Congress infighting has done a lot of damage to Punjab and its people. “No matter how many faces the Congress may change, in the upcoming elections, the people of Punjab will make the condition of the Congress worse than the Akali-BJP,” he said in a statement in Chandigarh. “By changing Ali Baba, the rest of the thieves will not become innocent,” he said. The AAP leader said all Congressmen are trapped in the quagmire of a mafia rule that has been going on for four-and-a-half years. “No matter how many faces the Congress may change, it cannot change its false, corrupt and opportunistic nature,” he added. Cheema said while being power hungry, Amarinder Singh and his MLAs and ministers never thought about the prosperity of Punjab and were only busy filling their coffers. “Because the fight is not only for the chief minister’s chair, but a battle to capture the status of mafia and kingpin,” he asserted. Cheema said that after being fed up with the 10-year mafia rule of the Badals and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), the people had expressed their confidence in Amarinder Singh and the Congress with great hope. “The more confidence they expressed, the more disappointed they got in four-and-a-half-years. The Congress infighting left behind all the main issues of Punjab and the people. This is the reason that today people have started hating Congress on the lines of the BJP-Akali,” said Cheema. Cheema said the Congress is a “sinking Titanic” today and no captain can save it from sinking now. He said the present reshuffle in the Congress is a last-ditch attempt to mislead the people of the state. “But the people of Punjab have become very aware at the political level. Due to this, the public will not become a victim of this high-voltage drama of the Congress,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/governance-biggest-casualty-in-cong-s-game-of-thrones-aap-101631994756575.html
19-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court paves way for Bandra society’s redevelopment||The Bombay high court (HC) has paved the way for redevelopment of a housing society at Bandra which was being stalled by a garage owner who wanted a commercial unit in lieu of the car parking space.The division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Milind Jadhav on Thursday directed the garage owner, Rajesh Mishra and his family members, to vacate the premises by September 30, failing which the court receiver will take forcible possession – if necessary, with assistance of the local police – of the garage in Bandra Trilok Cooperative Housing Society.The society’s developer, Shree Ahuja Properties, had moved HC in 2019 after seven of the 76 flat owners and five of the 20 garage owners refused to vacate their respective premises for redevelopment.Acting on a plea filed by the developer in the suit, a single-judge bench on May 3 appointed a court receiver for Mishra’s garage for the purpose of getting it demolished for redevelopment. The judge also rejected the plea filed by Mishra for restraining the developer from interfering with their possession of the garage and for restoring water supply to the unit, which the society claimed was illegally converted into a commercial space.The garage owners had moved in appeal against the judge’s order. The division bench on Thursday rejected the appeal. The bench noted that all other dissenting members had vacated their premises after the May 3 order and Mishra was the only member who had refused to vacate the garage.The division bench rejected Mishra’s claim for a commercial unit in the redeveloped building. The bench observed that a garage is clearly meant to park vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-paves-way-for-bandra-society-s-redevelopment-101631994696642.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||The Capt who put Cong back on saddle in Punjab||One of the strongest regional satraps of the Congress, Capt Amarinder Singh was the leader who put the party back in the saddle in Punjab after an intensely fought poll battle that decimated the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and crushed the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) dream of expanding its footprint beyond Delhi.The 79-year-old widely respected and popular leader steered the Congress in 2017 to a landslide victory in the 117-member assembly to occupy the chief minister’s post for the second time.The Maharaja’s win in Punjab after 10 years had also rekindled the hopes for the revival of the grand old party.Belonging to a very rare breed of politicians who have seen action in the Indo-Pak war, Amarinder tasted success in the 2017 polls after Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) supremo Parkash Singh Badal foiled his previous attempts to become chief minister in 2007 and 2012.Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu joined the Congress a few months ahead of the 2017 polls after quitting the BJP. Speculation was rife that he would be given the post of deputy chief minister, but he was made a cabinet minister. Relations between him and the chief minister were never warm.Just two years after the Congress came into power, Sidhu was stripped off key portfolios in the cabinet reshuffle in June 2019 and he then resigned from the state cabinet.Amarinder had divested Sidhu of the local government and tourism and cultural affairs departments and allotted him the power and new and renewable energy portfolio though the latter never assumed charge of his new department.Shortly afterwards, Sidhu had approached the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi and “apprised him of the situation”.The tension between Amarinder and Sidhu came out in the open. While Amarinder blamed him for the “inept handling” of the local government department, claiming that it resulted in “poor performance” of the Congress in urban areas in the (2019) Lok Sabha polls, the former cricketer, on the other hand said “(Congress chief) Rahul Gandhi is my captain...Rahul Gandhi is the captain of the captain (Amarinder) also.” However, things became worse and finally, Sidhu was appointed state Congress president, notwithstanding strong opposition from Amarinder.Once a leader of the Akali Dal, Amarinder, the scion of Patiala, in his short army career, fought in the 1965 war.Son of late Maharaja Yadavindra Singh of Patiala, Amarinder did his initial schooling at Lawrence School, Sanawar, and Doon School in Dehradun, before joining the National Defence Academy, Kharagwasla, in 1959 and graduating from there in 1963.Commissioned in the Indian Army in 1963, he was posted in 2nd Bn. Sikh Regiment (both his father and grandfather had served the battalion), served in Field Area - Indo Tibetan border for two years and was appointed Aide-de-Camp to Lt Gen Harbaksh Singh, GOC-in-C Western Command.The political career of Amarinder, who was considered a close friend of late Rajiv Gandhi, began in January 1980 when he was elected an MP.But he resigned from the Congress and the Lok Sabha in protest against the entry of the army into the Golden Temple during Operation Bluestar in 1984.After joining the Akali Dal in August 1985, Amarinder got elected to the Punjab assembly on an Akali Dal (Longowal) ticket in the 1995 elections.During his first term as chief minister (2002-07), his government in 2004 passed the state law terminating Punjab’s water sharing pact with neighbouring states.Last year, his government brought four bills, which were later passed by the state assembly, to “counter the contentious farm legislation enacted by Parliament”.In his second term, his government also announced a waiver of crores of rupees worth of loans under the farm debt waiver scheme for labourers and the landless farming community.Amarinder fought the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Amritsar and defeated BJP’s Arun Jaitley by a margin of more than one lakh votes.He then resigned in November as MP after the Supreme Court termed Punjab’s 2004 Act terminating the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal agreement as unconstitutional. A few days later, he was appointed president of the Punjab Congress again in the run-up to the polls. A widely travelled person, Amarinder has penned several books including his memoirs of the 1965 Indo-Pak war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/the-capt-who-put-cong-back-on-saddle-in-punjab-101631994636655.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||MC elections: Political activities heat up in Chandigarh||The political temperature in Chandigarh is starting to heat up with just about two months to go for the municipal corporation election.Political parties are strengthening their party structures, mobilising party workers on the ground, wooing rival party workers to cross over and organising public outreach programmes. The elections scheduled in December this year are going to be a three-cornered affair. The ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) is looking to repeat its last election performance, when it won more than 80% seats.Banking on anti-incumbency, the Congress is hoping to finally end its losing streak: it not only lost the last MC elections but also the two previous Lok Sabha elections in the city.The new entrant in the MC elections, Aam Admi Party (AAP), is confident of making a major dent in the fortunes of both BJP and Congress. The party entered the city politics on a strong footing in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but has frittered the advantage in the next seven years. Now, once again the party is building up momentum to challenge the two established parties.Focus on party structures“Appointment of panna parmukh, constitution of booth committees and polling station committees (shakti kendras) have been done. Party’s different morchas (cells) have been given fresh impetus and nearly 35,000 party members have been given specific responsibilities for the elections,” said Arun Sood, BJP city chief.The Congress is also reconstituting the party organisation at different levels. “We are appointing office-bearers at different levels, bringing in new faces and also reorienting the role of experienced hands,” said Subhash Chawla, president, Chandigarh Congress.AAP on September 3 dissolved its organisation structure of the Chandigarh unit. “We will within a fortnight finalise the new organisation structure. Our policy will be to have the right person for the right post,” said Chander Mukhi Sharma, chairman, election campaign committee.Direct connect with votersCongress has started “nukkad” meetings across the city. “In a day, we are having multiple nukkad meetings in every block and district. We are meeting party workers and guiding them on the key election issues, where we need to be on the offensive and areas where we might have to be defensive. In nukkad meetings, we are also discussing the BJP strategy,” said Chawla.The BJP has put more than 35,000 of its party members to work, giving them specific election responsibilities. “We are organising sammelans (conclaves) at different levels, both within the party and with residents. We have also planned out how these meetings will work out in the days to come. Thirty programmes are being organised daily,” said Sood.The AAP has initiated the ‘Jan Sampark Abhiyan’. “Public meetings and worker-level meetings are being organised on a daily basis. We are also taking up civic problems of the people and staging protests at the ground level if needed,” said Sharma.Documenting failures, achievementsThe Congress is preparing a chargesheet against BJP governance in the last five years. Chawla said it will detail the failures of the BJP on all the fronts in the city. “The municipal corporation under BJP has totally failed to meet the people’s expectations. They have only burdened the people with taxes. They couldn’t deliver on their election promises,” he said.For the BJP, work on the preparation of the vision document (manifesto) and a booklet on its achievements in the last five years has started. “We are relying on our development. By October, we will place before the people what we have done,” said Sood. AAP’s focus will be on the implementation. “People are tired of these chargesheets. We will bring in new perspective on these issues so that people know what has been done and what should be done,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mc-elections-political-activities-heat-up-in-chandigarh-101631993442739.html

JCCI president Arun Gupta said, “Looking into the atrocities of the government on the business class of Jammu, we have decided to give a clarion call for Jammu Bandh on September 22.”He expressed resentment over the proposal of big companies such as Reliance opening stores in Jammu, saying that if this happens, small businesses will be affected and many shops will shut down.“Despite adding opportunities for business, the directionless government has snatched what was in hand of traders which is unacceptable,” he added.“The directionless policies of the government are hitting hard the business fraternity,” he said.“Now, bar owners are the next targets of the anti-Jammu administration. Hundreds of wine traders have lost their livelihood after the introduction of e-auction of liquor vends in Jammu and Kashmir; 228 liquor traders lost their shops in the e-auction conducted recently,” he said.Gupta then referred to banquet halls, which he said are bearing the brunt of government’s baseless restriction on the number of guests.He also lashed out at the government for ending the Darbar Move.The Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association, Ikkjutt Jammu and around 20 other organisations have extended support to the Bandh call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/to-protest-proposed-reliance-stores-jcci-calls-for-jammu-bandh-on-wednesday-101631993136670.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Minors elope, brought back from Nepal border||Chandigarh Police have rescued a 17-year-old girl belonging to Balongi from near the Nepal border and apprehended a boy, also aged 17, who is accused of kidnapping her. The boy, who belongs to Nepal and is a school dropout, was taking her across the border to get married, said police. This is sixth such case of elopement of minors reported in Chandigarh this year. According to the National Crime Records Bureau data, 19 girls were kidnapped to compel them for marriage in Chandigarh in 2020.The complaint was lodged by the girl’s father after she didn’t return from school on September 13. According to police, both teenagers used to study in the same school before the boy dropped out. The two had boarded a bus from Sector 17, Chandigarh, and reached Uttar Pradesh, from where they planned to enter Nepal. The girl did not carry her mobile phone while the juvenile was carrying one, but switched it off to avoid being traced. Police got information about the teenagers being spotted near the Nepal border, after which teams were dispatched to bring them back to the city.They were traced to Siddharth Nagar near the Nepal border, where they were staying in a lodge waiting for a chance to cross over. The girl was handed over to her parents while the boy has been sent to the juvenile home. He has been booked under Section 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code. The girl has refused to get her medical examination done. “Children have been locked inside their houses owing to Covid-19 and they do not have anyone to guide them at this tender age, which is leading to such cases where minors are eloping,” said Sangeeta Jund, project director, Childline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-minors-elope-brought-back-from-nepal-border-101631992956008.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Tricity buzz: Son rise in Chandigarh Congress||With Pawan Bansal, a former Congress MP from Chandigarh, camping in Delhi after being appointed the party treasurer, his son Manish Bansal has become active in city politics. These days, he is found presiding over meetings organised by the local party unit. Manish is not new to politics for he had been managing the former MP’s elections from behind the scenes. Former UT Congress president Pradeep Chhabra, who joined the Aam Aadmi Party recently, had been alleging all along that Bansal was upset with him over his son not getting due importance. Residents in a fix over UT’s move amid third wave fearsThe Chandigarh administration’s recent decision while preparing for the Covid third wave has left residents in a fix. “It’s confusing. While fearing an onset of the third Covid wave, the administration has fixed the noon to 1pm slot three days a week for people to meet UT officials. At the same time, it has allowed more people to get together at social gatherings,” said a city resident, who has been waiting for a week now to meet an official at the UT secretariat. Mohali MC House okays 10 items in 10 minutes During the monthly House meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Mohali on September 14, 50 councillors approved 10 items on the agenda pertaining to the development of the city in just 10 minutes. The councillors did not even discuss two policies pertaining to taxi stands and increasing the number of vends for coconut vendors in Mohali. The opposition councillors did not raise any objection either. The meeting began at 3.30 pm and was over at 3.40pm. One wonders if the councillors had even read the items on the agenda before coming for the meeting. NTA, the Not Today Agency The JEE main result was mired in controversy and not just because of the alleged cases of cheating but because of how long it took for the National Testing Agency (NTA) to release the result. With registrations for JEE advanced set to begin from Monday, it was only after Tuesday midnight that the results were declared. Many students took to Twitter to voice their frustration. NTA was given a new name, the Not Today Agency as aspirants waited for the result to be declared online. Chandigarh Police get cracking on feedback Chandigarh Police have started acting on public feedback after recent meetings with Resident Welfare Associations. While senior citizens had complained that police officials on beat duty don’t visit them often, the initiative was restarted, and a senior citizen registration feature was launched on the E-saathi app for those living alone. The traffic police have also started awareness drives to make people stop at signals on slip roads after feedback that many didn’t know whether to stop or move on at the lights.

19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana BJP protests against Punjab CM, Congress counters with slogans||High-voltage drama was witnessed in various Haryana districts on Saturday, as workers and leaders of the ruling BJP and the Congress held protests against each other.In Panipat, BJP activists, led by Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia and Panipat City MLA Pramod Vij, gathered at the Congress office near Red Light Chowk to protest against outgoing Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Later, Congress workers also reached their office and raised slogans against the BJP leaders over the farmers’ agitation. The protests led to serpentine queues of vehicles on the service lane of the busy National Highway-44. Heavy police force was deployed to deal with any untoward incident, but the protest remained peaceful. BJP leaders slammed the Congress leaders from Haryana for not speaking against Captain Amarinder Singh’s statement that Punjab farmers should shift the protests from Punjab to Delhi and Haryana. On the other hand, former minister and Congress leader Ashok Arora said it was ironical, as the leader of the ruling party was also holding protests. He said the BJP-JJP alliance government in Haryana had failed to deliver on its promises, and though farmers were protesting for the past 10 months, the leaders of the ruling party had no concern for them. Similar protests were held at the Congress party’s district headquarters in Rohtak, Ambala, Jind and Kurukshetra. In Rohtak, former BJP minister Manish Grover, along with other senior party leaders, took out a protest march near the Congress office, where local MLA Bharat Bhushan Batra and other Congress leaders were present, and raised slogans against the BJP.Grover said the Punjab CM was the main force behind instigating the protesters against three farm laws. “Punjab’s economy is dwindling due to the protests, and he asked the farmers to protest at Haryana and Delhi borders, which proves that the Congress is instigating the protesters,” the BJP leader added.Congress’ Rohtak MLA BB Batra accused the BJP of creating drama by holding such protests to hide the failures of their Union and state governments. In Ambala, BJP workers led by Yamunanagar MLA and party’s district in-charge Ghanshyam Das Arora protested at the Old Cloth Market. In a counter protest, Congress workers also staged a sit-in few metres away. Former deputy CM Chander Mohan and MLA Shally Chaudhary were among those present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-bjp-protests-against-punjab-cm-congress-counters-with-slogans-101631992781803.html

The caseThe Congress government in June 2009 had issued a notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act to acquire 1,407 acres for developing residential Sectors 58 to 63 and commercial Sectors 65 to 67 in Gurugram by HUDA.While issuing the declaration under Section 6 on June 2, 2010, the total area was reduced to about 800 acres. Finally, the award, dated May 29, 2012, was passed for 87 acres only.The SC had said about 1,300 acres were released in the favour of private builders. The CBI in its preliminary inquiry had prima facie established irregularities in the release of land from acquisition process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gurugram-land-scam-cbi-court-pulls-up-police-for-delay-in-further-probe-101631992780476.html

19-09-2021||Chandigarh||‘Humiliated’, says Captain as he resigns as Punjab||Punjab’s chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh became the fifth chief minister (across four states) to be pushed to resign, although experts said the Congress’ decision could end up hurting its prospects in elections early next year.With under five months to go for the state elections, Singh resigned on Saturday after the Congress summoned a meeting of its lawmakers in the state, saying that he feels “humiliated”, but adding that he won’t accept newly appointed party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu as the next CM or the party’s face in the coming polls. Analysts said the infighting could work to the advantage of the Aam Aadmi Party, widely seen as the strongest contender in the state at this point in time.The two-time chief minister submitted his resignation along with those of his council of ministers to Governor Banwarilal Purohit at the Raj Bhawan barely minutes before a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), widely seen as having been called to remove him from the CM’s post. The meeting was announced by the Congress high command late on Friday, and it appeared to catch Singh, who is the leader of the CLP, unawares.The development came amid a power tussle that divided the ruling party in the state, with Singh and Sidhu at loggerheads. Sidhu was made the state Congress chief earlier this year despite opposition by Singh. Sidhu and several Congress lawmakers in the state have targeted Singh for not fulfilling promises made in the 2017 manifesto, being soft on the Badals of the Akali Dal , and an over-reliance on a small group of bureaucrats.“I feel humiliated...this is the third time they (Congress high command) have called the MLAs. Apparently, they do not have confidence in me and didn’t think I could handle my job. But I felt humiliated at the manner in which they handled the whole affair,” Singh told reporters after submitting his resignation.Singh said he spoke to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and told her about his decision to quit. “I have resigned and the (Congress) leadership can now make anyone it trusts the chief minister,” he said. However, there was no decision on his successor till late on Saturday.CLP passed a resolution authorising Sonia Gandhi to take a decision in the matter. The names of Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, his predecessor Sunil Jakhar and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa were doing the rounds as possible contenders for the post.Singh’s resignation came following a long-drawn tussle with Sidhu, four cabinet ministers and several MLAs. It also comes amidst fears that anti-incumbency arising from his style of functioning could hurt the party’s chances in he coming polls. The BJP effected changes in Uttarakhand and Gujarat recently citing similar concerns. While the process wasn’t entirely smooth -- especially in Gujarat, where the entire cabinet was dropped -- the party still managed to avoid making the changes the kind of public spectacle that has played out in Punjab over the past few months.Asked about his future course of action, Singh said he would decide this in consultation with his supporters. “I have been in politics for 52 years. I am going to be here. In politics, there are always options. I will use that option when the time comes… At the moment, I am still in the Congress,” he said.Before going to the Raj Bhawan, Singh was a huddle with at least a dozen ministers, MLAs and MPs, according to people aware of the development. He insisted that the MLAs attend the CLP meeting later.In another interaction with the media, the Congress leader said he won’t accept Sidhu as the Punjab chief minister, describing him as “a total disaster”. The man who could not handle one ministry, can never run entire Punjab, he said. If Sidhu is made the face of the Congress for the Punjab polls, Singh said he will oppose him “tooth and nail”. He also added that Sidhu’s close association with Pakistan PM Imran Khan could end up compromising India’s national security. Punjab shares an international border with Pakistan.Singh’s exit leaves the electoral battle in Punjab interestingly poised. The Shiromani Akali Dal has still not shrugged off the fall out of the sacrilege and police firing case, and its alliance with the BJP at the time the farm laws that have sparked a protest by farmers that is now into its eleventh month.Between June and October 2015, three incidents of sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib took place in Faridkot district, sparking protests across the state. On October 14, 2015, two protesters were killed in police firing in Behbal Kalan. The same day, police also opened fire on protesters in Kotkpaura. Amarinder had promised strict action against those responsible for sacrilege and police firing. On April 9 this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the investigation carried out by the state police’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the Kotkapura police firing case. The state government has constituted a new SIT in accordance with the court order. The obvious beneficiary of the fallout of these cases, analysts said, could be the Aam Aadmi Party.A Congress leader, asking not to be named, said Singh should have sent his resignation to the party president instead of giving it to the Governor in keeping with his long association with the Gandhi family and the party.The CLP meeting was attended by 78 out of the 80 Congress MLAs. Besides Singh, Vidhan Sabha speaker Raja Kanwarpal Singh did not join the meeting because of his constitutional obligation. The resolution was passed in the presence of two central observers, general secretary Ajay Maken and revenue minister in Rajasthan, Harish Chaudhary. Harish Rawat, in charge of Congress affairs in Punjab, said that all the MLAs passed the one-line resolution requesting Sonia Gandhi to decide the name of the next chief minister.The resolution was moved by Brahm Mohindra and seconded by the party’s Dalit MLA from Amritsar West, Raj Kumar Verka, the Congress’s working president and Urmur MLA Sangat Singh Gilzian and four-time MLA from Samrala, Amrik Singh Dhillon.Rawat said a copy of the resolution has been sent through email to Sonia Gandhi and the decision in this regard is expected soon.The CLP also passed a resolution hailing Singh’s tenure as the chief minister. The resolution in this regard was moved by Maken and was seconded by rural development and panchayati raj minister Tript Bajwa, who was among the first ones to revolt against Singh . “The party praised Amarinder for his tenure of as the chief minister. He tried to his best to serve the state under tough conditions the state was facing when he took over. He provided solutions to the problems the state was facing,” said Rawat.Maken said he hoped that Singh will continue to guide the Punjab Congress, being the most senior leader of the party.Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal said Amarinder Singh’s resignation is an admission by the Congress that it failed to perform in the state and has nothing to show for its tenure of over four-and-a-half years.“The Congress party cannot hope to save its incompetent government and befool Punjabis with a mere change of face,” he said, and alleged that the entire state cabinet was steeped in corruption.The BJP also termed Singh’s resignation a “failure” of the Congress in the state, and accused the ruling party of protecting “mafia raj”. BJP national general secretary Tarun Ghugh said, “The entire Punjab cabinet failed. The chief minister failed. Congress has failed in Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/humiliated-says-captain-as-he-resigns-as-punjab-101631992335805.html

A hunt was immediately launched by the villagers who found the boy’s body in the nearby plantations.Range officer (wildlife) Sajid Farooq said the boy lost his life in the unfortunate incident. People heard the cries and saw a blood trail.“The boy was quickly retrieved by the villagers and taken to hospital where doctors declared him brought dead,” Farooq said.This is the second incident in three months in Budgam when a child has lost his/her life to an attack by a leopard.A four-year-old girl had gone missing on June 3 while she was playing in the lawn of her house at Ompura Housing Colony, Budgam and was believed to have been taken away by a leopard.Next day, her mauled body was found in a forest nursery. The incident had caused outrage in the Valley.On June 15, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had announced that the leopard responsible for killing the girl was captured following a massive operation.Following the incident, the forest department had trimmed down and pruned trees in the nursery to “avoid any further loss of life”.“The area of Friday’s incident does not have any proximity to any forest but has a large poplar plantation on revenue land,” he said.Officials said the strength of personnel from forest protection force and wildlife is reinforced and traps are being installed in Soibugh area.“We have already installed a cage and are in the process of installing another,” Farooq said, adding, “We are ascertaining its movement pattern and determining its track.”He said the leopard was probably waiting at the fringe end of Hari Pora Haran village near a place which has a lot of trash.He urged villagers not to allow kids unattended in early mornings and evenings. “It is better to keep your surroundings clean and install lights at dark spots to avoid such incidents,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/8yrold-mauled-to-death-by-leopard-in-budgam-101631992536124.html

I think, if the state government hands over the information with them, the agencies like NIA will definitely probe the matter. The Centre will fulfill its constitutional responsibility in terms of investigation,” Muraleedharan said.The union minister also mentioned about an alleged incident of ‘”narcotic terrorism” reported in Punjab recently, quoting media reports there to counter Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s statement that he was coming across the ‘’narcotic jihad” remark by the Pala Bishop for the first time.At a time when the state was witnessing a raging debate on religious extremism and concerns about the radicalisation of youth, the in-house note seems to have put the CPI(M) in a dilemma as the opposition Congress and BJP have asked the left party to reveal the factual data substantiating their claim.Muraleedharan said against the backdrop of the party note surfacing, which substantiates the statements of Kallarangatt, the people of the state would like to know whether the ruling party or the chief minister would tender an apology for their stand taken against the Bishop.He also asked the government and the Chief Minister to take necessary action to eliminate the extremist forces from the state without limiting the matter within the party meetings.Under the sub-title ‘Minority Communalism’, the CPI(M)’s in-house note said it should be viewed seriously that even debates, supporting terrorist outfits like Taliban, which was denounced by the democratic world and majority in the Muslim community, were happening in the state. Stating that extremist forces were infiltrating mainstream Muslim outfits and trying to create issues in the southern state, it also said the actions of Sangh Parivar forces had instilled a sense of insecurity among the minority groups.“Deliberate attempts are being made to lure youth into communalism and extremist ideologies. Conscious efforts are on to make educated young women in the professional colleges to think that way. Both the student union and youth organisation (of CPI-M) should pay special attention to the issue,” it said.Though the Christians in the state generally do not comply with the communal ideologies, the radical influence growing among a small section in the community in recent times should be viewed seriously, it noted.Deliberate attempts were being made to turn the Christian community against the Muslims in the state, the party note said, adding that such moves would help the majority communalism to thrive in Kerala.The opposition Congress has urged the CPI(M) to show the proof for the allegation as it was a “serious” charge raised by the party which rules the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hand-over-info-on-terror-to-centre-bjp-to-kerala-101631991996025.html

Sharma hasn’t been arrested, while Brar was arrested from his office at Cantonment’s Rai Market.All except Section 505 (2) are bailable offences. They were booked after a news report was published in the newspaper about the arrest of a purported ISI-linked terrorist by the Punjab Police in Ambala.Anterdeep Singh, assistant public prosecutor, while asking for judicial remand, alleged that “by publishing wrong information in a national newspaper, he has created a false alarm in the mind of the general public, thereby promoted enmity between classes and he has also committed an offence against public peace.”He further argued that Brar might hamper with the evidence, as the machines from where the newspaper was printed, are at the office.Moving his bail application, advocate Rohit Jain said that Brar has been a journalist for over nine years and has been falsely implicated due to political pressure on police officers.While granting bail, the court of Mukesh Kumar, judicial magistrate first class, said that there is no need for further interrogation as custodial interrogation has been completed and the investigation is based on documentary evidence.On the prosecution charge of creating enmity, the court said, “..after perusal of remand paper and the copy of newspaper produced by the investigating officer, this court is of the view that there was nothing which can create enmity between classes.”HDF general secretary Chitra Sarwara welcomed the bail order and said that she believes that all authorities concerned will respect the law and individual rights in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/journalists-arrest-ambala-court-finds-no-substance-in-allegation-grants-bail-101631991935899.html

Government has taken many measures to alleviate distress and for welfare of the needy,” he said.“These are often financed through money which may be said to have been borrowed from our children and grandchildren. We owe it to them that these scarce resources are put to best possible use and are most effectively used for welfare of the poor,” he added.“Audit engagements provide a unique opportunity of gaining a deep understanding of the system and place CAG in a good position of suggesting improvements,” he said.“Governments will take a serious note of the advice made by an institution like CAG. This will positively impact our public service delivery standards,” he added.The President said for citizens’ convenience, government processes are increasingly getting digitised. “Fast expanding technology frontier has reduced distance between state and citizens. Through direct benefit transfer, money can reach the poorest citizen in the most remote corner of the country at the push of a computer button. From an audit perspective, this is a ‘small challenge’ and ‘huge opportunity’,” he added.Using advanced analytics tools, information from large volumes of data can be weaned out without travelling afar. Systemic red flags can be raised at an earlier stage.He said such surroundings are a great place for learning pursuits. These surroundings also teach us of onerous responsibility of leaving the same pristine nature for our future generations to enjoy. Despite India’s developmental needs, we have undertaken significant responsibility to address global climate change challenge and environmental protection.He noted that CAG has taken measures to build capacities in the area of environmental audit. “We must always remember that constraints of resource finiteness can only be partly addressed by human innovation. For the rest sacrifice by our generation is the only recourse. CAG has a big role to play in making us aware of sacrifices we need to make for our future generations,” he said.Addressing the officer trainees, the President said as public servants, they will derive satisfaction in being able to serve the poorest and bring a smile on her face. “While performing our constitutional duty, we should always be mindful of this common responsibility assigned to all functionaries. An approach laden with mutual empathy would ensure that we reach our national goals, much faster,” he said.Kovind, who is on a four-day tour to Shimla, also visited Jakhu Temple along with members of his family on Saturday.

As the Zirakpur municipal council is desperately trying to check water contamination that is leading to these outbreaks, the fresh cases come as a major embarrassment because Sukhna Colony is located next to its office.“Sixty cases of diarrhoea have been reported at Sukhna Colony. Twenty patients have been admitted to hospitals in Chandigarh, Mohali, Dhakoli and Panchkula,” said Mohali civil surgeon Adarsh Pal Kaur. The health department has set up a camp in the area for the past two days and is distributing chlorine and zinc tablets along with oral rehydration salts from door to door.Water supply to Sukhna Colony and nearby areas has been stopped, said Udayveer Singh Dhillon, president, Zirakpur municipal council, adding that two tankers have been deployed to provide drinking water. Water samples have also been collected for testing. Diarrhoea is the frequent passing of loose, watery and unformed faeces. Cholera is a bacterial disease causing severe diarrhoea and dehydration, usually spread through contaminated water. The infection is often mild or without symptoms but can sometimes be severe and life-threatening. Water contamination, again Sources in the health department said that there is no proper drainage system in the area, which is leading to mixing of sewage with drinking water. “The area is very congested and people are living in unhygienic conditions. Contamination of drinking water is the reason for spread of disease,” said the civil surgeon. Rohit Sharma, husband of the area councillor, said water pipelines were damaged during digging for laying a sewage pipeline. “It led to contamination of drinking water,” he said, adding that residents were informed not to use water during the work, but they did not heed to the directions. “Many people are also using submersible pumps to get water. We are getting water samples collected, and in case contamination is found, steps will be taken,” said Dhillon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/zirakpur-now-60-diarrhoea-cases-surface-at-sukhna-colony-101631991817235.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||How Punjab crisis snowballed despite enough warning signs||Exactly six months ago, on March 18, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh held a press conference to mark four years of his government, claiming to have fulfilled 85% of the promises listed in his party manifesto before the 2017 assembly elections.Confident and in control, he appeared to be master of all he surveyed: a firm grip on the state legislature party with no potential challengers from within, a strong equity with a whittled-down party high command and a dispirited Opposition.But the wheel of political fortunes turned rather swiftly for the scion of the erstwhile Patiala royalty and one of the tallest Congress leaders. On Saturday, six months after he looked unassailable, Amarinder’s chief ministership ended abruptly on a bitter note. Barely five months before the state assembly elections due early next year, in which he was hoping to again lead the party, he was forced by a cascade of circumstances to resign.Though Amarinder tendered his resignation to the Governor half an hour before the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting, the angst of an unceremonious exit was writ all over his demeanour and in an interaction with a horde of jostling journalists, he accused, for the first time, the party high command of humiliating him. In fact, the trigger for his ouster was a hurriedly called CLP meeting that AICC general secretary and Punjab incharge Harish Rawat announced on late on Friday on his Twitter handle, bypassing Amarinder, the leader of CLP.Signs of a gathering storm against Amarinder became evident last week when it emerged that about 40 Congress MLAs (out of the party’s strength of 80 in the 117-member House) shot off a letter to working president Sonia Gandhi, demanding the CLP meet and strongly articulating their disenchantment with the chief minister’s “failure to fulfil an 18-point to-do list that the high command had handed to him two months ago”. The letter, in the high command’s reckoning, was a strong and irrefutable expression of no confidence in Amarinder, whose political standing ostensibly suffered an erosion. That, coupled with a continuing bad blood between Amarinder and state Congress chief Navjot Sidhu, is understood to have forced the high command’s hand to jettison the Captain and effect change of guard to put its house in order before the assembly sweepstakes.The two-time chief minister’s exit was the culmination of the tussle between him and newly appointed Punjab Congress president Sidhu that saw several cabinet ministers and MLAs turn against Amarinder. The internal wrangling continued to dog the Congress no end, despite Rawat’s efforts to bridge the Amarinder-Sidhu rift that turned more pronounced and less reconcilable.While Amarinder was shrewd enough to checkmate the occasional rumblings of dissent, his troubles mounted after the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the special investigation team (SIT) report in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case that came out on April 9.A sulking Sidhu, who had fallen out with Amarinder after his exit from the state cabinet in July 2019, quickly latched on to the politically sensitive issue and blamed the CM for the setback. Several party ministers and MLAs, anxious about its political fallout on their electoral prospects, joined the Sidhu bandwagon.The turmoil turned into a full-blown war in May, forcing the Congress central leadership to intervene. Sonia set up a three-member committee headed by Rajya Sabha MP Mallikarjun Kharge on May 29 to resolve factionalism. They met 150-odd state leaders, several of whom griped about the public perception that Captain was “hand in glove” with the Badals, and the buzz about non-fulfilment of poll promises, working style and dependence on bureaucracy. The tipping point in the Amarinder-Sidhu face-off was the cricketer-turned-politician’s equity and equation with the brother–sister duo, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, who apparently saw him as the next generation face of the Congress in Punjab.On July 18, the high command named Sidhu as the state unit chief along with four working presidents, overriding the objections of the chief minister, who was bitterly opposed to his foe’s elevation and had, in a letter to the Congress president, even warned that it may lead to a split in the party. Though the party leadership was hopeful that its intervention would heal the rift, the crisis in the state Congress worsened, with both Amarinder and Sidhu pulling the party in different directions. Last month, four ministers and 24 legislators demanded that a CLP meeting be convened to remove the chief minister.“The infighting was hurting the party. When it failed to make them work together, it had to make a choice. Since the high command had appointed Sidhu barely two months ago after much deliberation and ignoring the chief minister’s reservations, he was here to stay and Captain had to go,” a senior party leader said, asking not to be named. Also, Sidhu and other disgruntled leaders, including those who remained close to Amarinder for a long time, kept harping on the strong undercurrent of anti-incumbency against the chief minister, laying the blame on him. The embattled leader did not help his cause by not acting promptly enough on the to-do list and lost equity with the leadership.But, Amarinder’s bitter exit may queer the pitch for the party. He dropped enough hints that he is not going to take his humiliation lying down. “I have been in politics for 52 years and remained chef minister for nine-and-a-half years. I am going to be here. There are always options in politics,” he told reporters after tendering his resignation. “I will explore and exercise them at the time of my choosing.”79-year-old Amarinder may be down, but he is certainly not out. A sulking Amarinder will keep the party on tenterhooks. He has the support of several party MLAs and MPs and may even emerge as the prime voice of dissent in the state Congress in a reversal of roles. His political manoeuvring skills, even though they did not work this time, are acknowledged by his critics. The last word on the Congress turmoil in Punjab is yet to be heard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/how-punjab-crisis-snowballed-despite-enough-warning-signs-101631991350211.html

Sizes of properties range from 167 square yards to 528 square yards, with their reserve price set between ₹1.2 crore and ₹3.7 crore. Also, after the UT administration announced the draft nursing home policy for residential sites, this will be Estate Office’s first offering of nine nursing home sites for sale.The sites include four in Sector 51, two each in Sectors 33 and 46, and one in Sector 44. The Estate Office is holding an auction after nearly two years. Planned for earlier this year, the auction was stuck as the office couldn’t get the requisite approvals from other departments involved, primarily the UT engineering department, for removal of heavy vegetation at the proposed sites.“Most of the preparations for the e-auction have been done. The non-encumbrance certificates are in. We expect to offer these properties within this month,” said a senior UT official.In the last auction held in 2019, all residential properties were sold, but there were no takers for the commercial and industrial plots. The department had generated a revenue of close to ₹44 crore from the auction of 11 residential properties whose total reserve price was around ₹27 crore. All of these properties were freehold and were located in southern sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-estate-office-to-auction-27-properties-this-month-101631991641086.html

19-09-2021||Other||In Cong upheaval, AAP stands to gain the most||Chandigarh Barely five months before the state assembly polls, the Congress got rid of its chief minister to bring a fresh face and to end the ongoing tussle in the state unit.Its troubles, however, are far from over with Capt Amarinder Singh becoming combative. His scathing attacks on Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and the party leadership will provide more ammunition to the opposition, lurking to take advantage of the growing fissures in the ruling party. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) stands to gain more from the Congress infighting than the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bahujan Samaj Party (SAD-BSP) combine. The BJP, which has been at the receiving end of the protesting farmers’ ire, is still struggling to get its act together. The AAP, which won 20 seats in the 2017 state polls to emerge as the principal opposition party, is already going all out to make the most of the instability in the Congress. It is slowly gaining traction in large pockets of the state with its campaign theme that they (people) have seen what the Congress and the SAD have to offer and should give them a chance. The party does not have a heavy baggage from the past, unlike the Akalis who are not only facing a blowback from farmers, but are also on the back-foot over the emotive sacrilege and police firing issues. The AAP, on the other hand, has been consistent in attacking both the Congress and the Akalis on these issues. Ashutosh Kumar, professor of political science, Panjab University, says the AAP will stand to gain from the upheaval in the Congress in a multi-cornered contest, as things stand now, because the Akalis are still to recover from the dent their image has suffered in public perception. “They (AAP) have their own sets of problems, starting with the fact they have not been able to offer a chief ministerial face to people. Another issue is the party leadership’s attempts to run the state unit from Delhi which had hurt them in 2017 as well,” he says. AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had, on June 21, announced in Amritsar that the CM candidate will be from the Sikh community. While the party has been searching for a prominent Sikh personality for its CM face, two-time Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann, the most popular state leader of the party, has run out of patience. The party’s top brass has offered to make him the deputy CM in case it gets the numbers needed to form the government in 2022, but has reservations about making him the face of the party, said sources. Of late, Mann has been maintaining a low-profile which does not augur well for the party with the state polls drawing closer with each passing day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-cong-upheaval-aap-stands-to-gain-the-most-101631990495621.html

On her arrival in Prayagraj, Anupriya, who is also Union minister of state for commerce and industry, said although there had been no formal talks with the BJP over number of seats that would be given to Apna Dal (S) yet, number of seats was not a matter of concern as both the parties had one goal to form an effective and strong government in Uttar Pradesh. “For this, Apna Dal (S) is activating a total of 16 ancillary units of the organisation and the workers working under them will also be trained in the coming weeks,” she said while speaking to media persons here. She further claimed that the alliance would be kept intact with complete integrity and honesty. “Both the parties will make collective efforts by rising above personal gains and we will get more seats as compared to 2017 elections in the upcoming UP assembly elections,” she said.On the issue of family dispute, Apna Dal (S) chief said, “I visit Kanpur every month to meet my mother. It is my personal effort and that of the party that she dons the role of the mentor and we all await her decision.”Giving the victory mantra to her party workers, Anupriya asked them to make the party strong at booth level as only then the target of “Mission 2022” would be achieved. Teams of 15 workers should be formed at each booth, she said. Applauding efforts of PM Narendra Modi in the field of social justice, the minister said the work of the government needed to be taken to the common man. She also said that Apna Dal (S) would play a decisive role in 2022 UP assembly election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/anupriya-patel-will-keep-apna-dal-s-alliance-with-bjp-intact-at-all-costs-101631988526271.html

Usually, the proposals are first vetted and approved by the standing committee and then by the House of the elected councillors before being implemented.According to the policy, applicants will have to submit a no objection certificate (NOC) from the land owner for using the open space/terrace for service purpose only. Also, it makes it mandatory for restaurant owners to get an NOC from the Delhi Fire Service (DFS).The policy says that no cooking or food preparation will be allowed in the open area, and that it must not be covered.“If liquor is being served in the open spaces, it has to be done in a way that it is not visible to passersby, which means that it should have a wall with a provision for regulated entry/exit. The open space should also have a direct access or opening to the main road,” it said.Besides, permission will be given for dining in open areas only on the submission of building structural safety certificate by registered structural engineer, the policy says.Public health department officials said restaurant owners will be charged an open service area fee along with the licence fee for operating such spaces. “The fee for operating open spaces will be charged at the rate of ₹200 per square feet for restaurant that are rated less than four stars. For restaurants operating in star hotels (four stars and above) the rate will be ₹400 per square feet. The validity of the licence will be up to three years and will be renewed accordingly with licence of eating house,” said a senior official, who asked not to be named.EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said the policy has been given anticipatory approval. Besides providing a legal sanction to open air dining, which has been a long-standing demand from restaurant owners, it will also help boost revenue. “There are many five-star hotels in our area as well as a number of standalone restaurants, and we hope to earn substantial revenue. This will give the eating outlets a new boost during the pandemic as well. Also, those who have been trying to have open air dining for long will now have it easy. It works both ways and benefits both the corporation as well as restaurant owners, and also those who want dine in the open,” said Aggarwal.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation implemented the same policy last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/east-delhi-civic-body-unveils-policy-to-allow-open-air-dining-at-eateries-101631982754793.html
19-09-2021||Delhi||Grey Line gets one more station, Metro touches Delhi’s rural heart||The Dhansa Bus Stand – Najafgarh section on Delhi Metro’s Grey Line was opened at 5pm on Saturday with Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurating the stretch through video conference.The newly opened Dhansa Bus Stand station is an underground facility, and is an extension of the Dwarka-Najafgarh corridor, which is known as the Grey Line. Now, the line will have four stations -- Dwarka, Nangli, Najafgarh and Dhansa Bus Stop.The stretch between Najafgarh and Dhansa Bus stand is only 1.2 kilometres long, but it is significant as it will provide the Metro link to at least 50 villages in that area.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said the Dhansa Bus Stand station is the first ever underground Metro station of the Delhi Metro network to have an entire underground floor dedicated for parking of vehicles. “The parking facility will be integrated with the main station area where vehicle users will be able to park their cars and two wheelers and then proceed to the concourse of the station directly using lifts and escalators,” it said.Speaking at the inauguration Puri said the total Metro network in India will be increased to about 2,000 kms by 2022. “Nearly 740 km of metro lines are at present operational in various cities in India and the network span is steadily scheduled to rise to about 900 km by 2022. The remaining kms are under construction,” he said.Puri said with its ridership reaching 6.5 million per day during the pre-Covid times, Delhi Metro has been a trailblazer. “The overall ridership in Metros across the country in pre-pandemic time was 8.5 million, of which the Delhi Metro alone conducted 6.5 million rides,” he said.Kejriwal said until Friday, the route of the Delhi Metro in outer Delhi used to end at the Delhi Gate region in Najafgarh. “There are about 50 villages in the area from where a huge number of people come to central parts of the city for work and shopping. All these people had to cross the busy and congested Phirni Road Chowk to get to the Metro that resulted in a huge traffic jam at the Chowk. Now that the metro services have been extended to the Dhansa Bus Stand, people won’t need to cross the Chowk and wade through traffic. The new link may be just 1.5 kms long but it is a very significant stretch for the residents. A large number of people come from Jhajjar, Haryana to work in Delhi. They too will benefit from this service,” he said.The areas around Dhansa Bus Stand in the Najafgarh region have deep cultural roots and contributes significantly in terms of ecological value. Jheel between Najafgarh and Dhansa is a marshy ecosystem and is an ecological haven for a large number of local wildlife. It also witnesses seasonal movement of migratory birds.To make the Metro station reflect the essence of the area, DMRC used photographs on printed glass panels at Dhansa Bus Stand station to showcase the rich biodiversity of this area. The artwork at the station is themed as “Migratory Birds”, the DMRC said. “The surrounding villages are renowned for many ancient folklores. The villages host fairs to celebrate their historical significance.Therefore, some hand painted artworks are inspired by their rich spirit and the celebration of values and are themed as “local socio-cultural scenario,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/grey-line-gets-one-more-station-metro-touches-delhi-s-rural-heart-101631968413193.html
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | It’s never too late to add to qualifications||Education has always been a passion of mine. In fact, I pursued it throughout my career spanning three-and-a-half decades. I never missed any opportunity to study further. It wasn’t easy coupled with my responsibilities on the domestic and official fronts. Nevertheless, I continued to add to my educational qualifications enthusiastically, despite my fragile health due to chronic haemophilia. Braving all odds, I went on a spree of higher learning and pursued a postgraduate degree in economics, Bachelor of Legislative Law, and subsequently completed my doctorate in journalism and mass communication. In May 2017, I decided to join a master of laws course at Kurukshetra University through the directorate of distance education and decided to submit the admission form personally so as to avert any chances of rejection and secure a seat in the course.On our way back to Chandigarh from Delhi after attending an interview for a tourist visa with the US embassy, my wife, an associate professor, accompanied me to the university campus. We handed over the admission form to a clerk in his mid-50s who after meticulously checking the documents, quipped Haryanvi, “Tau, tane ghare koi kaam nahin jo is umar mei bhi padai kar reha” (Sir, don’t you have any work at home that you are even studying at this age).I told him that I wanted to pursue the course to reconnect with the subject as practising law was my post-retirement plan. However, the clerk was not convinced and curtly remarked: “Muje lage tujhe ghar koi na rakhe” (It appears to me that no one lets you to stay at home). I was taken aback by his observation as he probably mistook my age due to my bushy grey beard and fragile physique. It was an embarrassing experience, particularly as my wife who has always encouraged me to study further was accompanying me. Finally, the official confirmed my admission, assigned a roll number and asked me to collect lessons from the store in-charge.On our way back to Chandigarh, I kept pondering over the unsavoury incident and felt quite perturbed by the unpleasant attitude of the concerned official. However, later, I decided to take his rare wit in a positive manner as age can never be a barrier for improving one’s academic prospects. This episode eventually reaffirmed my belief as educating oneself has no age limit because learning is a lifelong process. opinder.lamba@gmail.com(The writer is additional director (press) to the Punjab chief minister)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/its-never-too-late-to-improve-academic-prospects-101631961031970.html

But he said real-time data from the US and Israel continues to come in showing waning efficacy among broader groups of people that will need to be addressed soon.In Italy, bookings for vaccine have spiked after the government said all staff must show proof of a jab, negative test or recent recovery from Covid-19. “On a national level, there was a generalised increase in bookings for the first dose between 20-40% compared to last week,” Covid-19 commissioner Francesco Figliuolo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-official-says-booster-dose-use-may-be-expanded-101632075861498.html

They are slated to discuss the ongoing pandemic and their joint efforts to boost global vaccine supplies, the climate crisis, partnering on emerging technologies and cyberspace, and promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific.Their September 24 meeting is the first in-person summit level meeting of the group that is technically called the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue but is popularly known as just the Quad. It is seen as an emerging bloc of countries positioning itself as a check against China’s growing aggression in the Indo-Pacific and outside. The leaders held their first summit in March, but it was held virtually.Citing a draft of the joint statement, Nikkei reported that the four leaders are expected to say that “resilient, diverse and secure technology supply chains for hardware, software, and services” are vital to their shared national interests.Japan and the United States are the world’s leading manufacturers of semiconductors, along with Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. China is a big rival that has been called Asia’s “Big 4” along with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. India and Australia are nowhere in the market although New Delhi has moved aggressively to woo chipmakers in recent years.Nikkei reported that the draft document seeks to set common principles on technological development, arguing that “the way in which technology is designed, developed, governed and used should be shaped by our shared democratic values and respect for universal human rights”.The document does not specify any country as a threat or competition, but it does refer to China’s alleged theft of technology, saying that “illicit transfer or theft of technology is a common challenge that undermines the very foundation of global technological development and should be addressed”.In a barely veiled reference to China’s widely reported use of technology for surveillance of its population, specially Uighur minority Muslims, the draft reportedly says that the Quad believes “technology should not be misused or abused for malicious activities such as authoritarian surveillance and oppression”.The Quad group hopes to “launch a joint initiative to map capacity, identify vulnerabilities and bolster supply chain security for semiconductors and their vital components”, the draft says further according to the report in Nikkei.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-summit-4-nation-leaders-to-announce-securing-semiconductor-supply-chain-101632073801854.html

"There photos are real," he posted as Taliban fighters can be seen enjoying some serene moments in the lake with RPGs and assault rifles slinging from their shoulders.A Daily Mail report said the photos have been taken at Band-e Amir National Park, which used to be a hotspot for international travellers and domestic tourists as well. Around 45 miles from Bamiyan, the park contains a series of six deep blue lakes situated in the Hindu Kush mountains. Taliban in Bamyan Province…(These photos are real) pic.twitter.com/oWHJXDpVfZSome social media users also compared the photo with the iconic painting of Washington crossing the Delaware, which depicted the historic event of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River during the American Revolutionary War.Gun-toting Taliban fighters have become a commonplace sight in Afghanistan after the country was captured by the group on August 15.

Initial reports said five people were killed, including two civilians, among them a child. The Taliban were not immediately available for comment about possible casualties among their ranks, the report said.Who are attacking the Taliban?The target of the explosions, two days on the row, is the Taiban, reports have said as in both the cases vehicles carrying Taliban fighters have been attacked. Since Jalalabad is a stronghold of the ISIS-K, who claimed responsibility for the blast at Kabul airport on August 25, they are on the list of suspects.Saturday's attack was the first deadly blast in Afghanistan since the US withdrew its forces from the country, while Saturday's attack proves that the Taliban are facing stiff resistance in areas under their control.This comes at a time when the Taliban and the Haqqanis are at loggerheads with reports doing rounds that Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani had punched Mullah Baradar in the recent fighting between the two groups.The attacks come amid apprehension that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan would bolster terror activities in the region, though the Taliban have promised that they will ensure that the soil of Afghanistan is not used for any terror activities. US security experts have already alerted that al Qaeda has started activities in Afghanistan and will take a year or two to become capable of striking the US from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosion-targeting-taliban-in-jalalabad-for-2nd-day-in-row-hints-at-infighting-101632052938572.html

According to a report citing Finnish researchers, although the ‘Mu’ variant of the coronavirus has now been detected in as many as 39 other countries apart from Finland, the variant does not pose any additional threats compared to the other variants of the virus causing the infectious disease.Also Read | Is Mu variant of coronavirus vaccine resistant? WHO says it could be possible“All variants that can evade protection conferred by a previous infection or vaccine-provided immunity are potentially worrying, or ones that we have to monitor,” the report quoted Turku University virology professor Ilkka Julkunen as saying. “That's the case with the ‘Mu’ variant as well.”The Mu variant of the coronavirus was alerted by the WHO as being responsible for a growing number of Covid-19 cases in Colombia in South America and other countries. The variant, officially termed as B.1.621, “has been designated as a Variant of Interest as it has some mutations that need to be studied for their potential impact on the body’s immune response.”The WHO designated it as a variant of interest due to the several concerning mutations, and assigned a Greek letter name to it. Mu carries key mutations, including E484K, N501Y, and D614G, that have been linked with increased transmissibility and reduced immune protection.According to the WHO's Bulletin published earlier this month, Mu has caused some larger outbreaks in South America and Europe.

Let's see,” Navalny's banned Anti-Corruption Foundation tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-blocks-list-of-russian-candidates-recommended-by-jailed-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-101632034108075.html

Shocking at times, but also sweeping in its beauty, A Night of Knowing Nothing is a first feature that already demonstrates her strong voice as a filmmaker,” the award citation stated.Indian director Payal Kapadia had earlier directed the short films Afternoon Clouds in 2017 and And What Is the Summer Saying the next year. TIFF programmer Andrea Picard had described the film as “One of the year’s most electrifying debuts” and “a fever dream of impossible love tied to a broader reflection on contemporary India.” The film had earlier won the best documentary award at Cannes.The other awards in this category went to Somali director Khadar Ayderus Ahmed’s The Gravedigger’s Wife and Canadian Rhayne Vermette’s Ste. Anne.TIFF also announced its major honours on Saturday evening, with the People’s Choice Award going to British director Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast. This particular award is often a harbinger of Oscars, as in the case of the 2020 winner Nomadland, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture this year.While the People’s Choice Award is based on voting by the viewing public, TIFF’s competitive programme, based on selection by a jury, is the Platform Prize. This was awarded to Indonesian director Kamila Andini’s Yuni. The jury statement explaining the choice said this was a “film that brings a fresh, intimate perspective to a coming-of-age story, marked by a subtle structure, delicate framing, and lush cinematography”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-director-payal-kapadia-s-documentary-wins-award-at-tiff-101632031677512.html
19-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Justin Trudeau likely to pip Erin O’ Toole to post||With just over a day left before voting in Canada elections begins, it appears that barring a miracle, the results will be a rerun of the 2019 polls. Incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is likely to pip his Conservative rival Erin O’Toole to post and return to Ottawa to head another minority government. Survey data now consistently points to the Liberals under the leadership of Justin Trudeau emerging as the single-largest party and thereby favoured to form the next government. The polls indicate that maintaining of the status quo, though Trudeau, leader of the ruling Liberal Party, had precipitated snap elections with the intent of securing a majority. In a release titled “Déjà vu all over again?” the non-partisan polling agency Angus Reid Institute (ARI) emphasised this point, “The Liberals and the Conservatives are separated by very little daylight, fighting for advantage in a race that may now depend on factors not entirely in their control: voter turnout, and the performance of other parties.”That appears to be direction predicted by the CBC Poll Tracker as it has the ruling party at 150 seats, 20 short of the majority figure, while the principal opposition Conservative Party under Erin O’Toole is at 118. If those figures hold, Justin Trudeau’s party will be seven short of the seats it garnered in 2019 while the Conservatives, led by Erin O’Toole, will drop three.A somewhat brighter prospect is predicted by the Ottawa-based market research company Advanced Symbolics Inc Artificial Intelligence-based engine Polly, as it placed the Liberals under Justin Trudeau at 163 seats on Saturday evening, an improvement of six over 2019, and on the cusp of the majority mark in the 338-seat House of Commons, but also said the likelihood of a minority was at 66%, twice that of a majority.Among the factors playing into subduing Trudeau’s ambition could be the continued displeasure of Canadians over holding elections in the midst of the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. A poll conducted by the firm Ipsos Public Affairs for the outlet Global News noted that at the outset of the campaign, 56% of respondents didn’t think an election at this time was necessary and that figure has only increased, to 69%. Ipsos vice-president Sean Simpson stated that “if (the Liberals) they do win with a parliament that looks a lot like the previous one, Trudeau may once again need to explain to Canadians why we had an election.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-justin-trudeau-likely-to-pip-erin-o-toole-to-post-101632029577042.html
19-09-2021||World||No respect: Afghan rights commission says Taliban using its cars, computers, other assets||The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) said in a statement on Saturday that the Taliban are showing a complete ‘disregard’ for human rights, zero willingness to respect the commission's mandate and independence even though it has continued running its Afghanistan office amid a precarious situation following the fall of Kabul to the Islamist group. Not only have the Taliban occupied the commission's offices, but they are also using its cars, computers, and other assets – indicating a total lack of respect for the human rights groups working in the war-torn land.“Since August 15, the AIHRC continues in office but has been unable to fulfil its duties to the Afghan people,” the statement read. “All AIHRC buildings have been occupied by Taliban forces, who have also made appointments and used AIHRC assets such as cars and computers.”The AIHRC demanded that the Taliban “respect” the independence of the commission and its staff and all the human rights defenders based in the country, all of who have been working tirelessly to protect the rights of the Afghan people.The organisation also highlighted the reported attacks on its female staff by the Taliban rulers. “Given the restrictions by the Taliban on women’s employment and role in public life, we fear the Taliban would not allow female staff to continue to carry out their duties, including at a leadership level. This is unacceptable: the AIHRC cannot protect the rights of all Afghans if it cannot protect the rights of its female staff,” the agency said.Meanwhile, the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said on Friday that the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is ‘pretty desperate’ and called for urgent aid to the country. During a press conference in Islamabad, Grandi stressed that food, medicines, shelter, and other necessities are needed urgently in Afghanistan.Earlier this week, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) unanimously adopted a resolution renewing the mandate of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), specifying the importance of “equal and meaningful participation” of women in public life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-respect-afghan-rights-commission-says-taliban-using-its-cars-computers-other-assets-101632023856738.html
19-09-2021||World||Imran Khan does a U-turn, after praising Taliban, he defends Joe Biden||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan defended US President Joe Biden’s decision for the botched pullout of American troops from Afghanistan, insisting that it was a “sensible” move and Biden is being “unfairly criticised” for it. "There was so much unfair criticism of President Biden, and what he did was the most sensible thing to do," Khan told a Russian news channel on September 17.Khan’s defence of the American President comes a month after he blamed the US for expecting Pakistan to “clean up the mess” it leaves behind in Afghanistan. “Pakistan is just considered only to be useful in the context of somehow settling this mess which has been left behind after 20 years of trying to find a military solution when there was not one,” Khan told reporters in Islamabad in early August before Kabul fell to the Taliban.Khan himself has been a vocal critic of Biden’s decision to pull troops from Afghan soil. In an interview with The New York Times in late June, he blamed American withdrawal for diminishing the influence Pakistan had over the Taliban. “Given that the United States gave a date of withdrawal, from then onward, our leverage diminished on the Taliban. And the reason is that the moment the United States gave a date of exit, the Taliban basically claimed victory. They’re thinking that they won the war. And so, therefore, our ability to influence them diminishes the stronger they feel,” Khan alleged.Biden has been subjected to strong-worded criticism from opposition politicians in his country and from the international community, who termed the pullout “hasty”, and worried about the Taliban’s newfound legitimacy, after the botched US withdrawal on August 31.Khan also expressed doubts on America’s future intentions regarding Afghanistan, and said he wasn’t sure if the country had a coherent policy on how to deal with a war-ravaged country, Dawn reported on Sunday. He also simultaneously called on the US to engage in humanitarian efforts to help refugees, stressing the important role the country has to play after being in Afghanistan for over 20 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-says-us-afghanistan-withdrawal-was-sensible-defends-biden-against-unfair-criticism-101632028198287.html
19-09-2021||World||Taliban are after Bactrian gold treasure. It has an Indian connect||The Taliban have said they have begun efforts to track and locate the 2000-year-old Bactrian treasure, also known as Bactrian Gold. “The issue is under investigation, and we will collect information to know what the reality is. If it has been transferred (out of Afghanistan), it is treason against Afghanistan,” Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the cultural commission of the Taliban interim cabinet, was quoted as saying by Tolo News. “The government of Afghanistan will take serious actions if this and other ancient items are moved out of the country,” Wasiq said.More than 20,000 artefactsThe Bactrian treasure was excavated in 1978-79 from the graves of six wealthy nomads—dating from the first century BC to the first century AD— in the Tela Tapa or Hill of Gold area of Sherberghan district in northern Afghanistan. The graves of the Saka tribesmen from Central Asia, perhaps, or the Yuezhi from northwest China, had more than 20,000 artefacts including gold cupids, dolphins, gods and dragons encrusted with semiprecious stones such as turquoise, carnelian, and lapis lazuli. They also contained golden rings, coins, weapons, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, weapons, and crowns.Also read | Taliban to track, secure 2000-year-old Bactrian gold treasure: ReportViktor Sarianidi, the Moscow archaeologist who led the joint Soviet-Afghan team that uncovered the graves, compared the impact of the find to the 1922 discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb. "The gold of Bactria shook the world of archaeology. Nowhere in antiquity have so many different objects from so many different cultures—Chinese-inspired boot buckles, Roman coins, daggers in a Siberian style—been found together in situ,” Sarianidi has written, according to the Smithsonian Magazine.“The 2,000-year-old artifacts found with them exhibit a rare blend of aesthetic influences (from Persian to classical Greek) and the great number of precious objects found surprised the archaeologists, in particular the intricate golden crown found in the sixth tomb,” it added. Smithsonian Magazine said in 2009 that for example the diadem, “a five-inch-tall crown of hammered gold leaf, conveniently folds for travel, and a thumb-size gold figure of a mountain sheep is delicately incised with curving horns and flaring nostrils”.Also read | Afghanistan had women ministry. Taliban replace it with ‘vice and virtue’Kushan Empire, BuddhaSarianidi believed that the treasure had been assembled by Yuezhi nobles from China, who arrived in the Bactria region around the second century BC and later established the Kushan Empire in India. Other scholars say the hoard was interred by Scythians from modern-day Iran. “The contesting theories reveal the variety of influences that make up this huge collection of objects. Other items include a Roman coin with the head of the emperor Tiberius, a silver mirror with Chinese engravings, rings with Greek text, and a coin with Buddhist imagery,” National Geographic magazine said in 2016.Sarianidi and his workers found a skull and skeleton surrounded by gold jewellery and ornaments during the course of the excavation. They were the remains of a woman, 25 to 30 years old, whom Sarianidi called a nomadic princess. “He subsequently found and excavated five additional graves, all simple trenches containing lidless wooden coffins holding the remains of once ornately attired bodies,” according to Smithsonian Magazine.Also read | Taliban ban female employees from entering ministry of womenSarianidi's team uncovered in the grave of a chieftain—the only man found at the site—turquoise-studded daggers and sheaths and a braided gold belt with raised medallions that bear the image riding on a panther. Some say the image is that Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, and others speculate it's the Bactrian goddess Nana seated on a lion. An Indian medallion was also found near the chieftain's rib cage by the excavators. Véronique Schiltz, a French archaeologist with the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris, has said it bears one of the earliest representations of Buddha.The remains of a woman in her 30s were found in a nearby grave and she was wearing signet rings with images of Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, and a pair of matching jewelled pendants with gold figures grasping S-shaped dragons. Another grave, that of a teenage girl, contained thin gold shoe soles along with a Roman coin minted in the early first century AD in Gallic Lugdunum—present-day Lyon, France.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-are-after-bactrian-gold-treasure-it-has-an-indian-connect-101632026306958.html

But there were some boys who did not go back to schools as they reopened in the country. The Wall Street Journal reported that some boys in the Afghan capital of Kabul stayed home in solidarity with their female schoolmates. “Women make up half the society... I will not show up at school until girls’ schools are open too,” Rohullah, an 18-year-old student of Class 12, was quoted as saying by WSJ.The Taliban education ministry on Friday said boys' secondary schools would soon reopen. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told the local Bakhtar News Agency on Saturday that arrangements were being made to reopen girls' secondary schools but he gave no date. "All male teachers and students should attend their educational institutions," a statement, issued late Friday, said, without mentioning anything about women teachers or girl pupils.Also read | Taliban reopen schools for Afghan boys, girls still not allowed in classesThe Taliban have said they will not enforce the fundamentalist policies, including a ban on girls going to schools, when they last ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, and have assured that girls will be able to study but only in segregated classrooms.Nazife, a teacher at a private school in Kabul, said they had made changes in order to reopen. "Girls study in the morning and boys in the afternoon. Male teachers teach boys and female teachers teach girls,” she told Reuters.Some girls did go back to their primary schools with gender-segregated classes on Saturday, but older girls are yet to figure out when they would be able to resume their studies at the secondary school level. "Their spirits are down and they are waiting for government announcements so they can resume studying," Hadis Rezaei, who teaches the school's female secondary-level pupils, was quoted as saying by Reuters.Also read | Afghanistan had women ministry. Taliban replace it with ‘vice and virtue’"The education of girls is fixing a generation. The education of boys may affect a family but the education of girls affects society," said the school's principal, Mohammadreza. "We are very closely following the matter so that girls can resume their education and complete their studies."The United Nations has said it was "deeply worried" for the future of girls' schooling in Afghanistan. "It is critical that all girls, including older girls, are able to resume their education without any further delays. For that, we need female teachers to resume teaching," the Unicef, the UN's children's agency, said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-solidarity-some-afghan-boys-stay-back-home-as-girls-yet-to-resume-school-101632021810661.html
19-09-2021||World||Hong Kong holds its first 'patriots only' election, pro-democracy candidates nearly absent||Fewer than 5,000 Hong Kong people from mostly pro-establishment circles began voting on Sunday for candidates to an election committee, vetted as loyal to Beijing, who will pick the city's next China-backed leader and some of its legislature.Pro-democracy candidates are nearly absent from Hong Kong's first election since Beijing overhauled the city's electoral system to ensure that "only patriots" rule China's freest city."The whole objective of improving the electoral system is to ensure patriots administer Hong Kong," Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, said on Sunday morning."I doubt very much that another government or country will allow the public election to their local legislature of people whose mission is to undermine the national interest or national security."The election committee will select 40 seats in the revamped Legislative Council in December, and choose a chief executive in March.Police have ramped up security across the city, with local media reporting 6,000 officers are expected to be deployed to ensure a smooth vote, in which about 4,900 people are expected to cast ballots.Changes to the political system are the latest in a string of moves – including a national security law that punishes anything Beijing deems as subversion, secession, terrorism, or collusion with foreign forces - that have placed the international financial hub on an authoritarian path.Most prominent democratic activists and politicians are now in jail or have fled abroad.China's rubber-stamp parliament in May changed Hong Kong's electoral system, reducing democratic representation in institutions and introducing the vetting mechanism for election candidates and winners. This all but removed any influence the opposition was able to exert.The changes also dramatically reduced the influence of the city's powerful tycoons, although groups close to their business interests retain a presence in the 1,500-strong committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive.Tycoons out, sons remainChina promised universal suffrage as an ultimate goal for Hong Kong in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which also states the city has wide-ranging autonomy from Beijing.Democracy campaigners and Western countries say the political overhaul moves the city in the opposite direction, leaving the democratic opposition with its most limited space since Britain handed the former colony back to China in 1997.Committee membership for 117 community-level district councillors, dominated by democrats, was scrapped, while more than 500 seats designated for Chinese business, political, and grassroots groups were added.The new electoral list includes community-level organisations such as Modern Mummy Group and Chinese Arts Papercutting Association, Cable TV reported.Representation from professional subsectors that traditionally had a bigger pro-democracy presence was diluted by the addition of ex-officio members, reducing the number of elected seats.About 70% of the nominees did not feature in the last two polls for the committee, which will expand by 300 members to 1,500, Reuters calculations based on the election committee website showed.Many prominent tycoons, including Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-Shing, will not be on the election committee for the first time, as Beijing seeks to rebalance power from big conglomerates to small businesses.Three property moguls - Li, 93, of CK Asset Holdings, Lee Shau-kee, also 93, of Henderson Land, and Henry Cheng, 74, of New World Development - withdrew from the race, although their sons will retain their seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-holds-its-first-patriots-only-election-pro-democracy-candidates-nearly-absent-101632021491906.html

However, the warning came too late: the missile had already been launched and officials received a note of it just seconds before the projectile hit, according to a CNN report. The missile strike never got any of its intended terrorist targets, and instead killed 10 civilians, including seven children.Also Read | 10 civilians killed: US says Kabul drone strike was a ‘tragic mistake’The American multinational news network reported, citing those privy with the matter, that there may have been a “miscommunication” between the military and the intelligence community since rapidly evolving situations often call for prompt action without following up on the complete chain of command. The CIA, however, refused to comment when contacted regarding the development, the news organisation added.The gap in decision-making between the two institutions has resulted in what has been a consistent reality in Afghanistan – civilian casualties; however, analysts cited by the news network say that these “mistakes” are only going to get worse without the presence of US troops on the ground, who could potentially have verified the correct target before successful strikes on legitimate ISIS-K or al Qaeda targets are launched.The US military on Friday acknowledged that the drone strike carried out in Kabul on August 29 was a “tragic mistake” and all 10 people killed were civilians, including seven children, and not one of them had anything to do with the terrorist group Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) as had been claimed earlier.It was a most profound reversal of the Pentagon’s earlier description of the drone strike in Kabul, which was touted as a successful operation that presaged the over-the-horizon counterterrorism capability that President Joe Biden said the US will have in Afghanistan after the pull-out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-warned-of-civilian-casualties-in-kabul-drone-strike-but-it-was-too-late-101632015845653.html
19-09-2021||World||Russian parliamentary elections to conclude today; Putin projected to win||The three-day parliamentary elections in Russia, which began on September 17, will conclude on Sunday with President Vladimir Putin’s ruling United Party expected to win the polls marred by claims of widespread violations and suppression of opposition voices. However, some poll experts have said that Putin’s party will fall short of retaining its current two-third domination of the state Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament.The Communist Party of Russia is expected to gain from the loss Putin’s party may see in this election. The loss of a two-thirds majority in the State Duma assumes significance because the Russian constitution can only be changed by a party with a two-thirds majority in the parliament.The Communist Party is projected to benefit from the now-banned Smart Voting App promoted by incarcerated Putin critic Alexei Navalny. Tech giants Google and Apple took down the app from their respective stores after Russian authorities warned that failure to do so will be seen as an attempt to interfere with the country’s electoral process. Navalny used the Smart Voting App to inform voters on the strongest candidates who were in a position to defeat candidates fielded by Putin’s party, thereby undermining their vote share.Also Read: MI6, CIA chiefs and Russia’s Security Council secretary make beeline for IndiaBoth independent media and election monitoring agencies like Golos have reported violations like vote-buying and lack of proper measures for guarding ballots at polling stations. Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov told reporters on the second day of polling that the Russian police and the national election commission must respond to claims of ballot stuffing incidents in many regions.Central elections commission head Ella Pamfilova accepted Zyuganov’s claims and stated that 6,200 ballots have been annulled in five regions for ballot stuffing and other procedural violations.Navalny, Putin’s most vocal critic, who has been incarcerated in a Russian penal colony, and his organisation have been declared as “extremists” by the Putin administration and thus all of its candidates have been banned from contesting elections, thereby decimating one of the strongest opposition forces Putin has faced in recent history. Navalny’s efforts and the vacuum created by the banning of his organisation is expected to benefit the Communist Party.On the first day of the elections on September 16, long lines were seen outside polling stations in the country, with independent media outlets deducing that the queues were indicative of state-run companies forcing employees to vote. Voters who talked to journalists present at voting venues showed little to no interest in the country’s electoral process. Journalists also witnessed incidents of ballot stuffing and other poll violations in different provinces, reported the Associated Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-parliamentary-elections-to-conclude-today-putin-projected-to-win-101632019218129.html

The new defensive pact forced Canberra to give up on a $66 billion contract with France to develop 12 state-of-the-art conventionally powered attack submarines.The G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The summit in Cornwall, held on June 11-13, was also attended by the leaders of the European Union and several guest nations, such as South Korea, Australia, and South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-australia-explored-aukus-pact-at-g7-meet-behind-macron-s-back-reports-101632019075483.html

But currently, there are fewer officers in the departments.At the moment, most of Afghanistan's embassies have cut off contacts with the Kabul administration and the host countries, he revealed, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.Some embassies are still led by former minister, Hanif Atmar and then vice-president Amrullah Saleh.Some remained neutral, while others were in contact with the new administration, the source said, without providing further details, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.The official said 80 per cent of the embassies' expenses were met with their own revenue collected from services like issuance of passports and other facilities.He also disclosed workers of Afghanistan's embassies in France and Germany had sought asylum in the host countries, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.The former MoFA official claimed the acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, had tried several times to organise online meetings with Afghan envoys abroad, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.The minister reportedly planned to hold a virtual meeting with them on Wednesday, but it was cancelled because most of the ambassadors were absent, reported Pajhwok Afghan News.According to the source, a former officer of the ministry, in a voice message, had asked Afghanistan's embassies to continue discharging their responsibilities. However, the source explained such orders should be issued in writing.Embassies also did not know about their fate and whether or not host countries would recognise the new government, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-embassies-acting-independently-many-broke-contact-with-taliban-report-101632015334445.html

The four amateur astronauts who went on a private space trip this week landed safely back to Earth on Saturday night after orbiting the planet for three days. The SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft ‘Resilience’ splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida in the United States at approximately 7:07pm EDT (around 4:37am IST), writing a new chapter in the history of human spaceflight and perhaps bringing the civilisation closer to the much-speculated future of space tourism.Also Read | SpaceX crew member plays ukulele in zero gravity, makes spaceflight history“Splashdown!” SpaceX posted from its official handle on Twitter, with a clip of the landing. “Welcome back to planet Earth, Inspiration4!”“On behalf of SpaceX, welcome back to planet Earth,” a SpaceX mission controller was quoted as saying after the splashdown. “Your mission has shown the world that space is for all of us.”Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire who sponsored the trip and was also its mission commander, said in reply, “Thanks so much, SpaceX.

The event generated great interest across the world since it is expected that this chapter will now lead to a future of spaceflight for average people, rather than just government-sponsored astronauts.However, it is to be noted that the aforementioned crew was still far from ‘average’, in the true sense of the word.The trip was sponsored by Jared Isaacman, billionaire and philanthropist with pilot training. He is the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of payment processor Shift4 Payments Inc, and was also the mission commander of the spaceflight, having chosen the rest of the crew himself through a competition.Isaacman was joined in the SpaceX mission by Hayley Arceneaux, a 29-year-old paediatric cancer survivor, now working as a physician assistant. Arceneaux also became the first person to fly to space with a prosthetic device—she lives with a rod implanted in her left leg as part of her treatment for bone cancer.Chris Sembroski, a US air force veteran who now works as an aerospace data engineer for Lockheed Martin in Seattle, was also part of the crew. The other member was Sian Proctor, a 51-year-old geoscientist in Phoenix, who was almost selected to become an astronaut for Nasa in 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-inspiration4-all-civilian-crew-land-back-safely-after-3-day-private-earth-circling-trip-101632010626913.html

It was felt widely, from neighboring cities such as Santa Monica, Torrance and Beverly Hills to the Antelope Valley an hour's drive north and south to Orange County and possibly beyond.The Marathon Petroleum refinery in Carson lost power and began burning off excess gases in a process known as flaring that sent flames into the sky and prompted calls from people concerned that there was a fire.“Flares are safety devices and the flares are functioning as intended. There are no injuries or off-site impact,” company spokesman Jamal Kheiry told the Los Angeles Times in an email.The Los Angeles Fire Department went into earthquake emergency mode, sending vehicles and helicopters to patrol its 470 square miles (1,217-square-kilometer) area but said it didn't receive any reports of “significant damage or injury," according to a department statement.Seismologist Lucy Jones told KCBS-TV that the quake “doesn't look abnormal at all."“This size happens on average somewhere in Southern California every couple of months," she said. “When it happens to be in the middle of the Los Angeles basin then a lot more people feel it and it becomes bigger news."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-injuries-as-4-3-magnitude-earthquake-rattles-los-angeles-101632008845857.html

"Their crimes do not justify the way they are being treated."Members of Congress were not in the building on Saturday as the rally unfolded under the watchful eye of police in riot gear with shields, with many lawmakers still on summer recess and not back in town until next week.Look Ahead America, which organized the event and is planning similar rallies across the country in the coming weeks, had appealed for attendees to show respect to law enforcement officers and refrain from bringing Donald Trump banners.But some carried signs that read "Free Biden's political prisoners" or "Justice for Ashli Babbitt," a woman who was shot dead by police on January 6 as she tried to breach the House of Representatives.- Four arrests made -Capitol Police said 400 to 450 people were inside the protest area, excluding law enforcement -- but that would include the numerous journalists on site.Daniel, a 35-year-old who only gave his first name, said he had a few friends who were being detained pending trial."I think they should release them," he said.Pointing at the Capitol, he added: "That's our Capitol, for taxpayers, so we're allowed to go in there when we want."Thousands of Trump's supporters, some associated with ultra-nationalist and white supremacist groups, stormed the US legislature eight months ago in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory.Around 600 have been charged, including at least 185 accused of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees and more than 70 indicted for destruction or theft of government property.Officials say the mob assaulted 140 officers, with damage to the Capitol complex estimated at $1.5 million.Four people were arrested Saturday near the Capitol, including two for weapons charges. Capitol Police also said they separated groups of protesters and counter-protesters without incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sparse-attendance-at-rally-in-support-of-us-capitol-rioters-101632007920300.html

"This will not do."A "serious crisis" was now in progress between the allies, he added.Le Drian was speaking a day after Paris, on the orders of President Emmanuel Macron, recalled its ambassadors to Canberra and Washington, an unprecedented act that revealed the extent of the anger in France over the rupture of the contract.He described the withdrawal of the ambassadors as a "very symbolic" act which aimed "to show how unhappy we are and that there is a serious crisis between us and to re-evaluate out positions to defend our interests.""The fact that for the first time in the history of relations between the United States and France we are recalling our ambassador for consultations is a serious political act, which shows the magnitude of the crisis that exists now between our countries," he said.He also issued a stinging response to a question over why France had not recalled its ambassador to Britain, when London was also part of the security pact that led to the rupture of the contrat."We have recalled our ambassadors to (Canberra and Washington) to re-evaluate the situation. With Britain there is no need. We know their constant opportunism. So there is no need to bring our ambassador back to explain," he said.Of London's role in the pact, he added: "Britain in this whole thing is a bit like the third wheel."NATO would have to take account of what has happened as it reconsiders strategy at a summit in Madrid next year, he added.France would make a priority now of developing a EU security strategy when it takes on the bloc's presidency at the start of 2022, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-accuses-australia-us-of-lying-in-serious-crisis-101632006744092.html

"They were not terrorists, and now it is clear for them and all the world to see," he said of his relatives.Haidari added that he wanted officials to "capture and prosecute" those responsible for firing the missile."Most of them had worked with Americans," Haidari said. "Naser had worked with Americans for about 10 years. My uncle had also worked with international organisations."At the time of his death Ahmadi was working for a US aid group.Haidari said all the victims had received evacuation papers and had hoped to go to the United States soon, like many Afghans eager to flee newly Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.- 'Intelligence was wrong' -On the night of the strike, Ahmadi pulled his car into his driveway before youngsters piled into the vehicle -- pretending the parking routine was an adventure -- while he watched from the side.A missile then came screeching down onto the car -- obliterating the lives of 10 people in an instant.The wreckage of the vehicle was still in the courtyard of the house on Saturday, alongside another burned-out vehicle.Broken glass was strewn across the ground and the tiny sandals of the young victims had been placed on the mangled chassis.US Central Command commander General Kenneth McKenzie said American intelligence had seen the vehicle at a site in Kabul that had been identified as a location from which IS operatives were believed to be preparing attacks on the Kabul airport.Three days earlier an Islamic State-Khorasan suicide bomber had killed scores at the airport, including 13 US service members."We selected this car based on its movement at a known target area of interest to us," McKenzie said."Clearly our intelligence was wrong on this particular white Toyota," he said.- 'America must compensate' -Defense secretary Austin said Ahmadi's activities that day were "completely harmless", and that the man was "just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed"."We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan," said Austin.Ahmadi's brother Aimal, whose three-year-old daughter Maleka died in the attack, said "America must compensate"."Today it was good news for us that United States officially admitted that they had attacked innocents civilians," he said. "Our innocence has been proven."We demand justice from international institutions... Then we want compensation."McKenzie said the US government was studying how payments for damages could be made to the families of those killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/relatives-of-afghan-family-killed-in-us-strike-want-face-to-face-apology-101632006549496.html

People must still wear masks indoors and maintain a distance of 1.5 metres if social distancing is not possible.However, mass drinking parties are still illegal and punishable with fines for taking part between 500 euros ($586.25) for minors and 600 euros ($703.50) for adults. Organisers face fines of up to 600,000 euros ($703,500.00) if a court judges it is an activity which puts public health at risk.There were other mass drinking parties in Barcelona and the northern Spanish city of Logroño on Friday night, authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/about-25-000-spanish-students-hold-macro-botellon-drinking-party-101632006317844.html

Once in orbit, they chatted with St. Jude patients, conducted medical tests on themselves, rang the closing bell for the New York Stock Exchange and dabbled in drawing and ukulele playing.It will be the first Atlantic splashdown by a returning space crew in more than 50 years. SpaceX's two previous crew splashdowns, with NASA astronauts, were in the Gulf of Mexico.SpaceX envisions up to six private flights a year, sandwiched between astronaut launches for NASA to the International Space Station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacexs-1st-tourists-homeward-bound-after-3-days-in-orbit-101632006172845.html
19-09-2021||World||France recalls envoys to Australia, US in standoff||France plunged into an unprecedented diplomatic crisis with the United States and Australia on Friday after it recalled its ambassadors from both countries over a trilateral security deal which sank a French-designed submarine contract with Canberra.The rare decision taken by French President Emmanuel Macron was made due to the “exceptional gravity” of the matter, foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement.On Thursday, Australia said it would scrap a $40-billion deal signed in 2016 for France’s Naval Group to build a fleet of conventional submarines and would instead build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines with U.S. and British technology after striking a trilateral security partnership.The abandonment of the ocean-class submarine project that Australia and France had been working on since 2016 constituted “unacceptable behaviour among allies and partners”, Le Drian said.“Their consequences affect the very concept we have of our alliances, our partnerships, and the importance of the Indo-Pacific for Europe,” he added.On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden announced the defence alliance which is widely seen as aimed at countering the rise of China.The move infuriated France, which lost the contract worth $36.5 billion when signed in 2016.Australia said on Saturday morning it regretted the recall, and that it valued the relationship with France and would keep engaging with Paris on other issues. “Australia understands France’s deep disappointment with our decision, which was taken in accordance with our clear and communicated national security interests,” a spokesperson for foreign affairs minister Marise Payne said in a statement.Payne and defense minister Peter Dutton are currently in the United States for annual talks with their U.S. counterparts and their first with President Joe Biden’s administration.French Ambassador to Australia Jean-Pierre Thebault said Australia never mentioned that the project could be scrapped.In an interview to Australian Broadcasting Corp., Thebault said, “We never were informed about any substantial changes. There were many opportunities and many channels. Never was such a change mentioned.”Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, however, rejected French criticism and said he had raised the possibility in talks with the French president that Australia might scrap the Naval Group deal.Morrison insisted he had told Macron in June that Australia had revised its thinking.“I made it very clear, we had a lengthy dinner there in Paris, about our very significant concerns about the capabilities of conventional submarines to deal with the new strategic environment we’re faced with,” he said in an interview on Friday. “I made it very clear that this was a matter that Australia would need to make a decision on in our national interest.”Expressing “regret” over the French envoy’s recall, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that France was a “vital ally” and that the United States would be engaged in coming days to resolve the differences.He added that the issue would be discussed “at the senior level”, including at the United Nations General Assembly next week, which both Le Drian and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will attend.Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby meanwhile acknowledged that telephone talks earlier between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and French counterpart Florence Parly showed “that there is still much work to do in terms of our defence relationship with France”.The French foreign ministry statement made no mention of Britain, but a diplomatic source said France considered Britain had joined the deal in an opportunistic manner.“We don’t need to hold consultations with our (British) ambassador to know what to make of it or to draw any conclusions,” the source added.The strain in multilateral ties comes as the United States and its allies seek additional support in Asia and the Pacific given concern about the rising influence of a more assertive China.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried on Thursday to calm the French outcry, calling France a vital partner in the region. France meanwhile called off a gala at its ambassador’s house in Washington scheduled for Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-recalls-envoys-to-australia-us-in-standoff-101631993088728.html

Imran Khan says country paid ‘heavy price’||A day after the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) called for an independent, terrorism-free, and peaceful state in Afghanistan, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that his country paid a “very heavy price” for siding with the US in its invasion in the now Taliban-captured nation.He also said that several remarks that have been made by US politicians, including the secretary of state Anthony Blinken, which blame Pakistan for the current situation in Afghanistan, has left Khan “deeply hurt.”“As a Pakistani, I felt deeply hurt by some of the remarks made by those senators. To blame Pakistan for this debacle in Afghanistan is the most painful thing for us to listen to,” Khan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI based on his interview with Russia’s TV network RT.Khan believes that committing Pakistan’s support to the American occupation of Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, though helped Pakistan secure US military aid, was still a wrong call.Also Read | At SCO meet, Modi says Afghanistan proof that radicalisation key challenge to peaceThe Pakistani premier further pointed out that after the American invasion in Afghanistan, and his country’s subsequent support of the same, alienated the mujahideen forces – which the Pakistani intelligence helped in building up only 20 years before as part of the US anti-Soviet campaign. “We have trained them to fight against foreign occupation. It was a holy war, a jihad,” Khan told RT, adding that with the Americans invading, the same Pakistan began telling these mujahideen forces that fighting the US troops was “terrorism.”“So, they (mujahideen forces) turned against us. They called us collaborators,” he said.Khan’s remarks come in the backdrop of Blinken being faced with a string of questions after the recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings where several US lawmakers blamed Pakistan for facilitating the Taliban. The lawmakers, regardless of being Democrat or Republican, called for severe action against Islamabad for its inflammatory role in the Taliban’s reoccupation in Afghanistan.Also Read | Antony Blinken says ties with Pakistan under review over AfghanistanFor instance, New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, Idaho Republican James Risch and Florida Republican Marco Rubio – all called for “understanding” Pakistan’s role in the current Afghanistan debacle. “We need to understand the double-dealing by Pakistan and providing a safe haven to the Taliban,” Menendez, who is also the chairman of the Foreign Relations committee said.Blinken, meanwhile, has given a message to Pakistan, telling it to “line up” with the broad majority of nations to force the Taliban regime to uphold the basic rights to Afghans, including women and children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-says-pak-paid-heavy-price-in-siding-with-us-in-afghanistan-invasion-101631989129609.html
19-09-2021||World||Outgunned and alone: How Panjshir's resistance fell to the Taliban||An old man in the Panjshir Valley sadly describes the last stand resistance fighters made against the Taliban's relentless sweep of Afghanistan: "There were too many of them."Leaning against the door of a closed shop in the village of Khenj, Abdul Wajeed said the group's forces massed in September at the mouth of the valley, north of the capital Kabul.The sight of dozens of armoured Taliban vehicles powering through the narrow gorge is burned into his memory."There was nothing more we could do," he said.For three days his village and the National Resistance Forces (NRF) -- a mix of Panjshiri fighters and remnants of the defeated national army -- had fired "with heavy weapons" from the rugged cliffs above the valley.The charred and twisted wrecks of more than a dozen Taliban vehicles are testimony to their intense struggle.But the hardline Islamists continued their relentless advance, emboldened by sweeping victories across the rest of the country and armed with an enormous weapons arsenal seized from the Afghan army.- Waves of attacks -"We were surprised, we did not know what to do," said one NRF fighter, who remains hidden in Panjshir. "We did not have enough weapons."In Malaspa, a farming village surrounded by lush fields, 67-year-old Khol Mohammad said the Islamists convoy had been so large it seemed like "a thousand vehicles full of Taliban" had swept in.Panjshir fighters earned a legendary reputation for resistance, defending their mountain homes first from the Soviet military for a decade, throughout the following civil war, and against the first Taliban regime from 1996-2001.The 115-kilometre (70-mile) valley surrounded by jagged snow-capped peaks offers defenders a natural advantage.But two decades since the late veteran fighter Ahmad Shah Massoud led the Panjshiris to victory, the province is no longer as isolated.On August 30 the Taliban launched a multi-pronged offensive -- with some residents claiming the Panjshiri fighters were outnumbered three-to-one.- Vintage rifles - Many of the Panjshiri guns were decades old, Taliban commander Mullah Sanaullah Sangin Fatih told AFP, as he showed off a huge cache of weapons and rockets he said was abandoned as resistance fighters fled."It dates mainly from the time of the Soviet occupation," Fatih said.That stands in stark contrast to the modern arsenal the Taliban had at their disposal.One Panjshiri fighter said the Islamists used a drone, "which enabled them to easily locate and bomb our positions".Multiple witnesses reported aerial bombardments, but it was not clear who carried them out.Some in Panjshir accuse neighbouring Pakistan of air strikes against them, claims Islamabad has rejected outright.Others criticise the lack of leadership, saying that the 32-year-old Ahmad Massoud -- the son of the legendary fighter -- lacked both experience and international backing.The other leader, ex-vice president Amrullah Saleh, did little to galvanise support."When he came in August to call on people to fight with him, the elders criticised him for never having done anything for Panjshir," a local journalist said.It is unclear what remains of the resistance, and whether its leaders are even still in the country.- Calm, for now - On September 6, the Taliban seized the Panjshir's capital of Bazarak and raised their white banner.Today, the valley appears calm, with Taliban rule going "well", according to several residents interviewed by AFP.As a sign of respect, the group have repaired the tomb of Ahmad Shah Massoud, which some of their fighters damaged when they seized Bazark.They say they want to bring "peace and security" to Panjshir, while continuing to hunt down remaining resistance fighters.But Khair Mohammad, an elder from Peshjrur village, said it reminded him of the Soviet occupation."It was exactly the same. They came, they told us at the beginning that we could be friends, and we said yes of course," he said with a smile."And you know what happened next."emd/mep/pjm/fox/rbu||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outgunned-and-alone-how-panjshir-s-resistance-fell-to-the-taliban-101631987448535.html
19-09-2021||India||India can achieve net zero carbon emissions target by 2065-70: Study||New DelhiIndia can achieve ‘net zero’ carbon emissions by 2065-70 as its greenhouse emissions will peak by 2035 and if it caps coal usage in the next 10 years, said a new study co-authored by the former vice-chairman of the erstwhile Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia. But he said this will also depend on rich countries doubling climate finance to US $200 billion per year in the next few years. The paper titled ‘Getting Net Zero Approach for India at CoP 26’ strongly advocates that India should declare its ‘net zero’ target year at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference or CoP 26 starting from October 31 in Glasgow, United Kingdom. It said that India’s traditional argument that it has to emit for its own development no more holds “diplomatic ground” as there are viable non-emitting energy alternatives available.Net zero is the state in which a country’s greenhouse emissions are removed from the atmosphere by carbon absorption or sequestration. This is the most hotly debated proposal for CoP 26 as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had said achieving net zero by 2050 was a must to keep global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to pre-industrial level by the end of 2100.India is now the fourth-largest emitter after China, United States and the European Union, and as per IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report released on August 9, it will be among the most severely affected countries. India has committed to reducing the emission intensity of its gross domestic product by 33-35% by 2030 and having 175 gigawatt renewable energy capacity by 2030 under the Paris Agreement of 2016. There is renewed pressure on India to enhance its renewable commitment under the Paris deal to 450 GW by 2030 and phase out coal.India’s environment minister Bhupendra Yadav, before going for the special UN meeting on climate change on Friday had said that net zero is not enough to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius. He said developed countries need to reduce emissions to provide carbon space to developing countries to exercise their right to grow and eradicate poverty.“While public announcements of 2050 as a net zero target date helps to focus public attention on the need to reduce emissions, it is important to recognise that having a common net zero emissions date for all countries is not the best way of tackling global warming,” the paper said. It said net zero target years can be given to countries based on the remaining available carbon budget with the least allocation to G20 (richest) countries, which account for close to three-quarters of global emissions. “A trajectory that gets to net zero by the time committed but exceeds the country’s carbon budget is much worse than following a trajectory which keeps within the budget but reaches net zero later,” the paper written for Centre for Social and Economic Progress said.Based on the above argument, the paper said that China and Indonesia have already announced that they will reach net zero by 2060. “The studies reviewed in this paper suggest that India could reach a peak around 2035 and get to net zero sometime between 2065 and 2070. We could offer something along these lines at CoP 26,” Ahluwalia said in the paper co-authored with Utkarsh Patel, who is an associate fellow at Centre for Social and Economic Progress, an independent public policy think tank. To achieve the net zero target, the paper said, India needs short-term decarbonisation targets along with trajectories for the next three decades. The best short term target, the study said, would be a planned phasing out of coal-based power generation as India has already adopted expanding renewable energy capacity to 450 GW by 2030. However, the Indian government has opposed phasing out coal saying it is needed for the country’s developmental imperatives.The paper outlined several implications for phasing out coal, including huge revenue loss for poorer Indian states such as Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. For states such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, close to 15% of the state revenue comes from the mining sector. Further, these states would lose out on employment, the paper said, as new employment in the renewable sector would be created in western and southern India which has better solar and wind resources.India has about 210 GW of coal-based capacity, 39 GW is under construction and another 25 GW is under different stages of approval. If the coal-based power plants have a life of 40 years, India will have the capacity to generate 200 GW thermal power by 2050 and achieving net zero status by 2070 will not be possible. “Reducing life of plants to 25 years can helping in achieving net zero,” Ahluwalia said.The close aide of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in the paper, strongly argued that India should not commit to a net zero target without enhanced international financial support, saying the IPCC’s assessment of $600 billion per year as the amount of additional energy sector investment needed in developing countries should be the starting point.He added that the finance could be divided into internet finance, private flow responding to market conditions, and additional bilateral and multi-lateral inflows. “The additional funding of around $100 billion per year through multi-lateral components should be a good starting point,” Ahluwalia said in the paper. The paper said that another US $ 100 billion can come from the private sector and market-based incentives such as carbon trading.Former special climate envoy Shyam Saran did not agree with Ahluwalia and said he was “pessimistic” that the funds could come from the developed countries to ease energy transition for developing countries.Saran, who has repeatedly advocated the traditional position that India should insist on emission reduction targets for the developing world, said any energy transition for the developing world would be costlier than the developed world as patents of almost all technologies are with the West. “The rich world has absolved itself from its climate responsibilities and passed on the buck to the developing world. Net zero is an example of that,” he said. Sunita Narain, director general of Centre for Science and Environment, said India should reject net zero targets put out by the West since they are flawed and inequitable for developing countries. “The target of 2050 is too far away. We need to keep our focus on 2030, with sharp and real targets. India should seek enhanced emission reduction from the developed world and finance for energy transition,” she said. “We need disruptive action, not disruptive technology.”Navroz Dubash of Centre for Policy Research said various studies have shown why net zero was important for India and it can achieve the target by 2065, which Ahluwalia said was equitable. “The emergence of new economic opportunities and technologies could dramatically change the landscape, and there may be space for an aspirational statement towards net zero. But given the information we have today, it would be gambling with the developmental future of India to lock ourselves into a hard net-zero deadline,” he had said in an article published in HT in March. Ahluwalia admitted that the approach could face resistance and economic gains should be considered. “There will be understandable resistance to making such a major break. However, the issue needs to be examined in the context of the enhanced warnings about the impact of global warming and the technological changes that have taken place which allow for making a shift to renewables, both feasible and economic,” he said.How much financing has come earlier?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-achieve-net-zero-carbon-emissions-target-by-2065-70-study-101632076022693.html

Asserting that his government had fulfilled every promise mentioned in the Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra in 2017, the chief minister said Uttar Pradesh witnessed a complete transformation from the past with welfare schemes now reaching the deserving and the state emerging as number two in the ease of doing business.“The scenario in the state has changed with the new model of governance and security. Uttar Pradesh attracted a large amount of investment after creating a secure environment. In 2018, the first investors’ summit was organised here. Today, businessmen and industrialists from across the world are eager to invest in UP. The state has made a big jump in the ease of doing business from the 14th to 2nd position. It has attracted investment worth ₹3 lakh crore,” he said. The chief minister also claimed that the state has remained free from any riots under his leadership, “unlike in the past when there used to be communal clashes every 3-4 days.” Gangsters, irrespective of their caste, community or religion, are severely dealt with, he added.Adityanath said his government was working for all classes and communities without any discrimination. The chief minister also hit out at the opposition, saying they were busy building their houses when they were in power and indulged in corruption for transfer and postings while the state was seen as a laggard in development and its image linked with riots.“Unlike them (previous governments), we did not make luxurious houses for ourselves. Our government focused on building houses for the poor,” he said, taking a veiled dig at his predecessor and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.Alleging that farmers were denied benefits of minimum support price (MSP) under the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and SP governments, Adityanath said the previous regime procured paddy and wheat through middlemen whereas the BJP government procured agriculture products directly from the farmers and credited the money into their accounts.The previous governments that were in power from 2007-17 paid ₹95,000 crore to sugarcane farmers whereas the BJP government disbursed ₹1.43 crore from 2017 to September 2021, the chief minister claimed. The chief minister also pointed out that the state’s Covid-19 management model was lauded across the country as well as worldwide, and UP’s positivity rate, fatality rate and active Covid cases were lowest in the country. UP tops the country in conducting sample tests and administering Covid vaccine doses, he said. Responding to Adityanath’s claims, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav tweeted: “The 16-page booklet published by the BJP government is 16 aane (hundred per cent) lies. It seems that the BJP government in UP has published the textbook of ‘international training centre for lies’. But the BJP’s ‘jhoot ke doot’ (messenger of lies) will only be able to run them in online classes as they are unable to go to the masses.” “Six months are left for this government, which has committed atrocities on farmers, poor, women and the youth through unemployment, inflation, hatred and slump in business. Do not want a government whose truth is ‘thug ka saath, thug ka vikas, thug ka vishwas, thug ka prayaas’ (support of cheats, progress of cheats, trust of cheats and efforts of cheats),” he added. BSP chief Mayawati tweeted: “The advertisement of transformation of four-and-half years is all gas and far from reality....there has been increase in poverty, unemployment and inflation, and the bad condition of the public is known to everyone.” UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu tweeted: “Enough of tall claims...But the BJP government was least bothered about people dying of illnesses, be it encephalitis, Covid, or mysterious fevers...This government hovers helicopter (all over the state), gets photo-ops and hides accountability by lying.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-adityanath-marks-4-5-years-of-his-government-says-bjp-will-win-350-seats-in-up-elections-101632075961851.html
19-09-2021||India||Uttarakhand polls: Kejriwal vows unemployment aid, job quota for local residents||Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday promised jobs for all in Uttarakhand and a new ministry that will specifically look after this if his party forms the next government in the state. He also promised a monthly income support of ₹5,000 for the unemployed youth till they land jobs. Kejriwal, who was on a day-long visit to Haldwani in Nainital, said his party will launch a scheme called Har Ghar Rozgar and provide 100,000 government jobs within six months of being elected to office. Of these, he said, 80% will be reserved for those domiciled in Uttarakhand. “An online job portal will be launched on the lines of Delhi. It will contain data on both the jobs provided and those who get jobs. When such a portal was started in Delhi, more than 1 million people got employment”, Kejriwal said.The Delhi CM also promised the creation of a ministry of employment and migration affairs in the state. “This separate department will make effective policies only for employment generation and checking of migration from the hill state,” he said. Taking a dig at the frequent change of chief ministers in the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state in the last few months, the AAP national convenor said if people vote for the BJP, they will get a new CM every month. “If they vote for AAP, they will get a CM who will give employment for five years,” he said. On the question of the feasibility of providing free power when the economic condition of Uttarakhand was weak, he said, “Government should have the will power. And we showed it by giving free electricity in New Delhi.” Kejriwal also said that there were good people in many parties, including the BJP and the Congress, who were feeling suffocated there. “Such good people were welcome in AAP, ‘’ he said. Later, Kejriwal took out a roadshow and also held a public meeting at Ramlila Maidan in Haldwani. This is Kejriwal’s third visit to the hill state this year. With less than a year left for the next state assembly elections, AAP is aggressively stepping up its poll preparations. Over the last eight to nine months, it has been attacking the ruling BJP on various issues like alleged corruption, unemployment, and health infrastructure. On his previous visit on August 17, Kejriwal announced Colonel Ajay Kothiyal’s (Retd) name as AAP’s chief ministerial candidate for the 2022 assembly polls and promised to make Uttarakhand the spiritual capital for the Hindus across the world if elected to power. Before that, when he visited on July 11, Kejriwal promised 300 units of free electricity to every household if AAP was elected to power here. Talking about replicating AAP’s Delhi model of governance in Uttarakhand, he had said that the party will bring a major change in the schools and health infrastructure. In July, the AAP state unit also launched ‘Kejriwal Muft Bijli Guarantee Card’ under which the party’s 10,000 workers will visit households in all the 70 assembly constituencies and urge residents to register for free electricity and give them the Kejriwal card as a token of guarantee for free power. Commenting on AAP’s Tiranga Yatra across Uttarakhand, Union minister of state (MoS) for defence Ajay Bhatt told news agency ANI: “Parties are coming to Uttarakhand and speaking their minds but let me tell this that the people there have made up their minds. They will give an opportunity to the Bharatiya Janata Party to serve the people again in the 2022 elections and the party will win with a huge majority.” Referring to the AAP’s promises of providing free water and electricity, Bhatt said the BJP is providing ration, Covid-19 vaccines, medicines and ventilators free of cost to the people of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-polls-kejriwal-vows-unemployment-aid-job-quota-for-local-residents-101632075722621.html
19-09-2021||India||The Week Ahead: A challenge for Congress; campaigning for Bengal assembly seats begins||A week is a long time in politics. Scratch that; two days are a long time in politics. Ask the Punjab political establishment. Captain Amarinder Singh, chief minister and, until a few months ago, someone who was seemingly strong despite the frequent and fervent attacks by fellow Congressman Navjot Singh Sidhu, had to quit his post. This week will see the installation of Charanjit Singh Channi as the state’s first Dalit-Sikh chief minister. The 58-year-old three-time MLA from Chamkaur Sahib was a surprise choice, and given the complexities of Punjab politics, a relative unknown on the national stage. It will be interesting to see who he appoints to his cabinet. Will the Captain’s ministers return? Or, as it happened in Gujarat with BJP’s new chief minister, will the old guard be completely sidelined?The Congress will definitely be tested this week, and developments in other Congress-governed states, too, will be closely watched by political observers.Others states too have an action-packed week ahead. The Monsoon session of the Karnataka legislature will see a crucial bill to ban online gambling and wagering. It is most likely to be passed during this session itself. A bill for delimitation and reservations to be transferred from the state election commission to the government will be put forward in the Karnataka High Court on Monday.Veteran BJP leader BS Yediyurappa is slated to hold discussions with the party’s state unit over the 78-year-olds state-wide travel plans ahead of the 2023 assembly election. Panchamasali, the biggest sub sect within the Lingayats, had given a deadline to the government over change of reservation. The group has threatened to revive its agitation from October 1.In West Bengal, the campaign for the much-anticipated Jangipur and Samserganj assembly seats starts on Monday, and the polls are to be held on September 30.Assam said it will resume physical classes for Standard 10 from Monday after a gap of four months. The state government had earlier allowed resumption of classes for final year students of graduation, post-graduation and higher-secondary from the first week of this month. Union minister and former Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal will file nomination papers as BJP candidate for Rajya Sabha seat from Assam on September 21. One RS seat is vacant following the resignation of Biswajit Daimary, who is now a BJP MLA and the Speaker of state assembly. Sonowal, who represents Majuli assembly seat, is expected to win easily as Congress has decided not to field any candidate due to shortage of numbers. In Rajasthan, too, regular school classes of VI to VIII standard students will resume from September 20 and that of Class I to V from September 27 in government and private schools, as per the fresh guidelines issued by the Rajasthan government on Friday. The classes can be conducted with 50% capacity In Tamil Nadu, candidates will be filing their nominations — the last date being September 22 – for the local body elections schedule for October 6 and 9. The local polls will be conducted in newly carved nine district in Tamil Nadu. Meanwhile the new Governor for the state, RN Ravi was sworn in on Saturday.In Chhattisgarh, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is likely to visit Bastar and northern Chhattisgarh this week amid speculation over change of chief minister Bupesh Baghel. The speculation intensified after Punjab CM Amarinder Singh was asked to resign.In Kerala, the state’s sero prevalence study is expected by next week. Since schools are opening, the government asked concerned bodies to submit its report. The government plans to call an all-party meeting on September 24 in the wake of wars of words triggered after the Pala Bishop’s narcotics jihad statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-week-ahead-a-challenge-for-congress-campaigning-for-bengal-assembly-seats-begins-101632075007566.html
19-09-2021||India||‘Need to put in efforts to win state elections’: Yediyurappa||Former Karnataka chief minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader BS Yediyurappa on Sunday tried to clarify his earlier remarks that the Modi wave alone will not help win elections in the state.“Let us not be under some notion. In the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it is very easy to win the Lok Sabha elections. But we should put in efforts and by helping development works reach the people we should win the elections,” Yediyurappa said on Sunday in Davangere, about 260 kilometres from Bengaluru.The statements come at a time when Karnataka is preparing for several elections like zilla and taluk panchayats, MLC polls and other bypolls in the coming year under chief minister Basavaraj Bommai.The Bharatiya Janata Party in Karnataka has seen significant changes in leadership with Yediyurappa forced to step down and Bommai taking his place as chief minister, much to the discontent of several seniors in the party who were overlooked for the top job.The BJP has intensified its outreach to muster support from the grassroot-level workers in a bid to strengthen its base ahead of the 2023 assembly elections. Several leaders of the saffron outfit spoke in the BJP working committee meeting in Davangere.He added that the party should be strengthened by bringing in more leaders from the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and other backward classes into the BJP fold that would help strengthen the party and the organisation.Yediyurappa asked BJP legislators and leaders not to take the opposition parties lightly.He said that the opposition parties have their own calculations and strength.It is no secret that Yediyurappa and the BJP’s national leadership under Modi and Amit Shah was strained and the latter being forced out two years before his term could end.Speaking to reporters later, Yediyurappa said that the meaning of what he said was that the party should win 140 plus seats (in 2023) based on the blessings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and our own special efforts.He also said that state Congress president DK Shivakumar was trying to contact BJP legislators and that there was no chance of anyone from the saffron fold leaving.He said that the chances of Congress leaders coming to the BJP was higher.Yediyurappa is also planning to undertake a state-wide tour to build the party which has added to apprehensions of the BJP’s top leadership which has so far been unable to replace the stature of the 78-year-old.Yediyurappa has built his career on caste-based politics as against the BJP which is trying to infuse Hindutva, adding to the contrasting approaches to help the saffron outfit return to power.People aware of the developments said that the BJP is anxious about Yediyurappa’s upcoming tour.However, Arun Singh, the national general secretary of the BJP, incharge of Karnataka on Sunday said that Yediyurappa does not need any green signal from the party for his tour. “There is no need for a green signal. BS Yediyurappa is the tallest leader amongst all parties in the state. If he tours (the state), it will be beneficial for the party and inspire workers,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-put-in-efforts-to-win-state-elections-yediyurappa-101632073804971.html

Harish Rawat explains||Amarinder Singh had no deputy when he led the Congress government in Punjab, but new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi will have two deputy chief ministers, the Congress has decided as the party is readying a team for the upcoming assembly election. Even before the name of Charanjit Singh was announced on Sunday, it was decided that the new Cabinet will have two deputy chief ministers. An ANI report claimed that one will be Hindu and the other will be a Sikh.Congress leader said the decision to appoint two deputy chief ministers in Punjab was taken as it was felt necessary. "Our mutual feeling is that there should be two deputy CMs. Soon we will take a call on it along with names for the Council of Ministers...Some names have been discussed but it's the CM's prerogative who discusses it with party high command and takes a call," Harish Rawat told ANI.The CM pick of the Congress has been done after much calculation and keeping nothing but the election in mind, experts have said. Charanjit Singh Channi's appointment will allow the party to play the Dalit card in the state where at least 30 per cent of the population is Dalit, counting both Sikhs and Hindus. "The opposition BJP had earlier announced that if voted to power in Punjab, it will make a Dalit the chief minister, while the Shiromani Akali Dal -- which is fighting the polls in alliance with the BSP -- had said that its deputy CM would be from that community," A PTI report said.Amid speculations that Charanjit Singh Channi may not be the chief minister face in the upcoming election, Harish Rawat said, “The party's face for theupcoming election will be decided by Congress president. Given the circumstances, elections will be fought with CM's cabinet under Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, whose chief is Navjot Singh Sidhu. He is very popular.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-will-charanjit-singh-channi-have-two-deputies-harish-rawat-explains-101632071811425.html
19-09-2021||India||'Well done, Rahul': BJP's 'Me Too' swipe over Charanjit Singh Channi||The BJP on Sunday took a swipe at the Congress over its Punjab chief ministerial pick Charanjit Singh Channi, citing reported allegations that he had sent an inappropriate text to an IAS officer in 2018.BJP leader Amit Malviya, who is its IT department head, tweeted, "Congress's CM pick Charanjit Channi faces action in a 3-year-old MeToo case. He had allegedly sent an inappropriate text to a woman IAS officer in 2018. It was covered up but the case resurfaced when Punjab Women's Commission sent notice. Well done, Rahul."The issue had resurfaced in May this year when Punjab women panel chief threatened to go on a hunger strike if the state government failed to apprise her within a week of its stand on the “inappropriate text” message allegedly sent by Channi, who was then a minister in the Amarinder Singh government.Punjab Women Commission chairperson Manisha Gulati had said she had written to the chief secretary seeking the government’s action taken report.Malviya also posted a story reported in May this year that said that outgoing chief minister Amarinder Singh's rivals within the party had accused him of "hounding" them with old cases.In another tweet, the BJP leader said, "In the last few days, Congress in Rajasthan passed a bill to register child marriages, giving it legitimacy and robbing young girls of their growing up years, and now has elevated a MeToo accused as CM of Punjab. Let’s wait for Rahul Gandhi to pontificate on women empowerment."Following the 2018 allegation against Channi, the Punjab Women Commission had taken suo motu cognisance of the matter and had sought the government’s stand even then.At that time, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had asked Channi to tender an apology to the woman officer and had said he believed the matter has been “resolved” to her satisfaction.Channi was elected the leader of the Congress Legislature Party in Punjab on Sunday and will be the next chief minister, succeeding Amarinder Singh who resigned a day ago following a bitter power tussle in the state unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/well-done-rahul-bjp-s-me-too-swipe-over-charanjit-singh-channi-101632070163536.html

Nitin Gadkari has a concern for middle-class car owners||Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday said small cars should have adequate safety measures as a large number of lower middle-class people buy these cars. He also expressed his concern about automakers providing eight airbags in large cars which are brought by people who fall under the higher-income category.The Union minister of road transport and highways while speaking to news agency PTI also appealed to automakers to include more airbags in small cars and said his appeal was to ensure safety and prevent deaths due to car accidents.The Union minister said that the poor and middle-class in the country also deserve ‘adequate protection’.Gadkari’s remarks come after the automobile industry raised issues that high taxes and stricter safety and emission norms for vehicles have made cars more expensive. “Mostly, lower middle-class people buy small economy cars and if their car won't have airbags and when accidents happen, then it may result in deaths. So, I appeal to all car manufacturers to provide a minimum of six airbags across all variants and segments of the vehicle,” the Union minister said.“For rich people, you (referring to automakers) offer eight airbags and for economy model cars which are used by lower middle-class people, you will offer only two-three airbags. How come?,” Gadkari asked. He however acknowledged that adding airbags will increase car costs by at least ₹3,000 - ₹4,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-only-2-3-airbags-nitin-gadkari-has-a-concern-for-middle-class-car-owners-101632070115247.html

19-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Sept 20, 2010 — India in big boys’ league||Bombay – There are times when pluck and grit collude to transport a player to a different plane. In sport there exists an exalted realm where only the fortunate few dwell on a regular basis, Years of sweat and pain, however, do force the Gods of sport to, once in a rare while open a gateway for the journeymen too, On Sunday, Rehan Bopanna walked through the door of Davis Cup greatness to display a brand of tennis that only the gifted can conjure. India barged through to the World Group on the wings of a man possessed, The 3-2 victory was sculpted by Somdev Devvarman first grinding down the resolve of Thomaz Bellucei 7-6 (3), 4-0 (conceded), Then came Bopanna, who hammered out a masterpiece in power tennis by blitzing past Ricardo Mello 6-3, 7-6 (2), 6-3 in two Hours. The sun shone bright in Chennai today, the layout of the stadium here does not allow any breeze to waft close to the court. Out there in the middle, it was a cauldron of dizzying heat sapping humidity. The Brazilians wilted. For the first time ever in its 89-year Davis Cup history (first tie played in 1921), India came back from a 0-2 deficit. The feat has been managed only 45 times in the 110-year history of the event. The Indian think tank’s strategic call to host the tic in this city finally came good. But lest this incredible achievement be construed an outcome of the elements conspiring, it needs to be asserted that it was actually all about one man coming to terms with his demons. Tennis is a sport of the mind. Strong will alone allows for the nerves to be steadied enough to unleash skill in the face of pressure. Very, very few players can actually regroup after the kind of debilitating five-set loss that Bopanna suffered on Friday. To bury that negativity and come back to shoulder the expectations of a nation in such dazzling fashion speaks of rare mettle. Bopanna was never broken. He broke Mello twice – both times at 2-1 in the first and third sets. Too many times in the past has he been on the cusp of delivering only to let his own serve slip away. Not today. In both his matches Bopanna was a tough riddle for the Brazilians. Devavarman’s effort was aided by a severely dehydrated Bellucci losing his resolve in the heat. But by the time he conceded the match, the Indian had already asserted his dominance by taking charge of the first set tiebreak and then breaking Bellucci twice in the second. India will now face one of the fifteen other nations in the elite group next March. If these guys play the way they did today, there is enough reason to paint India’s chances with a bright flourish of hope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-in-big-boys-league-101632065460090.html
19-09-2021||India||Amarinder Singh extends best wishes to Charanjit Singh Channi, says he is sad for another reason||Congress leader Amarinder Singh extended his best wishes to Charanjit Singh Channi, the chief minister-designate of Punjab after the Congress announced his name on Sunday, a day after Amarinder stepped down from the post. Amarinder said that he was sad because he won't be able to personally hand over the job letters to the kin of 150 farmers who lost their lives during farmers' protests. "Hope CM-designate Charanjit S Channi will do needful at the earliest. I continue to stand with farmers in fight for justice," the outgoing chief minister said. Channi will take oath on Monday at 11am."My best wishes to Charanjit Singh Channi. I hope he's able to keep the border state of Punjab safe and protect our people from the growing security threat from across the border," the Congress leader said.As Amarinder Singh resigned on Saturday expressing how humiliated he felt by whatever happened within Punjab Congress in the last few months, he emphasised that he will oppose if the Congress chooses Navjot Sidhu as the chief minister. By picking Charanjit Singh Channi, the Congress has, however, averted another immediate crisis.While the Captain is unsure about his future political plans, Union minister Ramdas Athawale has extended an invitation to him and the BJP is all praises for a ‘nationalist leader’ like Singh. "I would like to ask Captain Amarinder Singh what is the use of staying in a party which has humiliated you. I request him to leave the Congress party and join the NDA-led by Narendra Modi," Athawale said."His dedication for the country is respectable. What is said is true; for us all, the nation comes first and party second. Whatever Captain said is right, I appreciate his feelings for the country," BJP Punjab in charge, Dushyant Gautam said during a telephonic interview with ANI.Amarinder Singh's resignation was precipitated by the ongoing internal conflict in the Punjab Congress, which could not be tackled even after Navjot Sidhu was made the president of the state party unit. While the Captain lost the support of 60 MLAs, he claimed that people were happy with his government and he did not understand why the Congress felt the need to bring in the change in the leadership with a few months left before the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-extends-best-wishes-to-charanjit-singh-channi-says-he-is-sad-for-another-reason-101632063280597.html

Further, health experts will discuss the issues with district collectors and arrangements would be made to address the concerns of both students and parents, the minister said. “The plan will include the provision of masks, sanitisers and social distance adjustments when children arrive at school, as well as things to be observed in vehicles used for transporting children,” he added.Earlier on Saturday, following a review meeting of the core committee on Covid-19 pandemic chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the state government had decided to reopen schools in the state from November 1 for classes one to seven and also for classes 10 and 12. The chief minister had directed to reopen all classes by November 15, his office had informed. “The department of education and the department of health should hold a joint meeting to make the necessary preparations for the reopening of the schools,” the CMO said. Also, children with weakened immunity systems do not have to attend physical classes.Notably, the Kerala government had decided a few weeks ago that the higher educational institutions in the state would be reopened from October 4. It had also mandated at least one dose of the vaccine for students before entering the premises and urged teachers, staff and students to be fully vaccinated before returning to campuses.On Sunday, the state saw 19,653 new Covid-19 infections and 152 deaths, taking the state’s death toll to 23,591, news agency ANI reported.

19-09-2021||India||Mufti says BJP using Taliban, Afghanistan issues to garner votes||Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of using the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan for political reasons and in order to gain votes. The People’s Democratic Party president said that the BJP rakes up issues related to Afghanistan and Pakistan but does not mention the Galwan valley clashes with neighbouring China.“They will not talk about China which has intruded into Ladakh because they do not get votes by talking about that country. If you want to frighten people, talk about Taliban, Afghanistan and Pakistan and do something here and there and seek votes,” Mufti said while addressing a rally organised by the youth wing of her party in Srinagar. She added that the BJP will start cashing on the ‘God-given’ opportunity presented by the Taliban in Afghanistan to win votes as elections in several states draw nearer.She also criticised the Uttar Pradesh government led by chief minister Yogi Adityanath and said that it failed to provide employment to youth and infrastructure to its citizens. She also claimed that people of the state were forced to dump bodies of their loved ones in the ‘sacred’ Ganga as they lacked resources to cremate them.She also claimed that the BJP will use the Jammu and Kashmir issue to win elections. “They do not have anything to sell to the people and therefore they will use Pakistan and J-K to garner votes. They have destroyed J-K and are using sticks to oppress the people who are not allowed to speak openly for their rights,” Mufti said. She also alleged that the BJP will listen closely as to what she said in the rally and use it against her.Mufti said that the BJP has put the nation and democracy in danger. “Jammu and Kashmir is in trouble and so is the entire country. They say Hindus are in danger but they are not in danger and in fact it is India and the democracy which are in danger because of them,” Mufti added. Mufti reached Jammu on Saturday after finishing a five-day tour of Poonch and Rajouri districts. She faced a small protest by a group of Rashtriya Bajrang Dal activists. They attempted to stop her cavalcade near Dogra chowk, which police forces foiled.Mehbooba also batted for self-rule of Jammu and Kashmir and said that the Union Territory is placed at a position which can be beneficial for trade. She claimed that if the Union Territory achieves self-rule then neighbouring countries can open ‘bank branches’ in Jammu and Kashmir.“Jammu and Kashmir holds a strategic position and can be a gateway to central Asia if all the cross-border traditional routes are opened and all the neighbouring countries allowed to open bank branches which will generate employment,” Mufti said. She also said that the party is raising fuel prices to fill their ‘coffers’ and ‘intimidate and buy’ opposition MLAs.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mufti-says-bjp-using-taliban-afghanistan-issues-to-garner-votes-101632058167395.html

Punjab Congress president Navjot Sidhu's name also came up, but insiders indicate that he will be the CM face for the Congress in the Punjab assembly election, while the new CM might have to be in the post only for the time being.Charanjit Singh Channi is the first Dalit chief minister of Punjab. He belongs to the Ramdasia Sikh community. Insiders said the combination of both these factors that Charanjit Singh Channi is a Dalit and a Sikh worked in favour of him in the last leg of the race. And that's why the party's last-minute calculation surprised all speculation when Harish Rawat announced Channi's name as the new chief minister.Who is Punjab CM-elect Charanjit Singh Channi?A Sikh face is important for the Punjab chief minister post. In fact, Punjab has never had a non-Sikh chief minister. This is the reason that Ambika Soni cited for rejecting the proposal from Rahul Gandhi. Another unofficial but important requirement to handle the top job in Punjab at present is to be in tandem with Navjot Singh Sidhu in which too Charanjit Singh Channi finally emerged as a safe bet, insiders said. Some reports indicated that Sidhu was not too happy with the proposal of Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa as the CM.In addition, Charanjit Singh Channi has an impressive academic and political career. He is a law graduate and an MBA and has taken care of the technical education ministry. He is also a three-time MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dalitsikh-face-sidhu-s-yes-what-worked-in-favour-of-charanjit-singh-channi-101632057287513.html

19-09-2021||India||‘Good opportunity for public welfare’: Babul Supriyo after joining Trinamool||Former Union minister Babul Supriyo on Sunday thanked Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee for giving him a chance in the “playing 11", a day after he left the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for West Bengal's ruling party."I thank Mamata didi, Abhishek Banerjee and TMC for giving me a chance in the 'playing 11'," the singer-turned-politician said, a day after he was inducted into the Trinamool Congress by party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien.The former Union minister of state for environment, who was stripped off his portfolio during the recent Cabinet reshuffle at the Centre, had announced to “quit” politics in July. However, he later decided not to reliquish his membership of the Parliament.The sitting MP from West Bengal's Asansol constituency was miffed at the BJP for dropping him as the Cabinet minister, months after his humiliating defeat in the assembly elections against Trinamool's Aroop Biswas for the Tollygunge seat. At that time, the MP had taken to Facebook to unleash a rant on the people of the state for their voting choice – even saying that the citizens made a “historic mistake” by not giving the BJP a chance and bringing back “the cruel lady (Mamata Banerjee) to power.” He, however, deleted the post later.Talking about his decision to join the Trinamool Congress, of which he had been a vocal critic of, Babul Supriyo said he has been in politics for seven years now and felt it was a good opportunity for public welfare.ALSO READ | ‘Wait and watch’: TMC says more leaders to join after Babul Supriyo’s entryHours after Babul Supriyo joined the Trinamool Congress, the ministry of home affairs downgraded his paramilitary security cover from Z to Y category.Babul Supriyo engaged in a verbal spat with his former party colleagues Swapan Dasgupta and Tathagata Roy after joining the Trinamool Congress. Rajys Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta earlier in the day tweeted, criticising the minister for “tearing hurry” while remarking that “he may end up damaging his own image.”Did I create history by shifting sides?Well, then all the ‘Rivals’ who joined BJP, were embraced&made to sit on top posts ignoring all those ‘real’ BJP grass-root fighters shud be dumped cuz they may have all spoiled their images(like u said I did)tarnishing BJP’s image•Right?🙏Responding to the tweet, the Asansol MP reorted that the same must then be true of the 'outsiders' who joined the BJP and were given top posts earlier this year. He rued that the BJP sidelined its grassroots workers to make room for ‘rivals’ who defected to the party.The turncoat MP also took a dig at former Bengal governor and BJP leader Tathagata Roy on Twitter for calling him a 'traitor'. I think you have the right to disagree with me on many counts & u can criticise me as much as you want but why is lingo ‘Dadu’? Is it to stay in news? U earn the right to hate my decision only when u understand that you will have to respect it too•That’s the thumb ruleOn Saturday, Roy posted on Twitter that “traitors have put the BJP at a precarious position in Bengal” but “Babul Supriyo is neither the first traitor nor the last one.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-opportunity-for-public-welfare-babul-supriyo-after-joining-trinamool-101632050943615.html
19-09-2021||India||Jaishankar meets Saudi counterpart, says ‘very useful exchange of views on Afghanistan’||The developments in Afghanistan and other regional issues figured in discussions on Sunday between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his visiting Saudi Arabian counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan al Saud.Prince Faisal is the first Saudi minister to visit India since the Covid-19 pandemic began last year. Strategic and security cooperation between the two countries has grown in recent years and they held their first naval exercise in August.“Very useful exchange of views on Afghanistan, the Gulf and the Indo-Pacific,” Jaishankar said in a tweet after the meeting. He added that he and Prince Faisal had discussed “cooperation in the political, security and socio-cultural pillars of our strategic partnership”.India has urged the world community not to rush into recognising the Taliban set up in Kabul, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointing out last week that the new regime in Afghanistan is not inclusive and was formed without negotiations.The discussions between the two ministers on Sunday will help shape the way forward in Afghanistan, including the issue of recognising the setup created by the Taliban after they took over the country on August 15.Prince Faisal had recently said Saudi Arabia hopes the Taliban’s interim cabinet will help Afghanistan to achieve stability and overcome violence and extremism. He also said that Saudi Arabia will support “the choices the Afghan people make regarding the future of their country, away from external interference”.The external affairs ministry said in a statement the two ministers also discussed all issues related to bilateral relations and regional and international issues of mutual interest. They reviewed the implementation of the Strategic Partnership Council Agreement signed by the two sides during PM Modi’s visit to Saudi Arabia in October 2019. “They expressed satisfaction at the meetings held under the Agreement and progress achieved. Both sides discussed further steps to strengthen their partnership in trade, investment, energy, defence, security, culture, consular issues, health care and human resources,” the statement said.The ministers also discussed bilateral cooperation at multilateral forums such as the UN, G20 and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).Jaishankar tweeted that he had urged Prince Faisal for the “early resumption of direct flights to Saudi Arabia”, and that the two sides had agreed to “work closely on all Covid-related challenges, including to travel”.The external affairs ministry said Jaishankar had appreciated Saudi Arabia’s support for the Indian community during the pandemic and urged Saudi Arabia to further relax restrictions on travel from India.In addition to being one of India’s largest energy suppliers, Saudi Arabia is home to 2.6 million Indians, the largest expatriate community in the kingdom and one of the biggest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia.Last month, Saudi Arabia relaxed travel restrictions for Indians who have received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine in the kingdom. Under new guidelines, Indians who travel to India after receiving both doses in Saudi Arabia will be able to directly return to the kingdom without having to quarantine in a third country. The move benefited Indians who work in Saudi Arabia and were stuck in the country because of strict travel restrictions.Prince Faisal is scheduled to meet the prime minister on Monday before he departs for New York to participate in the UN General Assembly session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-meets-saudi-counterpart-says-very-useful-exchange-of-views-on-afghanistan-101632051960824.html
19-09-2021||India||9 yrs after arrest over CM Banerjee’s cartoon, Kolkata professor fears new case||Nine years after he was arrested for allegedly forwarding a cartoon on chief minister Mamata Banerjee, then junior Union railway minister Mukul Roy and his predecessor in office Dinesh Trivedi to members of the email group at his housing society in the southern outskirts of Kolkata, Jadavpur University professor Ambikesh Mahapatra found on September 14 that his legal battle with the state was far from over. Though charges under a defunct section of the Information Technology Act was dropped, the trial court said it will continue to hear the case because the de facto complainant, a Kolkata citizen, intends to press charges of defamation and insult to the modesty of a woman, who, in his case is the chief minister who has so far taken no legal step. Following their arrest in April 2012 by the East Jadavpur police station, Mahapatra, a chemistry professor, and Subrata Sengupta, then a septuagenarian retired engineer, were accused in the 2013 charge-sheet under Section 66A (b) and (c) of the of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Sengupta, who was secretary of the housing society in New Garia, was additionally charged under Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which pertains to aiding and abetting in a criminal act. Though both were released on bail hours after the arrest, the police action triggered a stir since it was the first of its kind in West Bengal. Opposition parties, intellectuals, rights groups and citizens raised their voice, pointing out that the cartoon’s theme was based on a line from the script of Sonar Kella, the first movie Satyajit Ray made in the 1970s on Pradosh Mitter, the iconic detective he created for children. The child protagonist in Ray’s story was also named Mukul. Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders countered the arguments, saying the cartoon was circulated with mala fide intention. While Section 66A of the IT Act was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015 in the Shreya Singhal vs. Union of India case, as unconstitutional, the ground reality, however, did not change for the two accused in the cartoon case. Sengupta, who was ailing and had to undergo a kidney surgery, died in 2019 at the age of 80, two years after moving the Calcutta high court to seek quashing of the charges. The court passed an interim order in his favour while hearings continued in the trial court. Current case statusOn September 14, while hearing Mahapatra’s petition for discharge, Subrata Mukherjee, the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) of Kolkata’s Alipore court, where the case is being heard, dropped the charge under Section 66A of the IT Act. “…. I am of the humble view that the striking down of the provisions of Section 66 A of the IT Act in Shreya Singhal’s case has a retrospective effect and therefore applies to all pending proceedings as well and the accused Ambikesh Mahapatra deserves to be discharged from the charge…..” the magistrate said in the order. He also cited a Union home ministry instruction that asked the states in July this year to drop all cases filed under Section 66A. HT has seen a copy of the Alipore court order. “The court did not let me go although the sole charge against me was dropped,” said Mahapatra. After hearing the lawyers of Amit Sardar, the de facto complainant, the CJM ordered that the case will be heard again in November to consider “whether any case under Section 500/509 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or any other law can be made out against the accused” or, whether Mahapatra deserves to be discharged from the case. While Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) pertains to defamation, Section 509 recommends imprisonment of up to three years as well as fine for insulting the modesty of a woman. “Although Sections 500 and 509 were mentioned in the initial police complaint filed in April 2012, these were dropped from the charge-sheet submitted in court a year later. Sardar now wants to press these charges. They can neither be argued nor proved unless Mamata Banerjee’s statement is recorded,” said Sanjib Ganguly, Mahapatra’s lawyer at the Alipore court. In his order, the CJM said the de facto complainant had earlier filed a protest petition challenging the charge-sheet but it was dismissed by another judge in July 2015 after which no hearing took place. “…from the order dated July 16, 2015, it becomes clear that the learned magistrate held that the opportunity of hearing must be given to the prosecution/de facto complainant to show or to argue that a case under section 509 IPC can be made out against the accused,” the CJM’s order said. A lawyer representing Sardar said on condition of anonymity that the CJM’s order can be challenged in higher court. “We do not agree that the Supreme Court’s order on Section 66A of the IT Act has a retrospective effect,” he told HT. Sardar, who resides in the Nayabad area located along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass could not be contacted despite several efforts. TMC legislator Tapas Roy, who is also a lawyer, said, “One cannot pass any comment on the decisions of a magistrate.” Moving human rights commission and Calcutta high court “I do not know how many years I have to visit the courts. Sengupta and I moved the West Bengal Human Rights Commission (WBHRC) in 2012 alleging unlawful arrest and violation of liberty. In August that year, the WBHRC granted us a compensation of ₹50,000 each and recommended departmental proceedings against two officers of East Jadavpur police station. We moved the Calcutta high court in 2013 after the state government rejected the WBHRC’s recommendations,” said Mahapatra. “After hearing us and the government for one year, justice Dipankar Dutta of the Calcutta high court passed an order in March 2015. He upheld the WBHRC’s order and asked the state to pay us an additional cumulative sum of ₹50,000 to cover legal expenses. The government moved a division bench challenging the order but no hearing has taken place till now,” Mahapatra added. HT saw a copy of justice Dipankar Dutta’s 60-page order. “I am also convinced that it was not WBHRC but the police administration that was squarely responsible for blowing the incident out of proportion. Officers of the police administration ought to realise that the time is not far away when they may have to pay a heavy price for unwarranted, uncalled for and unjustified invasion of human rights of the people at large,” justice Dutta said in his concluding remarks. What expert sayEminent advocate and CPI(M) Rajya Sabha member Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, who represented the accused at the Calcutta high court, said, “It is unfortunate that the idiocy of the issue has gone to this level. Application of Sections 500 and 509 of IPC means the allegedly affected individual has to file a complaint but neither Mamata Banerjee nor anybody representing her in court has done that.” A constitutional expert and former principal of Kolkata’s Presidency College, Dr Amal Mukherjee said, “I know Ambikesh. I am sure his purpose was not to insult anyone. He shared a cartoon just for fun. Right to this freedom is protected under Article 19 of the Constitution. The fact that he was arrested shows that we are not living in a democracy in West Bengal.” “When I was the principal of Presidency College during the Left Front regime I used to write a column for a newspaper. I made fun of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, Left Front chairman Biman Bose and other leaders. I also made funny remarks about Indian gods and goddesses. Nobody ever said a word,” said Mukherjee. Noted human rights activist Sujato Bhadra, a former secretary of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, said he sees the action against Mahapatra as an act of revenge. “Mahapatra was harassed. Those who shout about human rights violations in other states are encouraging Fascist practices on home ground. The government should apologise to Mahapatra. Even Nehru used to say that if cartoons on him stopped appearing it would mean he was losing popularity. Cartoons are an integral part of politics,” Bhadra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-yrs-after-arrest-over-cm-banerjee-s-cartoon-kolkata-professor-fears-new-case-101632051599350.html

Hours before the meeting, Amarinder Singh resigned and expressed anguish over the recent developments. Apart from Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, the names of former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa came up for consideration. While Sunil Jakhar is not an MLA and Congress MPs were not in favour of Jakhar, Bajwa's relationship with Sidhu is not cordial. Sidhu's name was also doing the rounds but an offer was made to Ambika Soni by Rahul Gandhi. Ambika Soni rejected the offer as she thinks Punjab CM should be a Sikh leader.

19-09-2021||India||Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa's name proposed as next Punjab chief minister: Report||The Congress has proposed the name of Punjab Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Randhawa as the next chief minister, news agency ANI reported citing sources. However, no decision has been taken yet as a discussion is going on at the resident of Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi with Ambika Soni present at the meeting, the report said. This follows the meeting of the Punjab MLAs on Sunday, a day after Amarinder Singh resigned following months of turmoil in the state party unit. Congress MLA Pritam Kotbhai told ANI all MLAs have named Sukhjinder Randhawa's name for CM before the Congress high command and he will become the chief minister. Sukhjinder Randhawa is a Punjab state cabinet minister in charge of jails and cooperatives. Interacting with media persons in between meetings on Sunday, Sukhjinder Randhawa said he never hankered after any post. Taking a dig at Amarinder Singh, the former chief minister, Sukhjinder said, "A chief minister remains (in his post) only till the time when his party, people of the state stand by him."The 62-year-old Congress leader is a three-time MLA and presently represents Dera Baba Nanak assembly constituency. His father Santokh Singh served as Punjab Congress chief twice. Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa has also remained in the post.The Congress Legislature Party on Saturday met and requested Sonia Gandhi to choose the next chief minister. An offer went to Congress leader Ambika Soni from Rahul Gandhi at a late-night development on Saturday, which Ambika Soni rejected stating that the party needs a Sikh face as Punjab CM.Former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar was among the frontrunners but reports said that Punjab MPs were not in favour of making Jakhar the chief minister. Plus, Sunil Jakhar is not a party MLA. Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa's name was also reportedly ruled out because his equation with Navjot Sidhu is not good and a Captain-Sidhu situation would arise if he is made the CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sukhjinder-randhawa-s-name-proposed-as-next-punjab-chief-minister-report-101632044344197.html

19-09-2021||India||Despite 'personal anguish': Amarinder Singh's words to Sonia Gandhi before resignation||Amarinder Singh wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi hours before he resigned as Punjab chief minister in which he said that despite his personal anguish that propelled the decision, he hoped the best for the Congress and Punjab. "Notwithstanding my personal anguish, I hope this will not cause any damage to the hard-earned peace and development in the State, and that the efforts I have been focusing during the last few years, would continue unabated, ensuring justice to one and all," Captain wrote as he informed the party president of his decision. In the letter, he also listed the achievements his government made in the last few years.After facing dissidence in the party for months, fomented by Congress leader Navjot Sidhu who was promoted to the position of the state unit chief, Amarinder Singh stepped down from his post with only a few months left for the state assembly election. Without mincing any word, Captian said that he felt humiliated by the recent developments in the state party unit and sensed a lack of trust in him on part of the party high command. Also Read: Losing support of 60 MLAs sealed Amarinder’s exitCaptain's sudden exit was a reaction to the recent developments in the state Congress which, Amarinder warned Sonia, were "clearly not based on full understanding of the national imperatives of Punjab and its key concerns.”The veteran Congress leader was considered to be very close to the Gandhi family as he was a close friend of Rajiv Gandhi. While his exit does not come across as amicable and he has not put a fig leaf on his hurt emotions, speculation over his future political moves are rife. The Captain said that he will not be retiring from politics and not quitting the Congress for the time being. He has also made it clear that while the High Command can choose whoever they trust as the next chief minister, he will oppose if Sidhu is made the chief minister.Calling Sidhu "anti-national, dangerous, unstable, incompetent" hours after his resignation on Saturday, Captain said, "We have all seen Sidhu hugging (Pakistan prime minister) Imran Khan and (Pak Army chief) General Bajwa (three years ago during a trip to that country), and singing praises for the Pakistan PM at the opening of the Kartarpur corridor while our soldiers were being killed at the borders every day."In interviews and media statements that Amarinder Singh issued on Saturday after his resignation, said he could not understand the logic behind the party High Command's decision to effect a change of guard in the poll-bound state, while people of Punjab were happy with Amarinder Singh's government. "Punjab has been doing so well in every sphere. I do not understand why the party felt the need to make a change," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-personal-anguish-amarinder-singh-s-words-to-sonia-gandhi-before-resignation-101632041693792.html

He was among the most prominent and distinguished legal brains of Assam and the Northeast, and had argued several cases in the Supreme Court.Dutta had studied in the St. Stephen's College in Delhi and was later involved in the Naxalite movement, for which he was arrested and imprisoned. After his release, he became a bank employee and then an advocate. He held the post of the Advocate General of Arunachal Pradesh since 2016.An avid sports lover, Dutta was the president of the Assam Cricket Association and did umpiring in several international cricket matches. He was also a member of the High-Level Committee (HLC) of the Union Home Ministry on the Clause-6 of the Assam Accord that submitted its report in February last year.His untimely death triggered reactions from across the political spectrum."In his passing away, we have lost a legendary legal luminary of the North East. My sincere condolences to his family and prayers for his soul to attain highest abode," Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu tweeted.Khandu's Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma said that his state has lost one of the brightest lawyers, who had also contributed to many other fields including sports administration. "His demise has created a huge void difficult to be filled up. Offer my deepest condolences to his family and well-wishers," Sarma tweeted.Union minister of shipping, ports and waterways Sarbananda Sonowal said in a Twitter post, "A scholar with brilliant legal acumen, his death is a huge loss to the fraternity.

He also added that he hoped that Amarinder Singh won’t do anything to hurt the party.“I hope that Captain Amarinder Singh will not take any such step which will harm the Congress party. Captain Sahib himself said that the party had kept him as the chief minister for nine and a half years. He has served the people of Punjab by working to the best of his ability,” Gehlot said in one of his many tweets reflecting on the Punjab crisis. Gehlot also defended the party high command and added that those in the party who get upset at losing power should listen to their conscience.“I personally believe that the Congress president chooses the CM at the risk of inviting displeasure of several leaders who are in the race for Chief Ministership. However, when the same chief minister is changed, he/she is displeased and holds the decision wrong. One should listen to one’s inner voice in such moments,” he tweeted. Captain Amarinder Singh was pushed to resign as Punjab CM after the Congress central leadership summoned a meeting of the party MLAs, who had expressed their lack of confidence in Amarinder Singh’s leadership. Reading the writing on the wall, Singh resigned half an hour before the Congress Legislative Party was to meet in Chandigarh. Singh said he felt “humiliated”“This is the third time they (Congress high command) have called the MLAs. Apparently, they do not have confidence in me and didn’t think I could handle my job. But I felt humiliated at the manner in which they handled the whole affair,” Amarinder Singh said after submitting his resignation on Saturday evening.He didn’t say that he was considering leaving the Congress party but made it amply clear that he would not accept Punjab Congress chief and his bête noire Navjot Singh Sidhu as the face of the party in the state, clearly drawing battlelines.Following the developments, speculations were rife if the change of guard in Punjab and Amarinder Singh’s unceremonious ouster will impact Congress prospects in upcoming assembly elections there.Gehlot said that all Congressmen needed to rise above themselves and act responsibly in the interest of the country and the party when “fascist forces” were a matter of concern for all the countrymen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-says-he-hopes-that-capt-amarinder-singh-will-work-in-party-s-interest-101632036717897.html

The Saudi minister will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and minister of external affairs S Jaishankar to hold bilateral talks on a range of issues, including the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan in the wake of the Taliban takeover. “H.H. Prince Faisal Bin Farhan Al Saud, minister of foreign affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, arrived in New Delhi today evening,” tweeted Arindam Bagchi, the spokesperson for the Union ministry of external affairs, on Friday.H.H. Prince Faisal Bin Farhan Al Saud, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, arrived in New Delhi today evening. pic.twitter.com/zcN88SELsVThe Saudi foreign minister's visit to India comes days after he batted for the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, ‘hoping’ that the caretaker government will help the war-torn nation achieve stability and overcome violence and extremism. Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, without elaborating much on the Taliban's approach to governance, said that Saudi Arabia will support “the choices the Afghan people make regarding the future of their country, away from external interference.”However, there are underlying security concerns regarding the emergence of a medieval theocratic Afghanistan state and its ties to a global jihadist network enabled by the Taliban regime.

19-09-2021||India||Nagaland’s new all party govt to be called United Democratic Alliance||As the political parties represented in the Nagaland Legislative Assembly (NLA) finalised the formation of an all party government on Saturday in Kohima, the house resolved that the new government will be called the United Democratic Alliance.“The nomenclature of United Democratic Alliance (UDA) for the Opposition-less government in Nagaland has been unanimously resolved by the legislators and party leaders of NDPP, BJP, NPF and Independent MLAs,” chief minister Neiphiu Rio tweeted after the decision.Government spokesperson, Neiba Kronu told journalists that the legislators will be writing to the assembly speaker in the next few days for formation of the UDA. Earlier it was announced that the new government will be called Nagaland United Government but Kronu said it was decided during Saturday’s meeting that UDA would be more appropriate.On July 19, the Opposition party, Naga People’s Front (NPF) passed a resolution for constituting an all-party government without preconditions, requesting the chief minister’s consideration with the aim to jointly push for an early political solution to the Naga issue. Initially, while the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) lauded the move, Central Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders were reported to be not so enthused over the development. The BJP is a major ally of the NDPP in the government and CM Rio is said to have convinced the Central BJP leadership in Delhi.This is not the first time Nagaland will be having an all party government. The state has had a government with no Opposition in assembly in 2015 during the third tenure of the NPF-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN), when the Congress MLAs joined the government and subsequently merged with the ruling NPF. But this time, a coalition has been formed without merging.The government spokesperson also informed that no decision was taken on Saturday’s meeting on sharing of portfolios with the NPF.In the house of 60, NPF has 25 MLAs, NDPP has 20, the BJP has 12, and there are two independents, while one assembly seat is vacant after Shamatore-Chessore MLA Toshi Wungtung of NDPP died on July 1.Although, Nagaland’s lawmakers are not directly involved in the Naga peace talks, elected members over the years have, cutting across party lines, held that they would play a facilitating role for settlement of the long-standing problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagalands-new-all-party-govt-to-be-called-united-democratic-alliance-101632023996564.html

19-09-2021||India||Centre assigns mediators to Nagaland, signalling resumption of peace talks||Former additional director of Intelligence Bureau (IB) AK Mishra arrived in Nagaland on Saturday and is widely expected to hold a series of informal talks with the Isak-Muivah faction of National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM) in the next few days to revive the Naga peace process that was stuck since October 2019 over the rebel group’s insistence on a separate Naga flag and constitution.HT has learnt that Mishra, currently an advisor in the Union home ministry, is a choice candidate to replace former Nagaland governor RN Ravi as interlocutor to resume the peace talks but an official order to this effect is yet to be issued. Ravi was recently made Tamil Nadu governor.After the derailment of the talks since the contested 31st October 2019 deadline, when Ravi and the NSCN (IM) fell out over above mentioned issues pertaining to the Framework Agreement, signed with the Centre in 2015, the NSCN (IM) leadership had been meeting a team from government of India led by IB officials including Mishra.People aware of the developments said Ravi is yet to be officially relieved from his role as interlocutor and Mishra will be working as an emissary, but the latter is already being referred to as the “new interlocutor” in various sections of the media. Even the state government spokesperson Neiba Kronu on Saturday told journalists in Kohima that “new interlocutor AK Mishra has been appointed” and he knew the Naga issue well.It was also learnt that on the directive of the Centre, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma will be coming to Nagaland on September 21 and Kronu said the state’s Parliamentary Core Committee will try to meet Sarma along with the “negotiating parties”. Sarma and Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio were earlier tasked by Union home minister Amit Shah to act as go-betweens when the relationship between Ravi and NSCN (IM) soured.Meanwhile, NSCN (IM) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah, along with the group’s team assigned to resume talks, is also said to have reached Dimapur on Saturday from the NSCN designated camp Hebron. People aware of the developments said a series of informal talks is scheduled to begin between the NSCN (IM) and Mishra from Sunday. Till the time of filing of this report, other Naga nationalist political groups were yet to receive any invitation to sit with Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-assigns-mediators-to-nagaland-signalling-resumption-of-peace-talks-101632020936142.html

An announcement was made on Friday in this regard by Sawant, who announced that his government will launch the initiative on September 19 from the Thivim assembly segment in North Goa.The doorstep government initiative will be aimed at grievance redressal and to ensure that every resident of Goa can take the full benefits of the various official schemes and initiatives launched by the government. The officials will help the local residents with prompt solutions to their problems, and hear out the difficulties faced while filing the applications for government schemes, thus initiating steps to redress these issues.According to Sawant, the initiative will be carried out at different assembly constituencies across the state. He has said some of the issues that will be tackled with the help of the initiative during the day-long activity include pending applications and dues on ration cards, Aadhaar cards, Dayanand Social Security Scheme, voter ID cards, Kisan cards, and the like.

19-09-2021||India||Cong social media dept passes resolution to make Rahul Gandhi party president||The Congress social media department Saturday passed a resolution to make Rahul Gandhi party president at the earliest, saying his leadership will bring new energy into the party cadre.The resolution was passed unanimously at the social media department's national executive meeting "Drishti 2021".This comes after similar resolutions were passed at the national executive meetings of the Indian Youth Congress, the NSUI and the Congress SC/ST department.Rahul Gandhi attended the social media department meeting and urged party workers to continue their fight against the ruling dispensation with humility, truth and love.Social media department head Rohan Gupta said Gandhi inspired party workers and spoke to them candidly about their lives and answered each of their questions with empathy and patience.He also commended the social media workers for their hard work and dedication to the party and commitment to fight and defeat the ruling dispensation, he said."We believe that only the rights-based approach, the policies of justice or NYAY of Shri Rahul Gandhi can save the country today. He is the only leader in the country who has shown the courage and conviction to hold the fort of truth and welfare of the citizens."We believe leadership of Shri Rahul Gandhi will bring a new energy into the party cadre across India. We therefore, unanimously pass the resolution that Shri Rahul Gandhi should take over as President of the Indian National Congress at the earliest," said the resolution passed Saturday at the conclusion of the two-day meeting.In another resolution adopted at the meeting, the party said social media is being used as a weapon to spread hate and create division among various sections of the society by the "fascist forces" ruling the country."We resolve to fight for the Idea of India as conceived by the Gandhian and Nehruvian philosophy to save the country from the policies of division by the ruling dispensation."We resolve to use social media as a tool to unite people from across all sections of the society. The ruling regiment has been on a rampage spreading fake news and misinformation using social media to run their agenda," the resolution said.It further stated that the party will expose "fake news being propagated by them" and ensure that truth and reality take the centre stage."The RSS-BJP government is hiding their incompetence and mis-governance using PR and headline management and using event management to distract people from their failures. We resolve to bring forth their reality without any fear and with absolute conviction," it said.Gupta said everyone is disturbed over the goings on in the country as every single person is suffering -- from the student community, to farmers to women and the oppressed sections of the society."Not a single Indian is at peace. To please a few friends, the economy of the country has been destroyed. The social fabric of this country, which was our pride and strength, is being damaged time and again," the resolution also said.Those who are raising their voices against those in power are being harassed and being made victims of vendetta politics, it alleged."Hate crime is on the rise and the criminals are enjoying state impunity. Women are not safe in this ‘new India'. Crime against women is at an all-time high," the resolution also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-social-media-dept-passes-resolution-to-make-rahul-gandhi-party-president-101632007123439.html
19-09-2021||India||PM Modi pep talks top mandarins, stresses on policy implementation||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday met all the secretaries to the government of India over three hours and urged them to work together and implement policy decisions, according to people familiar with the matter.Flanked by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba and Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Dr PK Mishra, PM Modi heard out some senior secretaries to the government even as he gave them a pep talk about the need for faster delivery and implementation. But it was not without his usual repartee.After the meeting continued for over two and a half hours, the PM jocularly told the top IAS officers present that he was used to long meetings and hoped that they did not mind the extended meeting. The PM spoke for half an hour before opening the meeting for senior officials to speak their mind.Before the coronavirus hit the country in January 2019, the PM has held meetings with all secretaries in the past too to get feedback from policy implementers. It is understood that several secretaries gave ideas, some fresh ones, while newly appointed secretaries met the PM face to face. However, it was quite evident that hurdles to implementation of government policies remained as also to the speed of execution.At one point, the PM jokingly told the top bureaucrats that since they knew the problems and the solutions and had the vision for the future, the problem lay with him regarding the implementation of policies.The basic purpose of the exercise was to energise the bureaucracy so that it becomes result driven and not process driven.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-pep-talks-top-mandarins-stresses-on-policy-implementation-101631993752218.html
19-09-2021||India||Move to convene CLP confirmed Cong leadership’s loss of trust in Captain||This might be an instance of the fifth chief minister losing his job (across four states), but the Congress central leadership hasn’t covered itself with glory in securing the scalp of a chief minister of Amarinder Singh’s stature and seniority in Punjab. The party might have retained its legislative strength in the assembly. But in popular perception, it has slid notches down the totem pole.Nobody can aspire to be chief minister for life and the Captain, now 79, had a nine-and-a-half year stint over two terms. It has been clear for some time that he no longer enjoys the confidence and support of the Gandhis but the straw that broke the camel’s back was the manner in which the All India Congress Committee (AICC) blindsided him while summoning the meeting of the legislature party in Chandigarh.The signal inherent to the move was loud and clear. He was kept out of the loop to deny him time to marshal support among MLAs. It was the unkindest of the many cuts he thought the party inflicted on him in his slugfest with Navjot Sidhu, who was anointed the Congress’s state unit chief against his advice.The midnight move to convene the CLP was a sort of coup that confirmed the leadership’s loss of trust in the CM. By all available indications, he became a persona non grata in the leadership’s scheme of things. It was for that reason that he drove down to the Raj Bhawan to submit his resignation rather than showing up and getting shamed at the CLP of which he was the leader.To avoid any rival show of strength, the AICC’s instructions to the MLAs were to reach the party office for the CLP meet with no pit stops along the way. The message clearly was to not turn up at the meeting the CM had reportedly convened at his farmhouse.Yet, over two dozen legislators besides ministers and party MPs met Singh before his call on the Governor to put in his papers. While bidding adieu, he asked them to attend the CLP meeting, which they did. That accounted perhaps for the attendance of 78 of the 80 MLAs at the gathering that authorised Congress president Sonia Gandhi to choose his successor.Deferential as always to Gandhi, the Captain did mention that he felt “humiliated” by the inquisitions he faced in Delhi in recent weeks. That he was kept in the dark about today’s CLP meet added insult to injury.Amid the internal party turmoil that often spilled in the open, Singh had been telling his friends and advisors that he was reconciled to “hanging his gloves” if the leadership so desired. Pointing to portraits adorning his study in his farmhouse, he’d say: “Having had a wholesome five decades in public life, I’ve no regrets and a lot to look back with satisfaction.”Upset though he was at the treatment meted out to him, the Captain never badmouthed the Gandhi family, having fond memories of his friendship with the late Rajiv Gandhi. “I’d never turn against Sonia or her children who call me uncle,” he once told this writer, indulgently showing the messages he exchanged with Priyanka on the exquisite varieties of plants and flowers at his sprawling farmhouse. “She’s very prompt with her replies....”That leaves one wondering about the communication breakdown that led to the sad denouement. Even if his popularity had slipped among a section of legislators and people on account of his work style or lack of progress on certain issues, the problem was resolvable. The impression that he has been sacrificed to mollycoddle Sidhu, his principal detractor, could queer the pitch for the party.

19-09-2021||India||Losing support of 60 MLAs sealed Amarinder’s exit||The final chapter in the Congress’s plan to remove Captain Amarinder Singh as Punjab chief minister began on Friday afternoon when party general secretary Ajay Maken went to meet former party president Rahul Gandhi on Friday afternoon with a document signed by at least 60 Congress MLAs from the state.The signatures, taken on Friday morning, showed that Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh did not enjoy the support of his own legislative party, according to people familiar with the matter. To be sure, Singh himself has admitted that most MLAs typically do what the party high command wants them to; and analysts point out that this is especially true in the run-up to an election because it is the party that decides who contests and who doesn’t.Things moved quickly from this point, they said. Gandhi asked Maken to consult the party’s legal expert Abhishek Singhvi fearing that Singh could recommend the dissolution of the Punjab assembly to governor Banwarilal Purohit, one person aware of the matter said.Simultaneously, this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added, Gandhi asked Harish Rawat, the party general secretary in charge of the state, to call a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party to elect a new CM.When Rawat called Singh to communicate there would be a CLP meeting, a surprised Singh asked him what was the purpose of calling the meeting was, a second senior Congress leader said. “Singh anticipated that he would be removed. He dialled Congress president Sonia Gandhi this morning to air his grievances and claimed that he has been repeatedly humiliated,” this leader added.“Two rapid action teams were set up in New Delhi and Punjab if any legal intervention was required. The Congress has a rightful claim to continue governing Punjab ahead of the elections,” said a third leader.The leaders underlined that a signal was given to Amarinder when Navjyot Singh Sidhu was appointed as the PCC chief on July 18 this year, ignoring the CM’s stiff objections.But the first sign of Captain’s depleting control over Punjab came, they added, when poll strategist Prashant Kishor quit as his advisor and gave feedback that the Congress was likely behind the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab, another functionary said. “The party’s internal surveys, too, found the Congress organisation lagging and that it would not get half of its current seats,” the functionary said, asking not to be named.The Congress has 80 MLAs in the 117-member state assembly.The functionary claimed that the CM didn’t have many efficient officers in his inner circle (one of the reasons for anti-incumbency).“Even otherwise, people of the state are not happy with him, especially the farmers,” the second leader said.Last month, Amarinder publicly contradicted Rahul Gandhi over the Jallianwala Bagh makeover. While Gandhi said that the revamp of the national memorial was an “insult to martyrs”, Singh said: “To me, it looks very nice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/losing-support-of-60-mlas-sealed-amarinder-s-exit-101631991858617.html
19-09-2021||India||22-month-old child in Odisha undergoes lung washing procedure at AIIMS||A 22-month-old girl from Odisha has become the youngest patient in the country to successfully undergo a lung washing procedure after she was diagnosed with a rare disease in which milk-like material get deposited in the lungs making respiration difficult.The girl from Dhenkanal district had contracted Covid-19 along with other family members in June this year and recovered. In July, she developed fever with breathing difficulty, following which she was admitted to various hospitals of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. However, as the child’s condition did not improve, she was finally referred to the Paediatrics department of AIIMS Bhubaneswar and later admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit of the hospital.Director of AIIMS, Dr Gitanjali Batmanbane said after investigations, she was suspected to be suffering from pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a rare disease in which milk-like materials get deposited in both the lungs, which the child cannot cough out.“The only available treatment option for this disease is washing both lungs with saline, which is technically challenging in such a sick child. So, an expert team of doctors was formed and the child was put on ECMO. The team of doctors aided by senior residents and nursing officers did the entire procedure on August 30 and a second procedure on September 12, which improved her condition further. On Saturday, she was discharged with a small minimal oxygen requirement,” said Dr Batmanbane.The expert team included paediatricians Dr Krishna Mohan Gulla, Dr Rashmi Ranjan Das, Dr Amit Kumar Satapathy, paediatric surgeon Dr. Manoj Mohanty and his team, Anaesthesia specialists Dr Satyajit Mishra, Dr Bikram Kishore Behera and cardio-thoracic surgeon Dr Sidharth Kumar Sathia and Dr Satyapriya Mohanty,” said the director.Paediatrician Dr Gulla said when the baby was admitted to the hospital about one and a half months ago, she was breathing heavily and needed 15 to 20 litres of oxygen. Her oxygen saturation level was 70 to 80 per cent.“As the baby was found suffering from Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis, surfactant protein was getting deposited in her lungs. We had to wash both her lungs with saltwater and put her on ECMO support for 26 hours. The second lung washing was carried out about 5 to 6 days ago without ECMO support. After that her condition improved. On Saturday, she was discharged with 1-2 litres of oxygen support as he oxygen saturation level was 97 to 98 per cent,” said Dr Gull, adding that the child’s condition is likely to be a genetic one. “The child’s lungs needs to undergo regular washing. We hope the child may not need ECMO in future as the condition of her lungs is better,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/22monthold-child-in-odisha-undergoes-lung-washing-procedure-at-aiims-101631991997066.html

19-09-2021||India||From communal harmony to terror infamy: How Bhatkal became a constant on intel agencies’ radar||Central intelligence agencies issued an alert to the Karnataka police on Thursday after intercepting ‘conversations of interest’ on satellite phones recently. While the districts in the state’s coastal belt have been notified, one town is of particular interest again. Even though Bhatkal in the Uttara Kannada district has a population of fewer than 150,000 people, every intelligence agency, state or central, has its units deployed in the town. The reason is the name itself. Outside of Karnataka, more than the town, the word Bhatkal triggers memories of Yasin and Riyaz Bhatkal, two masterminds behind multiple terror attacks in the country. Decades before these men emerged and the town came under the radar of the intelligence agencies, Bhatkal was an inconspicuous fishermen’s town, which remained peaceful following the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992. GU Bhat, a senior journalist from Uttara Kannada district remembers the events of April 10, 1996, which he believes was a turning point in the town’s history. On that day, Dr DU Chittaranjan, a popular doctor in the town and an RSS activist was assassinated by unknown men inside his house. “He reached home around 8 pm that night. Before having dinner, he watched the news. Just as he got up from his seat after his wife called him for dinner, someone shot him from behind through the window. He died on the spot. It was this murder that divided the Muslim and Hindu communities in the town,” said Bhat, who had covered the story. Chittaranjan was sent to Bhatkal to build an RSS base in the town. He was popular in the town for charging his patients just ₹5 or less. His popularity laid the foundation of the party in Bhatkal, which had elected only Muslim candidates from the constituency until the late 1990s. Under Chittaranjan, leaders like Anant Kumar Hegde, a former minister in the state government and Uttara Kannada MP, started their political careers. Despite his popularity, Chittaranjan lost two elections. But the situation changed in 1993 when stones were pelted at the chariot procession of the famous Hanuman temple in the heart of Bhatkal. As a result, in 1993, the town saw communal violence for over nine months. Around 19 people were killed in riots – ten Muslims and nine Hindus. Many residential areas were attacked during these riots, and religious were formed on lines of religion as a result. A Muslim community leader and doctor practising in Bhatkal said even during this time, Chittaranjan stood for harmony between both communities together. “I remember he came to us and said there was a need to end the violence. Even the community trusted him, and he played a huge part in bringing the situation under control,” said the leader, who didn’t want to be named. However, with his murder in 1996, communal disharmony in Bhatkal rose to new heights. Hegde emerged as the new face of the RSS-BJP in the town, and two months later, elected Member of Parliament from Uttara Kannada. Unlike his guru, Hegde believed in political polarization, said the community leader.As the Hindutva wave got momentum across the Uttara Kannada district, resistance grew within the Muslim community. “Since the mid-1980s, there were many Muslim men from the Bhatkal who moved to Gulf countries, and over the years, the community became rich,” said a senior state intelligence officer. While the Hindutva movement gained traction and power in Bhatkal, youth employed in Gulf countries became the backbone of resistance against the movement. The Hindu-Muslim conflict in Bhatkal soon witnessed an influence of international players, who tried to support the resistance against the rise of Hindutva. From this resistance emerged Riyaz Ismail Shahbandri and Mohammed Ahmed Siddibappa, popularly known as Riyaz Bhatkal and Yasin Bhatkal. “When their name started getting associated with terrorism, Bhatkal town itself became a place of interest for the intelligence agencies,” said the officer. As the terror suspicion associated with the name Bhatkal became a liability for its residents, an old tradition in the town made their lives even harder. Decades before the partition, Muslim families of the Nawayath community had business links with Karachi and other parts of Pakistan. Over the years, marriage alliances between Karachi and Bhatkal became common. Even after the partition, this practice continued, and many women who married men from Bhatkal got Indian citizenship. Soon as the town’s name started getting associated with terror, the approval for citizenship of many Pakistani brides became difficult. A decade ago, the government even began deporting some of the ‘Karachi wives in Bhatkal’, said an official of the Karnataka police.Pakistani wife of a suspected terror operative Syed Ismail Afaq, jailed for supplying explosive material that Indian Mujahideen (IM) used in bomb strikes across India, was deported on October 7, 2019. There are around 70 citizenship applications from Bhatkal alone, says Karnataka police, and for the families the wait for citizenship is difficult. Javeed (name changed), whose wife is a Pakistani, says that due to the visa restrictions travelling within the country is difficult. “We have to take permission from police if we have to travel. We have been going to multiple offices, and multiple police verifications have been done, but her request for citizenship hasn’t been processed yet,” he said. Even though south India hasn’t witnessed a major terror strike since 2014, the intelligence agencies continue to keep a close watch on this small town. Many believe Chittaranjan’s murder was a ploy to change the political narrative of a town that was once known for communal harmony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-communal-harmony-to-terror-infamy-how-bhatkal-became-a-constant-on-intel-agencies-radar-101631991815771.html

The carriers have been operating 72.5 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights since August 12, according to the ministry’s order. Between July 5 and August 12, the cap stood at 65 per cent. Between June 1 and July 5, the cap was at 50 per cent.The ministry issued a fresh order on Saturday, in which it modified the August 12 order stating that “72.5 per cent capacity may be read as 85 per cent capacity”. Saturday’s order also noted that the 72.5 per cent cap will remain in place “until further order”.When the government had resumed the scheduled domestic flights on May 25 last year after a two-month break, the ministry had allowed the carriers to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic services.The cap was gradually increased to 80 per cent by December.The 80 per cent cap remained in place till June 1. The May 28 decision to bring down the cap from 80 to 50 per cent from June 1 onwards was taken “in view of the sudden surge in the number of active COVID-19 cases across the country, decrease in passenger traffic and the passenger load (occupancy rate) factor”, the ministry had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airlines-can-operate-85-of-pre-covid-19-domestic-flights-aviation-ministry-101631991459610.html
19-09-2021||India||Need to Indianise our legal system, says CJI Ramana||Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Saturday asserted the need for the “Indianisation of our legal system”, pointing out that the colonial system being followed currently may not be best suited to the complexities of India.“Our system, practices, rules being colonial in origin may not be best suited to the needs of the Indian population. The need of the hour is the Indianisation of our legal system. When I say Indianisation, I mean the need to adapt to the practical realities of our society and localise our justice delivery systems,” the CJI said, while addressing an event organised in Bengaluru to pay tributes to late Supreme Court judge justice Mohan Mohan Shantanagoudar.Ruing that the system in vogue poses multiple barriers for the common people, and those belonging to rural parts of the country are usually made to feel out of place in the court, justice Ramana said it’s imperative to simplify the justice delivery system and make it more accessible and effective. “Courts need to be litigant centric, as they are the ultimate beneficiaries. The simplification of justice delivery should be our pressing concern,” the CJI underscored, pointing out that procedural barriers often undermine access to justice. The common man should not be apprehensive about approaching the courts and authorities, he said.Justice Ramana also called for the need to localise the justice delivery systems and explained this by illustrating how a litigant from a rural place would not understand the arguments or pleadings, which are mostly in English, and then they would be forced to spend more money to understand the implications of a judgment. “It is the duty of lawyers and judges to create an environment which is comforting for the litigants and other stakeholders. We must not forget that the focal point of any justice delivery system is the ‘litigant- the justice seeker’... It is crucial to make justice delivery more transparent, accessible and effective,” he said.During the event, justice Ramana fondly remembered justice Shantanagoudar, who died at the age of 62 due to a lung infection on April 24, as an “extraordinary judge”. His four-year-long tenure in the Supreme Court was marked by his concerns for social equality, the opportunity to all, and rights and liberties of the people, justice Ramana said.“Sitting on a bench with him for about a year-and-a-half, I was witness to his legal acumen, immense preparation as well as his kindness and generosity of spirit... He was built from a different fibre. Till his last days, he continued to sit on the bench, hear cases and write judgments. His commitment to his judicial duty was inspiring,” he added.Justice Ramana also recalled some of the important judgments by justice Shantanagoudar. In March 2020, justice Shantagoudar came to the rescue of small farmers and held that a farmer is entitled to file a consumer complaint against a seed company for deficiency of service. Through a ruling in February, justice Shantagoudar obligated the banks to ensure safe custody of valuables in their lockers, holding that banks cannot wash off their hands and claim that they bear no liability towards their customers for the operation of the locker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-indianise-our-legal-system-says-cji-ramana-101631990803623.html

Based on the input, an SDRF team rushed to the spot.”“After reaching the spot, they went down with the help of ropes and started a search and rescue operation to find the three missing people but failed. As the water level in the lake was high added with the darkness, the operation had to be stopped by the SDRF which was also accompanied by the NDRF and local police,” said Negi.She informed that the three men were identified as Sheeshpal, Sonu and Sher Singh.“The search operation was resumed on Saturday morning after a diving team of SDRF came from Rishikesh. After a few hours of the resumption of the search operation, a SDRF team recovered the body of Sher Singh and Sonu while one person is still missing,” said Negi adding that the locals who were present at the time of the incident informed the police that the car had broken the parapet wall before falling into the lake.She said that the search operation is “still on to find the remaining person”.On Friday night, the SDRF also rescued a man who had walked into a 100m gorge in Askote, Pithoragarh about 425 km away from Dehradun.“The man who was on an evening stroll, had slipped and fallen into the deep gorge adjacent to the road. The passersby tried to help him but couldn’t as the gorge was about 100m deep. They informed the SDRF which after reaching the spot went down and rescued him before rushing him to a nearby hospital for treatment,” said Negi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/car-falls-into-uttarakhand-s-tehri-lake-2-dead-and-one-missing-101631990737144.html

Leader of the outfit, Dharmendra, came down heavily on chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and said, “When we didn’t spare Mahatma Gandhi and killed him to protect Hindus, do you think we will spare you?” “Temples were demolished by the government in Chitradurga, Dakshina Kannada, and Mysuru. Who is running the government? If this had happened during the Congress regime, do you think the situation would have been the same? As long as the Hindu Mahasabha is there, we are not going to allow you to demolish Hindu temples,” he added. The statements come days after a video showing the Mysuru district administration demolishing a temple went viral. The Karnataka high court had pulled up authorities for failing to take action against illegal structures built on government land, prompting the Mysuru district administration to act. On August 12, the HC said the Supreme Court has stated that all illegal religious structures that were built after September 29, 2009, shall not be tolerated. The leader further posed the question as to why mosques and churches were not demolished as part of this drive. “If our Constitution guarantees us the right to equality, why are only Hindus being targeted?” he asked. Responding to the controversy, The Karnataka government on Wednesday said that it was not informed by the Mysuru district administration of its temple demolition plans and termed the action as ‘wrong’, assuring to discontinue the drive. KS Eshwarappa, minister for rural development and panchayat raj, said all deputy commissioners will be asked not to take any hasty action. “The government will sit, decide, and then direct what needs to be done,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahatma-was-also-not-spared-to-protect-hindus-says-hindu-mahasabha-leader-on-temple-demolition-in-karnataka-101631990735891.html
19-09-2021||India||Opposition joins forces to hit out at Congress over infighting in Punjab||Captain Amarinder Singh’s resignation as Punjab chief minister is an admission by the Congress that it failed to perform and has nothing to show for its tenure of over four-and-a-half years, said Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday, as opposition parties mounted an attack on the ruling Congress.Declaring that he felt humiliated, Singh on Saturday resigned as chief minister of Punjab, capping a months-long power tussle between him and Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was recently made state party president much against the senior leader’s wishes. Over 50 Congress MLAs had written to party president Sonia Gandhi, seeking that Singh is replaced as chief minister.In a statement, Akali chief Badal said: “The Congress party cannot hope to save its incompetent government and befool Punjabis with a mere change of face.”The Congress high command’s ploy to avert a backlash against the party by putting the blame on one person will not succeed, he added. “Punjabis know that the entire Congress party in Punjab is known for open loot and lawlessness. Its ministers and MLAs patronized gangsters. Its ministers looted the State exchequer of thousands of crores. It failed to undertake any development or infrastructure projects in the State”.Joining the chorus, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called on the people of Punjab to choose it in the elections early next year, saying that it alone can give the state a stable and progressive government. “The Congress in Punjab is licking the dust to revive itself,” said  BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh.Terming Singh’s resignation a “panic reaction” of the Congress high command to salvage the party’s situation, Chugh said that the Congress would be decimated in the forthcoming assembly elections and no fire-fighting of any kind can help it. “The mafia raj of the Congress in Punjab would prove to be the last nail in its coffin in Punjab,” he added. Union minister and BJP MP from Punjab Som Prakash said the resignation of Singh clearly shows that Congress is desperate as it is losing its position with every passing day. “Congress is in decline, Akalis have lost the trust of people, so we are hopeful that people of Punjab will give the opportunity to BJP which can give a stable and progressive government in the state,” Prakash said.The BJP which had been contesting elections in Punjab in alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has only two MLAs in the 117-member assembly and two MPs from the state. The SAD snapped its alliance with the BJP last year over the Centre’s three contentious farm laws.Reacting to the news of Singh’s resignation, Omar Abdullah of the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference wondered about the nationwide impact of the Congress’s moves in Punjab.  “I guess it’s too much to expect the Congress to take the fight to the BJP when its state leaders are too busy fighting amongst themselves,” he said In a series of tweets.“Ordinarily I wouldn’t give a toss about the fratricide in the Congress party - their party, their business. However what the Congress does has a direct fallout for every political party outside the NDA orbit because almost 200 Lok Sabha seats see a direct BJP-Cong fight,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-joins-forces-to-hit-out-at-congress-over-infighting-in-punjab-101631990378137.html
19-09-2021||India||Study warns against mining nod to 14 coal blocks in Hasdeo Arand||Fourteen of the 23 coal blocks in the Hasdeo Arand Coalfield should not be given mining clearance to protect the dense forest tracts in the region that are home to a large herd of elephants, a study has recommended.According to a research by the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education’s to assess the floral and faunal biodiversity of the coalfield, mining work was likely to raise environmental concerns in the region.“Mining related land-use changes will harm forest cover/density, forest type, and forest fragmentation. In addition, forest fragmentation will contribute to decreased patch/corridor connectivity, increased edge effect, change in micro-climate and promote invasive species if not taken adequate mitigation measures,” the study said.These fourteen coal blocks fall within Chornai and Ton-Teti watershed areas in the Handeo Arand area, which is a total of 1879.6 square kilometer.“The report has been submitted to us but the recommendations will be examined by the government and will be placed before the cabinet first .. Till now , the government’s decision over the report is not finalised” said forest minster Mohammad Akbar.The study further recommended that allotted four contiguous coal blocks falling within the Gej-Jhink watershed – Tara, Parsa, Parsa East Kanta Basan (PEKB)and Kente Extension – which are either already open or in advance stage of getting the statutory clearances – can be considered for mining with strict environmental safeguards, including appropriate conservation measures for the management of surface water and biodiversity.“The biodiversity study report was submitted to the state government around 15 days back and is under consideration.Necessary action over the report is to be discussed within the government and subsequently, it would be forwarded to Union government with state government recommendations,” said Rakesh Chaturvedi, Chhattisgarh’s principal chief conservator of forest.The study was conducted in eighteen months from 2019 to February 2021. The study area was the entire Hasdeo-Arand Coalfield (HAC), comprising of 23 coal blocks, which fall partly in Udaipur tehsil of Surguja district, Premnagar tehsil of Surajpur district, Poundi Uproda and Korba tehsils of Korba district in Chhattisgarh.The study was directed by National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2014 after an activist Sudeip Shrivastva challenged the stage-2 clearance by the ministry of environment & forests of Parsa East & Kanta Basan (PEKB) allotted to Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (RVUNL). NGT in its judgment quashed the said forest clearance, and an appeal was filed by RVUNL.In 2019, during the hearing of the said appeal, the Supreme Court asked about the compliance of NGT direction and five years after the order, the study started.The study further observed that infrastructure development and mining will harm the quality of habitat due to fragmentation and mitigation, which will be a huge challenge. The effect of mining on elephant habitat may not reflect in the same habitat but could be a silent trigger for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) in some other areas within landscape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-warns-against-mining-nod-to-14-coal-blocks-in-hasdeo-arand-101631989863530.html
19-09-2021||India||Navjot Singh Sidhu a total disaster, says Amarinder Singh after ouster||Hours after stepping down as the chief minister of Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh said he will not accept Congress’s state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu as the next CM and described him as “a total disaster”. Singh, however, remained tight-lipped on whether he would leave the Congress to start a new party.  Two-time chief minister Amarinder Singh put in his papers after speaking to Congress president Sonia Gandhi early on Saturday, barely five months before the state assembly elections are due early next year. “The thing is that this is the third time the party called the MLAs. You have an element of doubt on me... I feel humiliated,” he said, after submitting his resignation to Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit. His reference was to a Congress legislative Party meeting that was called -- and without keeping him in the loop. He said he felt sad and humiliated that his contribution to the state was not recognised and he had been misread despite having done the best for it, including on sacrilege and drugs issues. “Punjab has been doing so well in every sphere. I do not understand why the party felt the need to make a change,” he added. The Congress currenlty has 80 MLAs in the 117-member state assembly.‘Sidhu a threat to national security’Terming Sidhu “dangerous”, “incompetent” and a “threat to national security”,  Singh said he will fight “tooth and nail” against any move to make Sidhu his successor. “Navjot Singh Sidhu is an incompetent man, he is going to be a disaster. I will oppose his name for the next CM face. He has a connection with Pakistan. It will be a threat to national security...,” Singh told news agency ANI.“I cannot allow such a man to destroy us, I will continue to fight the issues that are bad for his state and its people,” he added.Asserting that Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan is Sidhu’s “friend”, Singh told HT: “We have all seen Sidhu hugging Imran Khan and General Bajwa (Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa), and singing praises of the Pakistan Prime Minister at the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor while our soldiers were being killed at the borders every day.”Sidhu hugged Bajwa during his visit to the country for Imran Khan’s swearing-in ceremony and faced criticism. Singh had then termed it as “not a nice gesture” and “completely avoidable”.“The government of Punjab means the security of India, and if Sidhu is made the face of the Congress for chief ministership, I will fight him at every step,” he added.Singh, who has been asked by the Governor to continue in office as chief minister till alternative arrangements are made, said Sidhu could never be a good leader for Punjab. “He is a total disaster. When he was a (Punjab) minister , he could not even run one ministry, now can he run the entire Punjab? I know that man has no capability at all,” Singh said.A former cricketer-turned-politician, Sidhu, a four-time MP, joined the Congress from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the 2017 Punjab assembly polls. He was inducted into the state cabinet but shared an uneasy relationship with the then CM, which eventually culminated in him quitting after Singh shuffled his portfolio in 2019.The CM had opposed his elevation as party chief, citing his lack of seniority in the Congress. Tensions between Singh and Sidhu, simmering since 2019, heightened in May after the Punjab government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 case of police firing on a crowd protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book.Sidhu and some leaders publicly accused Singh of corruption, prompting the Congress to set up the three-member panel. The panel met around 150 functionaries – including Singh twice -- and submitted its report to Gandhi on June 10. The panel recommended that Singh retain the charge but Sidhu be accommodated in a key role.  On July 18, Congress appointed Sidhu as the president of its Punjab unit. ‘Not hanging up my boots’Speaking after his resignation, Singh made it clear that he had no intention of quitting politics and said as an Army man, he has a lot of will and will remain active in the upcoming Assembly elections in Punjab. “I am not hanging my boots,” he declared, reiterating that he will decide on his future course of action after talking to his aides, including Congress MLAs. The leader claimed that he had himself asked MLAs who were supporting him to attend the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meet and the presence of a large number of legislators at the meeting did not mean they were supporting Sidhu. “Just a week ago, I sent to Sonia Gandhi a list of 63 MLAs who were supporting me,” he said, adding that MLAs usually respond to what they think Delhi wants, which was the case at the CLP meeting too. In any case, it is not possible to make all MLAs happy, he added.Pointing to the sweeping victory by the Congress under his leadership since 2017, Singh said he failed to understand the decision to replace him. “The people of Punjab were clearly happy with my government,” he said, adding that till three-four months ago, the tide was completely in favour of the Congress in Punjab but “they have cut their nose to spite their face and ended up from a winning to a losing position”.Asked if he would remain in Congress, the 79-year-old said, “I can’t answer that right now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-a-total-disaster-says-amarinder-singh-after-ouster-101631989896594.html

Police suspect the family members died by suicide.A two-year-old girl was found lying unconscious beside the bodies.The bodies of a 51-year-old woman, her two daughters aged 32 and 29, her 25-year-old son, and nine-month-old grandson have been sent for post-mortem examination and suicide will be confirmed only after that, Byadarahalli police said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Sanjeev Patil said that police were not able to recover any suicide note from the house. According to the officer, the incident came to light when the husband of the elderly woman returned home after five days. “He called the police and when they broke open the door, they found out that there were five bodies inside the house and [two-year-old] the baby was found alive. The bodies had started decomposing by the time they were found,” said Patil.In his statement to the police, the woman’s husband claimed that her daughter wanted to stay away from her in-laws and had asked her husband to move to a different house. “He said that he was not happy that his daughter was making these demands for their in-laws. The fact that she has been living in the house for the past year had irked the head of the family. He also claimed that his wife had asked his younger daughter also to do the same when she came home in February. He said there were some issues with his son as well. We are verifying these claims,” said a Byadarahalli police station official.The official added that on Sunday following one such argument, the man left the house claiming he didn’t want to stay with them anymore.Neighbours told police that there were constant arguments between the man and the other family members and last Sunday, following an argument over the same issue, the man had stormed out of the house. Since leaving the house he didn’t attend any calls made by the family members..The five bodies were found in a decomposed state and forensic experts have told police that the deaths could have occurred five days ago.Meanwhile, the two-year-old girl is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. “We have shifted the child to a private hospital since she was found to be unconscious. We are still awaiting a report from the hospital. When she recovers, we will provide her counseling,” said Patil.Soumendu Mukherjee, additional commissioner of Police (West) also said that the reason for the five deaths is yet to be ascertained. “The woman’s husband is in a state of shock. He will be inquired as soon as he is fit,”Mukherjee said.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.)

19-09-2021||India||25 million jabs in a day didn’t go down well with Oppn: PM Modi||States and Union territories such as Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Chandigarh and Lakshadweep have administered at least one dose of a vaccine against Covid-19 to their entire populations, with a priority given to cities that have a high tourist influx, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday.Addressing health care workers and vaccine beneficiaries in Goa a day after India administered a record 25 million jabs against the coronavirus disease, PM Modi also said that the overwhelming response to the vaccination drive on his birthday on September 17 made a political party experience “fever”.“India has given a lot of priority to states with potential tourism sector in the vaccination campaign. Himachal Pradesh and Goa are some examples; (where) everyone has received their first dose already. Tourists can visit these places with a feeling of safety,” said Modi.Sikkim, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Kerala, Ladakh, Uttarakhand, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli were not far behind in vaccinating their populations, he added.On August 29, the Himachal Pradesh government announced that it has covered its entire adult population with the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, becoming the first state in the country to do so. According to the CoWin dashboard, it continues to lead the country in key vaccination metrics – population covered with at least one dose, and the percentage of adults fully vaccinated. Around 63.7% of all adults in the state are partially vaccinated, while another 37.8% have been fully vaccinated.Modi said that the government has prioritised tourist destinations in the country for its vaccination drive to encourage international tourism.“It is very important that our tourism destinations reopen. When everyone from the hotel industry, taxi drivers, vendors and shopkeepers are vaccinated, people will feel safe to travel that destination,” he said.Earlier this week, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant also announced that 100% of Goa’s population had received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.“This is a major milestone in the fight against Corona. Every achievement of Goa that epitomises the concept of Ek Bharat -Shreshth Bharat fills me with great joy,” the Prime Minister said during the virtual interaction.Modi said that Goa braved heavy rains, cyclones and floods while maintaining the pace of vaccinations. He also lauded the healthcare workers for ensuring minimum vaccine wastage.“Goa is among the international tourist destinations where everyone is vaccinated,” he added.He said the spread of the virus has been reduced but people should not let the guard down. “We should give importance to COVID-19 protocol as much as to vaccination,” he said.While discussing the concerns over side effects of the vaccine during his interaction with healthworkers, the PM said, “I have heard of vaccine beneficiaries developing side effects. However, for the first time, I saw that a political party developed fever late last night after India achieved its vaccination record. Is there any logic to this?”The PM did not name any political party, however, his comments came after senior Congress leader P Chidambaram asked why the country had to wait till the PM’s birthday for the vaccination milestone.“Happy and grateful that 2.5 crore vaccinations were administered vaccines yesterday. But why did we have to wait until the PM’s birthday? Suppose the PM’s birthday was on December 31 then would the 2.5 crore vaccinations have been done only on the last day of the year? Vaccination is not like cutting a cake on a birthday,” Chidambaram said in a tweet.He also said, “Vaccination is a programme, it is a process. It has to be accelerated every day, not scale a peak on a birthday. Sobering thoughts: a) one-third of the adult population has yet to receive its FIRST dose. b) Only 21% has been FULLY vaccinated.”The former Union minister said the PM should celebrate his birthday everyday as BJP-ruled states “performed” on the day and vaccinated many times their daily averages.“BJP ruled states -- UP, MP, Gujarat and Karnataka -- “perform” on the PM’s birthday and vaccinate many times the daily average. On other days, they are “non-performing” states. I wish the PM celebrated his birthday every day,” said ChidambaramSoon after Chidambaram’s tweet, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said, “Looking forward to many more days of 2.1 crore vaccinations. This pace is what our country needs.”With nearly 25 million shots of the Covid-19 vaccine administered on Friday, India’s inoculation drive nearly doubled its previous single-day record for doses delivered, in a major push to the drive by several states to mark the PM’s birthday.States across the country – led largely by the ones ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – were preparing for a record vaccination day as part of three-week celebrations to mark the Prime Minister’s 71st birthday. The Bihar government had announced it will administer 3 million shots on Friday; Gujarat targeted 3.5 million for the day; Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka said they were preparing for a massive vaccination drive, and Uttar Pradesh launched a 20-day ‘Seva Aur Samarpan Abhiyaan’.According to Co-WIN data analysed by HT, at least eight states – Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttarakhand –set new single-day records of dose administration on Friday.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25mn-jabs-in-a-day-didn-t-go-down-well-with-oppn-modi-101631989356220.html

Naidu’s comments come on the backdrop of a major ruckus on the last day of the monsoon session of the Parliament. An enquiry panel is likely to probe the incident.“Disruption of proceedings amount to contempt of the House, by the logic of which disruption cannot be claimed as a privilege by errant members,” Naidu said. Delivering the second Ram Jethmalani Memorial Lecture on “Is the disruption of parliamentary proceedings an MP’s privilege and/or a facet of parliamentary democracy?”, Naidu described various rules and other provisions for maintaining a certain standard of behaviour of MPs.He pointed out that after the Upper House started recording productivity in 1978, it saw 100% functioning till 1996 – an achievement that was repeated only in 1998 and 2009. Naidu also added that the productivity of Rajya Sabha during 2004-14 has been about 78%, and it declined to about 65% since then, an indication that the House performed better when the BJP was in the Opposition rather than the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disruption-of-proceedings-in-house-not-a-privilege-venkaiahnaidu-101631987435971.html
19-09-2021||India||Sonu Sood, aides evaded taxes worth ₹20 crore, says I-T dept||Bollywood actor Sonu Sood and his associates were involved in ₹20 crore tax evasion and violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) while raising funds from abroad, the Income Tax (I-T) department said on Saturday, as raids on multiple locations linked to the actor continued for the third consecutive day.Since September 16, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the administrative authority of I-T department, has raided 28 premises belonging to Sood, his foundation, associates and a Lucknow-based real estate group in Mumbai, Lucknow, Delhi, Kanpur, Jaipur and Gurugram, during which they allegedly found incriminating evidence pertaining to tax evasion. The agency has claimed that Sood routed his “unaccounted income in the form of bogus unsecured loans from many bogus entities”.“Investigations so far have revealed use of 20 such entries, the providers of which, on examination, have accepted on oath to have given bogus accommodation entries. They have accepted to have issued cheques in lieu of cash. There have been instances where professional receipts have been camouflaged as loans in the books of accounts for the purpose of evasion of tax. It has also been revealed that these bogus loans have been used for making investments and acquiring properties,” the CBDT said in a statement, adding that total tax evasion amounts to more than ₹20 crore, so far.Subsequently, the I-T department also alleged violation of the FCRA by the Sood Charity Foundation, a non-profit charity organisation established during the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak last year.The actor shot to national prominence after he arranged free transport through rail, air and road for numerous migrant workers to reach their home states during the nationwide lockdown clamped last year to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.According to the CBDT, Sood’s organisation has collected donations worth ₹18.94 crore since April 1, 2021. Of this, around ₹1.9 crore has been spent so far on various relief work, while the remaining ₹17 crore is lying unutilised in the bank account of the foundation, it added.“It is seen that funds to the tune of ₹2.1 crore have also been raised by the charity foundation from overseas donors on a crowdfunding platform in violation of (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act) FCRA regulations,” the CBDT statement said.The I-T department had also conducted raids on various premises of a real estate firm, with whom Sood recently entered into a joint venture and “invested substantial funds”. The raids, the statement added, have unearthed “incriminating” evidence pertaining to tax evasion and irregularities in the account books.“The search has revealed that the said group is involved in bogus billing of sub-contracting expenses and siphoning off of funds. Evidence of such bogus contracts found so far is to the tune of over ₹65 crore,” it said.“Further, it has been unearthed that the said infrastructure group has entered into a dubious circular transaction to the tune of ₹175 crore with an infrastructure company based in Jaipur. Further investigations are being carried out to establish the full extent of tax evasion. Cash ₹1.8 crore has been seized during the search (at a company) and 11 lockers have been placed under prohibitory order,” it added.HT has reached out to Sonu Sood and his team, but did not receive any response till the time of print.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonu-sood-aides-evaded-taxes-worth-20-crore-says-i-t-dept-101631987375483.html
19-09-2021||India||Congress needs a permanent president: Shashi Tharoor||Senior Congress leader and Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor on Saturday said the Congress party needs a permanent president. He said leaders like him feel that it will be realised soon. Talking to newsmen after attending a party function in Thodupuzha in Idukki district on Saturday, Tharoor said Sonia Gandhi led the party perfectly for many years and strengthened it, but now since she asked to relieve her of the responsibility, the party will have to find a new president.“We all need Rahul Gandhi to assume the position. If he is still reluctant we have to find an alternative. The party needs a permanent president and the process should speed up,” he said, adding many states will go to the poll in a couple of months. “We need a strong party and a strong leadership,” he said.Tharoor said change is quite visible in Kerala after the new leadership took over and it will help strengthen the party. Tharoor was one among 23 signatories of a letter sent to Congress president Sonia Gandhi last year seeking sweeping changes in the party and strong leadership through organisational elections.After his discharge in the Sunanda Pushkar death case in August, the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram is taking a lot of interest in state politics. He is close to new PCC chief K Sudhakaran who said several times that the party could not exploit the talent of a leader like Tharoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-needs-a-permanent-president-shashi-tharoor-101631962834037.html

Unfortunately, even on an issue where women’s agency must be prioritised and there must be no victim-shaming, opinion seems to be divided in India. Many make statements about the victim being responsible for her fate, which are retracted after some outcry, but still remains part of the discourse around rape.
19-09-2021||Editorials||Punjab: The Congress gamble||By making it untenable for Captain Amarinder Singh to continue as Punjab’s chief minister (CM), and now picking Charanjeet Singh Channi as the next CM, the Congress leadership appears to believe it has warded off anti-incumbency, ended the internal factional battle between Mr Singh and state party president Navjot Singh Sidhu, and strengthened the party in the run-up to the 2022 polls. Appointing Mr Channi, a Dalit leader, as CM is indeed smart political symbolism — he will be the first Dalit CM in a state with 31% Dalits. But this does not take away from the Congress’s poor management of the Punjab crisis, which has potentially jeopardised its electoral prospects and enhanced the trust deficit between senior party leaders and the Nehru-Gandhi family nationally.Captain Amarinder Singh led the party to a win in Punjab in 2017. He is also a rare national figure in the party who is respected for his military service, politics of moderation, and personal temperament. It is indeed true that his popularity had dipped in recent years, and this needed correction. But working with the CM, rather than against him, would have been far more productive. After all, the Congress has lived with CMs with a less-than-impressive track record, and allowed them the opportunity to test their credentials in elections. But the fact that the leadership did not do so stems from Captain being far more autonomous than the party leadership in Delhi (particularly Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi) was comfortable with. Instead, the encouragement to Mr Sidhu, a recent recruit to the party who was openly undermining a party leader; his elevation as party president; and possible signals to party legislators against Mr Singh contributed to undermining the CM’s authority.As the Bharatiya Janata Party showed in Uttarakhand, Karnataka and Gujarat, it has the ability to change CMs without a major backlash — largely due to Narendra Modi’s authority and a culture of organisational discipline. The Congress is attempting to replicate the same pattern of control, except that its party leadership does not carry the same credibility, given its depleted ability to win votes. Mr Singh’s sense of hurt, and fierce criticism of both Delhi and Mr Sidhu, will cost the Congress in terms of both optics and votes in Punjab; it will also lead to deeper unease among other senior leaders about the direction of the party; and Mr Channi’s elevation could well sow the seeds of a new power conflict for leadership in the state unit. Instead of resolving a crisis, the Congress may have created another one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/punjab-the-congress-gamble-101632059460177.html
19-09-2021||Editorials||Facebook’s broken policies, tech, and management||Last week, a series of stories by Wall Street Journal gave yet more evidence of the broken policies, technology, and management at Facebook. The company is selective in how its rules apply to users, letting celebrities and politicians get away with violations such as hate speech. It rolled out new algorithms that rewarded outrage and anger, and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg shot down attempts to address these because it could reduce the amount of time people spent on the service. It dragged its feet in tackling abuse even when it realised that drug cartels and human traffickers were using Facebook for their goals. Its other main product, Instagram, has turned into a source of significant mental harm for a sizable part of its population (teenagers), the company’s own research found. Even when it tried to help by wanting to encourage vaccine use, Facebook failed.
