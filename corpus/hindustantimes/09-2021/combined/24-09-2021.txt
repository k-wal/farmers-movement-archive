24-09-2021||Noida||Noida: Ban on transfer, sale of plots allotted for industries||The Noida authority has banned the transfer or sale of plots that were given for setting up an industry, but are lying vacant and not being used for the said purpose, as it causes losses to the city, in terms of business, and defeats the purpose of allotment.The authority took this decision in its 203rd board meeting that headed by chairperson Sanjiv Mittal and attended by officials from Gautam Budh Nagar. Earlier, the authority used to charge 4% of total property cost, according to the prevailing allotment rate, as transfer fee on industrial property if the owner set up some business on the plot. Around 10% of the total property cost was charged as transfer fee if the plot owner did not start any business and kept the plot vacant. Now, as per the new order, the authority has banned the transfer of plots, which are vacant and the owner has not started any business activity, for which the land was allotted.“We have stopped transfer of non-functional industrial plots because if there is no business on a plot that we have allotted for industrial purposes, we cannot generate employment opportunities in the city. The move may encourage all industrial plot owners to set up businesses,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO of the Noida authority.There are around 10,000 industrial plots in the city, most of which are lying vacant. However, the authority has no data of such plots, which are lying vacant after allotment. Some of the industrial plot owners do not set up industries as they want to sell the plot when they get a better rate in the market, said officials. “Vacant plots in the middle of a sector is a nuisance to residents living nearby because it not results in hygienic issues but also becomes an eyesore,” said Vipin Malhan, president of Noida Entrepreneur association. Meanwhile, the authority has also fixed the transfer fee for commercial plots in the range of 2.5% to 5% of total property cost. Earlier, it was 10% and even higher for some properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-ban-on-transfer-sale-of-plots-allotted-for-industries-101632507910750.html
24-09-2021||Lucknow||UP transporters threaten fare hike, send proposal to state transport authority||In a move likely to boost inflation, transporters in the state have decided to increase charges/fares by 30%. The move came after a meeting of the UP Goods and Transport Association, on Thursday evening, after which they sent the proposal to the state transport authority for approval.Pankaj Shukla, regional in-charge, UP Goods and Transport Association, said, “The Association has taken a unanimous decision to increase charges. The last time – in 2013 – a 7% increase was affected when diesel was around ₹45 per litre. Today it is around ₹90 per litre. We were not increasing rates expecting slashing of diesel rates by the government but it has not happened. Instead the rates are going up.”Not only that, truckers also have to pay toll tax, insurance instalments have increased manifold, motor parts and maintenance have become expensive, Shukla added.However, RP Dwivedi, RTO, administration, said, “Any proposal to increase transport freight charges will be forwarded to the state transport authority because only the state transport authority can decide the rates of transporters.”Sanjay Gupta, president, Uttar Pradesh Adarsh Vyapar Mandal, said, “If transporters increase fares then there will be a proportional increase in rates of all essential commodities. If the proposal to hike fares by 30% is approved then inflation will surely increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-transporters-threaten-fare-hike-send-proposal-to-state-transport-authority-101632507849171.html

Like SC and ST, the demand for conducting a caste census of OBC has gained lots of emphasis across the country.”“The outright refusal by the central government will hurt the whole society as well as the future of the OBC people in the same manner as non-filling of the OBC backlog in government jobs,” Mayawati added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/centres-no-to-caste-census-exposes-bjp-s-obc-politics-maya-101632507671321.html

However, their attempts were foiled by the police, who intercepted them at the traffic intersection of Harola and Sandip Paper Mill. The farmers have been staging protests against the Noida authority regularly since September 1, demanding better compensation for the land that they have given to the authority for the development of Noida. The authority did not allow them to protest outside its administrative building as it affected their public work. Therefore, the farmers’ protest was confined to a vacant plot adjoining a community centre of Harola village-- around 800 metres away from the administrative building. On Friday, a group of farmers tried to reach the authority’s office but were stopped by the police.Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “The farmers have been given adequate space for their protest. But we had to stop them when they tried to march towards the Noida authority office.” Among the many demands of farmers are 64% hike in compensation of the total compensation they received during land acquisition since 1990, 10% (of total land acquired for development) residential plots for habitation, Abadi settlement in villages, construction of a park in each village, construction of a stretch on the lines of an outer ring road around each village and better civic amenities. Sukhbir Yadav, who was leading Friday’s protest, said, “Our agitation will continue until the authority accepts our demands. We will intensify our agitation if the authority does not pay heed to our demands.” “We are talking to farmers and trying to resolve their issues,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty of the Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/police-foil-farmers-bid-to-disrupt-meeting-of-noida-authority-101632507610600.html

Ritu Maheshwari, managing director of NMRC said, “The board has decided to expedite the Greater Noida west Metro project by getting the approval of the Government of India for the DPR positively by November. We are also exploring efficient routes to run bus services by engaging small-size buses to enhance metro ridership and provide last-mile connectivity to commuters,” The 14.95km extension of the Aqua Line in Greater Noida west will comprise nine stations from Noida Sector 51 to Knowledge Park V in Greater Noida. Manoj Vajpayee, general manager of NMRC, said they have issued a tender to select a developer for the Greater Noida west Metro project. “We have received three applications so far. These tender applications are under evaluation,” he said adding that the NMRC submitted the DPR to the Centre, which is expected to give its final approval by mid-November.

Maulana Siddiqui was arrested on Wednesday from Meerut by Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) on charges of running a conversion syndicate, on the clues obtained from the arrested activist, Umar Gautam, during an interrogation the by ATS. A group of students from Aligarh Muslim University took out a protest march on the AMU campus on Friday against the arrest of Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui. They warned district administration that they would intensify their agitation if Maulana was not released at the earliest. AMU students gathered at ‘Bab-e-Syed’ gate of the university and reached Jama Masjid on the campus and offered Friday namaaz there before starting their protest march till ‘Bab-e-Syed’ gate to press for their demand. The angry students also raised slogans against Islamophobia. Police was deployed at the Bab-e-Syed gate where students read out charter of their demand addressed to the President and called for stopping the witch hunt of Muslim preachers, activists, Ulemas, political and community leaders. “Students would not settle until Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui and activist Umar Gautam were released,” said a student leader at Bab-e-Syed gate. Meanwhile, members of civil societies, including former president of Aligarh Muslim University Student Union, M Salman Imtiaz, also staged a separate protest and handed over a memorandum addressed to the governor of Uttar Pradesh to express their anguish for uncalled arrest of Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui. “Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui has been illegally arrested in a false case of illegal religious conversion. It is all part of a conspiracy hatched by the ruling party in the state. All are free to have their religious belief and practice religion of their choice. The Muslim preachers never force others to accept Islam by coercion or threat,” stated Salman M Imtiaz, the former president of Aligarh Muslim University Student Union. In the memorandum, they said the arrest of some Muslim clerics over alleged unlawful religious conversions and the “harassment and eviction of Muslims in Assam on the citizenship issue were creating an atmosphere of fear and insecurity in the minds of Muslims”. “Such witch-hunting of minorities would pose a threat to the peace and stability in the country,” the memorandum added. In Lucknow, the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad asked people to share any information related to Siddiqui and another accused Mohammad Umar Gautam. The ATS has so far arrested 11 people, including Siddiqui, in connection with a religious conversion racket case. Those arrested were booked under relevant sections of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2020 and the Indian Penal Code, the officials said.Inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/conversion-racket-case-amu-students-protest-against-arrest-of-islamic-scholar-kaleem-siddiqui-101632507310046.html

24-09-2021||Noida||Residents rejoice as transfer charges on resale of property halved in Noida||In a move that may boost homebuyers’ sentiments, the Noida authority has reduced the transfer charges it levies on the resale of a property by 50%.In its 203rd board meeting held on Friday, the authority decided to reduce the transfer of memorandum (TM) fee, commonly known as transfer fee/charge, from 5% to 2.5% on residential category, which includes plots and flats. Officials said that the new charges will be applicable on the properties allotted after 2011. The transfer fee is levied on the resale of plots and flats at the time of registry.The move comes after the Uttar Pradesh government issued directions to the authority to reduce the fee as it will benefit homebuyers.“We have reduced the TM fee in order to provide relief to residents and those who want to buy a property in this industrial town,” said Sanjiv Mittal, chairman of the Noida authority, after the board meeting held at the authority’s main administrative building in Sector 6.In a resale property transaction, the Noida authority at present charges 5% of total flat/plot cost as per the prevailing allotment rate as transfer fee. For example, for a ₹1 crore flat, a buyer will now have to pay ₹2.5 lakh as transfer charge instead of ₹5 lakh earlier. Residents have expressed happiness at the decision by the authority.“We are happy that the Noida authority finally accepted our long standing demands on TM charges. We hope it will benefit the realty sector in the city,” said Rajesh Sahay, general secretary of the Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations, an umbrella body of Noida’s AOAs.However, a section of residents said that the authority should do away with the transfer fee completely.“The government charges around 7% of total property cost as registry fee. Then why did they levy additional transfer fee in Noida. The authority should remove this fee completely,” said SK Nagrath, a retired army official and president of Jaypee Aman AOA. Anti-smog tower at DND The Noida authority also approved a proposal to install an anti-smog tower along the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) road, near the Film City in Noida, to mitigate air pollution in the area.

The most worrying situation is in Siddharthnagar district where over half (53.5 per cent) of children do not enrol in class 9 after passing class 8, says a report sent by the state government to the union education ministry. The findings were even discussed during the last meeting of the Project Approval Board (PAB) of Samgara Shiksha Abhiyan in New Delhi, minutes of which were made available in public domain only on September 17.The report concedes that the overall transition rate in the state is 87% at secondary level, which means that only 87% children of previous year grade 8 enrolment were admitted to grade 9 in 2019-20. Moreover, in case of girls’ transition rate, it is only 81.5% and girls transition rate from elementary to secondary in 13 districts is less than 65%.The districts in which transition rate from is below 65% include Siddharthnagar (53.5%), Sitapur (56.2%), Hardoi (56.9%), Shravasti (57.1%), Sambhal (61.2%), Budaun (61.5%), Shahjahanpur(61.8%), Chitrakoot (62.4%), Farrukhabad (63.2%), Pilibhit (63.6%), Banda(64.5%), Bahraich ( 64.8%) and Basti (64.9%), say the minutes of the meeting that also finalised the annual work plan and budget of Samagra Shiksha for UP for 2021-22.“The report sent to the union ministry of education also points out that the annual average dropout at elementary level is 2.46% in the state. For boys, dropout rate at elementary level was 1.9 % and for girls it was 3% in 2019-20. At secondary level, it is around 14.4%. For boys, dropout rate at secondary level was 14.5% and for girls it was 14.2% in 2019-20,” said a senior state education department official requesting anonymity.In terms of gender parity index (GPI) at secondary levels, the minutes of PAB meeting duly note that GPI at secondary (0.93 per cent) and higher secondary level (0.94 per cent) in UP remains an area of concern. “In this regard, state needs to focus specially on those districts where the gender gap in gross enrolment ratio (GER) is more than 10% at secondary level like Aligarh (25.08), Hathras (17.67), Mathura (15.19), Mainpuri (12.82), Etah (12.61), Baghpat (12.33) etc,” add the minutes of the PAB meeting a copy of which is with HT.Academician and former vice chancellor, Uttar Pradesh Rajarshi Tandon Open University, prof MP Dube said the districts identified as having high annual average dropout at secondary level as well as those having higher gender gap in GER at secondary level are lesser developed ones.“The inability of educated youngsters to secure jobs based on their educational qualifications works as a major factor in parents getting reluctant to allow kids to pursue secondary or higher education. High degree of insecurity in this regard as well as the feeling that an educated youngster failing to secure a job may be reluctant to join the family trade like farming etc also acts a deterrent,” he added.Prof Dube said there was a need to undertake district specific interventions where these problems exist like counselling of parents and students alike, providing opportunities of acquiring vocational skills for them and extending financial or material support to bright kids.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-35-students-dropping-out-after-class-8-in-13-up-dists-govt-data-101632507009348.html

24-09-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Congress minority dept begins distribution of sankalp patra targeting SP||The Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) minority department on Friday launched a campaign to distribute a 16-point sankalp patra that contains some promises, which target the Samajwadi Party (SP). The Congress proposes to make these promises to the minorities in the 2022 UP assembly election.The promise to open tanneries closed during the SP regime, a judicial probe into the riots that took place during the tenure of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav as chief minister and action to punish those found guilty by the Mathur Commission (that probed the communal violence in Kanpur in 1992) are some of the major points incorporated in the sankalp patra.It mentions that the SP-BSP (Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party) government led by the then chief minister and SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav failed to act on the recommendations of the Mathur Commission.“We are distributing this 16-point sankalp patra drawing the attention of people in front of the main mosques in all the assembly constituencies after Friday prayers. We will make the distribution in front of 8432 mosques on four Fridays (September 24 to October 15) to reach out to nearly 2.5 million people. We will distribute the sankalp patras in front of at least six mosques every Friday across the state,” said UPCC minority department chairman Shahnawaz Alam.“A committee headed by former Union minister Salman Khurshid has been constituted to work out the Congress manifesto for the 2022 assembly election. We will request the manifesto committee to incorporate some of the points in the party’s election manifesto for 2022 polls,” he said.The other promises that the minority department proposes to fulfill if the Congress is voted to power in 2022 in the state include withdrawal of cases registered during the protests against CAA-NRC (Citizenship Amendment Act-National Register for Citizens), enactment of a law to check mob lynching, Maulana Azad hostels for minorities in every district on the pattern of Ambedkar hostels and compensation to the “innocent” persons against whom the cases under cow protection law have been dismissed by the high court.The UPCC also brought out a booklet recently targeting the BSP, SP and the BSP alike for taking the state on what it called the path of decline. There are indications that more such sankalp patras may be brought out by the party’s other departments and wings in the coming weeks.“Muslims have been a traditional vote bank for the Congress. The Muslims vote for a candidate who can defeat the BJP. This is an obvious effort to bring back the traditional voters back to the Congress. The move though has been made close to 2022 elections may work to some extent only,” said professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-congress-minority-dept-begins-distribution-of-sankalp-patra-targeting-sp-101632506110645.html

The expulsion of the two top BSP leaders before the assembly election had surprised the political observers as well as BSP workers.At that time, Verma and Rajbhar had said that they would meet Mayawati to clear misunderstandings. “We will wait for communication from the BSP chief. When she refuses to withdraw the expulsion, we will think about joining another political party,” Verma and Rajbhar had said. Mayawati refused to open the door to the duo, stating that she will not tolerate indiscipline by senior leaders or workers.Earlier, seven rebel BSP MLAs Aslam Raini, Aslam Ali, Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Hargovind Bhargava, Sushma Patel and Vandana Singh had also met Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav. There was speculation that these rebel MLAs will join the SP soon. Recently, former minister and BSP leader Ambika Chaudhary rejoined the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/expelled-bsp-leaders-meet-samajwadi-party-chief-akhilesh-yadav-101632505809003.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Maha schools to reopen from Oct 4, religious places from Oct 7||With the daily caseload of Covid-19 cases showing a slight drop over the past few weeks, the Maharashtra government announced opening of schools from October 4 and religious places of all faiths from October 7, the first day of Navratri festival. Primary and secondary schools will reopen after almost 18 months after the closure of the schools because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Offline teaching for Classes 5 to 12 in rural areas and 8 to 12 in urban areas will begin in the first phase, with the option of online teaching open for students. After consultation with the task forces of doctors, experts from education sector, officials from other department, the school education department announced the decision. The department has issued a detailed SOP for schools, teachers and parents to follow to avoid schools from becoming super spreaders. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has given the nod to the proposal, but district collectors and municipal commissioners have been given the final authority to take a call on the basis of the local Covid-19 situation. Local bodies in cities and districts with a high number of cases are likely to defer the decision. The guidelines issued by the government have recommendation for health clinics on school premises, linking schools with local health centers, roping in local doctors, identifying students with the Covid-19 symptoms, taking them to doctors and taking a call on their attendance in the school. The guidelines have also recommended psychological management of students in the backdrop of the Covid-19 caused stress and repercussions. It has also stressed on need for sensitisation of the teachers over treatment to the students, especially those infected of the virus. The guidelines also mandate social distancing, proper sanitisation and ventilation in classrooms during working hours. They also talk about the precautions to be taken by students and parents at home. The guidelines have also pressed for the parent-teachers meetings for better awareness about the pandemic, precautions and implementation of the protocol. The government has also suggested use of CSR for health-related expenditure for sanitizers, masks, oximeters and even for fans, etc. The department had issued an SOP on August 10 after announcing to reopen the schools from August 17. The decision was stayed by Thackeray after task forces raised red flag amid the threat of a potential third wave. The task forces had opposed the plan in the wake of the threat of the third wave, rise in cases in Kerala and instances of shutting down of schools in parts of the world because of the infection among students. The state, while deferring the decision, asked district administrations to aggressively vaccinate teachers and non-teaching staffs. “We had issued guidelines while opening the schools for Classes 5 to 12 in July and had issued one in August. Additional guidelines are being issued after our detailed discussion with the paediatric task force and health department. The guidelines issued today are comprehensive and what we feel the best in the country,” she said. The minister said that physical attendance will not be mandatory for students. “The consent of parents for attendance of the ward will be mandatory. Students can opt for online classes through the App, Youtube channels and other facilities made available to them. The schools will have to make the online modules available for students who want to avail the facility. We have also not made uniform compulsory to enable students to follow the protocol related to changing of clothes after returning home,” she said. Gaikwad said teachers and non-teaching staff are expected to be fully vaccinated and local administrations have been taking due efforts for it. “Bringing back dropped out children because of the crisis arising out of pandemic and lockdown is a task before us. We are chalking out a plan to ensure it,” she said. Head of state paediatric task force Dr Suhas Prabhu said monitoring the guidelines was important and the state authorities have been asked to do it properly. “We have asked the government to form a committee of stakeholders including people from health, education, local authorities, local representative for the effective monitoring and disseminating the information. It will help in monitoring and resolving the problems faced by the students, parents. We have also recommended norms for steps need to be taken in case of infection among students. We have suggested closing down the school if 10 people (including teachers, staff) or 10% of the total attendees are infected. The measures also have been suggested to take in case of less infections are reported,” he said. “We cannot keep the schools shut as the virus is not going to go altogether and physical schooling is important for all-round development of children. It is the emotional need of the children as they get to go out, play with friends, mingle around in the peer groups. In the absence of these things, they get upset, depressed and show unusual symptoms or develop bad habits,” he added. Meanwhile, about the reopening of religious place, Thackeray said that devotees will have to follow Covid-19 protocol and the management of the religious places will have to ensure it. “We prepared for the potential third wave after the number of cases from second wave started subsiding. We will have to be more cautious while opening up activities,” he has said. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party had staged state-wide protests last month demanding reopening of religious places. Party leaders had also criticised Thackeray government for imposing restrictions only on Hindu festivals The state has advised devotees above 65 years and below 10 years and those with comorbidities to not visit religious places. The detailed SOP issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, also clarified that religious places in the containment zones announced by the local authorities are not allowed to open. The management of such places has been directed to determine the time slots and the number of people to be allowed per slot to avoid crowding. They have also been told to properly manage the queue and maintain a distance of 6-ft between devotees. The managements have also been mandated with the responsibility of crowd management at parking lots and keeping separate entry and exits of the premises, distribution of prasad, sprinkling of holy water and touching idols, statues and holy books too has been banned. The entry inside the premises without mask and of the person with Covid-19 symptoms has been prohibited. Managements have been mandated to follow due procedure of isolation and proper sanitisation if any person found infected on the premises. Schools reactSchools are shocked with the decision. “Reopening of schools especially when children are not even vaccinated makes no sense. We assumed the government will first reopen colleges and then focus in schools, but this new announcement has shocked us all,” said the principal of a state board school in Dadar. While state board schools have time and again complained about the need for better infrastructure and more teachers in order to implement hybrid teaching model, many non-state board schools have been open to hybrid classrooms. “In international boards, Classes 10, 11 and 12 have board exams and already these students have suffered because of missing school and practical classes for one academic year. Our schools have not more than 25-30 students per class, plus we have the infrastructure to ensure students follow social distancing protocols while in school,” said Kavita Aggarwal, chairperson of Mumbai International Schools’ Association (MISA) and director of D G Khaitan School, Malad. Parent groups, too, are unhappy. “The government is expecting schools to reopen without any preparation. The government has no data on how many teachers and staff are vaccinated. And what’s worse is that children are not vaccinated. It’s risky to open school knowing that many students will be using public transport to travel,” said Anubha Sahai, president of Indiawide Parents’ Association.

24-09-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand red-flags ‘demographic change’, says one community forced to migrate||Dehradun: There has been an “unprecedented” increase in population in parts of Uttarakhand forcing “members of a certain community” to shift out, the Uttarakhand government said on Friday evening, ordering police and administrative officers in the hill state’s 13 districts to set up peace committees, track “illegal land deals” and prepare a list of outsiders with criminal antecedents.“Due to unprecedented rise in population in certain areas of the state, the demography of those areas has been majorly affected. And due to this demographic change, members of a certain community are forced to migrate from those areas. Also, there are possibilities that the communal harmony in those areas may be disturbed,” a government statement issued on Friday evening said.It also said that there is a possibility of an exodus of people because of this demographic change.The government order was finalised after a high-level meeting on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said.The Congress alleged the government order was aimed at polarising the politics in the state on communal lines ahead of the assembly elections in early 2022. “They are trying to do what they have been doing in UP,” said Suryakant Dhasmana, the Congress’s state vice president.Devendra Bhasin, vice president in the state BJP, countered him, insisting that the decision was aimed at securing national security since the hill state is a border state.The police and the district administrators have been ordered to ensure regular meetings of the proposed district-level peace committees and “identify areas where antisocial elements are living”.“A list of all such people should be made who have a criminal background and are living in Uttarakhand. A verification of their profession and domicile status should be done to make their records. The DMs (district magistrates) should also monitor the illegal land dealings in their districts and check whether someone is selling his land out of fear or pressure. If it is found so, then they should stop it and take strict action against those responsible for it”, the statement added.The district authorities have also been told to identify foreign nationals who are using forged voter identity cards and other government ID proofs.“I can only say that the police will take action as per the directions of the government,” director general of police (DGP) Ashok Kumar said, refusing to elaborate on the government order.Former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Aloke B Lal, who retired as Uttarakhand’s Director-General (Prosecution), expressed his apprehension about involving the police.“Demographic change, if any, should be checked by the revenue department and not the police…. It is not the job of police. However, if it is found that the crime rate has increased in areas due to the increase in population or demographic change, then the police could be involved. Similarly, police can be involved if it receives communication from their counterparts in other states about criminal elements from there settling in parts of Uttarakhand,” said Lal. Soon after the government announcement, BJP leader from Rudraprayag Ajendra Ajay said the move was linked to his letter to chief minister PS Dhami about what he called “increasing land-jihad” in the hill areas.“I had urged Dhami that concrete steps should be taken to check this land-jihad as people from the state are migrating to other states and people of a certain community from plains are migrating to hilly areas of the state, which is resulting in demographic changes here,” he said. BJP’s Devendra Bhasin said it was a good decision to identify outsiders and figure out what they are up to. “This exercise is meant to ensure such elements are identified and unable to disturb the communal harmony of Dev Bhoomi, the land of Gods”, he said.Congress’ Suryakant Dhasmana, however, dubbed it as an attempt to divert the attention of people. “This attempt at polarisation on communal lines is being made as the BJP government doesn’t have much to show to people in the election year. But such gimmicks won’t succeed in the state, where people of all communities have been living peacefully for centuries”, he said.Dehradun based political analyst SMA Kazmi also opined that politics could have dictated the decision. “Why should BJP suddenly issue such an order that demographic changes are happening, attempts are being made to disturb communal harmony in the state. One of the BJP leaders had even written to the chief minister PS Dhami to take cognisance of the zameen-jihad (land-jihad) in the hilly areas of the state. All this is being done to demonise a particular community and gain politically from such an exercise”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-red-flags-demographic-change-says-one-community-forced-to-migrate-101632505028971.html

24-09-2021||Lucknow||Mahant named Balbeer as successor in his last will, says lawyer||PRAYAGRAJ: Even as all eyes were on the Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani for the appointment of the next mahant of Baghambari Gaddi Math and Bade Hanuman Mandir in Prayagraj, the lawyer of late Narendra Giri claimed that the Mahant had made three wills in the capacity of the head of the math.“The first will was made by the late Mahant on January 7, 2010. In this, he had mentioned his disciple Balbeer Giri as his successor. However, he got the will changed in 2011, after I became his lawyer,” said Rishi Shankar Dwivedi, Mahant’s advocate.The second will was made by Mahant Narendra Giri on August 29, 2011. He declared his disciple Anand Giri as his successor, added the lawyer, a resident of Allahpur locality of Prayagraj. At that time, yoga guru Anand Giri was very close to Mahant Narendra Giri and managed most of the affairs of the Bade Hanuman temple and the Math in his absence. However, cancelling both the earlier wills, the late Mahant made his third and last will on June 4, 2020, in which he again nominated Balbeer Giri as his successor, said advocate Dwivedi. The lawyer said Narendra Giri had called him around 12.45pm on the fateful day (September 20) and said he wanted to discuss something very important, but did not disclose the issue over the phone. “The will dated June 4, 2020 was signed by Narendra Giri in my presence and that is his last will, which is registered,” said Man Singh, a lawyer of the lower court and one of the two witnesses to Narendra Giri’s last will.The second witness of the will is another lawyer of the city, RK Upadhyay. In the purported suicide note recovered from the room of the Baghambari Gaddi Math where Narendra Giri’s body was found also mentioned Balbeer Giri as his successor. A video recording found by the police in the late Mahant’s mobile phone was also said to reiterate the content of the suicide note, including naming Balbeer Giri as his successor. However, many senior seers including Acharya Mahamandaleshwar of Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani Kailashanad Giri dubbed the purported suicide note as fake and maintained that the Niranjani Akhada would be taking the final call on Mahant Narendra Giri’s successor. Significantly, the appointment of the successor at Baghamabri Gaddi Math had always been made on the basis of the will left by the preceding head, informed a senior seer of the Akhada. He said even Mahant Narendra Giri was appointed the head of Baghambari Gaddi on the basis of the will left behind by his predecessor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mahant-named-balbeer-as-successor-in-his-last-will-says-lawyer-101632502388727.html

The voter turnout is also encouraging,” State Election Commissioner Dr Deepak Prasad said at a press conference after the polling was over at 5 pm. Asked about the police firing at Navgarh panchayat in Aurangabad, the SEC said it was a minor incident. Sources said police had to fire six rounds to disperse miscreants who were trying to capture a booth at the behest of a Mukhiya candidate around 9.30 am. The police arrested four persons in this connection. In another incident, anti-social elements partially damaged a police jeep at Tarapur in Munger. Prasad said complaints related to polling malpractices or other discrepancies were negligible due to measures like verifying voters identity through biometric machines and webcasting. “However, 26 persons were rounded up for bogus voting,” he said. Asked about complaints of biometric system not working at a few places, the SEC said these snags were promptly addressed. In the first phase, polling was held for 4,646 posts, for which 15,078 candidates were in the fray. As per SEC data till 3 pm, male voter turnout was 46.67% and female 55.06%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1st-phase-of-panchayat-polls-over-turnout-60-101632501668742.html

The matter came to light recently when Bipin Chauhan, a resident of Sisauni village under Kisanpur police station, approached a nearby State Bank of India’s customer service point (CSP) in Supaul to open an account to get a job card under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA).However, much to his surprise, the CSP officials informed him that there was already an account in his name at the Union Bank of India, Supaul branch, with ₹9.99 crore as balance. The account was opened on the basis of Chauhan’s Aadhar number, but the photograph and signature were not his.Declaring it as a case of fraud, the bank officials said they were shocked as to how the account was opened without mandatory KYC (know your customer) documents.Santosh Kumar Khan, chief manager, Ranchi circle office, who was probing the incident, on Friday said it was a case of cyber crime. “The account in the name of the daily wage labourer was opened in October, 2016. Till February 2017, transactions worth crores were done in the account. I have directed the branch manager to inquire into the matter,” he said.On the other hand, branch manager Ravi Shankar denied that the account had a balance of ₹9.99 crore. “I have checked the account, no such amount is in it.” He, however, remained tight-lipped over claims that transactions worth crores were done through the account.This is the third such incident in quick succession in Bihar. Recently, ₹962 crore was credited to the accounts of two school students, while a man in Khagaria district was arrested after he refused to return ₹5.50 lakh erroneously credited in his account in April last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/transactions-worth-crores-done-through-fraud-account-created-on-daily-wage-earner-s-probe-on-101632501368583.html
24-09-2021||Lucknow||Nobody can glorify terrorists when BJP is in power: Yogi||GorakhpurGORAKHPUR Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said that the previous regime in UP adopted a soft approach towards terror outfits and withdrew cases filed against terrorists. “But today, when the saffron party is in power nobody can dare to glorify terrorists,” said the CM while addressing the crowd during a programme to mark the 152nd death anniversary of Mahant Digvijay Nath and seventh death anniversary of Mahant Avaidyanath, former head priests of Gorakhnath temple, of which Yogi Adityanath is current Mahant. “All of you are aware of the success we have achieved under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. With his inspiration, home minister Amit Shah scrapped Article 370, revoking the special status of J&K. The government also gave citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan by making laws and welcomed everyone who was stuck abroad. The earlier government did not have the courage to do this all,” said Yogi Adityanath. Enumerating the achievements of his government, the chief minister said with the construction of Ram temple, development of Ayodhya Dham and grand Deepotsav celebrations, Ayodhya has become the first Puri (pilgrimage cenre) among the seven in India and it’s grandeur is being watched by the entire world. Underlining the contribution of Gorakshpeeth in the Ram temple movement, the CM said the Ram Lalla idol came up at the Babri site in 1949 and seers fought a long battle for the temple under the guidance of Mahant Digvijay Nath and then under the guidance of Mahant Avaidyanath. Mahant Paramhans (litigant in Ayodhya case) fought the Ram temple suit under the guidance of Mahant Digvijay Nath. “Today, when the construction of Ram temple is underway, the soul of saints associated with the movement would be happy and at peace,” he added.Yogi Adityanath said a large chunk of Indian population, more than that of UP, attended the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj and this grand event was recognised as cultural heritage by Unesco. “Residents of Uttar Pradesh are representatives of Lord Ram, Krishna, Gorakhnath, Gautam Buddha and Kabir and they should feel proud of this,” said the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nobody-can-glorify-terrorists-when-bjp-is-in-power-yogi-101632501308738.html

Recently, an all-party delegation from Bihar, led by chief minister Nitish Kumar, had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press for a caste enumeration in Census 2021.First to react was former CM and Rashtriya Janata Dal president Lalu Prasad. “All types of birds, animals, trees and plants can be counted but not humans belonging to the other backward classes and the extremely backward classes. Wow! Why does the BJP-RSS have so much of antipathy for the backwards? Caste census would have benefited all. It would have given an exact idea of population of respective segments,” he tweeted in Hindi.Leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav served an ultimatum to CM Nitish Kumar and asked him to clear his stand within three days. “We will continue our fight for caste census and will request the CM to clear his stand in three days. After that we will decide how to take this fight forward,” said Tejashwi while talking to mediapersons. Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathore said the CM should clarify whether he is with BJP or with the people’s sentiment. Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, whose party HAM-S is an NDA constituent, said, “It was agreed to conduct caste census in the all-party meeting, then why was the affidavit not given as per the decision. We will again request the central government to consider it.” Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, president of the ruling Janata Dal (United) to which CM Kumar belongs, said one should wait for the SC decision. “The census has not started yet. The Centre has only placed before the SC its views,” he said. The BJP, which was part of the all-party delegation that met the PM, justified the Centre’s stance. “The central government has clarified the whole situation by stating the reasons for not getting it done in the affidavit. It has been said that in the SECC (Socio-Economic Caste Census) conducted a few years back, four lakh 28,000 castes have been mentioned, “said BJP’s Bihar unit president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unease-in-nda-after-centre-affidavit-on-caste-census-101632501249107.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to reopen religious places from October 7||Maharashtra government on Friday announced that it will reopen all religious places starting October 7. The chief minister’s office in a tweet said that all religious places of worship will reopen on the first day of Navratri.“All temples in Maharashtra to be reopened from October 7 - the first day of Navratri,” the Maharashtra chief minister’s office said. The government faced a lot of criticism from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for not opening religious places of worship.The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government earlier did not reopen places of worship fearing a rise in Covid-19 cases. It also cited that a rise in cases could also accelerate the chances of a probable second wave.The Maharashtra government imposed several restrictions on the Ganesh Chaturthi festival, which is one of the most important festivals in the state, due to Covid-19. Maharashtra saw muted celebrations for the second year in a row as the state welcomed the Hindu deity under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic.The state government asked citizens to strictly adhere to Covid-19 preventive measures. “The Maharashtra government has prepared itself for a third wave, but with all precautions, the state is allowing relaxations in various activities,” Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said.“Although daily Covid-19 cases are showing a declining trend, everybody should take care and follow Covid-19 protocols. While religious places are going to be opened, people still need to wear face masks and use hand sanitisers. The management of religious places will be responsible for the implementation of such measures,” Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Places of worship were reopened in the state in November last year. They were closed down when the second wave hit the nation and also took a toll on the state. Maharashtra was among the states which saw a record number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths due to Covid-19.Maharashtra also reopened schools for classes 5 to 12 in rural areas and 8 to 12 in urban areas starting October 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-reopen-religious-places-from-october-7-101632501111311.html

He was rushed to primary health centre (PHC) and was referred to the sadar hospital at Motihari where he was declared brought dead,” SHO Paswan said. “The RTI activist sustained four bullet injuries. We are looking at all angles,” said Abhinav Dhuman, a trainee Indian Police Service (IPS) officer posted as subdivisional police officer (SDPO), Areraj. Agrawal, who has been working as an RTI activist since 2009, had survived an attempt on his life on February 16, 2020. “He has fought a long battle to remove land encroachment in and around Harshidih area. Miscreants attacked and ransacked our house on February 16, 2020. His wife was dragged on the road in broad daylight. He had sued many people in this regard, but no one was arrested. We applied for protection several times, to no avail,” said Vijay Agrawal, the slain RTI activist’s father. Vijay Agrawal said his son had brought to light houses illegally built on eight acres of land worth crores near Gudri Bazar, Jadavpur Road and Pakadia Road (in Harshidih area). “In the 2020, a house situated on encroached land in Dhankhariya near Harshidih was demolished by the administration. Following a case filed with the Lokayukta in Patna, a petrol pump operating on encroached land was also sealed. Cases were also filed over a cold storage and residential house built on the encroached land,” he said. The RTI activist had earlier lodged a complaint in the subdivisional court at Areraj, accusing nearly hundred local people of implicating him in a false case of murder.When contacted, Navin Chand Jha, East Champaran’s superintendent of police, said, “A special investigation team has been formed under SDPO Areraj to probe the matter and arrest the assailants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rti-activist-shot-dead-in-east-champaran-101632500588583.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Eight hours work shift for women police personnel in Maharashtra||The director-general of police (DGP) of Maharashtra Sanjay Pandey on Friday said that the women police personnel in the state will no longer have to work for more than eight hours. Their work shifts would be of only eight hours. At present, the plan is already in effect in cities like Nagpur, Pune, Amravati and Navi Mumbai and now it would be extended in the entire state, he said.The move intends to reduce work stress on the women cops, who along with doing professional duties also have the burden of family responsibilities. According to police sources, the DGP office had received many complaints from women police personnel from across the state informing the top administration that their personal life was being adversely affected as they were on duty, longer than their shift hours. Previously, like others, the women cops were doing 12-hours shifts. Taking cognisance of the issue, the top cop first implemented the new working hour set-up for women in four cities as a pilot. After it received a good response, the top administration has now directed all the district police superintendents, commissioners and other unit commanders to start implementing the new order. The police department plans to implement the new order across the state in a month’s period, an officer said. Commenting on the development National Congress Party leader and MP Supriya Sule tweeted, “The Maharashtra government has decided to reduce the working hours of women police officers from 12 hours to 8 hours a day. This is a good initiative by the state government as this will help to have better balance between family and the duties of women officers.” Sule, added, “I thank chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Dilip Walse-Patil for taking this decision.” The decision is being welcomed by the female police personnel as it has come at a time when the festival season has just started in the state. During festive season due to regular bandobasts, nakabandi, preventive action drives and other duties, the workload is very high on cops and especially women cops find it difficult to make a balance between professional and family responsibilities.Earlier, former Mumbai police commissioner Datta Padsalgikar had also implemented 8-hours duty for constables, in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eight-hours-work-shift-for-women-police-personnel-in-maharashtra-101632500288357.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Fire Brigade to serve notice to Khar building over defunct firefighting system||The Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) has found violations of fire safety measures in Nutan Villa building in Khar, where a medium fire occurred on Thursday evening killing one woman. MFB will send a notice to the building owner and cut off electricity and water supply, fire brigade authorities said on Friday. The fire occurred in an electric duct on the first floor and spread to the ground floor of the building. However, as the duct connected all eight floors of the building, the entire building was smoked logged during firefighting. The fire brigade found the building’s firefighting system was not operational. A medium intensity (level-2) fire was reported in the residential building in Khar (West) at 6.58pm on Thursday, trapping three residents including a 10-year-old on the seventh floor. Among those who were trapped, Hema Jagwani, 40, was rescued and moved to Hinduja Hospital where she was declared dead on arrival by doctors. Sangita Thakur, 45, and Palak Jagwani, 10, were rescued by MFB using turn table ladders. A senior MFB official said, “While all three women were trapped on the seventh floor, two of them (Palak and Thakur) moved toward a window of the room, hence the fire brigade was able to rescue them from the outside. However, the deceased (Hema) was in an external room with access to the lobby where she got stuck while trying to take the staircase to exit the building. If she had also moved toward a window, we would have been able to rescue her.” All the eight floors of the building are occupied by one family. The fire brigade official said, “Other members of the family who were on lower floors were probably alerted sooner and were able to exit using the staircase. We are not able to determine exactly what happened regarding the deceased, but she probably did not have visibility as the entire building was smoke logged.” The fire was doused after about four hours of firefighting at 11.08pm on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fire-brigade-to-serve-notice-to-khar-building-over-defunct-firefighting-system-101632500168512.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Maha promulgates ordinance to ensure OBC quota in local body polls||The Maharashtra government on Friday promulgated an ordinance to ensure reservation to Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates of rural local body elections six months after the Supreme Court struck down the 27% reservation available stating that it breached the cap mandated by the apex court.With this ordinance, the state will amend two laws — the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayats — to ensure reservation.However, the amendments will not be applicable for the upcoming district bypolls to be held on October 5 in Palghar, Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim and Nagpur, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte clarified. “Considering the SC decision, it is clear that the reservation for OBC communities in local bodies no longer exists. To provide representation to the OBC community, it has decided to reserve 27% seats for the (OBC) community without exceeding the 50% total reservation quota in the local bodies’ as an alternative solution, hence, proposed the amendments in Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act. Since the state legislature is not in session and the governor is convinced with the urgency of the matter, this ordinance is promulgated,” the rural development department issued a statement on Friday.Kunte said that the state election commission (SEC) clarified to the government that the ordinance would not be implemented in bypolls. “Soon after the cabinet decision, we wrote to the state election commission requesting to consider the fresh reservation quota for holding bypolls in the backdrop of the ordinance. We told them if not considered then it may antagonize the OBC community, which may lead to a law-and-order situation in the state but they said they are unable to consider it at this stage and are following SC orders,” Kunte said“The commission further assured to consider the amendment for OBC reservation if the Apex Court issues fresh directives,” he added.On March 4, the Supreme Court ruled that the reservation for OBC in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% cap in reservation quota mandated by it. It also directed the state to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which, the reservation quota of the community be fixed and also allowed the state election commission to hold local bodies polls without having reservations for OBCs.There are five laws that govern urban and rural local bodies and their elections. The remaining three are the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act and Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and the Industrial Townships Act — fall under the state urban development department.A decision to bring amendments for OBC reservation in the above three legislations was also taken in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday and the ordinance to this effect (to amend the laws) will be sent to the governor for final approval soon, the officials said.“Any change in the bypolls has to be done at the directions of the Supreme Court because it has directed us to hold the bypolls based on open category candidates. If there is any change for whatever reason, the direction has to come from SC. We are following their directives and can’t change on our own,” state election commissioner UPS Madan told HT last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-promulgates-ordinance-to-ensure-obc-quota-in-local-body-polls-101632499928534.html

Police said one of the employees even possessed a licensed revolver, but he let the robber flee without resistance. Police suspect the involvement of some insider in the crime. Questioning of the employees is on, police said. The incident occurred around 5pm when Gagandeep Singh and Prince, employees of Shankar Metals, reportedly entered the building after collecting cash from the market. According to the employees, they were waiting for the lift to reach the firm’s office on the fifth floor when a man walked up to them and flashed a gun. The robber asked them to hand over the bag and threatened to kill them. The accused snatched the bag containing the cash and fled. The employees said before they could react, the robber had already fled from the scene. The firm’s owner Deepak Arora alias Shankar said his employees informed him about the incident and he immediately alerted the police. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, Industrial Area-B) Randhir Singh said the matter “looks fishy”. “The complainant has no record of the money transaction or the document to show the sale of gold. The employees neither resisted nor raised an alarm,” he said. The CCTV cameras captured the robber fleeing with his accomplice on a motorcycle after the incident. “An FIR has been registered at the Division 6 police station. Questioning of the employees is being done. The matter will be solved soon,” the ACP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/robbery-at-gunpoint-35-lakh-snatched-from-two-gold-trading-firm-staffers-in-ludhiana-101632499628416.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Bollywood movies used to lure Thane rural residents to get their vaccination||When nothing else worked, good old Bollywood came to the rescue of the district authorities and social workers who were struggling to deal with the vaccine hesitancy by those in the rural belt of Thane district.Social worker, Baban Harne, from Shahpur made use of popular movies and shared the photos of these celebrities getting vaccinated to encourage and motivate the villagers to get jabbed. Like Baban, many Anganwadi teachers, Asha workers and other social workers have worked hard to remove the sceptical mindset and with the help of freebies and other perks, motivated many to come forward and get vaccinated in rural areas.Since mid-July, when the response from villagers were low and so were the number of vaccine doses available across the district, the vaccination drive has increased to more than 96%. Not only has the availability and the number of centres increased but also the awareness related to getting inoculated. Such is the response that Thane District’s health department has requested the Collector to make provisions for a mobile vaccination facility in rural areas.“Not every village or tribal settlement has a health centre in its vicinity. In many places, we have converted schools and gram panchayat offices into vaccination centres for the convenience of physically-challenged, bed-ridden and aged individuals. Hence, there is a need for a mobile vaccination centre that will help provide better facilities to villagers. We have requested permission from the District Collector for the same,” said Dr Manish Renge, District Health Officer, Thane.Those residing in the rural areas and especially in tribal hamlets within Bhiwandi, Shahpur and Murbad areas had a lot of misconceptions about the vaccine. This led to a low turnout initially in these areas. Many used to hide within their homes or in the fields to avoid interacting with Zilla Parishad officials. Some also feared that they would be forced to get vaccinated.“Villages in areas like Talwada, Rodvahal, Jambhulpada, Chillarvadi, Junavali are complete Adivasi Padas, wherein resistance to get vaccinated was quite evident. Many feared that the vaccination would impact their fertility. We started providing stationery to kids in these villages and used this as an opportunity to show movies of well-known Bollywood actors. Later, we showed them pictures of the same actors getting jabbed,” said Harne.“Children would go home and tell their family members, especially mothers. In many instances, the mothers also watched movies with us and get inspired to get vaccinated. Along with the womenfolk, their husbands and senior citizens also stepped forward to get inoculated. Thus, almost 60% of the population in these tribal villages changed their mind and have now taken the first dose,” added Harne.In mid-July, rural areas of Thane district had vaccinated hardly 25% with at least the first dose. “Currently there is a continuous supply of vaccine doses. This has also helped us to conduct around 90 sessions also in a day within the rural areas. If we have enough manpower, we can definitely conduct more sessions,” added Renge.Thane district’s rural areas comprise Ambernath, Bhiwandi, Kalyan, Murbad and Shahpur. Till now, seven lakh people have been vaccinated with at least the first dose in rural pockets from among the 14.89 lakh population. Out of these, 5.57 lakh (75%) have received the first dose and 1.84 lakh (24%) are fully vaccinated in the rural areas till now.Instances of vaccinators not providing proper guidance to the beneficiaries regarding the side effects causing the villagers to panic have also occurred. “We have strictly asked vaccinators to guide and provide basic medication to the beneficiaries getting vaccinated. Moreover, they are kept under observation for a while after getting jabbed. Our team of Asha workers also visit the vaccinated senior citizens and inquire about their health condition,” said a senior officer from District Health Department, Thane.Many are daily wage workers, not savvy with online booking and it becomes difficult for them to travel long distances to the health centre just to get jabbed. “There have been instances when these villagers have visited the centre but were turned away due to lack of doses initially. To encourage them, we have been adapting various methods like providing books and raincoats for children, groceries for women and initiating conversations with other family members while distributing these items. We also tried our best to gain their trust. While doing so, we also educated them about Covid and the importance of getting vaccinated,” said Kundan Patil, a Bhiwandi resident and a health committee member of the Zilla Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bollywood-movies-used-to-lure-thane-rural-residents-to-get-their-vaccination-101632499508484.html

24-09-2021||Mumbai||Dombivli gang rape: Timing of FIR helped make speedy and maximum arrests, say cops||The timing of the first information report (FIR) registered by the Dombivli sexual abuse victim helped the police officers apprehend a majority of the accused within a single night.The victim, who stays with her family in Dombivli (East), was allegedly blackmailed and sexually assaulted by 33 accused from January to September this year. The FIR was registered late on Wednesday night, and by Thursday morning, the police had arrested 22 accused and detained two more, who were minors.According to the Manpada police, the victim’s aunt and a local social worker were trying to trap the accused on Wednesday. Six of the accused had called the victim to a house rented by one of them in the Kole village in Dombivli, and the plan was to catch them red-handed at the time. However, the autorickshaw, in which the aunt and the social worker were following the victim had a flat tyre, after which they immediately called up the Manpada police.“As soon as we got the call, we rushed a team to the house based on the live location that the victim had sent to her aunt. Four of the six accused were caught from the spot and brought to the police station. We started questioning them right away. Two others had left by the time we reached,” an officer said.Based on the results of their questioning, as well as the victim’s statement, a list of names was drawn up and four teams were formed immediately.“We briefed all the teams about the seriousness of the offence as well as the task at hand. The priority was to apprehend the accused before they started fleeing the city. Fortunately, since the FIR was registered late at night, none of the accused learned about it and this worked in our favour,” the officer said.Another officer added that to further eliminate the chances of the news of the FIR leaking out, it was decided to coordinate the raids as much as possible. Hence, several of the arrests were made at the same time.“Our orders were to make a majority of the arrests before morning and reveal nothing to anyone other than the immediate family of the accused. True to our hunch, the news of the FIR broke out by Thursday morning, but by then our teams had already reached the locations of the remaining accused. A lot of social workers and politicians started visiting the police station. Had this happened immediately after the FIR was registered, the arrests could have been delayed,” the officer said.As of Friday evening, the police had arrested 27 and detained two more — who are minors — out of the total 33 accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dombivli-gang-rape-timing-of-fir-helped-make-speedy-and-maximum-arrests-say-cops-101632499148248.html

24-09-2021||Lucknow||Yogi’s name sends shivers down the spine of criminals: Rajnath||GORAKHPUR Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday showered praise on Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath “for maintaining law and order situation in the state” to ensure holistic development.He said the CM had done commendable work and his name sends shivers down the spine of criminals.“If we want to make any state the best state, we need to maintain law and order and today the same work is done by Yogi Adityanath and the mafia is scared of the CM,” said Singh.The defence minister said the CM was following the path showed by Mahant Avaidyanath. “I believe the country’s seers could see the future. Mahant Avaidyanath had seen the future and that’s why he chose such a capable successor, and today the successor is turning Uttar Pradesh into Uttam Pradesh (best state),” said Singh after he and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath unveiled the statue of Mahant Avaidyanath in Maharajganj on his seventh death anniversary.Mahant Avaidyanath was the chief priest of Gorakhnath temple and also the guru of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Adityanath succeeded him as head priest of Gorakhnath temple after the Mahant’s death in 2014. Rajnath Singh said that Mahant Avaidyanath’s name will be written in golden words in the history of the Ram temple movement. “The Nath sect has done work for unifying the society. For his key contribution in the Ram temple movement, Mahant Avaidyanath’s name will be written in golden words in the history of Ram Janmabhoomi. The society will always be indebted to the great saint,” he said.“Indian Sanatan Sanskriti (ancient culture) gives the message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) and does not believe in untouchability. The heart of a seer is very big and a person with a small heart can’t become a seer and he can never benefit society,” added Rajnath Singh.Singh, who was a student at DDU Gorakhpur University in the early 70s, recalled his association with Mahant Avaidyanath. “In 1971, when I was doing M.Sc from Gorakhpur University, terrorists had taken an Indian aircraft hostage and Indians were angry. I built a student organisation and went to Avaidyanathji and told him that I want to lead a bandh (shutdown) in Gorakhpur. He said no one should be inconvenienced,” he said.The chief minister also showered praise on the defense minister, saying, “We all know about the nation’s internal and external security before 2014. Many used to infiltrate into the country and even hijacked planes. Bomb explosions and Naxalite attacks were also frequent. But since Prime Minister Modi took charge of the country and Rajnath Singhji took charge of the home ministry and defence ministry, enemies are turning back.” Input from agency||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogis-name-sends-shivers-down-the-spine-of-criminals-rajnath-101632498728427.html

24-09-2021||Lucknow||BJP open to alliances with other smaller parties in Uttar Pradesh, says Dharmendra Pradhan||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is open to alliances with other smaller parties in Uttar Pradesh , the BJP’s UP election in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan said on Friday. The BJP has already sealed pacts for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly election with the OBC-based Apna Dal (Sonelal) and the Nishad party. Dharmendra Pradhan didn’t make it clear as to which other “smaller parties” the BJP was still wooing, but dropped enough hints that efforts were on to form more alliances to ensure what he described as “social inclusiveness”. “Our state leadership is in touch with many (smaller parties) and as we proceed, we would let you know,” said Dharmendra Pradhan, the Union education minister. In the 2017 UP assembly election, the BJP had fielded 150 mostly non-Yadav OBCs and this time, too, the party leaders admit that the template is going to be the same. Political experts said that both the BJP and the SP were in a race to have a substantial chunk of the OBC pie.“At the moment it does appear that the two parties leading the race to woo OBCs are the BJP and the SP because these are the two political players witnessing the maximum footfalls of leaders from other parties,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran journalist and political observer.While the Nishad party is now officially with the BJP, the SP, too, has stepped up efforts to win over the riverine community that comprises fishermen and boatmen.In July, the SP chief had unveiled a statue of Nishad community leader Manohar Lal in Sarosi village of Unnao. The SP leaders have also said that they would put up a statue of former bandit-turned- politician the late Phoolan Devi, belonging to the Mallah (Nishad) community. The SP also got Bhojpuri actor Kajal Nishad to join the party in August. The entry of Bihar’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), Jaalvanshi Morcha led by Gyanendra Nishad and the Eklavya Sena run by Phoolan Devi’s husband Umed Singh has further queered the pitch. It is in this backdrop that Dharmendra Pradhan’s statement about the BJP being open to more smaller parties assumes significance. The statement made during the announcement of a pre-poll pact with Nishad party coincided with two former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) heavyweights Lalji Verma and Ram Achal Rajbhar, both OBC leaders, meeting former chief minister and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar, people familiar with the issue said, may join the SP in October. Earlier this month, first-time BJP MLA from Sitapur Rakesh Rathore too had similarly met Akhilesh Yadav, indicating that like the BJP, the SP too was trying to weave a rainbow coalition of OBCs, easily the dominant political caste group in UP. Rathore, too, is an OBC leader. The SP already has the support of the Mahan Dal that claims to have influence among Shakya, Saini, Maurya and Kushwaha communities, as well as the Janwadi Socialist Party of Sanjay Singh Chauhan which largely comprises members of the Bind and Kashyap communities. Asked if the BJP was also in touch with former ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), which has the support of the Rajbhars, an OBC group that is strategically spread over several assembly segments of east UP, a BJP leader said that the party would make attempts to “take everyone along.” Since his party fell out with the BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar has set up the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, an alliance of eight small parties. These parties are the SBSP, Jan Adhikar Party, Apna Dal (K), Bhartiya Vanchit Samaj Party, Bhartiya Manav Samaj Party, Janata Kranti Party (R), Rashtriya Bhagidari Party (P) and Rashtra Uday Party. They comprises members of various OBC groups like Bind, Gadariya, Kumhar, Dhivar, Kashyap, Patels and have been demanding adequate ‘hissedari’ (representation) in government. In August, OP Rajbhar’s meeting with UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev had triggered a buzz about the former ally returning to the BJP fold. The meeting was arranged by UP BJP vice president Daya Shankar Singh who had claimed that both the parties would contest the 2022 UP polls together. Ever since, Om Prakash Rajbhar has gone back to attacking the BJP but the ruling party strategists indicated that “backchannel talks were on.”Another BJP leader said: “I think by the time elections draw closer, we would have more OBCs than anyone else. But it’s not just about OBCs. It’s just that no other party can offer the people bouquet of all-round development, charismatic global leadership and social inclusiveness and that’s where we prevail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-open-to-alliances-with-other-smaller-parties-in-uttar-pradesh-says-dharmendra-pradhan-101632495849559.html

On the complaint of the school principal, a first information report (FIR) has been registered. The police are now scanning the details of the list of the user IDs and passwords (of the online conference app) provided to students for online class.Police officers said that two students, who attended the online class of Class 9, used names of Jethalaal Gada (a famous character from a popular Hindi sitcom Taarak Mehta Ka Oolta Chashmah) and the name of a girl as their profile names.The two indulged in obscene acts and laughed. The accused addressed a girl student while doing obscene acts. The students and teachers were left shocked by the acts, said a police officer. The school’s complaint with the police says that it has been going on for the past 10 days. Finally, on Thursday, the school approached the police and reported the incident.“We have registered an FIR under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code, Pocso Act and Information Technology Act for obscene acts, using computer resources for obscenity and obscene acts against children.

24-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court asks Centre, Maharashtra govt to address issue of potholes on highways||Observing that a distance that was traversed in 15 minutes on the Mumbai-Nashik highway was now taking two hours due to the potholes that had come up there, the Bombay high court (HC) has asked the Centre and the state government to take cognisance of the potholes on the said highway and other highways and initiate coordinated efforts to ensure that commuters do not lose lives due to the menace. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, which has been hearing a public interest litigation complaining of potholes on the Mumbai-Goa highway, while referring to news reports (has not referred to a news report of any particular media organisation) that highlighted the pathetic state of the highway said, “A distance that can normally be covered in a period of 15 minutes now takes at least two hours all because of the potholes.” The bench sought to know from the advocate general (AG) as to why such a situation had arisen and no action was taken to address the pothole issue. According to the September 23 report of the Hindustan Times, ‘Commuters had to endure a nightmarish commute on both Tuesday and Wednesday as 15km-long serpentine queues of vehicles were witnessed on the Mumbai-Nashik Highway. The traffic snarls spilled over to Ghodbunder Road, Waghbil, Kalwa, Majiwada and other areas in Thane city.’ The report also cites Vinay Rathod, DCP (traffic), Thane, explaining the reason for the traffic snarls, “The poor condition of roads and the heavy rains that damaged the temporary filling of potholes led to a slow pace of traffic. We have approached the local authorities and asked them to do the needful.” The bench further added, “It is not a good situation. Precious lives will be lost if this situation continues. We were dealing with the same potholes issue the other day in a PIL pertaining to Mumbai-Goa Highway.” In the PIL about the Mumbai-Goa highway, the bench on September 20, had asked the state government to consider a state-wide policy to deal with the issue of potholes on public roads and highways to safeguard the lives of citizens. The bench had warned the concerned authorities and contractors especially the state government that it would not allow the Konkan coastal road project which would pass through three districts if the road widening and pothole issue of the Mumbai-Goa which had commenced in 2010 is not completed in a time-bound manner. AG Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the bench that the Mumbai-Nashik highway was under various authorities of the central government and the state government was only the overseeing authority. However, the bench observed that these issues had to be sorted out between the authorities and all agencies needed to come together and co-ordinate on addressing the pothole issue. The bench then asked the governments to respond on the issue on October 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-asks-centre-maharashtra-govt-to-address-issue-of-potholes-on-highways-101632495127899.html

24-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to study role of mangroves in serving as buffer against cyclones||Maharashtra has launched the first scientific, empirical evidence-based study to assess the effectiveness of mangroves in serving as a buffer against cyclones. The study, which has been commissioned by the state government’s Mangrove Foundation, will seek to gauge how effective the mangrove patches in Raigad and Ratnagiri districts were in restricting or preventing damage to the coastline by the Nisarga and Tauktae cyclones.“This will be a comprehensive study and impact assessment of the Nisarga (2020) and Tauktae (2021) cyclones on mangroves and non-mangrove areas. The study will assess how effective mangroves were in preventing damage to the coastline,” said Deepak Apte, executive director of the Srushti Conservation Foundation, which is conducting this study. Apte, who is the former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), added that they would identify the key vulnerable sites in the two districts by using and analysing the satellite data, drone footages as well as field surveys of all such sites to reveal the changes before and after the cyclones.The study will quantify the impact of the two cyclones on mangrove and non-mangrove areas, the damage caused in these two areas and also identify patches that are vulnerable to cyclones and such adverse weather events. The site visits are currently being undertaken to verify if the mangroves, whose presence had buffered the impact of the two cyclones, have survived or have suffered mortality due to the severe nature of the storms. Apte said that the study, which cost ₹14 lakh and is expected to be completed next year, will help the state government evolve a comprehensive shoreline restoration plan. While mangroves grow in creeks and muddy areas, non-mangrove habitats may require a combination of soft and hard engineering interventions to prevent the impact of cyclones and adverse weather events.The complex root systems of mangroves dissipate the energy of sea waves, thus protecting coastal areas from tsunamis, storm surges and soil erosion. They also enhance sediment deposition and prevent coastal erosion. Mangroves serve as a breeding ground for fish and aquatic ecosystems and are carbon sinks.While such impact assessment studies on mangroves have been conducted on the east coast of India, which is vulnerable to cyclones and coastal erosion, and in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Apte said this was the first such integrative study in Maharashtra. “This study will help the state government evolve a systematic shoreline protection policy,” he explained while adding that as part of this assessment, their team will also interact with members of the coastal community. This will help them know about the native species of trees and vegetation that have served as buffers on these parts of the coast.Maharashtra has a 720-km coastline. According to the India State of Forest Report-2019 released by the Forest Survey of India, Maharashtra’s mangrove cover has been estimated at 320.27 sq km, of which Mumbai city and the suburbs have 2 sq km and 64.30 sq km respectively. Maharashtra accounts for 6.44% of India’s 4,975.22 sq km mangrove cover.Mangroves form 1% of tropical forests in the world or 15 million hectares and are distributed over 123 countries.In 2012, the state forest department established a mangrove cell to ensure the protection and conservation of mangroves on the coastline. The Mangrove Foundation has been established as an autonomous body to implement mangrove and marine biology conservation initiatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-study-role-of-mangroves-in-serving-as-buffer-against-cyclones-101632495068006.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||MBA aspirants to move court over discrepancies in CET paper pattern||Days after the common entrance test (CET) for admissions to various undergraduate and postgraduate professional courses ended, Master of Business Administration (MBA) aspirants have pointed at discrepancies in the question paper format. Many took to social media to highlight how different students who appeared for the exam received questions with different paper patterns, and called the exam unfair. Some students have decided to move the Bombay high court (HC) and seek a stay on the results.CET exam is an entrance test for admissions to professional undergraduate degree courses including engineering, management, architecture, hotel management, pharmacy, agriculture and allied courses among others. After an initial delay due to the pandemic, the exam is being conducted in multiple sessions starting September 20 and will go on till October 10.As per the official CET website, MBA aspirants’ entrance exam has a total of 200 questions which are divided in four topics—Logical Reasoning (LR), Abstract Reasoning (AR), Quantitative Aptitude (QA) and Verbal Ability (VA).“The paper pattern mentioned in the official examination brochure states that LR will have 75 questions, AR will have 25 questions and the remaining two topics will have 50 questions each. What happened, however, is that some students got 90 questions in LR instead of 75 and others got 30 questions in the same topic. Similarly, some students got 70 questions in QA while others got only 50. This means the exam was not held on a common platform,” said one of the students who appeared for the entrance exam this year.Students have raised their queries with the state CET cell, but yet to get a response. “The questions asked in the CET exam have been based on the syllabus decided by the state government. No out of syllabus questions were asked,” said CD Joshi, commissioner of the state CET cell. He added that the office in Mumbai has not received any complaints from students regarding discrepancies in the question paper as yet.A state-based student group, Maharashtra Students Welfare Association has approached state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant in this matter. “Some of us, who had jobs, have already quit because we had all our hopes on the entrance exam going well and scoring well too. But with the discrepancies in the way exam was conducted, we are worried about scoring well,” said a student from Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mba-aspirants-to-move-court-over-discrepancies-in-cet-paper-pattern-101632495007915.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Scientists, educators oppose panel set up to develop new curriculum framework under NEP||Scientists in Mumbai and around the country are opposing a steering committee set up by the Central government to develop a national curriculum framework under the National Education Policy (NEP).In a statement issued on Thursday, the All India People’s Science Network (AIPSN) — a network of over 40 people’s science organisations spread all over the country — said, “It is a matter of deep concern that the entire span of educational curriculum reform, from the early childhood years to adult education, has been entrusted to a small committee with no expertise in these crucial areas. Members include educational administrators and even entrepreneurs. This seems to be in line with the trend of the NEP 2020 to usher in private players while making subservient established institutions of public education.”On Wednesday, the Union ministry of education set up national steering committee for the development of national curriculum frameworks according to the perspectives of NEP. The committee is expected to develop four national curriculum frameworks — for school education, for early childhood care and education, for teacher education, and for adult education.According to the terms of reference, the 12-member committee chaired by former ISRO chief and space scientists K Kasturirangan will have tenure of three years. It will “discuss different aspects of school education, early childhood care and education (ECCE), teacher education and adult education keeping in focus all the recommendations of NEP 2020 related to these four areas for proposing curriculum reforms”.“Indeed surprisingly, no faculty members of NCERT are included, even though it is the apex national body responsible for the development of curricula; rather, the director of NCERT is expected to “assist” the Steering Committee,” said the AIPSN in its statement.AIPSN has called for a re-constitution of the steering committee with persons having a deep understanding about learners in diverse and disparate socio-cultural contexts, disciplinary knowledge of school education and domain expertise in teacher education/adult education, as well as sound experience of the pedagogical processes required to develop a national curriculum framework. “Moreover, if there is serious concern for the future of all our learners, the committee will need to address the challenges of education with commitment to the Constitution and a focus on equity, quality and inclusion,” said the AIPSN.Vivek Monteiro, a city-based science educator, member of AIPSN and secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Maharashtra, said, “NEP is a non-starter. Its disconnect with reality is shocking. Though released in 2020, there is not a single mention of the pandemic which was raging at the time of its release. Its following implementation document Sarthaq, published in 2021, continues this oblivion to the ground reality of a learning crisis arising out of the pandemic. On the contrary, the ministry is busy celebrating the business opportunities provided by online education. The committee set up to revise national curriculum framework is educationally incompetent and the only criterion of selection seems to be political proximity to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/scientists-educators-oppose-panel-set-up-to-develop-new-curriculum-framework-under-nep-101632494827832.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Kharghar residents file writ petition against Panvel civic body for wrong taxation||The Kharghar Forum, which was created by Kharghar residents to fight for their own causes, have recently filed a writ petition about the wrong taxation on the residents in the High Court against the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and CIDCO, too, has been made a party to it.Leena Garad, chairperson of Kharghar Forum, said, “Twenty five different services are provided through CIDCO and service charges are recovered. The Panvel City Municipal Corporation has levied 12% property tax for these services. Under Section 130 and Section 131 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, the corporation has the right to levy property tax only if such services are provided.”She added that as per Section 99 of the Municipal Corporation Act, a resolution on property tax must be passed every year on or before February 20 and this is known to the administration.Garad said, “However, no such resolutions have been passed in 2016, 2017, 2018 (excluding 2019) as well as in 2020 and 2021. The municipal commissioner has also agreed in writing in resolution number 118 dated January 17, 2019 that this matter is a serious mistake. Even then, property tax has been imposed on two-and-a-half lakh property owners.”The Kharghar Forum members have claimed that the PCMC authorities have failed to come up to the development expectations of the residents. “Around 80% citizens of the corporation totalling nearly two-and-a-half lakh people are living in the CIDCO Colony area and ever since the establishment of the corporation, no development has been done in this area by the PCMC. Despite this, unjustified property tax has been levied by PCMC retrospectively with effect from October 1, 2016,” Garad said.The Kharghar Forum had been repeatedly bringing the issue to the notice of the authorities and the administration. “Tax is the government’s right and it can’t be forgone. Tax demanded is as per the rules. The tax has been reduced by 10% till September 30. There is also a 2% rebate for paying taxes online. Citizens should take advantage of this concession and pay taxes as soon as possible,” said commissioner, Ganesh Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kharghar-residents-file-writ-petition-against-panvel-civic-body-for-wrong-taxation-101632494407822.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC starts Covid test of citizens in Mumbai with travel history during Ganesh festival||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is keeping an eye on citizens who have travelled to neighbouring districts during the Ganesh festival. This week, 272 people who travelled to the Konkan region from Mumbai have been found Covid-19 positive in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts. Following this, all ward officers have been instructed to run RT-PCR tests on people with travel history in the city.For Ganesh festival, a large number of citizens travel to their respective native towns in and around Mumbai. Although the seven-day positivity rate in Mumbai stands at 1.5%, there are some districts like Ahmednagar (5.3%), Pune (5%), Sangli (4%) which are still recording high infection rate. This makes them vulnerable to contracting Covid-19. So, to curb the transmission rate, BMC has already started identifying such individuals. Ward officers are sending their health officers for door-to-door inspections especially in areas with a high population with recent travel history.“We generally get the travel history of the individuals when they contract Covid-19. So, this time without any delay, we have asked the ward officers to make a list of these returnees and test them immediately,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.During any festive season, the daily cumulative testing in the past has been reduced to around 25,000, which was widely criticised by health care activists and medical experts. However, in the last three days, the number of tests has escalated to around 40,000 daily.Prashant Sapkale, assistant municipal commissioner and in-charge of K/East (KE) ward that covers the Andheri East and Jogeshwari said that they have already boosted up the testing in the slums. “We are tracking the recent travellers in the areas with high Marathi population. If anyone is showing any symptoms like fever and cough, we are immediately isolating the suspected patient,” he said.BMC has also instructed officials to tighten the testing in railway and bus stops which record the highest number of floating population. “Early detection of patients helps to stop the chain of transmission among the crowd. So, we will also randomly run rapid antigen tests in crowded places including malls, markets among others,” said Kakani.At present, the city has around 4,800 active Covid-19 patients who are on treatment. Of these, 60% of them are symptomatic and around 390 of them are critical.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-starts-covid-test-of-citizens-in-mumbai-with-travel-history-during-ganesh-festival-101632494348003.html
24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Be dignified, get rid of ‘super CM’: Sukhbir to Channi||Chandigarh Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday urged chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to conduct himself with dignity to match the sanctity of the office he holds. In a veiled attack at state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sukhbir advised Channi not to allow “an extra-constitutional super CM” treat him like a “rubber stamp”. Sukhbir was talking to the media after a party delegation met Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit, seeking adequate compensation for the agricultural land acquired for Bharat Mala road project, and monetary relief to Malwa farmers who have suffered losses due to spurious seeds and pesticides. Sukhbir said 25,000 acres of land in 19 districts was in the process of acquisition for various road projects and the compensation being offered was meagre. The delegation led by Sukhbir also had party leaders Tota Singh, Prem Singh Chandumajra, Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal, Daljit Singh Cheema, Hira Singh Gabria, NK Sharma and Harcharan Bains. Referring to CM’s statement on Thursday, wherein he had said that Sukhbir roams around with a large convoy of cars and security men, the SAD president termed the statement as “ridiculous”. “Let me remind the CM that his party president Navjot Sidhu begged for a car from Capt Amarinder Singh and made his party leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi intervene to secure it. He is not in government but is using the same car,” added Sukhbir. The former deputy CM said the government was planning to arrest some Akali leaders on “cooked-up charges”, adding, “We are ready and they are targeting us because they know that their days are numbered and Akali-BSP alliance is forming the next government in Punjab.” Sukhbir said the recent developments within the Congress show that they are trying to divide Punjab on communal and caste lines, which is dangerous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/be-dignified-get-rid-of-super-cm-sukhbir-to-channi-101632493689437.html

24-09-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Magic Realism||“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.” A man arrives in Mumbai for a short work trip and discovers he has Covid and has to quarantine. Alone, ill and isolated for 17 days, away from his family and friends, how does he cope? How does the city treat him? What impressions does he take away with him? “Since moving to Goa from Mumbai seven years ago, I hardly look forward to returning to Mumbai. Yes, I have family and friends here, but issues of parking, noise, and just the travails of the city are daunting, and I find myself visiting less and less,” says photographer David Desouza, who is currently working on a book to commemorate the 400th year of sainthoods of St Francis Xavier and St Ignatius of Loyola, which come up next year. Finding himself quarantined in an apartment in Churchgate, after his RT-PCR proved positive, Desouza says he was “super impressed” with the BMC. “They were actual women with cultured voices and clear and precise instructions, who called daily to monitor my progress,” he says. What’s more, he says he was bowled over by the care and concern of kind friends and neighbours who, unsolicited, had offered food and assistance. “In Goa, we look at Mumbai and think that Covid has been handled much better than in our state. Here it appears that the municipal commissioner has done an incredible feat. And I never thought I’d ever want to credit the Shiv Sena, but I have to admit that Uddhav Thackeray has been statesmanlike. My sister-in-law, who heads the ICU at Nair’s Covid ward, bears testimony to this,” he says. It’s not the handling of the Covid situation alone that has impressed David, it appears. Before his RT-PCR test during his initial stay, he says he was awestruck at the progress of infrastructure development when he visited a friend in Worli. And driving past the glass and steel skyscrapers of Parel he could barely believe that he was in Mumbai. “Ultimately, it’s not just the rich who will benefit,” he says, “Those skyscraper offices will be populated with the working class and the Metro, when completed, will bring ordinary commuters some much-needed relief.” Of course, Desouza knows all is not hunky dory. “There are areas in Mumbai that the CM and MC seem to have forgotten. These happen to be localities where very poor people live. If the powers that be look at the needs of all its citizens not just where commissions are greater, this will be a magnificent city,” he says. But as impressed as Desouza may be by Mumbai, he says he is in no hurry to move back. “Moving to Goa was one of the best decisions I’ve made,” he insists. Still, his farewell message to me from Goa is heartening. “Mumbai/Bombay of my youth, you are superb. What you need is a government that takes care of everyone, not just those who voted you in. I’m inclined to believe for the first time you are experiencing that kind of governance. Hopefully you inspire Goa, our magnificent state, that politics is a tool to help its citizens, all of them.” ***********************************************If a picture is worth a thousand words, then the one you see below, is worth more than seventeen thousand. Yes, at first when you look at it, you will see an ordinary man, sitting on an ordinary plastic chair, on an ordinary pavement in Mumbai, looking (perhaps, a trifle wistfully) at an ordinary white envelope. But look again. Because, according to me, this is no ordinary man, but a veritable Mumbai hero, deserving of applause and acclaim. A man who, in the split-second real-time that this photograph was taken, was most likely wrestling with an ethical issue that you and I would never surmount. Consider the back story behind the photograph: At the beginning of every month, the man, who happens to be my neighbourhood fruit and vegetable seller, is supposed to receive payment for last month’s purchases, sometimes by online transfer and other times in cash. Now, a couple of months ago, I had duly, in the first week of the month, sent him in cash, contained in a white envelope, the seventeen thousand rupees owed to him for the previous month’s purchases. The standing instruction for such payments is that the member of staff delivering the amount, snaps a picture of the person receiving it, so that there is some record of the payment made. But, due to a minor miscommunication error that month, unbeknownst to me, the amount had already been transferred to him online, by my assistant. Which is perhaps what accounts for the fleeting wistfulness, which you might notice on the man’s countenance, on receiving the envelope containing an additional seventeen thousand rupees. Perhaps what is going through his mind is if he ought to pocket the money quietly, hoping no one would be any wiser for it. After all, in the pandemic-induced fog, there could be many a slip betwixt cup and lip. Perhaps what he is thinking about are the toys he could buy for his children, the sarees for his wife, or the much-needed household durables that his family needs... After all, which one of us is above a bit of laxity, when it comes to a sudden windfall due to someone else’s error? How many of us would emerge, our conscience shining? But not even a few seconds after receiving the amount, realising the error, my fruit seller had returned the envelope, intact with all the cash inside. “Tell Madame I have already received the payment online,” he’d said, while handing it back. Just another ordinary, everyday, Mumbai hero, on an ordinary everyday Mumbai pavement, who’d performed an extraordinary everyday act of honour… ***********************************************And if you still need convincing that magic and miracles can be ordinary, everyday occurrences, consider this photograph of an ordinary, everyday Mumbai stray, blissfully snuggled up for an afternoon siesta, in an ordinary, everyday corner of a Mumbai institution. No magic or miracles in sight, right? Ah, but look again. The institution just happens to be one of Mumbai’s snootiest private membership-only clubs, where the strictest rules and regulations apply, to some of the city’s most celebrated denizens. So how come an indolent pooch, relishing its afternoon siesta, has been allowed to curl up so resplendently in a corner, unchecked for membership or any protocols? The answer to that, gentle reader, is revealed perhaps if you look carefully at the words inscribed on the bin the pooch has snuggled happily around. There, in large letters, for all to read, are the words “Ratan. Extra Strong”… Of course, it could be a happy coincidence, but don’t the words bring to mind a benevolent Parsi philanthropist and ardent dog lover? Someone who has long championed the cause of Mumbai’s strays, some whose very name spells care and shelter for them? But wait, can pooches read? Or could this be yet another of the city’s instances of magic realism, that occur daily — if only one looks out for them?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-magic-realism-101632492908305.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Kharghar residents demand closure of nullah as mosquito menace worsens||For more than four years now, the mosquito menace at the housing societies around the nullah near Sectors 20 and 21, Kharghar, has been increasing. The residents have been demanding with the local authorities to take some action.With the increase in the mosquito breeding spots in the area, the residents are in constant fear of contracting dengue or malaria. Local corporator, Netra Kiran Patil, has now approached CIDCO demanding a closure of the nullah following appeals from the residents of the area.“Every year, annually, CIDCO cleans the nullah during the monsoon. Instead of spending money for cleaning, we suggested building a ‘pay and park’ over the nullah like how it has been done by Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) at Sector 17, Vashi. The closure of nullah would bring an end to the problems of the people as well,” Patil said.Dnyaneshwar Pinglay (59), a retired employee of NMMC and a resident of Jalvayu Vihar in Kharghar, said, “The nullah is surrounded by a lot of trees and grass. The grass cutting was done recently but the main issue is mosquito breeding. The problem is more, especially during the monsoon when the breeding of mosquitoes and other insects in the vicinity increases due to the nullah water.”Meanwhile, Avinash Khedkar (40), a local resident, pointed out that besides the mosquito, the stench is also unbearable. “The water is there in the nullah throughout the year while it’s more during the monsoon. The stagnant water also emits stench. Also, many people just keep dumping their garbage in the nullah, worsening the stench,” Khedkar said.“We clean the nullah annually and this year’s cleaning has been done. I have received the request letter to consider covering the nullah and making it a ‘pay and park’ area. It has been forwarded ahead,” a CIDCO officer from Kharghar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kharghar-residents-demand-closure-of-nullah-as-mosquito-menace-worsens-101632491171459.html

24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Entrepreneur Tawheeda Akthar is the wind beneath the wings of unskilled Kashmiri women||Mir EhsanArmed with a sewing machine, Tawheeda Akthar, who grew up in abject poverty, went on to become a successful entrepreneur. Now, she is the wind beneath several unskilled women’s wings. With her father doing menial jobs for a living, money was always tight in the Akthar household, so much so that she could only study till Class 12. However, she had a burning desire to do something for her family and siblings. “My father was a labourer and couldn’t afford to educate me. However, I refused to sit idle at home and enrolled myself at the Bemina Industrial Training Institute (ITI) where I learnt how to sew and stitch clothes. I worked hard and graduated at the top of my class, which gave me the confidence to do new things in life,” says the 30-year-old. However, her journey was not smooth sailing, “At times, I did not even have enough money to cover the bus fare. However, the tough times only motivated me to work harder to fulfill my dream of giving my siblings a decent education.” Won her first sewing machine Akthar has three elder brothers and a younger sister. Her first break came when she participated in a competition organised by the Zainab Institute, Maisuma. “I won the contest and received a brand new sewing machine as the prize, which changed my life. I honed my skills on the machine and started earning well.”Akthar set up a small boutique, which is now a successful venture, which provides employment to around 12 women. However, just earning well for herself and her family was not enough, and she decided to empower women who came from a humble background and opened a training centre at Lawaypora. Has trained 1,150 girls “There are 12 workers in my boutique. I teach them sewing and mehandi art. I have trained more than 1,150 girls and charge a meagre sum from them. I do not charge anything from those who are very poor or orphans,” says Akthar, who also runs a society, Shining Star, through which she provides free training to women at her boutique or at the ITI. “Recently, I arranged a three-month free fashion designing course for 80 girls and a one-year ITI course for 15 girls and three boys.”Akthar’s inspiration is her maternal uncle, Nazir Ahmad Rather, who always encouraged her. “After sewing, I learnt embroidery work, knitting and aari work. I always tell my students that learning a skill will help them be gainfully employed, which will boost their confidence and make their lives more comfortable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/entrepreneur-tawheeda-akthar-is-the-wind-beneath-the-wings-of-unskilled-kashmiri-women-101632487266927.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to reopen schools for classes 8 and above from Oct 4||Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday announced that the state will reopen schools for students above classes 8 starting October 4. The education minister also said that a detailed SOP will be sent to teachers and school administrators across the state as the nation continues to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.Maharashtra earlier on Thursday reported 3,320 fresh Covid-19 cases and 61 deaths. The state currently has 39,191 active cases. The state has recorded 6.53 million cases so far and lodged 138,725 deaths.The paediatrician Covid-19 task force of the state, earlier on Tuesday, asked school administrations and teachers to undertake vaccination of teachers and non-teaching staff on war-footing ahead of reopening of schools. This task force was formed in May to ensure that children are not affected massively if a possible third wave of Covid-19 hits the state.“Primarily, teachers and non-teaching staff in schools should get the vaccine first. This would enhance their immunity and make schools safer for children,” Dr Bakul Parekh, a senior Mumbai paediatrician and a member of the task force told PTI earlier. He also said that the task force will likely recommend that only one student should be allowed to sit on a bench and classes should be planned accordingly. Suggestions have been made to simultaneously hold physical as well as online classes and physical attendance should be made in a rotational manner.Maharashtra government says that it is taking all steps to ensure that the loss of life and large numbers of hospitalisation which marked the second wave.

24-09-2021||Patna||5 years on, Bihar tweaks its Prohibition rules||A little over five years since a total ban was imposed on sale and consumption of liquor in the state, Bihar has tweaked its stringent Prohibition law to make it more practical, said officials of the prohibition and excise department.Now, instead of sealing the entire premises in cases of liquor haul, only the portion from where recoveries are made would be sealed, according to the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Rules, 2021, which got state cabinet nod on Wednesday. The relaxation, however, would not apply in case of detection of liquor manufacturing or bulk storage from any premises or sale/purchase and supply from there. In that situation, the entire premises would be sealed as per provisions of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016. The new rules will also allow storage of liquor in Cantonment areas and military stations, though there will be no permission to serving or retired defence personnel to consume or possess liquor outside the Cantonment area.”The provision for allowing storage of liquor in Cantonment area and military stations was there in the Act earlier also, but nobody can carry or posses it outside or move in an inebriated condition beyond the area. They have just been incorporated in the rules. If anybody is caught drunk outside the Cantonment area, law will take its own course without any distinction,” Bihar’s excise commissioner B Kartikey Dhanji said.The new rules are aimed at making implementation of the 2016 Act easier by removing the practical difficulties that have surfaced after over five-year experience during which mounting litigations related to liquor cases saddled the courts and led to a lot of criticism from the Opposition. As per official statistics, nearly 25 per cent of the total pending cases in lower courts and 20% in the high court are prohibition related cases. In 2019, alarmed by the growing pendency, the Patna High Court had asked the state government to present a plan for how it plans to dispose these cases related to excise. Though special courts were mandated in the new law for trial of liquor related cases, they could not be set up till then. Later, the state cabinet cleared a proposal for setting up 74 special courts. However, they are not yet functional.The new rules have also provided permission to distilleries in the state for manufacturing of extra neutral alcohol (ENA) and ethanol. Bihar has nine functional distilleries, but the number is set to grow substantially after it became the first state in the country to have its Ethanol Production Promotion Policy, 2021, which promotes new standalone ethanol manufacturing units by providing them additional capital subsidy at 15% of the cost of plant and machinery up to a maximum of ₹5 crore.However, the manufacturing of ethanol and ENA will be closely monitored and will be under surveillance of close circuit TV camera to prevent their misuse. The footage will be kept safe for one month for inspection.ENA is a grade of ethanol derived from sugarcane molasses and is distilled multiple times. They are used in alcoholic beverages like whisky, vodka, gin, cane, liqueurs, and alcoholic fruit beverages due to their higher levels of purity.Ethanol is an organic compound. The government has set a target to blend 10% fuel-grade ethanol with petrol by 2022. It is also used extensively as a solvent in the manufacture of varnishes and perfumes; as a preservative for biological specimens; in the preparation of essences and flavourings; In many medicines and drugs; as a disinfectant and in tinctures (e.g., tincture of iodine); in alcoholic beverages and as a fuel and gasoline additive.The new rules also make it binding for vehicles transporting liquor to other states leave the state boundaries within 24 hours. As soon as they will enter the state limits, the vehicles carrying liquor will have digital lock at the check post. The digital locks will be removed at the exit points.Excise commissioner B Kartikey Dhanji said the new rules were in keeping with the changes required due to the advent of the new ethanol policy, which would lead to opening of new units and require more monitoring, and experiences of over five years, without in anyway diluting the force of law.In July this year, the Patna High Court had directed that all proceedings related to confiscation of property under the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, must positively be initiated/concluded within a period of 90 days from the date of appearance of the parties concerned and the appeal/revision, if any, be also decided within a period of 30 days from the date of initiation, failing which the “things” (vehicle/property/ etc.) shall be deemed to have been released in terms of several orders passed by the HC in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/5-years-on-bihar-tweaks-its-prohibition-rules-101632486727177.html

24-09-2021||Mumbai||Zambian national held with Heroin worth ₹18 crore at Mumbai Airport||The Air Intelligence Unit (AIU) of Mumbai Customs arrested a Zambian national travelling from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to Mumbai and seized 3.5 kg of Heroin valued at ₹18 crore from her possession. The drug packets were cleverly concealed in a hidden cavity in the passenger’s trolly bag. She has been booked under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.This is the second big drug seizure made by AIU in a week. Earlier this week, a mother-daughter duo traveling from Johannesburg to Mumbai through Doha were arrested with Heroin worth nearly ₹25 crore at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.AIU senior officials said that based on specific inputs the 41-year-old foreigner was intercepted at the CSIA Mumbai on Thursday and subsequent examination led to the recovery of the drugs. She has arrived in India on a business visa. The arrested woman is a housewife from Zambia and comes from a poor background. This is the first time she has come to India. She was roped in by the narcotics gangs as a carrier and was offered $2,000 (equivalent to around ₹1.47 lakh) for the risky job, said an AIU official.“This is unusual. Usually South American drug cartels send Cocaine to India through this modus operandi as there is high demand for Cocaine in the country, but demand for Heroin is not that high.

24-09-2021||Other||Global village idiot: Why charade of responsible gaming is anything but a safe bet||So Mr D and I have been talking about cricket. And also playing some. With plastic bat and plastic ball. On the terrace. In the living room (at our own peril, since we are always likely to whack someone watching TV, or knock a favourite vase over). Mr D has chosen cricket as his sport. Which means he is going to talk cricket. Which means he’s going to talk about Kohli. Now Virat Kohli is big in our house. The younger kids don’t look up to any sports celebrities, but they know Virat Kohli and are willing to fight anyone who says anything critical about him. I don’t know why they took to him, but they just love his personality, style and we-are-the best attitude.During the third test with England, I managed to get some TV time in the evenings and caught a few overs as and when I could. Mr D would walk in and out of the living room and chit chat about who’s batting… that’s a great shot… and then, during an ad break, he suddenly stood still and watched because Kohli was in the ad… and he soon got mad.“Why is he dancing like that ?”“Do you like the ad?”“No! That is Virat Kohli, India’s cricket captain! How can that company make him dance like that?”A bulk of commercials nowadays are made for younger audiences irrespective of product targeting, which is why we see a lot of different kinds of music and attention grabbing tactics. What companies and ad agencies don’t realise is that you may catch the younger generations’ attention and then lose them as influencers or potential customers forever by misreading their values.But that’s their problem. What could quickly become my problem is also related to TV commercials, sporting commercials to be precise, but not about sports. These are the ads for online betting and gambling platforms. So if you have been watching the Test matches you would have noticed ads from several such betting/gaming platforms. Most of these are based outside India, though they are actively wooing and pitching Indian viewers as “responsible gaming” platforms. Here’s how it could be a problem. Gambling (online or otherwise) and specially sports betting is illegal in most states of India, definitely in Maharashtra. Most states have some rudimentary regulation or law governing what is legal gambling and what’s not. Responsible Gaming is a clever invention on the part of the industry (already a multi-billion dollar industry in India).I like the government’s approach of self-regulation in industries. But like with all things, there are some exceptions where one ought not to leave it to the better judgment of those making money - better judgment in those cases are always detrimental to broader society.At its best, self-regulation is a bit of a non-starter, especially for industries that are on “dubious grounds” to begin with. Gambling I understand, and most would because by its name you realise it carries great risk. Words like morality, ethics and the law are all quickly part of the debate depending on where you are… thus, if you still go gamble, one can’t really turn around and claim ignorance, or cry foul. Responsible Gaming is different. It is like renaming smoking as “conscientious inhalation of nicotine-supplemented air”. By introducing the term “responsible”, one clubs together the “dubious” with legitimate sporting activities, with the aim of providing legitimacy, or credibility, to the endeavour.There are serious issues at several levels: Governance, Taxation, Industry and Social at the very least.From where I sit, sportspeople train and play and get paid. People watching sportspeople play and predicting an outcome and making or losing money is gambling - irrespective of whether there is analysis or thinking involved or not. If you want to legalise gambling, please do, but please don’t do it with an elaborate legal, judicial and professional charade of what’s good for society and how to protect society from the possible fallouts. One should not take a vice, let it loose in society, then regulate it to organise the aftermath of foreseeable problems, and then manage the social devastation.Arguments aside, there is a very real problem with blurring the line between vice and entertainment, between sport and chance, and between ethical uses of skill and non-ethical uses thereof. What’s sad in all this is that there is a genuine gaming industry that’s has emerged and it’s likely to be clubbed together with “responsible gaming”.What concerns me are the commercials. Should we stop children from watching sports now? Because if something is illegal in a state should that be advertised? Gambling is right up there with smoking and alcohol consumption in terms of health risk. If you read through the reams of language that passes off as self-regulation or guidelines of advertising, most of it is aimed at how to circumvent genuine issues, not at being responsible by saying “no” to advertisements that could harm children. Does the flash of 18+ seriously address the real danger of youngsters and children accessing gambling or “responsible gaming” from a prime time ad on a sports channel? Shouldn’t there be a credible decision-making deterrent so that sports channels understand that they could be held accountable (not just responsible) for bringing gambling to the immediate attention of a minor?All this is being debated and government and judiciary and industry will decide what’s good for us. Meanwhile, I may just have to stop watching sports and read event reports instead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/global-village-idiot-why-charade-of-responsible-gaming-is-anything-but-a-safe-bet-101632480487201.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Villagers pull out truck driver’s body from Kasara ghat nullah amid rain, total darkness||For more than five hours before dawn on Thursday, amid thick fog, heavy rain and total darkness, villagers from in and around Kasara Ghat near Igatpuri helped pull out the body of a truck driver stuck in the middle of a 40 feet nullah.Five villagers and several officials were also injured in this rescue operation. The villagers claim that the burden of working in such difficult conditions is due to the lack of disaster management and rescue equipment for the ghat section.More than 220 people from different villages of Kasara are trained to handle accidents, natural calamity or any other emergency even before help from the authorities reaches them. On Wednesday night, they got a call from police officials informing them about a multi-axle trailer containing more than 200 iron rods falling off the road into the nullah. Due to lack of visibility on the ghat at night, the truck driver could not see a retaining wall of the road. He rammed into it and toppled into the nullah with all rods falling on him.Shyam Dhumal, a villager and rescue team head, said, “We reached the spot at around 12 midnight but the visibility was low due to the fog. We wanted to save people who were stuck under the rods. Therefore, we made a human chain with police officials and decided to pull out all the iron rods first. Till around 2.30am we were only removing the rods. We desperately needed a crane or an excavator to speed track the process as doing it manually took more than three-and-a-half hours.”He added that the rods were so sharp that some of them suffered injuries. “We continued to work for more than three hours despite heavy rain and low visibility after which a JCB arrived and removed the remaining rods. We pulled out the driver. However, it was already late by then. He was taken to a hospital. We also had to go to the hospital to treat our injuries. All our clothes were torn and some of us were bleeding.”He said that had there been at least one basic rescue equipment, this would not have happened. Police Inspector of highway police, Amol Walzade said, “The accident happened around 11.30pm and we could remove the driver’s body around 5am. Villagers helped us a lot to do the same in low visibility, rainy and foggy environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/villagers-pull-out-truck-driver-s-body-from-kasara-ghat-nullah-amid-rain-total-darkness-101632480127659.html
24-09-2021||Jaipur||REET exam: Govt says personnel found leaking question paper will be terminated||On Sunday, Rajasthan will be witnessing a massive movement of students across the state as close to 16 lakh candidates will travel to appear for Rajasthan Eligibility Exam for Teachers (REET) 2021. The state government is providing free travel facilities to all the candidates appearing in the examination. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has also approved the proposal for termination of government personnel found leaking the question paper and withdrawal of affiliation and recognition of private institutes if any of their staff is caught facilitating cheating. Addressing a meeting to review the preparations for REET-2021, Gehlot said that when incidents of cheating done by gangs in competitive exams come to the fore, the hard work put in by the candidates goes to waste. In such a situation, strict action should be taken against such gangs involved in fraud. The candidates appearing in the exam should not bring mobile phones to the examination centres. The chief minister said that strict action should be taken against all those who are responsible for incidents such as paper leaks and cheating in REET-2021 and all the competitive exams to be held in the future. In the event of the candidates coming to appear in exams, especially women, facing any problems, public representatives, social workers and voluntary organisations should come forward to help them. He said that district collectors should engage the voluntary organisations in their respective districts to help the candidates. He directed to set up a control room in every district so that candidates, especially women, can call directly in case they face any adverse situation. State transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said that all roadways buses are available for free travelling of candidates. Besides this, Lok Parivahan and other private buses are also being arranged for. Officers of the transport department have been given necessary directions regarding this, he said. Minister of State for Education Govind Singh Dotasara suggested that there should be a complete ban on mobile phones inside the examination centres to check paper leaks and cheating. The candidates should be provided with new masks at the examination centre to avoid any cheating devices. Additional chief secretary, school education, PK Goyal said that 16,22,19 candidates have applied for the exam and 3993 examination centres have been set up across the state. The Railways has agreed to run 11 special trains for the candidates and a request has been made for a few more special trains. Director-General of Police, ML Lather, said that all necessary preparations have been made to maintain the law and order situation during the exams. The available police force will be deployed at railway stations, bus stands, towns, markets and near examination centres. SOG and other agencies are vigilantly working on intelligence inputs and technical surveillance to prevent any incident of cheating and paper leak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/reet-exam-govt-says-personnel-found-leaking-question-paper-will-be-terminated-101632479945853.html

The solution will be sprayed across farmlands to stop stubble burning, which leads to air pollution in Delhi. Kejriwal said the solution will cost less than ₹1,000 per acre and it will be entirely borne by the government. The AAP earlier said that farmers will only have to fill a form and the bio-decomposer solution will be sprayed in their fields free of cost.“By spraying the bio-decomposer solution in the fields, it decomposes the stubble into compost in 15-20 days,” Kejriwal said while addressing a press conference after inaugurating the preparation of the solution.This bio-decomposer is cheaper than other alternatives to stubble burning. It cost less than ₹1000 per acre. Delhi government bearing its cost in the national capital, neighbouring states should also support their farmers: Delhi CM KejriwalA video shared on AAP's social media platform showed the Delhi CM mixing ingredients into the solution.Kejriwal told reporters that last year, nearly 300 farmers in Delhi opted for the bio-decomposer solution and it was sprayed to nearly 1,900 acres and this time, it will be sprayed in 4,200 acres and 844 farmers will use it. The Delhi CM also urged governments of neighbouring states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab to support their farmers with the solution.The expenditure of the drive to stop stubble burning will be around ₹5,000,000. In 2020, the bio-decomposer solution was sprayed only in fields growing non-basmati rice last year. But this time, the government will spray it in all fields including those that grow basmati rice.A committee of 25 members has been formed to approach farmers and carry out the drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/biodecomposer-solution-cheaper-than-other-alternatives-to-stubble-burning-cm-101632469301873.html
24-09-2021||Kolkata||Bengal teacher arranges for ‘vaccine rath’, gets 500 tribal women vaccinated with 1st dose||A 34-year-old primary school teacher from West Bengal’s Paschim Bardhaman district single-handedly ensured that at least 500 women, including lactating mothers and senior citizens, from a remote tribal village, get their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. To accomplish this daunting task he not just counselled the women, but even arranged for a few hundred mobile numbers from his friends, relatives and neighbours to get more than 1,000 women registered on the CoWin app. He turned a bus into a ‘Vaccine Rath’ to help women reach the nearest vaccination centre from the village. “I regularly go to some of the tribal villages in Jamuria block to teach a few hundred students and their parents free of cost. There, I found that even though the government was pressing for everyone to take the vaccine, particularly women, as there is an apprehension of a third wave, none of the tribal women in the villages was vaccinated. This, not only made them vulnerable, but even their children were at risk,” said Deep Narayan Nayak, who works as a teacher in a state-run free primary school for tribal children. Fondly called ‘Rastar Master’ (teacher of the street) and respected by young and old in the villages, Nayak started collecting the names and found that the number was huge – more than 500 in Joba Attpara and its adjoining three to four villages. They were all from tribal communities like Munda and Tudu. Then came the challenge of registering the women on the CoWin app. Coming from very poor families, the women didn’t have any smartphones. Nor can so many women be registered on one mobile. “At the most, only four persons can be registered through one mobile number on CoWin. I had three numbers. So, I started gathering numbers from my friends, relatives, neighbours and anyone in the villages where I go to teach. Initially, I registered around 500 women,” said Nayak. On the day of vaccination, he hired a school bus and named it ‘Vaccine Rath’ on which 500 women were picked up from the village in phases and taken to the Akhalpur Block Primary Health Centre, around 10 kilometres away, to vaccinate them. They were again dropped back to the village after their vaccination. “Had it not been for ‘master’, a few hundred women like me would have never gone to the vaccination centre to get the first dose. Now that we have received the first dose, the fear is gone and I would definitely go when I need to take the second jab,” said Belmuni Marani, mother of a year-old child and resident of Joba Attpara village. Seeing these 500 women, more women from adjoining villages started coming forward with their fear fading away. So far, Nayak has registered around 1,160 women for vaccination. Now they don’t need any bus or ‘rath’. Many have started going to the vaccination centre on their own to get the jab.“Earlier, I used to fear that I may die if I take the vaccine or I may fall sick. But when the master told us that nothing of that sort would happen and the vaccine was necessary for me and my child, I took the first jab. I am fine and didn’t fall ill. I would definitely return for the second dose,” said Kiran Tudi, a resident of an adjacent village named Joba Kathalpara. Tudi is the mother of one of Nayak’s students. The job didn’t end after just vaccinating these women. For the next three days after the first jab, Nayak enquired with the village women to find out if there were any complaints of adverse events following immunization (AEFI). “It was really a challenging task. Nayak single-handedly counselled the tribal women as they were afraid of taking the vaccine, registered them on the app and arranged a vehicle to ensure that at least 500 get the first jab. Now, more women from adjoining villages are coming,” said Dr Abinash Besra, Block Medical Officer of Health at Jamuria Block – I.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-teacher-arranges-for-vaccine-rath-gets-500-tribal-women-vaccinated-with-1st-dose-101632471247262.html

24-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC extends stay on eviction, demolition in view of pandemic||The Bombay high court on Friday extended till October 8 the general stay on eviction, demolition, or dispossession in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. It said if the pandemic situation improves, it is unlikely to extend the interim stay beyond that date.A bench comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta, justices A A Sayed, S S Shinde and P B Varale issued the order while hearing a Public Interest Litigation.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni told the bench that experts say the incubation period after the end of Ganesh Chaturthi festival was not yet completed. As such, he added, the government would give an opinion on the Covid-19 situation later.Kumbhakoni said the festival was celebrated by individuals and families over a period of one and half-day to seven days. He added many who travelled to their home towns have returned to their workplaces. Kumbhakoni said if the incubation period was calculated according to one and a half-day, then the stipulated waiting period has been completed and there was no indication of the Covid-19 situation deteriorating. He added that there was less likelihood of the state extending Covid-19 lockdown norms. Kumbhakoni requested the bench to extend the protection only up to October 8.“...if the current improvement in the pandemic situation continues, the general interim orders in all likelihood will not be extended beyond two weeks,” the court said. It also clarified that it would take up the matter for fresh consideration if the situation deteriorated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-extends-stay-on-eviction-demolition-in-view-of-pandemic-101632468606682.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||‘Underwent severe mental breakdown’: Delhi hotel ordered to pay woman ₹2 cr for wrong haircut||A luxury hotel chain has been ordered to pay a compensation of ₹2 crore to a woman after a salon at their Delhi-based hotel allegedly gave her a wrong haircut and hair treatment more than three years ago, according to reports. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) observed that it shattered her dream to become a top model. "There is no doubt that the women are very cautious and careful with regard to their hair. They spend a handsome amount on keeping the hair in good condition. They are also emotionally attached to their hair. The complainant was a model for hair products because of her long hair," a bench of president RK Agrawal and member Dr SM Kantikar said, according to news agency ANI. The commission noted that the complainant was a model for hair products because of her long hair and modelled for big hair-care brands but due to the haircut against her instructions, she lost her expected assignments and suffered a huge loss. “She was also working as a Senior Management Professional and earning a decent income. She underwent severe mental breakdown and trauma due to negligence in cutting her hair and could not concrete her job and finally, she lost her job,” the bench said in an order dated September 21.The commission also held the hotel guilty of medical negligence in hair treatment and said that the woman’s scalp was burnt and she developed an allergy and itching because of the staff’s fault. The commission noticed that the complainant’s WhatsApp chat shows that the hotel admitted its fault and tried to cover it by offering free hair treatment.The woman said in the complaint visited the salon at the Delhi-based hotel a week before a job interview and specifically asked for “long flicks covering her face in the front and at the back and four-inch straight hair trim from the bottom” in April 2018. However, she alleged that the hairdresser did not follow her instruction and chopped off her hair leaving only four inches from the top. She complained about this to the management of the salon, which in turn offered her a free hair treatment. She claimed the treatment caused permanent damage due to excess ammonia, which resulted in excessive irritation in her scalp.She brought the incident to the notice of the higher authorities of the hotel but “in vain”. “Rather, they misbehaved and threatened her to face consequences,” she said in her complaint and approached NCDRC, according to PTI. She sought a written apology from the management as well as compensation of ₹3 crore for harassment, humiliation, and mental trauma. She claimed that she stopped seeking herself in the mirror, avoided social activities, lost her self-confidence due to little hair.However, the hotel chain claimed said her hair was cut as per her request and was not chopped off and that no harm was caused to her scalp with the excess ammonia during the hair treatment. The hotel’s lawyer also said that the complainant is not a “consumer” as the payment was declined and the hair treatment was also provided to her free of charge. It claimed that the woman filed the complaint with a malafide intention to malign its reputation and goodwill and to extract unreasonably high and exaggerated compensation.However, the commission ordered the hotel chain to compensate the woman. “The complaint is allowed partly and we are of the considered view that it would meet the end of justice in case the complainant is granted compensation of ₹2,00,00,000. Hence, we direct the Opposite Party No.2 to pay a compensation of to the Complainant within eight weeks,” it ordered.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hotel-ordered-to-pay-woman-rs-2-cr-for-wrong-haircut-101632466179256.html

The level of water was a little too high near the spot where the elephant got stuck. Though elephants are good swimmers it got tired and was looking for ways to get out,” said Mohanty.Officials said on Friday locals found the tusker trumpeting and converged over the Mundali barrage as fire brigade personnel thought of ways to rescue the elephant. They first put a net around it to stop it from getting swept away and then planned to bring a crane to lift it out of the swirling waters.A couple of hours later, the elephant however slowly regained its strength and started wading through the water though the water level kept on rising covering half its body. “Our personnel are throwing tree branches so that it eats something. The elephant has been stuck in the river for over six hours and needs to cross at least 20 metres to reach the riverbank. We are very hopeful that the elephant will make its way to the riverbank,” said Mohanty.Wildlife expert and member of Odisha State Biodiversity Board, Jayanta Mardaraj said though elephants are good swimmers and regularly cross rivers without any problem, the water current may have been the stumbling block. After floodwaters were released from Hirakud reservoir over last week, Mahanadi has been in spate,” said Mardaraj.He said the fragmentation of the elephant corridors was the main reason for the tusker’s woes. “The riverbank has been encroached by farmhouses and elephants are now taking longer routes to cross rivers. In my youth, I have seen elephants regularly crossing the river from Chandaka to Banki effortlessly. But encroachment on the riverbanks is a major issue,” he said.In August this year, the National Green Tribunal ordered the Odisha government to notify 14 elephant corridors in the state within the next two months culminating in the realisation of the long-standing demands of elephant conservationists for declaration of the same that would give legal sanctity to the elephant paths.Responding to a petition by wildlife conservationist Biswajit Mohanty the Eastern Zonal bench of the NGT said that the 14 corridors identified by Asian Nature Conservation Foundation, a non-profit public charitable trust involved in the conservation of Asian elephants in 13 of the 30 districts be notified within two weeks.Mohanty had alleged that that though the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) had submitted details of elephant corridors in Odisha to the forest and environment department in 2012 for identification of 14 corridors with a length of 420.8 kms and a width of 0.08 km to 4.6 kms, no action was being taken for their formal notification under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-forest-officials-launch-operation-to-rescue-lone-tusker-stuck-in-mahanadi-river-101632466507053.html

The petitioner has been granted bail,” said Justice Mukta Gupta.Singh, who was remanded to judicial custody on August 10 after his arrest, is accused of creating enmity between different groups and inciting the youth to propagate against a particular religion at a rally at Jantar Mantar here on August 8.In his plea filed through advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, Singh claimed that he was “not involved in giving any inflammatory speech or raising any slogan against any person or community”.He asserted that the demand of establishing a Hindu nation did not attract Section 153A (hate speech) of the IPC and that he was not even present at the site at the time of sloganeering.The Delhi Police had opposed Singh's plea for his release on bail.On August 27, Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil had refused bail to Singh, arrested by the Delhi Police in the case, saying right to assemble and freedom to air one's thoughts are cherished under the Constitution.However, these are not absolute and have to be exercised with inherent reasonable restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hate-speech-case-delhi-hc-grants-bail-to-organiser-of-jantar-mantar-event-101632463554984.html

Pramod Nayak, the unit’s chief, said they have sent the recommendation to state Congress chief Mohan Markam.The demand for Pandey’s expulsion comes days after he and his supporters rushed to a police station on Wednesday and opposed the registration of a case against Congress leader Pankaj Singh for allegedly assaulting an employee of a government hospital. Pandey claimed Singh was being implicated because he is close to state minister TS Singh Deo, who has been involved in a power tussle with chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.Nayak said Pandey has said he is a supporter of Deo. “Every Congressman is a member of the party first... He also told journalists that police took action (against Singh) at the behest of higher authorities. Slogans against the chief minister were also raised.” He added Pandey’s conduct amounted to a breach of the party’s discipline.Rajkumar Tiwari, the unit’s vice president, moved a proposal for Pandey expulsion for six years. The proposal was seconded by general secretaries of the unit. Later all the members of the unit supported it before it was sent to Markam.Singh has questioned the case registered against him asking if he was being targeted for being close to Deo.Baghel, Deo, and Tamradhwaj Sahu, now home minister, emerged as the front runner for the chief minister’s post when Congress returned to power in the state In December 2018.The case against Singh put the focus back on the leadership struggle in Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/congress-district-unit-seeks-lawmaker-s-expulsion-amid-power-tussle-in-chhattisgarh-101632464465901.html
24-09-2021||Kolkata||BJP's Sukanta Majumdar, Priyanka Tibrewal booked over Kalighat protests||Sukanta Majumder, the newly-appointed president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal unit, said on Friday that the Kolkata Police have registered a ‘suo moto’ case against him and other party leaders in connection with protests with the body of a BJP leader near chief minister Mamata Banerjee's residence in the city earlier this week. The case has been registered at the Kalighat police station against Sukanta Majumder and other party leaders, including Arjun Singh, Jyotirmoy Singh Mahato, and Priyanka Tibrewal. According to officials familiar with the development, the FIR was registered under sections 143, 147, and 283 of the Indian Police Code (IPC), which relate to unlawful assembly, rioting, obstruction, and using criminal force to deter public servants from discharging their duties.The Kalighat area in Kolkata, which houses the chief minister's residence, saw a high-voltage drama on Thursday after BJP activists led by Sukanta Majumder engaged in a scuffle with the police after being stopped from holding a “peaceful demonstration” with the body of Manas Saha.According to police officials cited by PTI news agency, activists of the BJP were on their way to a crematorium from their party office for Dhurjati Saha’s last rites, when the flower-bedecked hearse suddenly took a detour through Harish Chatterjee Street, a part of the poll-bound Bhabanipur assembly constituency. As policemen threw a cordon and put guard rails to stop the hearse, forcing its driver to change direction, Majumder was seen running behind the carrier. He then sat in the middle of the road in front of the TMC supremo’s residence, with supporters raising slogans against the ruling party, as the hearse moved forward. BJP lawmaker Arjun Singh and the party’s candidate for Bhabanipur by-elections, Priyanka Tibrewal, were also seen protesting against the police action.Later, after a brief scuffle with the police, Majumder along with party colleagues was forced to leave the spot. He opposed the “manhandling” by the police personnel and alleged that the Mamata Banerjee government was stopping peaceful protesters instead of investigating the death of the BJP leader and apprehending the “murderers”.Dhurjati Saha allegedly come under attack in May when the counting of votes was in progress. Violent protests erupted on Wednesday when Saha, who unsuccessfully contested the March-April assembly polls from Magrahat Paschim constituency, died at a nursing home in the city; with BJP leaders claiming that ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporters assaulted him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjps-sukanta-majumdar-priyanka-tibrewal-booked-over-stir-near-didi-s-residence-101632461895105.html
24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Rahul Gandhi’s move to appoint Channi as Punjab CM bold decision: Jakhar||Punjab Congress leader Sunil Jakhar on Friday hit out at the party’s opponents for attributing motives to its choice of the chief minister in the state. Terming Charanjit Singh Channi’s appointment a bold decision, Jakhar said that the political opponents of the Congress are literally missing the forest for the trees in attributing political motives to the party’s choice of chief minister. Also read: Channi meets central leadership in Delhi to discuss cabinet expansion“What Rahul Gandhi has done by choosing Channi as CM is that he has broken the barely perceptible glass ceiling,” the former Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president tweeted. Channi is Punjab’s first Scheduled Caste chief minister. Jakhar, a Hindu face, was a frontrunner for the chief minister’s post with Rahul’s backing after Capt Amarinder Singh resigned following months of internal strife that left the state unit divided. His name was more or less final at one stage, but a section of party leaders, including Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Ambika Soni and some MLAs, pressed for a Sikh CM. He later even took a dig at “petty-minded small people occupying high positions” for trying to divide Punjab on the basis of race/caste/identities. Says Punjabiat being put to test again Jakhar said the bold decision (Channi’s appointment), though rooted in the ethos of Sikhism, is nevertheless a watershed moment not only for the polity but also for the social fabric of the state. “The warp and weft of this fabric is a complex interplay of aspirations and anxieties of all sections of society. This must be respected, maintained and nurtured as ‘raj dharma’ at all times,” he said, adding, “But there is clear and present danger of Punjabiat being put to test once again with usual divisive forces already weaponising this transformative initiative to fragment society”. Jakhar said this threat cannot be wished away and if handled in inept and/or biased manner the prevailing robust brotherhood and amity, which has always been the pride of Punjab even in testing times, can be just as fragile and shatter just as easily as a “glass house”. The new Congress dispensation is being keenly watched to see whether it has what it takes, he added. Chance meeting with Rahul Gandhi Jakhar’s statement came after he travelled with Rahul and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to Delhi on Wednesday evening when they were returning from Shimla. Though it was speculated that Rahul took feedback from him on expansion, Jakhar called it a “chance meeting”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rahul-gandhi-s-move-to-appoint-channi-as-punjab-cm-bold-decision-jakhar-101632462364601.html

DHFL said it should be discharged of all criminal proceedings registered against it prior to the CIRP after the resolution plan was approved. But the special court rejected the plea and forced DHFL to move the high court.Senior advocate Ravi Kadam, representing the DHFL, told a single-judge bench of justice S K Shinde that the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had conducted the CIRP and approved Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Ltd (PCHFL) as the resolution applicant. Kadam added thereafter DHFL filed an application in the special court seeking discharge or dropping of proceedings against it as per section 32A of the IBC.Kadam said yet the special court rejected the application for discharge saying DHFL would be prosecuted through its promoters the Wadhwan brothers as they were conducting its affairs when the alleged offence was committed.Advocate Hiten Venegaonkar, who appeared for the CBI, opposed the plea saying the NCLT order was under challenge.PCHFL also filed an intervention application through senior advocate Aabad Ponda and concurred with the arguments of Kadam about section 32A of IBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dewan-housing-finance-ltd-moves-hc-seeks-discharge-in-corruption-case-by-cbi-101632457986064.html
24-09-2021||Patna||Todarmal’s diary to offer authentic information about land revenue system during Mughal age||Would it not be interesting to learn about the land measurement and revenue system introduced by Raja Todarmal, the finance minister and counsellor of Mughal Emperor Akbar during the medieval age? A far more fascinating reading can be the details of the kind of habitations and the farming patterns available in Bihar at that time, especially in Bhagalpur district and the information related to the revenue administration system in the state during the Mughal period.All these details and information are available in Raqababandi Todarmali of Pargana Bhagalpur, the diary of Raja Todarmal who was one among the Navaratans of Emperor Akbar. And to bring these facts and figures among people, Bihar State Archives, part of the Cabinet Secretariat Department of Bihar Government, has got this diary translated from Persian into English and is preparing to get it published under the title, Raqababandi Todarmali, Pargana Bhagalpur, Sarkar Munger, Mazaf Suba Bihar.The Todarmali Diary was originally written in Persian in 1594 and after more than 500 years, the state archive is coming up with its English version.On Wednesday, some experts on medieval history and the Persian language were invited by the state archive to review the forthcoming English version of Todarmali diary. It has been translated by Muzaffar-e Islam, former assistant director, National Archives, Delhi.“We have been pursuing this project for the last two years. Todarmal’s diary has for years been available at the state archive and many wanted to go through it, but couldn’t because of the language problem,” Mahendra Pal Singh, director, state archive, said. Even for the translation work, getting an expert on this script of the diary was quite difficult.“Some of the numerical used in the diary seems to be in vogue during Mughal age,” he said.It’s for the convenience of historians and researchers, the state archive is getting it published in English. “People may get it from our office. The state archive is also preparing to put Todarmal’s diary in the e-library of the state archive. Anyone in any part of the world will be able to go through it on the state archives’ website,” he said.Muzaffar-e Islam, the man who has prepared the English version of Todarmali diary, said the content is related mainly to the land measurement and land revenue system in the Bhagalpur district.“One can find here the way Todarmal maintained facts and figures about the area under habitations and cultivation in Bhagalpur,” he said. The diary has revealed that over two and a half percent of the total land area in Bhagalpur was under cultivation at that time while villages over two lakh Bighas were under cultivation. The total area was more than seven lakh Bighas, he added.“In fact, land was the only source of revenue at that time and its details were maintained meticulously. Even today, we can maintain a database of the land under cultivation, for habitation and for other purposes,” he said. The second part of the diary has the list of Mauja or land, under the title Tarikhe-e Fehrist Diwat, he added.“All these details were written in 1594 over handmade papers of the diary or the Raqababandi Todarmali of Pargana Bhagalpur. In 1862, a British collector named Renny got the pages preserved and made it hardbound,” a former official of the National Archives, said.The official said this diary can be considered the most authentic information about the land revenue system in the state during the Mughal period. “There has been no tampering with the facts. To ensure that there will be no fraud or confusion with the facts, the then British age collector, Renny, had got all the 400 pages of the diary signed,” he said.Dr Imtiaz Ahmad, a former Patna University teacher and an expert on medieval history, said, the English version of Todarmal Dairy would definitely benefit many researchers and historians who have been trying to get to the authentic information. “In fact, many parts of Todarmal’s land revenue system were adopted by the British rulers. It would be easier now to understand those aspects,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/todarmals-diary-to-offer-authentic-information-about-land-revenue-system-during-mughal-age-101632457025255.html

24-09-2021||Bangalore||Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to address joint sitting of K’taka legislature today||Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla will on Friday address both houses of the Karnataka legislature, state legislative assembly speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri said on Wednesday. Om Birla will address Friday's session at 2.30pm on the topic "Democracy - Safeguarding Parliamentary Values." This is the first time he will address the joint session of the two houses of a legislature. Friday will be the last day of the 10-day long legislature session which started on September 13.According to an official statement, the Lok Sabha Speaker's address will see the participation of the chairman of the state legislative council Basvaraj Horatti, assembly speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, state ministers, MLAs, MPs and MLCs and other dignitaries.However, the Congress party, which is the main opposition in Karnataka, will boycott Om Birla's address. The Congress said that Birla's address at the legislative assembly chamber will set a "wrong precedent" as no one other than the country's President and Karnataka governor has addressed such joint sittings till now."When the matter came up at the Business Advisory Committee meeting, I had said, it will set a new precedent, as so far no Lok Sabha speaker has addressed the joint sitting in the assembly. Let's not set a new precedent, also there is no scope for it in the constitution," the leader of opposition in the assembly Siddaramaiah told reporters on Thursday.He said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government was not ready to extend the session by at least one week, adding that both houses met after six months and there are numerous issues to be discussed. "We have decided to boycott in protest," the former Karnataka chief minister said.Echoing his concerns, state Congress president DK Shivakumar said on Thursday that there is no scope of an address by Om Birla speaker inside the assembly "as per our parliamentary system and our business rules." Taking a jibe at the Lok Sabha Speaker's topic of address, Shivakumar said it seemed that the ruling dispensation agreed to the fact that democracy and parliamentary values have deteriorated under their rule.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/lok-sabha-speaker-om-birla-to-address-joint-sitting-of-k-taka-legislature-today-101632445895336.html

24-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi to prepare bio-decomposer solution from today to fight stubble burning||The Delhi government will start preparing a bio-decomposer solution from Friday for spraying across farmlands in order to stop stubble burning which leads to air pollution in the national capital. The bio-decomposer solution will be ready by October 5 and the government will spray it free of cost. The expenditure of this drive will be around ₹5,000,000.According to news agency ANI, the government, in association with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, developed the bio-decomposer capsule. This capsule can be converted into a solution that can be sprayed on crop stubble in farmlands. Once sprayed, the solution decomposes the stubble into compost in 20 days, ANI added.“Last year, the Delhi government, in association with Pusa Institute, sprayed bio-decomposer on the fields. We got a lot of positive responses. We presented that entire report to the Central Commission for Air Quality Management and they asked for a third-party audit. The audit has been done and the report has been handed over,” Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said while addressing a press conference on Monday.Also Read| ‘Neighbouring states ready to try bio-decomposer for stubble pollution’: Delhi minister Gopal RaiPointing out that stubble burning contributes to the national capital’s pollution which reaches a dangerous level; Rai said that previously, many laws were made to deal with this problem. “Penalties were imposed on the farmers but no solution was found,” the environment minister also told reporters on Monday.The solution was sprayed only in fields growing non-basmati rice last year. However, this year the government will spray it in all fields including those that grow basmati rice.A committee of 25 members has been formed to approach farmers and carry out the drive. The Delhi government also said that farmers will only have to fill a form and the bio-decomposer solution will be sprayed in their fields free of cost.Hindustan Times earlier reported that farmers in Delhi only burn only 1% of stubble and the smoke from stubble burning in states such as Haryana and Punjab contributes majorly to the winter pollution in the national capital.Environment minister Gopal Rai said on Thursday that neighbouring states are willing to experiment with the bio-decomposer solution to combat stubble burning, adding that such states and the Centre should prepare to spray the solution on a war-footing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-prepare-bio-decomposer-solution-from-today-to-fight-stubble-burning-101632444741381.html

This was aimed to keep a check on anti-social elements.Station director Tarun Kumar said railways has no jurisdiction outside the premises of the station area. “We have already conveyed our concerns to the traffic police and the municipal corporation regarding this menace. Now, clearing the traffic from the gates is their responsibility,” said Kumar.Meanwhile, joint commissioner of police, city, Deepak Pareek claimed that a 24/7 naka is installed outside the railway station as it is a crucial spot from safety point of view. “Our forces remain deployed there and they keep moving the traffic outside the railway gates,” said the JCP.Deepali Arora, a passenger carrying a luggage bag, waiting to board the Amritsar-Delhi morning Shatabdi, said, “I wasn’t frisked and neither did anyone ask me to put my luggage through the baggage scanner machine. Such negligence can prove risky.”HT on Tuesday had highlighted that the lone baggage scanner at the station which has three entry points was lying defunct.A senior railway security official at the station said, “I have already told the maintenance team to expedite the repair of the baggage scanner. It will be made functional soon. Our teams carry out manual checking of security too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chaos-security-lapse-at-ludhiana-railway-station-amid-rain-101632433982385.html

In several areas, residents complained of water entering their homes and shops, washing away the municipal corporation’s tall claims of rain readiness.Main roads, including the Ferozepur road, Model Town-Jawaddi road, Gill Road, Hambran Road, Dugri, BRS Nagar, underpass of the Southern bypass on Ferozepur road and the underpass near Lodhi club remained inundated. The problem persisted even near the Dholewal Chowk and Clock Tower, where MC officials had claimed that corrective steps had been taken to prevent flooding. The civic body authorities had claimed that a storm sewer line had been installed near the Clock Tower and a choked internal drain has been reopened in Dholewal area to drain out the rainwater fast. Officials stated that the drain line was choked due to dumping of garbage by residents and shopkeepers. Potholes on roads across the city added to the commuters’ misery. Water enters shops, housesIn New Kundanpuri, Shivaji Nagar, Hargobind Nagar, Haibowal and other areas, water entered people’s homes and shops, prompting many to make desperate attempts to drain out the accumulated water. Many resorted to setting up temporary barricades at the entrance while others were seen using buckets and other utensils to drain the water.Gurjeet Singh, a resident of New Kundanpuri, said, “After the water-level in Buddha Nullah increased, the sewer lines in adjoining areas got choked and rainwater mixed with sewage entered our houses. We saved our furniture and other belongings, but could not stop the sewer water from entering our house.” The situation was no better in city markets, especially those situated in old city areas. Heavy waterlogging was seen in Talab Bazar, Gur Mandi, Chaura Bazar, Gill road and other areas.Gurdeep Singh, a shopkeeper in Talab Bazar, said, “It was difficult for us to even reach our shops in the morning due to waterlogging. Authorities claim to be turning the city into a smart city, but they are not able to find a solution to even the most basic problems here.”Waterlogging was witnessed even near the deputy commissioner’s residence in Rakh Bagh. What was more embarrassing, however, was that even the roads outside the municipal corporation’s own offices in Sarabha Nagar, Gill Road and Mata Rani Chowk were inundated. A small portion of road caved-in near the residence of former mayor Harcharan Singh Gohalwaria in Dugri Phase 2. As per MC officials, the incident was reported due to sewer line leak and field staff was deputed to repair the damaged portion.Mayor, Ashu oversee ops While municipal corporation (MC) officials remained on their toes to expedite the work of draining out accumulated water, mayor Balkar Sandhu and MLA Bharat Bhushan Ashu moved around the city to oversee the work. Mayor Sandhu said water accumulation took place due to heavy rainfall and the drain lines got choked due to dumping of garbage and plastic material by residents. Mayor Sandhu said if the weather remains clear after Friday, the hot mix plant will be made operational to repair the pothole-ridden city roads at the earliest. Residents take sarcastic dig on social media:Furious residents meanwhile took to social media to lash out at the civic body and other elected representatives for their failure to rein in on the problem of waterlogging. Many residents posted videos and pictures of waterlogging and potholed roads. Buddha Nullah overflows, sewer water enters fields, homes The Buddha Nullah overflowed from at least three points near Peeru Banda area in Salem Tabri, leading to sewer water entering the adjoining fields. Residents said that the civic body had reduced the height of the embankments around the nullah on New Kundanpuri side for road construction, which is why the nullah overflowed. Due to this, waterlogging was witnessed in New Kundanpuri, Upkar Nagar, Chander Nagar among other areas. Residents said they suspect that the water-level may have also increased as the authorities release 100 cusecs of water in the nullah under the project to reduce pollution. MC officials, however, stated the process of releasing water was stopped on Wednesday in anticipation of rain. MC superintending engineer Rajinder Singh said teams were deployed around the nullah to keep tabs on the situation.Power outages add to residents woes in various partsAmid the downpour and waterlogging, several parts of the city, including BRS Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Sant Isher Singh Nagar, Model Town, Haibowal and Janta Nagar, experienced power cuts. In some parts, there were scheduled cuts due to maintenance work by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited.

The government withdrew notification after drawing criticism from various employees’ unions. “The dearness allowance will be given to officers along with other employees and pensioners,” said CM Jai Ram Thakur when asked about the strong resentment among employees and other officers. There are about four lakh employees in the state. They were expecting the government to hold a meeting of the joint coordination committee.

24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi shows interest in ‘Mission Lal Lakir’, orders drone survey in his constituency Chamkaur Sahib||The ‘Mission Lal Lakir’, a Punjab government’s project to empower the village residents by providing them rights of properties they have been living in for generations, has caught the attention of new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. In the first cabinet meeting he chaired after taking charge, instructions were issued to start drone surveys to be started in from Ropar district’s Chamkaur Sahib, the assembly constituency he represents. “The CM directed to cover Ropar district on priority,” said an officer who attended the cabinet meeting. “We will start flying drones over villages in Chamkaur Sahib within a week,” said a senior official, who is part of the mission. There are at least 200 villages in the constituency along with two municipal towns of Morinda and Chamkaur Sahib. The project, a part of the central government’s Svamitva (‘Survey of Villages for Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Area) scheme, called Mission Lal Lakir in the state, was launched last year for an integrated property validation solution in rural areas. It started in Gurdaspur district and is now being taken to 5 more districts. As per initial plans, the project for giving proprietary rights to dwellers inside ‘lal dora’ was to be expanded to Fazilka, Bathinda, Barnala, Faridkot and Fatehgarh Sahib districts but with the change of guard the expansion plan is being reworked. It was a long-pending demand of the rural residents to prepare a detailed inventory of all properties within the ‘lal lakir’ and give ownership rights so that villagers can monetise their immovable assets. The state revenue department has constituted a steering committee led by chief secretary with district-level monitoring committees headed by the deputy commissioners, said mission director Keshav Hingonia. So far, survey has been completed in 350 villages and maps of 20 villages have been verified and sent back to the Survey of India, the National Mapping Agency (NMA). Objections have been invited by displaying maps in 40 villages. The state has 12,500 villages which will be covered under the Svamitva scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-shows-interest-in-mission-lal-lakir-orders-drone-survey-in-his-constituency-chamkaur-sahib-101632429420591.html

Among them, Camelia, offering both residential and commercial units, in Kharar, and GBP Centrum (commercial) in Zirakpur have been under construction since 2016, with not a single allottee given possession.At two other projects – Athens (residential and commercial) and Aeroze (residential) – both on the Airport road, construction has remained stalled for years, and at a residential colony in New Chandigarh, where plots have been sold, construction has not even begun.Nearly ₹500 crore, invested by over 2,500 people from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pardesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and several NRIs, are riding on these projects.Criteria not met, investment pulled outIn June this year, UK-based SRAM & MRAM Group had signed an agreement with the GBP Group to invest around ₹700 crore in its projects, giving allottees new hope. But it has now backed out.In a letter to the GBP Group, director (finance), SRAM & MRAM Group, Thomas Mathew stated, “Our teams have verified all the documents and other information available through other sources. We are unable to proceed further with the investment proposal due to non-fulfilment of criteria of internal policy and guidelines.”“While we have already paid them the first instalment of ₹6.5 crore, they failed to fulfil the criteria. So, the investment will be cancelled,” Chaittnya Aggarwal, director, SRAM & MRAM Group, India, told HT.MD on the run, facing several casesGBP Group’s managing director Satish, Gupta, who could not be contacted as his mobile phone was switched off, is already facing multiple cases in Mohali and Chandigarh.“One FIR is registered in Mullanpur for carving out plots without permission.

But two years later, construction has not progressed. The MD and his family are absconding, and giving us no answers,” said Kush Bagroy, an investor from Mohali.In the same boat, Murthi Devi, an investor from Panipat, said, “ ₹45 lakh of my hard-earned money is riding on a food court at GBP Centrum.

Thereon, the owner filed a revision petition before the UT adviser, following which the adviser, on June 19, 2002, restored the site to the owner, subject to the payment of 10% penalty. The petitioner was also directed to apply for change in trade within 30 days.However, even after the owner complied with the order, the assistant estate officer (AEO) on October 27, 2003, while initiating fresh proceedings of misuse, issued a fresh show-cause notice to the owner.Vide an order dated March 5, 2014, the AEO also demanded misuse charges amounting to ₹18 lakh.Appeals were filed in the court of Dr Vijay Namdeorao Zade, UT chief administrator, by the SCF owner and his son, the co-owner, as they had already complied with the order passed by the adviser.In the appeals, advocate Vikas Jain, counsel for the appellants, submitted that in the order, the adviser had specifically mentioned that as per the amendment in the Building Rules, the change of trade had been allowed by the Chandigarh administration and as such the petitioner was free to apply for change in trade.The Estate Office agreed with the contentions of the counsel that the owner had duly complied with the adviser’s order and admitted the applicability of the amendment notification in the present case.Thereafter, the UT chief administrator set aside the orders of the AEO waived the ₹18 lakh penalty imposed on account of misuse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/misuse-charges-against-scf-owner-chandigarh-estate-office-concedes-mistake-18-lakh-penalty-waived-101632429303954.html

He said on Dagar’s instructions, Sajjan, alias Bholu, from Jhajjar, Haryana, and Anil Kumar, from Dwarka in Delhi, had shot dead Middukhera in Mohali. “Chaudhary has been arrested from Karnal jail after securing his production warrant and more facts are expected to emerge during his interrogation. Dagar will also be brought from Mandoli jail soon,” Singh said.The official said it was also revealed by Chaudhary that Lucky had carried out the murder of Sukhmeet, alias Deputy, a resident of Jalandhar on June 20, this year.

He phoned me around 11.30am yesterday and used foul language for not towing his line. I told him the DDPO office will proceed as per the rulebook to ensure elected gram panchayats representatives could work independently,” said the official.If a gram panchayat is unable to maintain a quorum for any reason, the state authorities appoint an administrator who then can spend the grants for village development. In his complaint, the DDPO alleged the MLA was using extraneous pressure and intended to harm him physically.Rejecting the allegations, MLA Awla said he did not threaten the DDPO or used unparliamentarily language against him.“There are numerous complaints of harassment by sarpanches against the DDPO. He is accused of unnecessary delay in public works. Being an MLA, I have every right to contact an official in public interest and fix his responsibility,” he added.Director (rural development and panchayats) Manpreet Singh Chhatwal confirmed that the matter was brought to his notice by the DDPO.Fazilka DC Arvind Pal Singh said he was yet to get the details. “We will sit and settle the matter amicably,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jalalabad-mla-issuing-threats-to-me-alleges-fazilka-officer-files-complaint-101632429060705.html

SGPC chief Jagir Kaur said, “We have written several times to the Centre for bringing 30 locally managed historic gurdwaras under the SGPC’s direct control as per the Sikh Gurdwaras Act. But the government is not responding to our repeated requests in this regard besides other demands. It is due to this non-serious attitude of the Union government that even the SGPC general elections are not being held on time.”Kaur also expressed concern over the alleged disrespect shown to the beard of Sikh men in Delhi during a protest in support of the farmers’ agitation. “I appeal to the farmer leaders to issue statements to clarify their stance on this. The guilty should be punished,” she said. Action should be taken on the recommendations of a sub-committee formed to look into the evidence of army action at the Golden Temple and the Akal Takht in June 1984, she added. “The pain of the genocide is still there in the hearts of Sikhs,” Kaur said. Also, the historic well of the sixth Guru in the basement of Akal Takht Sahib will soon be opened for the devotees, she further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sgpc-to-send-delegation-to-meet-shah-seeking-direct-control-on-30-historic-gurdwaras-101632428400520.html
24-09-2021||Chandigarh||3 British Sikhs freed in 2009 Rulda Singh murder case||A UK court on Wednesday discharged three British Sikhs — Piara Singh Gill, Amritivir Singh Wahiwala and Gursharanvir Singh Wahiwala — held in connection with the 2009 murder of RSS leader Rulda Singh, who was shot in Patiala, due to insufficient evidence. The arrests followed early morning raids on Indian extradition warrants executed by the West Midlands Police in December last year.They were held in connection with the 2009 murder of Rulda Singh, a senior RSS member, who was shot in Patiala and died a week after the attack. District judge Michael Snow presided over an appeal hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London. He ruled: “The accused have been discharged,” said the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which appears in court on behalf of the Indian authorities.Crowds of supporters of the so-called “West Midlands 3” gathered outside the court in support of the accused. An investigation into the case by the West Midlands Police dates back to 2011, with the judge noting that the issue had been a “long running saga” for the three men.Their lawyer described the allegations against them as “wholly unjust”. The prosecution conceded that the evidence was “not sufficient to make out a case” against them. Two men, aged 37 and 40, were arrested in Coventry and a 38-year-old man was arrested in Wolverhampton last year. They were granted bail under “strict conditions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-british-sikhs-freed-in-2009-rulda-singh-murder-case-101632428100201.html
24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Heavy rain worries paddy farmers in Punjab, Haryana days ahead of procurement||Heavy rain accompanied by high-speed winds in several parts of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana on Thursday left the farmers and the agriculture departments worried days ahead of the start of paddy procurement in the two states. In Punjab, paddy procurement will start formally from October 1 while the Haryana government has announced to start the process from Saturday (September 25). The agriculture departments rushed their field teams to assess the damage and issue advisories to the farmers. Waterlogging of fields and flattening of the standing crop was reported in several districts. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has ordered a special girdawari to assess the damage caused to crops because of rain and waterlogging.Agriculture experts said not only the procurement will get delayed but the crop health will also be affected if it continues to rain in the coming days. Also, the grain will be vulnerable to shrivelling, blackening and discolouration. Nearly 31 lakh hectares was under cultivation of paddy, including basmati, this year. As per reports from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Haryana received 20.5mm rainfall on Thursday. Heavy rain was witnessed in several districts, including Jind, Sonepat, Panipat, Kaithal, Hisar, Fatehabad, Bhiwani, Rewari Karnal, Kurukshetra and Ambala. Punjab agriculture commissioner BS Sidhu said it was a cause of worry but there is no emergency-like situation. “We are observing the ground situation as the district agriculture authorities have been asked to remain stationed on the ground. The weather conditions remained perfect for the growth of crop this kharif season but more rain in the coming days will affect procurement. The meteorological department has issued a warning of more rainfall in the days to come,” Sidhu said. Aditya Dabas, deputy director of Haryana agriculture department, Karnal, said, “Rain at this stage is harmful for paddy as it may lead the attack of white-backed plant hopper insect in the standing crop. And this insect spreads in the entire field within a few days if its population was not controlled at the early stage.”Amandeep Singh Chahal , a farmer from Dhadhera village of Punjab’s Patiala district, said the farmers were staring at losses as rain at this stage will reduce the yield. “More rain would add to our woes as it will increase the moisture content in the grain. Till Tuesday, the crop was in good condition and we were expecting high yield,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/heavy-rain-worries-paddy-farmers-in-punjab-haryana-days-ahead-of-procurement-101632427800352.html
24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Former Punjab Police ASI gets 10-year jail in 1992 Amritsar fake encounter case||The special CBI court in Mohali on Thursday awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to former Punjab Police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Amrik Singh in a 1992 fake encounter incident that took place at Sathiala village of Beas in Amritsar district. CBI judge Harinder Kaur Sidhu had on Wednesday held Amrik guilty of kidnapping and murder of Gurvinder Singh (20), a resident of Pheruman village in Amritsar district. Another accused, inspector Wassan Singh, who was also charged with ex-ASI Amrik Singh, died during the trial. Besides, the judge on Thursday imposed a fine of ₹20,000 on the convict and in case of default of payment of the penalty he will have to undergo one-year extra rigorous imprisonment. The convict, who was sentenced under section 364 (to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years) of the Indian Penal Code, broke down in the courtroom. He was sent to the Patiala jail. The judge said even as the convict had no criminal background, the offence committed by him was “grave and of serious nature”. On July 21, 1992, a police party raided the house of Gurvinder and picked his father Chanan Singh. On the disclosure of Chanan, Gurvinder was picked from the house of his uncle in Jalandhar. Though Chanan was released, Gurvinder was shown as killed in an encounter the next day. The case was handed over to the CBI in 1997 and charges were framed against two accused three years later. The police claimed that Gurvinder was involved in murders, extortions and kidnappings, but the allegations turned out to be false during the trial. It took us 30 years to get justice, says victim’s family The family of the fake encounter victim, Gurvinder Singh, on Thursday said it was unfortunate that it took them nearly three decades to get justice in the case. The deceased brother, Parminder Singh (47), who was present in the court, said, “After the incident, my family was completely shattered. My father became mentally unstable due to the cold-blooded murder of Gurvinder who wanted to join the police force. He had just completed his intermediate and was planning to get enrolled in college, but he was picked up by police and killed in a fake encounter. Even I was sacked as a police constable eight days after the incident.”“Will they give me justice now?” he questioned. The deceased’s cousin Jagtar Singh said, “When the CBI registered a case in 1997, we were hopeful of getting justice soon. But even then it took 29 years to get justice. The CBI should have booked other associates of the accused who killed our brother.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-punjab-police-asi-gets-10-year-jail-in-1992-amritsar-fake-encounter-case-101632427680200.html

However, Moga police intervened and saved the Ludhiana cops from backlash.Advocate Parampal Singh Takhtupura, chairman of market committee Nihal Singh Wala, said, “The CCTV footage clearly shows that the SHO came from behind and slapped the deputy mayor without any reason.

In a statement, Dhindsa said that Punjab was in dire need of a strong regional party as a third alternative. “The people of Punjab should now realize that the Congress government could not take any decision for the welfare of the people on its own as now it has to depend on the decisions of Delhi darbar (high command),” he added. He said that it was not only the Congress but also the previous SAD-BJP government which had to act on the cues of BJP. “For a long time now, the ministers of the Punjab government are leaving the people of the state homeless and fighting among themselves for their vested political interests and the people of Punjab are paying the price for the ongoing political tussle,” he said. The former finance minister said that looking at the activities of the newly appointed chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi so far, it seemed like he was incapable of taking his own decisions and following the high command and Navjot Singh Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/decision-of-cong-s-delhi-darbar-being-imposed-on-punjab-dhindsa-101632427141289.html
24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Naraingarh sugar mill: Despite rollback of diversion order, farmers to protest in Panchkula||Even after the Haryana government cancelled its controversial notice of possibly diverting the cane area allotted to the private sugar mill in Naraingarh, if it fails to start operating for the next crushing season, farmers’ unions are still adamant about protesting against the cane commissioner outside his office in Panchkula on September 28, over non-payment of pending dues and salaries.The government had on September 13 written to three mills in Yamunanagar, Indri (Karnal) and Shahbad (Kurukshetra) to prepare for possible diversion of sugarcane crops of at least 7,000 farmers associated to the mill. However, soon after they opposed the decision, the notice was rolled back on September 17.A meeting was held under the banner of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) in Tandwal village on Thursday, to get a consensus among the farmers of Ambala and Panchkula for the agitation.Rajeev Sharma, district media coordinator of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Charuni), said that local farmers will gather with their belongings at the mill in the morning and proceed for Panchkula in the presence of senior leaders.Major issuesFarmers’ unions, including those from Charuni and Tikait groups along with Ganna Sangharsh Samiti, have protested atleast four to five times in the last six months demanding that their dues be paid. Narinder Malik, the then managing director of the sugar mill, had assured senior farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni that their payments will be released, but the government failed to do so. At least 300 employees of the mill are also staging a sit-in at the premises for the last 11 days, demanding their pending salaries and increment.Farmer leader Malkit Singh said that as decided in an earlier meeting at Saha, the protest will take place despite the rollback of the decision.“Farmers have not been taken into confidence yet. There is insecurity among them over their produce and if the mill won’t operate, how will they get their pending dues of last season worth ₹66 crore. Moreover, the mill has taken crop loans worth ₹33 crore in the name of farmers in 2013-14 ,that stands as it is,” he said.Sandeep Kamdar, a union chief representing the employees, said, “Other than the pending salary of two months, we have also demanded that seasonal/casual workers and those working for the last five years be made permanent.”Niraj, sub-divisional magistrate of Naraingarh, said that the decision has been scrapped and the mill will function properly for the crushing season. On the issue of payment of dues, he said, “We are expecting that the arrears will be paid-off once the mill starts functioning. The loan was taken by the farmers from the bank(s), even though the guarantee was given by the mill. The loan still stands in the name of farmers and there are no documents to prove what farmers are claiming.” He added that the employees’ demands have been forwarded to the government, but due to the poor financial situation of the mill, they couldn’t be met.Meanwhile, local Congress MLA Shally Chaudhary demanded that owing to the current situation, the government should take over the mill at the earliest.

24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn to high court: No floor-wise NOC issued for multi-storey apartments||The Chandigarh administration on Thursday told the high court that it hasn’t issued no-objection certificate (NOC) mentioning floor for any residential property where transfer deed was registered, except in one case in Sector 27. UT’s assistant estate officer Harjeet Singh Sandhu told high court bench of Justice TS Dhindsa and Justice Vivek Puri that floor was mentioned only in one case pertaining to Sector 27, which was on the request of the Punjab and Sind Bank after creation of charge on the property. The charge/ lien (form of security in a property to secure payment) was noted and taken on record for necessary action on the property records. The estate office does not issue NOCs mentioning particular floor. No such NOC mentioning floor on the basis of share of owner/co-owner was issued by the present head or any of his predecessors, as per records, except the ones which may have been issued on the basis of registered sale deeds executed as per Chandigarh Apartment Rules 2001. The response came as high court sought clarification on an office order issued on August 20 by UT estate office, which gave the impression that while issuing the NOC to banks to facilitate certain loan transactions, the share percentage as well as the floor may have been mentioned. The high court was hearing a clutch of petitions against conversion of residential plots into apartments. A survey conducted on an HC order has revealed that between 2016 and 2019, as many as 891 sale deeds were registered, where part of a property was sold outside the family. The plea argues residential plots in Chandigarh are meant to be single-dwelling units. However, in the recent years, these are being sold floor-wise to multiple owners, which will put additional burden on infrastructure. UT has maintained that it does not allow floor wise sale. The matter will be taken up on Friday as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-to-high-court-no-floor-wise-noc-issued-for-multi-storey-apartments-101632425163425.html

For vehicle fitness certificates a daily quota of 600 vehicles is allotted and currently there is a month’s waiting period for this. Under the special quota 25 permits will be issued daily. For learning licences pending September 30 is now the date that it can get it done under the special quota. “This decision will give relief to thousands of applicants who were waiting this month. Giving an additional quota to clear the pending certificates and licences is good,” said Manohar Kamble, an applicant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-rto-issues-special-quota-to-clear-pending-licences-and-certificates-101632425100065.html

We will not allow anybody to speak against farmers from gurdwara premises,” said the protesters, accusing Jhinda of playing into the hands of BJP leaders.On the other hand, Jhinda slammed the gurdwara management, Charuni and the protesters, saying, “The gurdwara belongs to all and it is not the property of anybody. But now, my fight is against Charuni. I will not allow him to enter my area.”A visibly angry Jhinda also warned the head priest of the gurdwara ‘kar sewa’ not to enter the area.Ahead of 2014 assembly polls, the Congress government had constituted a 41-member ad hoc HSGMC team to manage, supervise and take over assets of cash-rich gurdwaras in Haryana, giving a boost to the demand of a separate Sikh body in state.The committee, constituted under the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Act, 2014 was passed by the state assembly.While Jhinda was appointed president of the Haryana Sikh body, Didar Singh Nalvi was given the senior vice-president’s post.But later, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) approached the Supreme Court and challenged the formation of a separate Sikh body in Haryana.But later, a rift between Jhinda and Nalvi came to the fore for the post of president. Jhinda had also announced to form a political party. Due to poor health, Jhinda was not active for the past couple of years and in August last year, sidelining him, the then parallel jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib Baljit Singh Daduwal was elected president of the HSGMC with the support of Nalvi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exhsgmc-president-faces-farmers-protest-not-allowed-to-enter-karnal-gurdwara-101632424859481.html

During the course of investigation on Thursday, searches were conducted in five places, including the office of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. Officials seized cash of ₹13.5 lakhs and gold jewellery weighing around 6.5 kg approximately valued at ₹2.5 crore. They also identified documents relevant to the case. Around 10 kg of sandalwood articles and pieces were also identified at Venkatachalam’s residence. “We have requested the Tamil Nadu forest officials to take necessary action,” said a senior DVAC official not wishing to be named. The DVAC has booked Venkatachalam under charges of corruption while he was holding the post of member secretary of the Board from 2013 to 2014, as member secretary of State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) from 2017 to 2018 and as chairman of the pollution board from 2019 to till date. The FIR against him has been filed under several sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 as amended in 2018.“The gold found may cross 8 kg. We are not yet finished and the searches will continue,” said the DVAC official quoted above.Since the DMK government took over in May, this is the first search being conducted against an official in office.

This is the difference between the governments led by the AIADMK and DMK,” he said. “There is no such government elsewhere in India that is so quick.”The governments led by his party, the DMK, had always been a regime of farmers, he said and cited a resolution recently adopted in the Tamil Nadu assembly against the three farm laws of the Centre. “Farmers will for sure not forget this.”Listing initiatives taken up during the tenure of former chief minister M Karunanidhi like those related to the Cauvery issue, waiver of ₹7,000 crore farm loans (cooperative banks), providing land to landless farm labourers and free electricity to farmers, Stalin said the launch of the ‘one lakh electricity connections scheme’ for farmers is the new addition.No one need to think that the government-run electricity entity is flourishing as 100,000 connections were being provided and a majority of them at free of cost, he said, alleging that the electricity corporation was ruined during the previous AIADMK regime.The state-owned Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) is the holding company and it has two subsidiaries, the TN Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) and Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation. “This is the achievement of the AIADMK government (2011-21). The electricity board has ₹1.59 lakh crore debt and it has to pay ₹16,000 crore a year as interest.”The AIADMK government purchased power at a very high cost and discrepancies in actual, on hand coal stock and the quantity recorded in registers in thermal power stations reflected irregularities, the chief minister alleged.A mere “53 Megawatt was the installed capacity” during the previous AIADMK regime as its schemes for 1,481 MW installed capacity during its period comprised projects for 1,428 MW planned during the DMK regime (2006-11), he said.Stalin said his government has taken all steps to turn around the state-run electricity entities and listed initiatives like new power generation projects and expeditious maintenance work. Project work has commenced to generate 17,980 MW during the next 10 years and projects -- already in planning stage -- were being expedited.For the first time in the state, a Solar Power Park would be set up in Tiruvarur, and recently, TANGEDCO has inked a pact with Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency for developing renewable energy projects and for raising the requisite funding of ₹132,500 crore, he said.The one-lakh power connection scheme for farmers, that has been launched now, has sole aim of increasing farm production, he said, adding, “let this be the foundation for Tamil Nadu’s agriculture revolution and let this (scheme) help increase area of cultivation.” He urged the beneficiaries to use power only for necessity as electricity generation is highly expensive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tamil-nadu-chief-minister-stalin-gives-100k-power-connection-certificates-to-farmers-101632424439305.html

Farmers are not given rates of crops as per recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, bonus of ₹100 per quintal was not given on crops, and free tubewell connections were also not given,” he alleged.Hooda said the promise of doubling the income of farmers has proved to be a ‘jumla’.

24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh solid waste processing plant in Chandigarh: IIT Ropar’s report on technology pushed to October||The beginning of the work on upgrading of the beleaguered solid waste processing plant is set to get delayed further.The officials of the municipal corporation (MC) had earlier maintained, and in the General House meeting as well, that the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, would submit a detailed project report (DPR) and the request for proposal (RFP) on the project by September. But now the officials concede that the report is expected to be submitted at the earliest in mid-October or by October-end.The DPR and RFP are to be tabled before the MC General House, which, as per MC’s earlier plan, was to be done in the September meeting. Now, this is likely to be moved to the October-end House meet. The process of floating the tender and inviting firms for the project is likely to take another month after October, that is if the House approves the DPR and the RFP.The MC General House had on July 29 decided to allot the contract for preparation of the twin documents to IIT Ropar. The institute had sought three months for the preparation of DPR and RFP.Code of conduct for MC polls to push process further“After MC approves the DPR and RFP, one month will go into floating the tender and the work allotment will take another three months at least. So, the entire process will take four months. But with the code of conduct for the MC elections scheduled to come into force in November, the entire tendering process will be pushed well into the next year,” said a senior MC official.In June last year, the civic body had taken over the solid waste processing plant from Jaypee Group due to its inability to process waste in entirety. But since then, the MC has neither improved the plant’s working nor upgraded the technology, and most of the daily waste is still being dumped at the Dadumajra landfill.The Bharatiya Janata Party is still hoping that the revamp project of the plant could be cited as one of its major achievements in the last five years for the MC elections due in December.President of the Dumping Ground Joint Action Committee, Dyal Krishan, said, “It is now one year and three months since the MC took over the plant. But the civic body is yet to start the much-hyped upgrade process. In the meantime, the unprocessed garbage continues to be dumped here and the waste mountain is getting higher. Even if we assume that in another five-six months the MC allots the work, it will take another year for the plant to work at its full capacity. Till then residents of Dadumajra will continue to suffer.”Still hopeful of getting an early preparation of DPR and RFP, mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said, “I have asked the officials to speed up the process so that we can table the documents before the MC General House.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-solid-waste-processing-plant-in-chandigarh-iit-ropar-s-report-on-technology-pushed-to-october-101632424199571.html

Besides the stubble burning issue, the state is also preparing itself to handle air pollution issues arising every winter.”He assured the Centre that Haryana is fully geared up to handle the issue of agricultural crop residue burning and air pollution issues ahead of winter in state.Monitoring of active fire locations (AFLs) has already been started from September 15 by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board through HARSAC, following the standard protocol approved by the CAQM.Till date, not even a single incident of farm fire has been identified in Haryana, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-assures-centre-of-effective-steps-against-stubble-burning-101632424140452.html

It is not fair that the bishop is singled out and attacked by all. Whatever he has raised the state government will have to look into it,” the Rajya Sabha MP, who had called on Pala bishop Joseph Kallarangatt a couple of days back, told reporters in the state capital. He denied speculations that he was shortlisted for the state party’s president’s post. The BJP was first to support the bishop when he said on September 9 that Catholic girls and youth were targeted by elements behind ‘narcotic jihad’. Later many party leaders called on him. His statement triggered a war of words between different communities and opposition parties urged the government to call an all-party meeting. But the CM said there was no need to call a meeting to discuss what he said a “non-existent issue.” He said attributing crimes related to narcotics to a particular religion is wrong.Meanwhile, Syro-Malabar church, strongest among church denominations, rallied behind the bishop and said his statement was a warning against certain evil tendencies, such as growing narcotics use, and that it was not meant against any community. The church said the ‘narcotic jihad’ was a term coined by the European Foundation for South Eastern Studies in 2017 relating to the growing narcotic trade in Afghanistan. The bishop’s statement triggered a raging debate in the state. “Wherever arms are not used, narcotic drugs are being used and Catholic girls turn victims. Some groups are functioning in the state to support them. To understand this, one needs to analyse how women from other religions landed in the Islamic State camps,” he had said. The bishop was referring to 21 people from north Kerala who reportedly joined the Islamic State in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/narcotic-jihad-row-centre-will-call-meeting-of-christian-leaders-bjp-mp-101632424139283.html
24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Tube well installation in Chandigarh: NOC to be made mandatory for groundwater extraction||From installing smart meters to paying on consumption basis, people opting for groundwater extraction will have to comply with the new provisions to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the municipal corporation (MC) for installing tube wells.The MC will table the agenda before the MC General House meeting, scheduled on September 25, for amending the Chandigarh water supply by-laws to incorporate the guidelines of the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti on regulation and control of groundwater extraction. Guidelines lay down detailed procedures for issuing of NOC for a tube well and charges to be imposed.For getting the NOC, the proposed amendment states that users will have to install digital water flow meters, install roof top rainwater harvesting and recharge systems in the project area. Also, users will have to pay for groundwater abstraction and restoration charges based on the quantum of groundwater use.Construction of observation wells for groundwater level monitoring will be mandatory. If the existing wells become defunct due to mechanical failure the user can construct a replacement well after intimating the MC. The water requirement for green belt shall be met from recycled wastewater.Rates based on consumptionThe MC, as per the guidelines, will also impose consumption based charges rather than only fixed charges as is currently the practice. For drinking and domestic use, for groundwater abstraction ranging from 0 to 25 cubic metre per month, there will be no charges. Between 26 to 50 cubic metre per month, charges will be ₹1 per cubic metre; above 50, ₹2 will be charged.For bulk or tanker water supplies, the charges for groundwater abstraction will range from ₹10 to ₹25 per cubic metre of consumption. For groundwater restoration, the charges will be ₹35 per cubic metre.In case the fixed rates are higher, the MC will charge on that basis rather than on the basis of consumption. The fixed charges are based on the type of bore, ranging from ₹15,000 per month for a 55mm bore to ₹60,000 per month for bore above 150mm.31 NOCs issued so farThe MC has so far issued no-objection certificates to 31 entities for setting up tube wells on their properties. “The law allows for tube wells in residential properties but MC generally doesn’t give NOCs to such requests. In the 31 NOCs given so far, none of them are residential properties. Most of these are institutional properties,” said an MC official.In the sectorial grid where the water supply system is well established, the MC generally doesn’t give permission to install tube wells. ₹87 lakh to be spend on next Rose FestivalFor celebrating the Rose Festival in February 2022, the MC plans to spend ₹87 lakh. The MC General House will decide whether to celebrate the festival or not, and also the financial estimates for holding it. Last year, the celebrations were symbolic due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ₹2.66 crore for C&D plant upgradeFor upgrading the C&D plant, the MC is planning to spend ₹2.66 crore. The upgrade will include establishment of a fully automatic block making machine among other technology additions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tube-well-installation-in-chandigarh-noc-required-from-mc-for-groundwater-extraction-101632424021196.html

He made veiled attacks on the BJP for not giving party ticket to his daughter Arti Singh Rao in the 2019 assembly polls and making attempts to weaken him in southern Haryana.Rao’s loyalist Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh, Sonepat MP Ramesh Kaushik, Rohtak MP Arvind Sharma, Rajya Sabha MP DP Vats, Haryana ministers Banwari Lal and OP Yadav, and two MLAs loyal to Rao attended the rally in the presence of BJP state chief OP Dhankar.During the rally, the Rao supporters chanted slogans terming him ‘the next chief minister of Haryana’. Not a single slogan was raised in favour of BJP and on many instances Dhankar was seen in trouble after Rao Inderjit and Arti Singh attacked the BJP.In an indirect attack on newly-appointed Union cabinet minister Bhupender Yadav, Rao Inderjit said there are two ways to become a leader - to land a pursuit candidate with the blessings of high command or to become leader with people’s support by winning elections - and he has always opted the second method.“Few months ago, I was thinking of getting retired from active politics but now I have decided to remain more active in politics. People of my area and Opposition leaders are asking me to pitch my daughter in the election fray but the BJP did not give her ticket. I urge you to get ready for a big battle like the Battle of Panipat,” he said.“You must introspect whether the BJP had paid you enough for your support or not. The BJP had given a slogan of crossing 75 seats in the 2019 assembly polls, what happened to that slogan? Due to this slogan, I could not go out to the southern Haryana region and the party had been reduced to 40. I want to assure you that we will make a better decision at the right time,” he added.The Union minister said he has not sought anything from the BJP except respect for him, his people and the Ahirwal region.“I have not invited any senior BJP leader because two years ago, the then Union minister Manohar Parikar had skipped Shaheedi Diwas Samaroh in Rewari and only cabinet minister Rajnath Singh had attended it. If anyone skips our event, it is disrespectful to my people and our area. Some people are trying to weaken us but the people of my area are standing by me for the last 50 years. With their blessings, I reached Lok Sabha five times and the Haryana assembly four times,” he added.He also demanded to constitute Ahirwal regiment and urged four BJP MPs sitting on the dais to meet the high command and resolve protesting farmers’ issues against Centre’s three farm laws.Rao Inderjit’s daughter Arti Rao said some people have been creating hurdles in her political life.“I will contest the next election. At the right time, we will decide from where I will contest the polls. Many people are trying to backstab my father. But this rally will give a befitting reply to such opponents,” she added.Haryana BJP chief OP Dhankar appreciated Rao Inderjit for his clean and transparent image for the last five decades.“We will celebrate this year to identify those soldiers whose names were missed in history,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/not-retiring-from-active-politics-daughter-will-contest-polls-in-2024-rao-inderjit-101632423906195.html

East UP, he said, now holds one of the keys to success, as the “Modi government is banking on caste mobilisations to defeat this movement, which has become a national symbol of fight for people’s democratic and economic rights.”He said Punjab has led by challenging the restrictions on protest by moving together in large numbers to reach the outskirts of Delhi. “We broke Corona lockdowns, we braved water cannons and lathis and we overcame roadblocks and trenches. That unity, courage and determination have pushed the central government on the back foot,” he claimed. He said the central government is not accepting the farmers’ demands because it does not lead the interests of the Indian people, but of big corporate houses and foreign exploiters.Senior vice-president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), Rajesh Chauhan, criticised the central government for fooling farmers that they were now free to sell their crop anywhere, while actually it is closing down government mandis, government procurement centres and MSP. AIKMS general secretary Ashish Mital lambasted the government for using public funds to give relief to big corporate houses while it is increasing taxes on fuel and fertilisers and selling roads, natural gas resources, airways, ports, land, mines, rivers and forests to make up its losses.Others who addressed the gathering included Ram Kailash, Prayagraj AIKMS president, Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) leader Avinash Misra, All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU) leader Kamal Usri, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) leaders Bhupendra Pande and Gyan Singh Patel, BKU leaders Surendra Singh and Noorul Islam among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kisan-panchayat-in-up-s-ghoorpur-farmers-flay-centre-for-ignoring-demands-101632423850178.html

They said this year, over 43% of the total 13.64 lakh hectare paddy are under the Parmal varieties and 20% of it is early maturing.“Since the private traders are procuring early maturing Pusa 1509 for the past one month without any complaint about the moisture and this year, prices have also increased to around 50% than last year. But on the other hand, government is reluctant to start procurement before October 1 and the delay will cause huge losses to farmers,” said farm leader Ratan Mann.Aditya Dabas, deputy director of Haryana agriculture department, Karnal, said, “Rain at this stage is harmful for paddy as it may lead the attack of white-backed plant hopper insect in the standing crop. And this insect spreads in the entire field within a few days if its population was not controlled at the early stage.”Officials of agriculture department said rains have also flattened matured crops and this will not only cause loss of luster and yield, but will also increase the harvesting cost. They have advised farmers to make arrangements to pump out excess water from their fields to avoid losses.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has ordered a special girdawari to assess the damage caused to crops because of rain and waterlogging. “The Haryana government has given instructions to conduct special girdawari to assess damage to crop due to the ongoing rains so that compensation can be given to farmers,” tweeted the CM.Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal on Thursday said the exercise of girdawari will be completed at the earliest so that farmers get compensation in time.Dalal said Mukhyamantri Bagwani Bima Yojana, which the state cabinet approved on Wednesday, is the first scheme across country under which insurance cover will be provided for horticulture crops.According to the IMD reports, Haryana received 159.9mm rain from September 1 to 23 – 124% more than 71.4mm considered normal in the month.The state has received 20.5mm rain in the past 24 hours and light to heavy rain has also been forecast till September 27 in most parts of Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-harvesting-unseasonal-rains-worry-paddy-growers-101632423726215.html

The suspects also withdrew cash from the victims’ debit cards and then dumped the duo near Jewar toll plaza on Yamuna Expressway.Iqrar Ali, 40, the son, a resident of Madanpur Khadar in New Delhi, said that he and his father Sohrab Ali, 80, were waiting for a bus near Mahamaya Flyway on the morning of September 16. “A few buses stopped there but they were not going to Mainpuri, our destination. At 7.40am, a car stopped there in which four persons, including the driver, were sitting. They asked us where we wanted to go. They offered to drop us, saying they were going on the same route,” he said.Iqrar Ali said two suspects were on the front seat while two others were on the rear seat. “The suspects locked the doors and held us hostage. They hit us with an iron rod when we tried to resist. They also played loud music when we tried to raise an alarm,” Iqrar Ali said.The suspects snatched ₹1.20 lakh from the two. “They also snatched my debit card and asked for its password. They stopped the car near Pari Chowk and one of them visited a nearby ATM kiosk and withdrew ₹50,000 in two transactions and returned. They took away our money, mobile phone and debit card. Then they drove on the Yamuna Expressway and dumped us near Jewar toll plaza at 8.30am,” Iqrar Ali said.The two managed to board a bus to Agra and inform their relatives. Later, the same day Iqrar Ali returned to Noida and filed a complaint at Sector 39 police station.Rajeev Kumar, SHO, Sector 39 police station, said based on the complaint, the police registered a case against unknown suspects under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code on Wednesday. “The complainant was not able to narrate the incident properly on day one.

24-09-2021||Noida||UP makes it mandatory to obtain licence for home bar||The state excise department has announced new rules for obtaining a personal home bar licence. The rules came into effect from Thursday evening. According to the new rules, residents can keep a maximum of four bottles of liquor (750 ml) --two each of a foreign brand and of Indian origin-- at home without a licence. A licence is mandatory for those who wish to set up a bar at home. According to officials, the licence also caps the upper limit of liquor at 72 bottles (varying among the 15 categories of liquor) to be kept at home. Officials from the state excise department said the purpose of the rule is “not to harass anyone but provide a legal recognition to those who like to maintain a personal bar at home”.Officials also said that under the new rules, customers who are buying liquor in bulk from shops could also be asked to present a home bar licence to do so. “Licence for a home bar can be applied for at the district excise department’s office, which will be approved by the district magistrate. The annual licence fee is ₹12,000 while the security deposit is ₹51,000,” said R B Singh, district excise officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.On being asked if the rules will apply to ex-servicemen who get a quota of 10 bottles per month, Singh said, “Though there is not much clarity on the same, the rules do not apply to the ex-servicemen as they are already covered under the rules of the armed forces.”“The aim of this new policy is to provide legal recognition to those who like to maintain a bar at home. The rules are not for harassing any individual. So, if anyone is holding a party at home, there is scope for leniency,” Singh added.According to the new rules shared by the district administration, only those who have filed income tax returns for past five years, of which at least three years of ITR is under the 20% slab, may apply for a licence.Officials said that only those people, who have a permanent residence in the district, will be eligible to apply for a home bar. According to the rules, one person can obtain only one licence, with which (s)he can have a bar at her residence or farmhouse/guest house but not at both places. According to the rules, only liquor authorised to be sold in Uttar Pradesh, shall be allowed to be kept at a personalised home bar. The home licence holder may keep a maximum of six bottles of imported whiskey and four bottles of Indian whiskey (each 750 ml), two bottles of imported and one bottle of Indian manufactured rum, two bottles of imported and one bottle of Indian manufactured vodka, one bottle of each Indian and imported wine, 12 cans (500/650 ml) of imported and six cans of Indian-made beer, among others.The rules added the licence holder has to ensure that a minor or anyone below 21 years doesn’t have access to the bar. Family members, relatives and guests or friends can consume liquor at any personal home bar without “paying” the licence holder. “The licence holder has to ensure than any minor or anyone aged 21 years or younger doesn’t get access to the premises/bar area… Family members, friends, relatives and family guests can have alcohol without paying in cash or kind to the licensee,” said the rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-makes-it-mandatory-to-obtain-licence-for-home-bar-101632423659280.html

Of the total, 24 have been arrested while two minors have been detained, and a special investigation team (SIT) has been formed to probe the case, they added. In her complaint on Wednesday, Manpada police said, the survivor alleged that it all started in January when a man she was in a relationship with, threatened to leak their private videos and forced her to have physical relations with some of his friends and acquaintances. All the accused raped the girl, a resident of Dombivli (East), at various locations such as Dombivli, Murbad and Badlapur in Thane district and Rabale in Navi Mumbai on multiple occasions, officials familiar with the matter said. The case, however, came to light earlier this month when the survivor approached a relative over the prolonged sexual abuse. “The girl’s aunt approached a local social worker and decided to nab the accused. On Wednesday, six of the accused called the victim to a lodge in Murbad. She shared her live location and her aunt informed us,” an officer, who is part of the probe, said on condition of anonymity.A police team rushed to the lodge and managed to arrest two persons. Based on their and the girl’s statement, police gradually began apprehending the remaining accused from Wednesday night onwards, the official said. “A FIR was registered and the accused booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code as well as the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,” Sachin Gunjal, deputy commissioner, zone III, Thane police, said. Additional commissioner of police (East region) Datta Karale added that a SIT has been formed to investigate the matter. The girl, meanwhile, was sent to a government hospital in Kalwa for medical examination. In a statement, Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde said: “I have spoken to the Thane Police commissioner and issued instructions to arrest whoever is involved in the offence.” Bharatiya Janata Party leader Devendra Fadnavis said: “An atmosphere of fear is prevailing in the state. The increase in the number of such incidents is worrisome.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/32-booked-for-rape-of-15-year-old-girl-over-nine-months-in-dombivli-101632423539343.html

24-09-2021||Pune||Colleges, students want campuses reopened in Pune||PUNE: With the new academic year about to begin and admissions to various undergraduate and postgraduate courses already underway, the principals and administration of colleges has started demanding that college campuses be opened up. With Covid-19 cases in the state plummeting, there is demand for the blended learning or hybrid method.Dr Sachin Vernekar, dean faculty of management studies and director IMED Bharati Vidyapeeth Pune, said, “We Indians have always had a good immunity system. The vaccination drive at all levels and standard operating procedures (SOPs) followed by the majority with a positive response to all government measures has really helped us reduce the number of cases in the last few months. I don’t think there will be a third wave if we all continue following these measures during the upcoming festivals and elections too. As regards the reopening of schools and colleges, we should start reopening the same in stages. It has been proved that children get mild infections and recover fast. However, we should use the blended learning method which includes both online and offline to start the academic year.”“Students in the 18+ age group who have taken both the doses should be allowed to attend offline classes in two shifts with 40minute lectures. Schools too can be opened in stages with 50% students attending offline classes and the remaining 50% attending online classes (rotational basis). However, the SOPs must be strictly followed by all. At every class level, there must be a team to ensure compliances. It is time we take the right decision in the interest of the student community,” he said.Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal - Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce (Shivajinagar), said, “For the past one-and-a-half year, the entire system of learning from children to the postgraduate level and beyond, has moved online. I think it is overburdening students and their capacity as well as that of the faculty to sit in front of the screen is at its end. It is high time that offline lectures be started with all necessary precautions against Covid-19. There should be both offline and online classes, as we have done earlier when college campuses were opened in a phased manner.”Students, too, are willing to return to campuses. Pushkar Ganeshan, a science student, said, “I am tired of online lectures and there is no seriousness at all in that kind of teaching. We want to go back to college to study, meet our friends and enjoy the campus atmosphere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/colleges-students-want-campuses-reopened-in-pune-101632423419181.html

24-09-2021||Noida||Mihir Bhoj statue in UP’s Dadri college: Gurjars, Rajputs blame BJP for row||The dispute between the members of the Rajput and Gurjar communities over a statue of the ninth-century king, Samrat Mihir Bhoj, at a college in Greater Noida’s Dadri continued even after it was unveiled on Wednesday, officials said on Thursday.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath unveiled the statue at Mihir Bhoj degree college in Dadri -- an event organised by Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar.In Gautam Budh Nagar, both the communities are protesting the move by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), claiming that the party has presented the facts incorrectly.“The event was an insult to our community as the word ‘Gurjar’ was deliberately removed from the plaque of the King Mihir Bhoj statue, after being pressurised by the Uttar Pradesh government... We will decide the future course of action soon,” Navin Bhati, president of Akhil Bhartiya Gurjar Front, said on Thursday.Various organisations from the Gurjar community will also organise a mahapanchayat at PG College in Dadri on Sunday to “brainstorm over the insulting event”. We will intensify the agitation if the state government does not take appropriate action in the matter, they said, adding that Gurjars from other states are also likely to join the mahapanchayat.On Wednesday, after CM Adityanath unveiled the statue, people from the Gurjar community protested against the MLA Tejpal, and gheraoed his house in Dadri.“We will stop the agitation if the Uttar Pradesh government officially issues a notification and adds the word ‘Gurjar’ on the statue plaque. We will hold a series of protests if this is not done. There is no doubt that Samrat Mihir Bhoj was a Gurjar king...,” Bhati added.Members of the Rajput community also said that they want to “teach a lesson” to BJP leaders who ”did not take care of this matter responsibly”.“We have decided to protest against the BJP during the upcoming 2022 assembly polls because it was irresponsible of the party leaders to unveil the statue in Dadri. Besides, the BJP has also been encouraging such activities in other cities too, and it is an insult to the Rajput community. We will hold several protests if the word ‘Gurjar’ is not added on the statue,” said Prithivi Singh, national secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha.The BJP, meanwhile, said that the dispute is uncalled for, and that the people need to rise above caste, creed, language and regional issues, and stay united.Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson Chander Mohan said, “It is a local issue, and the president of Gautam Budh Nagar BJP, Vijay Bhati, will take care of this issue.”On this, Bhati said, “First, let me talk to the stakeholders, then we can talk on this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mihir-bhoj-statue-in-up-s-dadri-college-gurjars-rajputs-blame-bjp-for-row-101632423242135.html

Local members of the NCP are also unhappy with the state cabinet decision announced on Wednesday.The Congress and NCP prefer single -member wards, like Mumbai, or two-member wards. Elected Congress members in the PMC Arvind Shinde, Lata Rajguru, Ajit Darekar, Vaishali Marate and Rafiq Shaikh have written a letter to the state unit president Nana Patole asking that the Maha Vikas Agadhi (MVA) decision on three-member wards be revised.

It would not be helpful for either the Congress or the NCP.”Arvind Shinde said, “For local self-government, it is always useful to have single-member wards as it helps citizens to contact the concern elected member directly. Whenever there are single or two-member wards, the Congress always gets more seats.”NCP members, speaking off the record, said that three-member wards help the BJP. A senior NCP leader speaking anonymously said, “As my party welcomed the decision officially, I cannot oppose it openly, but we place our views before Ajit Pawar. The BJP is a master at campaigning.

Across Maharashtra, rainfall reported between June 1 and September 23 is 13 per cent in excess, which falls in the normal category. K S Hosalikar, deputy director general, IMD Mumbai said, “Usually all districts report good rainfall by the end of the monsoon season.

He added that due to the revival of various weather systems over Maharashtra, these few districts that were in the deficient category, have also reported above normal rainfall now. “This is the first time this rainy season all districts have reported normal or above normal rainfall. What is noteworthy is that drought-prone regions of the state have also reported above normal rainfall.

24-09-2021||Noida||Residents in UP village install CCTV cameras to keep a check on thefts||After a spate of thefts in Bhojpur village near Modinagar this year, especially of cattle, villagers decided to take matters in their own hands and installed 32 CCTV cameras, which has brought a major portion of the village under surveillance. Plans are now being formulated to put in place 32 more cameras to cover every street in the village. Spread across 2km, the village is located in the rural belt of Ghaziabad district and is about 32km from the district headquarters. The estimated population in the village is about 10,000-12,000. Shahid Chaudhary, the head of the village or gram pradhan, said instances of petty thefts, especially of cattle,had become a cause of concern for poor farmers. “As per our estimates, there have been about a dozen theft cases so far this year. A farmer generally incurs a loss of about ₹40,000-50,000 if he loses a cattle. Further, petty thefts of bicycle or some small household item were rampant.Sometimes, we reported the matter to police while other people let it go. We decided to keep an eye on such activities and installed about 32 CCTV cameras at major streets in our village,” said Chaudhary adding that the panchayat funds were used for the purpose. The CCTV cameras are monitored from a control centre that functions out of the panchayat office in the village. “We have installed a big screen which shows live feeds of all locations. I myself monitor the footage till afternoon. We have deployed another person who takes over later in the day. Reports of thefts have reduced ever since we installed the CCTV cameras about a month ago. In addition to the cameras, we have also installed loudspeakers, which help us convey messages to people like holding vaccination camps, ration distribution and any other public service messages,” added Chaudhary. Prabhat Kumar Dixit, station house officer (SHO) of Bhojpur police station, said police also asked villagers to take some initiative, following which they installed the CCTV cameras. “The installation of CCTV cameras has given us an edge as we can rely on its footage when there is a theft or any other criminal activity. There have been cattle thefts in Bhojpur but they have subsided now. One such CCTV camera is also installed near the police station, from where two roads go towards Hapur city and Pilkhuwa. The CCTV cameras have helped villagers but will be of great help to the police too,” said Dixit. Villagers said the CCTV cameras are also keeping the anti-social elements under check. “The cameras have been installed at all the major crossings of our village. We have a liquor shop nearby and girls pass by it while coming from their schools/colleges or market. The cameras are deterring anti-social elements from indulging in any inappropriate activity. Any incident in the village will be recorded in the CCTV cameras,” said Suraj Verma, a resident, who is pursuing post-graduation from Modinagar. Senior police officers praised the efforts of the villagers and said that their initiative should serve as a model for other gram panchayats. “We have heard of such initiatives in urban localities but are seldom taken up in villages. In Ghaziabad, we have about 150 gram panchayats and we urge each of them to take up such initiatives, which will also help police check crimes and other incidents,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of rural police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-in-up-village-install-cctv-cameras-to-keep-a-check-on-thefts-101632422999305.html

A budget of ₹2.5 crore has been set for the project.The work on the ground has started, and the authority will announce the move officially after it is approved in a board meeting scheduled on Friday (September 24), they added.“Air pollution is a big problem during the winters. If implementation of this tower is successful, the authority may also install anti-smog towers at other locations in the city,” said a Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.The tower will clean air with polluting particles around it and release the purified air. Equipped with intake and exhaust fans, the tower will initially run with the help of electricity. The authority, however, plans to run the tower with the help of solar energy later. “We will require ₹3 lakh per month to run this tower properly. As of now, we will use electricity to run it, and will install solar panels later,” said the official.The maintenance cost of the tower, excluding electricity charge, includes changing of filters which will clean pollutants in the air.“We will have to change the filters every 15 days,” the official added.Covering an area of 1,000 metres radius around it, the tower benefiting the residents in sectors 15, 15A, 16, 16A (Film City), 17 and 19 among other areas.

So, the plan was chalked out,” said VK Mittal, president of Karwa.The association filed several petitions with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in October 2015, September 2018, and March 2019, and finally moved Supreme Court in October 2020, and appealed against the polluted surroundings.The plan also stated that removal of encroachments and regulation of traffic will also be taken up by respective departments.“The plan has short-term and long-term measures and we have also discussed the plan with the petitioners. It was formulated after a joint inspection by officers of different departments from UP and Delhi. We have already started the work related to the creation of parking, vending zones, and the installation of height barriers,” said MS Tanwar, commissioner, Ghaziabad municipal corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/comprehensive-traffic-management-plan-readied-for-up-s-kaushambi-101632422519346.html
24-09-2021||Pune||Corporators demand 4th metro station on Swargate-Katraj route||PUNE: Maha-Metro said it will examine the possibility of a fourth metro station near Dhankawadi or Bharti Vidyapeeth along the proposed 5.4km underground metro corridor between Swargate and Katraj after elected members of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) unanimously put forth the demand for the same.The PMC gave its nod to the underground metro corridor between Swargate and Katraj, which is an extension of the route between Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Swargate. Maha Metro had proposed three metro stations, namely Market Yard (near City pride), Padmavati and Katraj along the underground metro corridor. However, elected members of the PMC have demanded that a fourth metro station be planned between Padmavati and Katraj either at Balajinagar, Dhankawadi or near Bharti Vidyapeeth.NCP leader Vishal Tambe said, “Balajinagar and Dhankawadi are densely populated. Even today, PMPML buses are getting maximum ridership from this area. Around 50,000 students visit the Bharti Vidyapeeth campus. If the metro station is planned in this area, it will help get maximum ridership for the metro.”“As per the existing formula, there is a metro station after every 1km but after Padmavati, the next station has been planned after 2km. Maha Metro can consider erecting a metro station at Dhankawadi or near Bharti Vidyapeeth,” Tambe said.Former mayor Dattatray Dhankawade also demanded that a fourth metro station be planned near Balajinagar or Dhankawadi considering the sheer number of people in these areas dependent on public transport. “Considering the commuter load, it is a must to have a metro station at Dhankawadi,” he said.Other elected members including Ashwini Kadam, Pravin Chorbole, Rajendra Shilimkar and Varsha Tapkir reiterated that the route between Katraj and Swargate has the highest commuter footfall for PMPML buses. There are also many private vehicles along the route. They said that there had been demand since a long time to have a metro along this stretch and that it was good that all parties had approved the underground metro corridor. They too suggested having a metro station at Dhankawadi.Atul Gadgil, director works, Maha Metro, said, “Elected members of the PMC have requested that we plan one more station. We will definitely examine it and if it is technically feasible and there is no issue with land, we can plan it while starting work on it. The cost of one more station can be adjusted within the project cost.”“The existing metro line runs alongside the Shankar Maharaj flyover. Though it is underground, it does not disturb the foundation of this flyover,” Gadgil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/corporators-demand-4th-metro-station-on-swargate-katraj-route-101632422279525.html
24-09-2021||Other||Yogi exhorts religious bodies to protect cows, promote Sanskrit||Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday called upon religious organisations, including maths (monasteries), temples and ashrams, to come forward for cow protection and the promotion of culture and the Sanskrit language. Such an academic venture to promote Sanskrit will get the government’s full support as the Vedic language is the basis of Hindu culture, he said. He was addressing people on the concluding day of a weeklong programme organised at the Gorakhnath temple here to mark the 52nd death anniversary of Mahant Digvijay Nath and the seventh death anniversary of Mahant Avaidyanath, the former head priests of the temple. He said eligible and competent teachers should be selected to run such Sanskrit colleges, and saints and ashrams of the Santan Hindu Dharma should ensure that no ineligible candidate came. He also said, “Cow protection will not be ensured just by giving speeches but by faith, putting in efforts and becoming part of the system. The government is doing its own work (to protect cows) but people will have to come forward as cows can’t be protected with the attitude of taking milk and leaving cows on the roads.” He expressed displeasure while disclosing that not even a single math, temple or religious organisation had come forward to take the benefits of government schemes aimed at protecting and conserving cows even after wide publicity and an appeal by the government. Enlisting the steps taken by the government for cow protection , Yogi said the UP government was currently ensuring the same in three ways. First, over six lakh stray cows were given shelter and being taken care of in government-run shelter since his government came to power in 2017. Second, the government was already offering an honorarium of ₹900 per month to those who took home abandoned cows and looked after them, he said. The milk and other dairy products will be of the man who looks after such cows. The third way is to provide a cow to families with malnourished women and children with a monthly stipend of ₹900, he added. Praising Gorakshpeeth (Gorakhnath temple) for being involved in cow protection since long, Yogi Adityanath spoke about how bio gas was being used to cook prasad at the temple (and give free meals to the poor twice a day). He appealed to others to replicate this model for cow protection and energy conservation. Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “visionary leadership”, the chief minister said that every individual needed to introspect to find out what he could contribute towards the nation’s development. He said the Hindu religion can only be protected when the nation becomes strong and united. “Anti-Indian elements will become strong if voices are divided. Mahant Digvijay Nath knew this and that’s why he came forward to keep Hindus united by focusing on samajik samrasta (social harmony) and abolishing the practice of untouchability,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yogi-exhorts-religious-bodies-to-protect-cows-promote-sanskrit-101632422159529.html
24-09-2021||Pune||10 million Covid-19 vaccines administered in Pune district||PUNE Pune district, on Thursday, crossed an important milestone, administering 10 million (one crore) Covid-19 vaccines since the vaccination drive began from January 16. State health officials confirmed that Pune is the second district after Mumbai to have crossed this milestone. As per the CoWin dashboard, a total of 1,00,14,854 vaccine doses have been administered in Pune district as of Thursday evening. Of these, 69,34,547 are first doses and 30,80,307 are second doses. According to health officials, Pune district is on its way to achieving its target for the Covid vaccination drive - a first dose for the entire eligible population in the district by the end of October. While Pune district crossed the five-million jab milestone on July 8, the following five million were vaccinated within 76 days. Health officials attributed this to the availability of vaccine doses as producers like the Pune- based Serum Institute of India (SII) delivered more vaccine doses. “Now we have administered more than one crore doses, including first and second ones. The numbers indicate that there are still approximately 10.8 million people in the district who haven’t received the first dose yet. Five million people still need a second dose. Our target is all of the eligible population should at least get the first dose by October end, so every eligible citizen would be partially, or fully vaccinated by then,” said Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director (health), Pune region. According to the officials there are approximately 8.7 million people in Pune district who are eligible for Covid vaccine. “Considering the total population, Pune would require around 17.4 million vaccine doses of which 10 million have been administered. We are halfway to complete vaccination of the eligible population,” Dr Deshmukh added. The highest vaccination count is in the age group of 18-45 years, where 56, 87,698 vaccines were administered; 25,49,708 vaccines have been administered in the age group of 45-60 years, and in the above-60-year age group, 17,77,448 beneficiaries have got the shot. Since the Covid vaccination drive began in January, there have been ups and downs with daily inoculation drives. Vaccine shortages impacted the speed of the drive. In Pune district, a total of 460,000 doses have been administered to frontline workers and 290,000 doses have been administered to the health workers. The district administration had also run a special inoculation drive for teaching and non- teaching staff in the private and government schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/10-million-covid-19-vaccines-administered-in-pune-district-101632421860920.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||Liquor crisis brewing in the city, likely to intensify from with festive season||A liquor shortage is brewing in the city in the midst of a transition in the city’s excise rules as empty shelves at most shops and vends are forcing customers to visit multiple stores or neighbouring cities such as Gurugram and Noida. Retailers say the crisis, though temporary, will only worsen in the coming weeks as demand usually shoots up in October and November, ahead of the festive season, and peaks around Diwali.The shortage is because all private retail vends have stopped restocking supplies since they have to shut shop from October 1 to ensure a smooth transition to the new excise regime, which kicks in from November 17. Diwali falls on November 4 this year.While government vends in Delhi will remain open between October 1 and November 16, a spot-check by HT found that they are ill-equipped to cover even the usual demand and mostly have cheaper brands on offer. This is because even the government stores are not restocking at their usual pace as they will permanently shut from November 17.HT on Thursday visited at least a dozen liquor stores in east, central and south Delhi, and found that customers either had to compromise on their choice of alcohol or return empty handed due to the unavailability of mid-range and premium brands.“I have been to at least three shops and none of them had Glenfiddich. I asked for Black Label or Chivas Regal, but they did not have that either. They only had some imported wines,” said Rakesh Sinha, a buyer who visited three shops in Star City Mall in Mayur Vihar Phase 1.By appointing new retail licensees, the Delhi government is trying to pave the way for a range of sweeping reforms to boost the city’s revenue, crack down on the liquor mafia and improve user experience under the new state excise policy. The city has been divided into 32 zones and allotment of licenses is now being done on a zonal basis through which the government has already earned ₹8,917.59 crore. From November 17, liquor shops in the Capital, in a first, will also be able to offer discounts. Stores will get rid of the iron grilles at the front of most liquor vends in the Capital, and allow buyers to browse and purchase the brands of their choice. For this, the shops will be spacious, well lit and air-conditioned to allow customers a walk-in experience under camera surveillance.Under the new policy, business hours have been fixed from 10am to 10pm, while those at the airport may open round-the-clock.Some consumers suggested that, in the interim, the Delhi government should geotag its stores on their website or an app so people can locate them.“Liquor vends near my home are all private ones. Where do we go hunting for government shops now? Most of these shops are in obscure locations. They are also much smaller and have a jail-like grilles, which makes for a very unpleasant shopping experience. I tried looking for the nearest state-run shops, but the excise department’s website had nothing. They should have prepared better,” said Akash Tyagi, a resident of Ashok Vihar in north Delhi.A senior excise official said the department held a meeting with wholesalers this week and issued specific directions asking them to ensure adequate supply of most liquor brands.“This is a transition phase, so some issues are bound to occur. But the excise department is trying everything possible to make it a smooth shift. We know the closure of private vends falls during the festive season, particularly on Diwali which is on November 4. From activating our enforcement teams to having meetings with retailers, government agencies and wholesalers, we are taking all possible measures and are closely monitoring the situation,” said the official who asked not to be named.Delhi has 849 liquor stores, of which 276 are privately run. The rest are run by the Delhi government.Aseem Diwan, in-charge of Big Way Exports Private Limited, a liquor store inside Star City Mall, said the excise department informed all retailers well in advance about the need to clear stocks by September.“So, we stopped placing fresh orders a month back. Whatever you see on our shelves is all we are left with. In beer, we only have Kingfisher, and in whiskey we have McDowell’s, Antiquity and Black Dog. We ran this shop for over a decade and now our business is down by over 50%. We used this space on rent, and will vacate it next month,” he said.Another liquor shop in the mall that was open for more than six years has already been shut. The third shop also had lower-end brands, which ranged between ₹150 to ₹1,000. The situation was similar at a government store at Malviya Nagar.“Not just retailers, even alcohol brands have put distribution on hold partially, because they are signing fresh agreements with the new retailers who have won the bids for the 32 zones in Delhi. Also, no retailer is placing fresh orders, at least not for premium or mid-range brands,” said the manager of the shop, who is an employee of the government’s Delhi tourism department and did not wish to be named.Rajeev Malhotra, manager of a liquor store in Savitri Cinema complex in Greater Kailash 2, said they were awarded a zone during the bidding process, and the new store will come in the same location.“Work will begin next week. The whole shop will be redone. The entrance will have sensor-based sliding doors and the first section will be earmarked just for beer. We have tied up with leading alcohol brands and interior designers to help us out,” he said.“It will be much better,” he added.But the transition phase is likely to be rough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/liquor-crisis-brewing-in-the-city-likely-to-intensify-from-next-month-with-festive-season-coming-101632421139047.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||Ensure children who lost a parent to Covid continu in same school: Delhi govt||The Directorate of Education’s private school branch on Thursday asked all its district officials to ensure that children who lost either one or both parents to Covid-19 continue their elementary education in an uninterrupted manner and preferably in the same school. “Children who have become orphans or lost a parent after March 2020 either due to Covid-19 or otherwise, need due attention to enable them to continue their education in private unaided/aided recognised school,” said Yogesh Pal Singh, deputy director of education, private school branch. The education department directed that such students may be adjusted in the same school that they are studying in, if the school is running on DDA or government allotted land under the freeship scheme. According to the scheme, private schools, allotted plots at concessional rates, are required to set aside 20% seats for children from the underprivileged sections.“Or, such students may be treated as a student studying under economically weaker section/ disadvantaged group category and reimbursement may be claimed from the Directorate of Education, up to elementary level and after class 8, such students may be guided/facilitated for admission in any government school for uninterrupted further education,” Singh said in the circular. According to the Right to Education Act, 25% of seats in entry-level classes — nursery, kindergarten and Class 1 — in all private schools are to be reserved for the EWS/DG category which includes 3% reservation for children with special needs. These students are entitled to free textbooks, writing material, and uniforms till class 8, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount to schools. The department had issued a similar in August this year. A senior DOE official said on condition of anonymity, “The circular issued in August was for awareness whereas this one directs schools on how to ensure uninterrupted education of children who have lost parents to Covid. It also clarifies that schools can shift students to EWS/freeship category and then submit a proposal to the directorate instead of doing it in the reverse, which may cause delays and affect the child’s education.” Till June, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) had identified at least 2,029 children who lost either one or both parents to Covid-19. Their names have been shared with the women and child development department to ensure that eligible beneficiaries are able to avail of government schemes and aid. Between March and May, Delhi saw over 13,000 Covid-19 deaths and 786,000 infections during the second wave of the pandemic. On May 18, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a one-time relief of ₹50,000 to families that lost the breadwinner to Covid. He also announced free education and monthly aid of ₹2,500 to those orphaned by Covid, till they attain the age of 25 years. Malini Narayanan, principal of Army Public School in Shankar Vihar and chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference, an umbrella body of schools, said private schools have provided relief and made arrangements for supporting such children of their own accord. She said the inclusion of orphaned children in the EWS category would create confusion and put an additional burden on schools. “Inclusion of orphaned children in the EWS category would create confusion and add to the financial burden on schools. Even if the government pays for them, it would still be a huge dent on the school’s finances as it will only get a paltry sum ( from the government). There are still bills pending that have not been cleared by the government,” said Narayanan. She further said private schools have stretched themselves to help orphaned children and their families. “We have done our bit. We don’t want this as a continuum and addition to the EWS category. If such children will be counted in the EWS category, the number of new children we count in EWS will reduce,” said Narayanan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ensure-children-who-lost-a-parent-to-covid-continue-their-studies-in-same-school-delhi-education-dept-tells-officials-101632420958956.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||Transport dept told to ensure buses stick to fixed lanes, bays||Ahead of launching an enforcement drive to ensure lane discipline among motorists, the Delhi traffic police has written to the transport department asking it to sensitise drivers of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses about plying buses in the designated lanes and stopping only at designated points, bus bays and bus boxes.In the letter to the principal secretary and commissioner of the transport department, joint commissioner of police (traffic) Meenu Choudhary said the decision to launch the enforcement drive was taken keeping in mind the rising number of road accidents, including fatal ones, this year, and also the complaints regarding lane violations by DTC and cluster bus drivers.  “It has been observed that the drivers of DTC/cluster buses do not ply their vehicles in the bus lanes and do not stop the buses at bus bays/box to pick and drop passengers. The level of the bus queue shelters/bus stands is same as the floor of low-floor buses so that passengers are able to board/de-board the buses safely, particularly senior citizens, physically challenged, children, etc.,” Choudhary said in the letter dated September 22.“Therefore, it is very essential that drivers of DTC/cluster buses stop their buses along the kerb at the designated points to facilitate easy boarding/de-boarding of passengers,” she further wrote, a copy which has been marked to DTC managing director as well.Many have taken to social media to post comments, videos and photographs to raise lane discipline concerns, prompting the traffic police to take action, said special commissioner of police (traffic) Muktesh Chander.Police statistics show that on average, three accidents causing deaths were reported every day in Delhi this year between January 1 and September 15. The total number of fatal accidents on Delhi roads during the period stood at 801, which is 21 more than the corresponding period figure of 780 last year. While 799 people lost lives in the 780 accidents last year, the fatalities for the same period this year stood at 830.The police data shows that till September 15, 33 fatal accidents were caused by cluster and DTC buses and 37 people were killed in those accidents. While cluster buses killed 25 people in 22 accidents, DTC buses claimed 12 lives in 11 accidents till September 15, the data shows.Mentioning that the traffic police will soon be launching an enforcement drives to ensure lane discipline, the joint CP concluded the letter, “…it’s therefore, requested that the drivers of DTC/cluster buses may be suitably briefed and sensitised to ply their buses in the designated lanes and stop only at the designated stops/bus bays/boxes.”When contacted, the transport department nor the DTC offered comment on the issue or letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/traffic-police-to-launch-drive-to-enforce-lane-discipline-wants-bus-drivers-sensitised-101632420845335.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: After repeated court raps, Police forms committee to monitor probe||The Delhi Police has formed a committee of four senior officers to monitor the investigation in the Delhi riots cases, and ensure that investigating officers are well prepared with the cases during the ongoing trials in city courts. The order comes in the backdrop of lower courts and the Delhi high court pointing out loopholes in the investigation, and questioning the handling of many cases related to the February 2020 communal riots in northeast Delhi. Named the special investigation cell(SIC), Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana signed the order on September 19 appointing four officers -- special commissioner of the central zone, joint commissioner(eastern range), deputy commissioner of police(east), and additional deputy commissioner of police(northeast) -- as part of the SIC to oversee investigation and progress in each case filed by the northeast district police. The riots cases are being probed by the special cell, crime branch and the local police stations in northeast Delhi. The northeast district is probing 695 cases; the crime branch filed 60 cases, and the special cell is probing one case. In the latest case, on Wednesday, a Delhi court dropped charges of arson against 10 people accused of looting shops during the violence. The court noted that police were “trying to cover up by clubbing different incidents that occurred on different dates.” The court noted that two separate incidents of February 24 and 25 were clubbed together and that the allegations of arson were not mentioned when the complaint was filed at the time of the incident. According to Asthana’s September 19 order, the four-member committee must take stock of all cases pending investigation by the northeast district and expedite the probe. “The officers shall personally liaise with the special public prosecutor to ensure their presence in court in all matters to represent the case of the prosecution on each date effectively....the team shall ensure that all witnesses and investigating officers are appearing in court on time, properly briefed and well prepared. In case the IO (investigating officer) is unable to attend court due to unavoidable circumstances, the SIC shall direct the Station House Officer(SHO) to either attend the matter himself or depute a responsible person...In all cases, where FSL results are pending, personal follow up will be made with Director FSL with a request to expedite the FSL results,” reads some important pointers for the committee.In the order, Asthana also mentioned that 14 police officers, who were posted in the northeast district during the riots, and were transferred in the meanwhile, have been sent back to assist the investigation. A former Delhi police officer, KG Tyagi, who has served in the northeast district has been appointed as a consultant to monitor the riots cases and advise the officers. Overall, Delhi police have registered 755 FIRs in connection with the February 2020 riots that broke out in parts of northeast Delhi, leading to 53 dead and 581 injured. A total of 1,818 persons were arrested and charge sheets have been filed in at least 400 cases. In the last few weeks, the courts have pulled up the Delhi Police for their investigation in some cases. For instance on September 17, chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg called out the city police and the prosecution for their “lackadaisical” approach in handling the Delhi riots cases and said no action has been taken by the commissioner and top officials despite repeated orders. The magistrate noted that the record showed that the special public prosecutor did not appear in the case on several occasions and this had been brought to the notice of all senior police officers. The court’s remarks came as the prosecutor failed to appear before the court despite repeated calls, while the investigating officer (IO) appeared before the court late without preparing and failed to answer the court’s queries.On September 2, another court discharged three people in a vandalism case related to the riots, and noted that it seems the police made no real effort to trace eyewitnesses or the real accused persons and solved it “merely by filing the charge sheet.” Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, while dropping the charges against three men in an alleged case of loot and vandalism at a shop in Chand Bagh on February 25, said the “lack of supervision by the superior officers clearly depicts that the investigating agency has merely tried to pull the wool over the court’s eyes and nothing else”.On August 23, a city court termed the police investigation as “highly callous”, “inefficient” and “unproductive” in another riots-related case reported from Ganga Vihar area. To be sure, the court. however framed charges against the arrested persons as it noted that it could not ignore the statements of witness while framing charges in the case. Delhi police spokesperson, Chinmoy Biswal, said, “In the interest of justice for the victims, the cases are being monitored by senior officers. This is a good initiative. Delhi Police will ensure that the cases are brought to its logical conclusion and the victims get justice.”A mid-level officer, who asked not to be named, said, “Some observations in a few cases are making the headlines. The fact is that the court has framed charges in 45 cases so far. It dropped the charges only in one case. Charges are only framed when court finds prima facie evidence. The process of framing charges in other cases is underway.” A clash between supporters and opponents of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, below the Jafrabad Metro station triggered one of the worst bouts of rioting in Delhi in recent years.The clash snowballed into full-fledged Hindu-Muslim rioting between February 23 and 27. Fifty-three people were killed , 581 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-repeated-court-raps-delhi-police-forms-committee-to-monitor-probe-in-delhi-riots-cases-101632420119370.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||Liquor smugglers attack four forest officers in Asola Bhatti||Four forest officials, who were patrolling the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary in south Delhi, were grievously injured on Thursday after over two dozen suspected alcohol smugglers attacked them, senior forest department officials said. Deputy conservator forests (south division) Amit Anand said four officials from his team were on night patrolling when men, suspected to be alcohol smugglers who use the sanctuary route to illegally transport large quantities of alcohol from Haryana into Delhi, attacked them. “The injured officials are currently admitted at the Batra Hospital. Over the last one year, we have been taking strict action against alcohol smugglers who use the forest route to transport liquor crates from Haryana into Sangam Vihar and neighbouring areas. And this action was intensified in the last two months. So effectively, we had almost finished their illegal business and we suspect the attack was in retaliation to that,” said Anand. Forest officials said that around 7.30pm, four officials, who were patrolling the area on two separate vehicles, were attacked by around 20-25 men with sticks, iron rods and knives. The officials were surrounded, their vehicles were damaged and they were beaten up, the officials said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said information was received from Batra Hospital that four forest guards were admitted into the hospital after they were allegedly beaten by some unknown persons during patrolling. “The injured have been examined, and the place of incident is being verified. Further action will be taken as per their statement and medical reports,” said Thakur.HT reported in July how smugglers from unauthorised neighbourhoods near the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary were using the forest routes to bring in large quantities of liquor from Haryana to Delhi. These smugglers had carved out dirt paths through the thick forest to connect illegal liquor vends in Haryana to Sangam Vihar, from where it is believed to be further distributed to other localities. Since the rate of liquor in Haryana is lower as compared to Delhi, this is a viable business for many bootleggers in Sangam Vihar area, forest officials said. Over the last one year, the south division of Delhi’s forest division was cracking down on this illegal operation. Their usual paths were dug up and patrolling was increased. Since August, several vehicles with alcohol were also seized and cases were registered against offenders under the Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972). Anand said that till 9.30pm on Thursday, the medico-legal case (MLC) was completed and the police was in the process of registering an FIR against the culprits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/liquor-smugglers-attack-grievously-injure-4-forest-officials-patrolling-asola-bhatti-sanctuary-in-delhi-101632419879025.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||Streetlights on the blink in south Delhi, survey identifies 2,557 dark spots||A 25-day long joint survey by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), the power department, residents welfare associations and municipal councillors has identified 2,557 dark spots in south Delhi, arising out of non-operational streetlights. Several municipal councillors have also raised the issue of dark spots arising from non-functional streetlights in house meetings and have highlighted the higher dysfunctional rate of LED lamps during the monsoon season. The survey found the maximum number of such spots in the south and Najafgarh zones while the situation was relatively better in the west zone. The report said 786 streetlights were found non-functional in the south zone, 734 in Najafgarh zone, 670 in central zone and 367 in the west zone.Ved Pal, municipal councillor from Aya Nagar ward, who raised the issue in the councillors’ meeting, said the rate of malfunctioning streetlights has increased threefold during the monsoon season. “Around 190-200 streetlights are still currently dysfunctional, which adversely impact public safety in these areas. There are issues related to accumulation of carbon on the filament and chips of the lamp unit,” he said.The issue of dark spots arising from malfunctioning streetlights was raised by the leader of the house Inderjeet Sehrawat in the last standing committee meeting. He said maintenance is very poor and each ward has over 50 dark spots due to non-operational streetlights. Sehrawat said the electronic chips of streetlights were faulty and replacements were not available. “The situation is now gradually improving,” he added. A senior south corporation official, however, insisted that only a very small percentage of streetlights was faulty and regular night patrolling is being carried out to identify such dark spots.Dr Kalpana Vishwanath, founder of Safetipin,an organisation working on issues related to dark spots and women safety, said Delhi has made significant strides in developing infrastructure for ensuring women safety and reduction of dark spots but this needs to be turned into an institutional process. “It cannot be a one-time thing. We should carry out regular audits and develop a system to incorporate regular checks. Besides the reduction of dark spots, we should also focus on improving last mile connectivity and infrastructure. Safety audits should be an ongoing process and community feedback must be taken,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/streetlights-on-the-blink-in-south-delhi-survey-identifies-2-557-dark-spots-101632419638927.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s 7th sero survey to begin Friday, check infection and vaccination status||After a nearly two-month delay, the state government will on Friday begin the seventh serological survey to estimate the population-level prevalence of antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) in the Capital, said officials familiar with the matter.The sample collectors will also record Covid-19 infection and vaccination history. Those not vaccinated will be asked why they have not got the shot yet, as part of the survey.“We need to understand how many people have been exposed to the virus, how many have received one dose, how many have received both the doses, and the antibody levels in them. We also need to understand why some have not received the shot. A detailed questionnaire on the history will be filled up while samples are collected. We urge those who are randomly selected for the survey to agree to share their blood samples,” the Delhi health department official said, asking not to be named. Sero surveys are blood tests that check for antibodies to the virus. They are a good measure of the exposure of a population to the virus. They are also a proxy for the level of broad immunity that exists in the population, although the best immunity is that achieved through vaccination.The survey, which was initially to take place over the first two weeks of August, was delayed. It was then scheduled for the last week of August, was pushed back yet again. It was not immediately clear why the survey was postponed twice, and state health officials declined to comment on the matter.All data will be captured digitally during the survey, making compilation and data analysis easier, said officials. “Our team of phlebotomists will collect the samples, and an external team accompanying them will collect the digital data,” said a senior district-level official. HT previously reported that the Delhi government had a proposal in the pipeline to hire an agency to conduct the survey. The samples will be processed at laboratories in Delhi government hospitals. HT on Wednesday reported that a proportion of the blood samples will also be analysed for the levels of neutralising antibodies that specifically target the Sars-CoV-2 virus. “This will also help us in co-relating the level of antibodies with the IgG levels found in the semi-quantitative test, thereby giving us an understanding of how much of the population is actually protected,” one of the researchers said previously. The team is expecting that with the severe surge in infections in April-May and the increased pace of vaccination, 80 to 90% of Delhi residents are likely to have antibodies against the virus. The last round of the survey conducted in Delhi in April, the sixth such, had to be stopped midway due to rising cases but 13,000 of the planned 28,000 samples that had already been collected returned a reading of nearly 56%, which means 56 out of every 100 residents of the Union territory were exposed to the virus. The previous five surveys returned readings of 56.13%, 25.5%, 25.1%, 29.1%, and 22.6% respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-seventh-sero-survey-to-begin-friday-check-infection-and-covid-vaccination-status-101632418319121.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt urges neighbours to switch to CNG for public vehicles, ban crackers||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday suggested that the neighbouring states should consider implementing a complete ban on firecrackers, and shift all public vehicles to CNG for a robust anti-pollution plan for the national capital region. Rai also stressed on the need to promote the use of bio-decomposers by farmers to tackle crop stubble, and prevent them from burning it. After participating in a meeting convened by the Union environment ministry on Thursday, Rai told reporters that Delhi’s air pollution crisis cannot be resolved in isolation, and it will need cooperation from all neighbouring states.Environment ministers of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan and chief secretary of Punjab attended the meeting, which, the union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said focussed on the ways to prevent farm fires.Delhi has been at the centre of India’s air pollution crisis for years now, which particularly worsens every winter season. The landlocked demography of the national capital also puts it at a disadvantage, as winds carrying pollutants from neighbouring states also impacts its air. Experts have time and again pointed out that sharing a common air shed with the Indo-Gangetic Plains, the issue of Delhi’s pollution cannot be tackled in isolation, and the governments will have to come up with a holistic plan to bring down emissions in the entire region.The stubble fires in the neighbouring agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana are a case in point. Every year, when farmers burn stubble after harvest, the smoke carries dangerous particles measuring less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) to Delhi. Last year, according to Safar -- an agency under the Union ministry of earth sciences, the contribution of farm fires to concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) in Delhi’s air reached up to 40% in November. Every winter, Delhi’s air quality nosedives with pollution levels reaching emergency levels on several days. The deterioration starts around mid-October with the fumes of stubble burning in the fields of Haryana and Punjab and gets worse with cracker bursting during Diwali and Delhi’s own local pollution sources. The unfavourable weather conditions including a change in wind direction and slow wind speed also add to the Capital’s problem. Rai on Thursday said that Delhi’s pollution can be attributed more to external factors than its own sources. He said that on September 18, the reading of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) pollutants was 67ug/m3 and that of PM2.5 was 27ug/m3. On September 19, it was 85ug/m3 and 35ug/m3 respectively, on September 20, it was 78ug/m3 and 31ug/m3 respectively, on September 21, it was 81ug/m3 and 31ug/m3 respectively and on September 22, it was 64ug/m3 and 27ug/m3 respectively. “Last year, I saw from the war room that the PM10 and PM2.5 graph was increasing. We specially monitored how Punjab and Haryana were contributing to the pollution of Delhi through stubble burning. As the quantum of stubble burning increased in these states, the air quality worsened in Delhi. In today’s meeting, we appealed to the central government and the government of the neighbouring states to eradicate the stubble burning practices as soon as possible,” Rai said. He added that no extension should be given to thermal power plants in NCR that are operating without emission control devices.“These plants are to be retrofitted with new technology to control emissions but they operate without it after paying a penalty. The gases they emit are the most harmful,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-urges-neighbours-to-switch-to-cng-for-public-vehicles-ban-crackers-101632418019016.html

Ranked number one in the junior category in India, 20-year-old Zeena trained hard at the Indian shooting camp conducted at Karni Singh Shooting Ranges in New Delhi under coach Suma Sharoor. Around 370 shooters from 32 nations are participating in this championship.Hailing from Rohru in Himachal Pradesh, Zeena was 14 when she decided to pursue air rifle shooting. She first impressed when she clinched a gold in the Khelo India Youth Games in 2018 in the 10m air rifle event. Thereafter, she bagged a gold at the Junior World Cup in Sydney, Australia, in the same event. She stunned some of the top shooters from the country and snatched gold in the 10m air rifle event with an impressive score of 251.3.Aiming to do well at Lima, Peru, Zeena is pumped up and raring for a podium-finish. “I have trained well in the national camp and now want to do well in Lima, Peru. As China is not sending their shooters for the championship, Indian shooters will face good competition from USA and European shooters,” said Zeena, who is also eyeing a spot in the Indian senior shooting team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shooting-junior-world-championship-dav-student-part-of-indian-team-at-peru-event-101632417899016.html
24-09-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay tops QS Graduate Employability Rankings in India, rank improved||The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay is the best institution in India for career-focused students, according to 2022 QS Graduate Employability Rankings released on Thursday. The institute moved up to the 101-110 group, from 111-120 group in 2020.“India’s national employability leader — those implementing the nation’s strongest employability processes and achieving the strongest employability outcomes — IIT Bombay,” said QS Quacquarelli Symonds, global higher education analysts, in a statement.According to more than 50,000 employers surveyed by QS, IIT-Bombay produces India’s highest calibre of graduates. It achieves the nation’s leading score for QS’s Employer Reputation indicator (73.9/100, 70th globally).IIT-Bombay is followed by its sister campus in Delhi, which has jumped from the 151-160 band in 2020 to the 131-140 group in 2022. IIT-Madras, too, has risen from the 171-180 band to the 151-160 category. These are the three Indian universities that ranked among the global top 200, with all three having improved their position over the last year. These are also the top three universities in India according to the World University Rankings released by QS in June this year.The QS Graduate Employability Rankings offer a granular comparative examination of the work universities are doing to cultivate propitious pathways into high-quality employment, said QS. Universities are rated on partnerships with employers (including internships), the number of sectoral leaders among their alumni, the frequency with which employers are present on campus, and a location-adjusted graduate employment rate.Meanwhile, the University of Mumbai (MU) maintained its rank in the 250-300 band. University of Delhi and University of Calcutta fell further down in their rankings.Three Indian universities achieved top-100 scores for QS’s Alumni Outcomes metric, which measures the number of highly successful business leaders, philanthropists, creatives, high-wealth individuals, and entrepreneurs produced by each university. University of Delhi ranked 21st globally and first in India for this metric with a score of 96/100.“IIT-Delhi is happy to jump by 20 places in the QS Graduate Employability rankings. We have been consistently improving our rankings in both domestic and international rankings in the past few years. We have taken various measures in the past few years and they are beginning to show their impact,” said V Ramgopal Rao, director, IIT-Delhi.However, Indian universities underperformed in QS’s Partnerships with Employers indicator, which captures the number of research engagements and work-placement partnerships formalised by each institution. Only one Indian university – IIT-Bombay – achieved a top-200 score for this metric.Subhasis Chaudhuri, director of IIT-Bombay, said, “Training at IIT-Bombay emphasises as learning outcomes on developing skills for analytical problem solving, capability to address unseen problems and an appreciation for the constraints that beset a specific problem. These are the terms of endearment for any technology-oriented company. Hence I am not at all surprised at this ranking. As a matter of fact, I expect the rank to be within top-50 if it is truly measured.”IIT-Madras achieved India’s highest location-adjusted Graduate Employment Rate score (100/100, fourth globally). It is the only Indian institution to achieve a top-50 score for this metric.Ben Sowter, Director of Research at QS, said, “With students becoming increasingly conscious of the competitiveness of the global graduate jobs market and of the ever-increasing financial costs of their educational investment, it has become correspondingly crucial that independent data of this sort is available to them, so as to inform evidence-based decisions about their educational futures.”“The data that contributes to this ranking shows that Indian universities are consistently producing high numbers of entrepreneurs, business leaders, and other highly successful individuals. However, with consistently low scores in our Partnerships with Employers indicator, it is also clear that India’s higher education leadership must strive to create stronger links with industry, facilitating more employer-student connection opportunities on campus,” Sowter added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-tops-qs-graduate-employability-rankings-in-india-rank-improved-101632417358678.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||DDA seeks ISRO help to track its vacant land parcels||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has revived work on GIS mapping all its vacant land parcels in a bid to protect the land from encroachment. The survey will be completed by next year, said a DDA official in the know of the matter.The survey is part of the DDA’s project to have an online record of its lands and keep a check on encroachments. For this, the land-owning agency enlisted the help of the Regional Remote Sensing Centre (RRSC), a part of the National Remote Sensing Centre (an arm of Indian Space Research Organisation) in 2018. A senior DDA official said on condition of anonymity, “We are currently mapping the vacant land. Our teams are doing ground surveys to mark latitude and longitude of each land parcel. With the help from ISRO’s RRSC, we will be developing a mobile application through which we can check on any unauthorised construction on our land.” A second DDA official said the ISRO has provided satellite images from 2006-2018. “The images will be useful not only in checking encroachments but also in planning future developments in the city, especially the implementation of schemes such as land pooling and PM-UDAY ( a scheme to confer ownership rights to residents of unauthorised colonies),” said the official, asking not to be named. The official further said, “DDA officials said an agency has been enlisted to carry out the GIS survey. There are over 3,500 vacant land parcels with the DDA. During the survey, we will also get to know about the extent of encroachments on our land.” While work on the project started in 2018, DDA officials said the pace of work was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The land-owning agency is putting in place a computerised system to detect encroachments using the satellite images provided by ISRO.“It is a big project as we plan to take all land data online. Not much work could be done due to the pandemic. We have been able to do GIS mapping of just a few areas so far, but we plan to expedite the process,” said the official.Encroachment on its land has been a major problem for the DDA. A few years ago, the agency started a system to upload pictures of vacant land on a monthly basis to check on encroachments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-seeks-isro-help-to-track-its-vacant-land-parcels-101632417118646.html

The accused allegedly used the woman’s email ID to take revenge on her.According to the police, the accused, Premji Parmare, married one Anuradha two years ago, but as he was unemployed, she left him and went to stay with her mother Lakshmi at Amboli. When Parmare tried to take Anuradha back with him, Lakshmi would allegedly intervene and stop him.To take revenge for this, Parmare used Lakshmi’s email ID and sent an email to the Mumbai Police threatening to plant a bomb. Police officers traced the email address to Lakshmi. When Amboli police detained Lakshmi to question, they found out Parmare was behind the crime and he had tried to frame his mother-in-law so that he could take his wife home without any interference.“By the time we investigated the case, Parmare had fled to Gujarat. We are now tracing him. A case has been registered against Parmare,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-uses-mother-in-law-s-email-id-to-send-hoax-mail-101632416698465.html
24-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to implement deshbhakti curriculum in schools from September 28||The Delhi government will implement the deshbhakti curriculum, which aims to instil patriotism and help students “become active and committed citizens”, from nursery to Class 12 in public schools in the Capital from September 28, when it will be launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at an event in Chhatrasal stadium.In a circular released on Thursday, Directorate of Education (DoE) said, “The aforesaid curriculum shall be launched on the birth anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh (September 28) by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal…After the launch, the deshbhakti curriculum shall be implemented in schools by teachers in every class (nursery to Class 12) as and when the schools reopen physically for the concerned classes.”Currently, based on the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) directive last month, only students of classes 9 to 12 are allowed to return to schools for in-person classes.“For now, the curriculum will be taught to students of classes 9 to 12 who are coming to school. The curriculum will be taught to the rest of the students only once schools reopen,” said a senior official from the education department.The circular issued on Thursday said there will be one Deshbhakti period every day for students in nursery to Class 8, and two classes per week -- not on consequent days -- for senior students of classes 9 to 12.“Every deshbhakti period shall start with a five-minute ‘Deshbhakti Dhyaan’, where the teacher and students shall practice mindfulness, reflect on their gratitude for the country, freedom fighters, and any five persons that they consider deshbhakts, and pledge their respect for the country,” said the DoE circular.According to officials, 41 mentor teachers, nine NGO partners and experts played a significant role in developing the curriculum and holding a pilot run between June and July this year.The pilot run was conducted by a core group of Delhi government schoolteachers with over 250 students of different classes in 20 schools over the online platform.In order to ensure smooth implementation, the directorate has asked schools to appoint three deshbhakti nodal teachers in each school for the three-class groups – nursery to class 5, classes 6 to 8, and classes 9 to 12. “The deshbhakti nodal teacher should preferably be a teacher of a class in the same cohort and he/she shall also take deshbhakti class with one section of a class,” the DoE circular said.Officials said an orientation will be conducted for all nodal teachers between September 29 and October 5 by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) Delhi. Principals of Delhi government schools have been asked to forward names for the nodal teachers before September 27 as these teachers also have to conduct an orientation session for all deshbhakti teachers of their respective groups before implementing the curriculum.Mentor teacher Anju Rohilla, who was involved in the pilot run, said that through the curriculum, students were encouraged to ask questions that they wouldn’t usually think about. “We have designed the curriculum in a way that learning has to be conversational and through discussions. Sometimes children may find it difficult to respond because these are questions they have never been asked – like how they can express their love for their country and others. We had given the feedback that teachers should ask more prompting questions and that is likely to be implemented in the final curriculum,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-implement-deshbhakti-curriculum-in-schools-from-september-28-101632416579105.html

24-09-2021||World||Quad to announce fellowships, initiatives on semiconductors||A working group on space, a joint mechanism on semiconductors and a fellowship for master’s and doctoral studies in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields are among some initiatives that the Quad leader are expected to announce when they meet on Friday (Sept 24) for their first in-person summit.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will join their host President Joe Biden at the White House for the in-person summit which starts later in the day and is expected to last two hours.The four leaders will also receive and review updates on initiatives they had launched at their virtual summit in March, which included a commitment to make 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines for distribution in the Indo-Pacific region by 2022, and working groups on climate, cybersecurity and emerging technologies.Previewing the meeting for reporters, senior Biden administration officials made clear once again the informal nature of the group. “The Quad is an unofficial gathering, although we have a number of working groups and we are deepening cooperation on a very daily basis,” one of the officials said, adding, “It is also the case that it is not a regional security organisation.”The official also drew a distinction between the Quad and the recently launched trilateral alliance of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States called AUKUS. They are two “completely separate initiatives” that have nothing to do with one another, even though there are overlaps.“The Quad is a discussion and engagement effort around a number of practical matters, like - we’ve discussed Covid and issues associated with climate change,” the official said, adding, “There is not a military dimension to it or security dimension to it. And it is an informal grouping.”There has been an outpouring of commentary from experts who have argued that the Quad’s security and defence related role stands diminished by the AUKUS.But others, including Indian officials, believe the Quad was never intended as a military alliance even though there had been some talk of it during former president Donald Trump’s term - of formalising the group with the reference point being Nato, a purely military alliance of 30 countries.The Quad will remain focused on non-security related challenges in the Indo-Pacific, with the new initiatives previewed by the US officials.They will announce the launch of working groups on space, the officials said but did not share any details.They were far more forthcoming about the fellowships. Sponsored by private donors, 25 students from each of the four countries will be selected to pursue master’s and post-doctoral degrees in STEM fields at leading US universities every year.The four countries will also announce a supply chain initiative on semiconductors. It will be a detailed joint initiative to map overall capacity; identify respective vulnerabilities; and to take critical steps to bolster supply chain security, particularly for semiconductors and all their vital components, one of the officials said.They will also launch a 5G deployment and diversification effort. “And this is to support the critical role of Quad governments in fostering and promoting a diverse, resilient, secure telecommunications ecosystem,” it was said.Other announcements will an effort on Open RAN (interoperability on wireless networks) development and adoption, which will be a part of the 5G plan. And the other will be on sharing information on illegal fishing and issues associated with maritime domain awareness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-to-announce-fellowships-initiatives-on-semiconductors-101632494767929.html
24-09-2021||World||'I miss you very much…': Young Taliban are singing and dancing in Afghanistan||When the Taliban first came to power in 1996, they imposed a harsh version of Sharia law and banned all sorts of avenues of entertainment in Afghanistan as they found it un-Islamic. The return of the Sunni Pashtun militants at the helm of power has again triggered the fear of human rights violation, especially against women and girls.While the Taliban have maintained that women could soon return to workplaces, the signs remain grim. The newly announced Cabinet has no women members and the ethnic minority communities have not been given any significant post in the government. But there is a palpable change in the entertainment scene, according to a report by news agency AFP.Seven young Taliban, who probably didn’t witness the cultural onslaught two decades ago, were seen singing and dancing while chanting the lyrics of a patriotic Afghan song: "Send me a hello from Kabul... I miss you very much", reported AFP.One evening, they were reportedly clapping their hands and moving side by side in traditional Afghan style on the bank of Arghandab river, which was the side of bloody clashes between the insurgents and government forces just months ago.Singing and dancing were strictly forbidden during their previous rule from 1996-2001. But the younger Taliban listen to music as well, even if most of it is religious, according to AFP. The report suggests that the song they were singing celebrates national unity in a country marred by ethnic division."This song belongs to us, it belongs to our country," AFP quoted Hafiz Mudasir, a young Taliban dancer.While the world closely monitors the actions of the Taliban for their assurance of respecting human rights, the AFP report shows how the last two decades have brought a gradual change in the group’s acceptance of music and dance.(With inputs from agency)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-miss-you-very-much-young-taliban-are-singing-and-dancing-in-afghanistan-101632492640680.html
24-09-2021||World||Taliban govt remains non-inclusive and all-male after Sept 21 expansion||The Taliban recently announced a Cabinet expansion to showcase to the world that the Sunni Pashtun militants have opted for an inclusive government in the wake of repeated demand from the international community. While announcing the expansion, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had claimed that the new Cabinet includes members of ethnic minorities such as Hazaras and Tajiks. But the reality is different.These ethnic minority communities have not been given any significant post and all inductions are unknown faces, with Haqqani and Baradar factions getting the major share of power. The Islamist fundamentalists have not included a single woman in the Cabinet, which they had already indicated, but the Cabinet remains monopolistic even in terms of ethnic minorities. Formers presidents of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, have not been given any role in the new government.New ministers like Qalandar Ibad, Abdul Bari Omar, Mohammad Hassan Ghiasi, Haji Gul Mohammad, Arsala Kharoti Lutfullah Khairkhwa belong to the Haqqani Network, which merged into the Taliban in 2016. Qalandar Ibad is their new health minister while all others are deputy ministers in various departments.On the other hand, Mullah Mohammad Ibrahim, the new deputy minister of interior security, is a Pashtun from the Baradar faction. The deputy minister of defence Mullah Abdul Qayyum Zakir is also Pashtun and said to be a close aide of Mulla Yaqoob, the minister of defence in the Taliban set up. Nazar Mohammad Muttamin, who has been appointed as acting president of Afghanistan’s National Olympic Committee is again a Pashtun from Kandahar and belong to the Baradar faction.Mujeeb-ur-Rehman Omar, deputy minister of power and energy; Mohammad Faqir, acting head of central statistics office; and Gul Zarin Kochi, second deputy minister of border affairs also belong to the Baradar faction.The 50-member Cabinet includes just one representative from the Hazara community, three from Tajiks, and one from Uzbeks. Tajiks like Haji Ghulam Ghaus has been appointed as deputy minister of disaster management, while Haji Nooruddin Azizi, a resident of Panjshir Province has been appointed as acting minister of commerce. Haji Mohammad Bashir, another Tajik, has been appointed as the deputy minister of commerce. Haji Mohammad Azim Sultanzada is the only Uzbek in the new set-up.Najibullah, the director of atomic energy; Mawlawi Abdul Rahman Rashed, minister of agriculture; Molavi Sad Razam, deputy minister of agriculture; and Mawlawi Ataullah Omari, deputy minister of agriculture, are also from the Taliban factions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-govt-remains-non-inclusive-and-all-male-after-sept-21-expansion-101632487611749.html

We are going to address particular issues associated with the challenges confronting the Indo Pacific in the current environment,” the official said. “President Biden believes that too often these kinds of discussions are scripted and he really wants to be able to sit down and have a deeper conversation with all leaders in an environment where they can really share perspectives on what's important to each of them as they go forward,” the official said.“It also indicates that the Biden administration understands that the challenges of the 21st century will largely play out in the Indo-Pacific and we are doubling down on our efforts. This quad is part of a larger fabric of engagement that you will see,” the official added.India, Australia agree on low emissions tech partnershipAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said he and his Indian counterpart and "dear friend" Narendra Modi have agreed on some important new initiatives, including low emissions technology partnership and ultra-low-cost solar programme, which will help in further deepening the economic ties between the two countries.Space, 5G, Quad fellowship - What Quad leaders may announce“We're going to announce a 5G deployment and diversification effort. This is to support the quite a critical role of Quad governments in fostering and promoting a diverse resilient secure intelligent telecommunications ecosystem,” a senior administration official told PTI. They would also announce a STEM -science, technology, engineering and mathematics - scholarship programme. “We will also announce a major fellowship that will bring students from India, from Japan, from Australia and the United States 100 in total, over the course of the next year and a half to study in elite universities in the United States, in areas related to science and technology as a clear signal of the importance of these issues to all of our country's futures,” said the senior administration official.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-wants-to-sit-down-for-deep-conversation-with-quad-leaders-white-house-101632485225443.html
24-09-2021||World||'Illegal': Chinese central bank on crypto transactions||China's central bank on Friday said all financial transactions involving cryptocurrencies are illegal, sounding the death knell for the digital trade in China after a crackdown on the volatile currencies.The global values of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin have massively fluctuated over the past year partly due to Chinese regulations, which have sought to prevent speculation and money laundering."Virtual currency-related business activities are illegal financial activities," the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in an online statement Friday, adding that offenders would be "investigated for criminal liability in accordance with the law."The notice bans all related financial activities involving cryptocurrencies, such as trading crypto, selling tokens, transactions involving virtual currency derivatives and "illegal fundraising".Bitcoin fell as much as 5.5 percent following the announcement, hitting $42,232 around 1000 GMT before stabilising. Around 1030 GMT it was trading down 5.0 percent at $42,464.The central bank said that in recent years trading of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies had become "widespread, disrupting economic and financial order, giving rise to money laundering, illegal fund-raising, fraud, pyramid schemes and other illegal and criminal activities."This was "seriously endangering the safety of people's assets," the PBOC said.While crypto creation and trading have been illegal in China since 2019, further crackdowns this year by Beijing warned banks to halt related transactions and closed much of the country's vast network of bitcoin miners.Friday's statement by the central bank sent the strongest yet signal that China is closed to crypto.ControlBitcoin, the world's largest digital currency, and other cryptos cannot be traced by a country's central bank, making them difficult to regulate.Analysts say China fears the proliferation of illicit investments and fundraising from cryptocurrency in the world's second biggest economy, which also has strict rules around the outflow of capital.The crypto crackdown also opens the gates for China to introduce its own digital currency, already in the pipeline, allowing the central government to monitor transactions.In June, Chinese officials said more than 1,000 people had been arrested for using the profits from crime to buy cryptocurrencies.Several key Chinese provinces banned the operation of cryptocurrency mines since the start of this year, with one region accounting for eight percent of the computing power needed to run the global blockchain -- a set of online ledgers to record bitcoin transactions.Bitcoin values tumbled in May on the back of a warning by Beijing to investors against speculative trading in cryptocurrencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/illegal-chinese-central-bank-on-crypto-transactions-101632485805780.html
24-09-2021||World||China blames India for Galwan Valley clash||China on Friday blamed India for the Galwan Valley clash in June last year in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed, saying New Delhi had violated all border-related agreements and encroached on Chinese territory.India and China have been locked in a border row for 16 months, a row that witnessed the deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley on June 15, 2020, when troops from both sides fought for hours with iron rods and clubs covered with barbed wires.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the Galwan Valley clash, the first fatalities on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) since 1975.Several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have failed to fully resolve the tension, the worst in decades.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquility in the border areas.China, however, has continued to blame India.Responding to a question on the reorganisation of the Indian military into theatre commands and its impact on the management of the Sino-India border, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said: “All the agreements and treaties between China and India on upholding the peace and stability in the area of the LAC have played an important role in upholding stability in the border areas.”“In the last year, Galwan Valley incident took place because India violated all the signed agreements and treaties and encroached upon Chinese territory, illegally crossed the line (LAC). We hope India will abide by all the signed agreements and uphold peace stability in the border region with concrete actions,” Zhao Lijian said.In September, 2020, China had said that it abides by the LAC, the notional Sino-India boundary, as proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in a letter dated November 7, 1959 - an offer New Delhi has consistently rejected since it was first made 61 years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blames-india-for-galwan-valley-clash-101632485946796.html
24-09-2021||World||China sniggers at Quad ahead of summit in Washington||The four-member Quad, an “exclusive, closed” group will find no support, China said on Friday ahead of the first in-person summit of the bloc’s leaders in Washington to be attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Besides Narendra Modi, the high-profile summit will be attended by Prime Ministers Scott Morrison (Australia) and Yoshihide Suga (Japan) and US President Joe Biden.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry sniggered at the summit of the Quad, which is often seen as a counter to China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.“China always believes that any regional cooperation mechanism should not target a third party or harm its interests. Seeking exclusive closed cliques against a third country runs against the trend of the times and aspirations of countries in the region,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Friday. “It (the Quad) will find no support.”China, Zhao Lijian said, is a builder of world peace, contributor of global development and upholder of world order.“The growth of China means the growth for peace and stability in the world and China’s contribution to peace and stability and development in the Asia-Pacific is there for all to see,” Zhao Lijian said. “Relevant countries should do more that is conducive to solidarity and cooperation with countries in the region.”China had reacted strongly to an online meeting of the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) leaders in March, saying that the “will end up nowhere” if it does not abandon its ideological bias and cold war mentality, underscoring its opposition to the bloc.The March summit attended by all four leaders via video link was closely monitored and critiqued by Beijing.The consensus in Beijing is that the four countries came together to counter China’s increasing influence and muscle-flexing in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region.In November 2017, New Delhi, Tokyo, Washington, and Canberra gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quad to develop a coordinated strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific maritime region free of any influence.In 2018, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had described the Quad as “...seafoam in the Pacific or the Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate”.By 2020, Wang Yi came around to acknowledging that the Quad had become a “security threat” and a so-called Indo-Pacific “New Nato”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sniggers-at-quad-ahead-of-summit-in-washington-101632483726769.html
24-09-2021||World||'See America's daughters': Deriding video of Imran Khan's UN leader goes viral||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has sent Shehryar Khan Afridi, the chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Kashmir, to the United States to take part in the United Nations General Assembly. Reports said that he has been sent to the UNGA to 'raise awareness' about what is happening in Jammu and Kashmir. But Imran Khan's 'Kashmir' man has already gone viral on social media for a vlog that he shot from the street of Manhattan.Shooting the video of women roaming around the street, Afridi, clad in a casual t-shirt, said women in Pakistan have a far better condition than those countries who preach to the world. Accompanied by a few men, Afridi is seen taking a stroll and saying, "Whatever the ethnicity is --Baloch, Sindhi, Punjabi, Pashtun, Kashmiri-- we give respect to women. See here, these are America's daughters. Recognise the values that we have. This is not a political slogan. This is the reality. See the condition of those who give us lectures, who tell us 'I am the king'". Video of #Pakistan-i Parliamentarian Shehryar Afridi taking a weekend stroll in Times Square, New York, while bashing American Women & Values.He is in US as part of Pakistan’s delegation to #UNGA: pic.twitter.com/gyjWMvGHEZThe video surfaced a few days ago and has now gone viral with several social media users pointing out the condition of women in Pakistan."Once again PM Imran Khan is going to address UNGA as an ambassador of Kashmir. World has to listen to the tale of the barbarism of fascist Indian regime," Afridi tweeted on Friday.This is, however, not the first controversy of Afridi during the trip as he was reportedly stopped at JFK airport for screening. The Pakistan Embassy in Washington said that it was a routine screening as Afridi is a first-time visitor. “As noted by the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, as a first-time visitor, Mr Afridi had secondary screening briefly and was cleared in routine without any guarantees being sought or given by anyone from the Embassy or the Consulate,” a statement from the embassy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/see-america-s-daughters-imran-khan-s-un-leader-s-deriding-video-goes-viral-101632480972124.html

24-09-2021||World||Afghans perish at border town as Pakistan refuses to let any more refugee in||Thousands of Afghans families are faced with a dire situation as they make desperate attempts to cross the dusty border town of Spin Boldak in search of greener pastures in Pakistan.While the Taliban and Pakistan are said to have supported each other over the years, the recent humanitarian crisis unfolding along the border is creating deep fissures between the neighbouring powers. Pakistan border officials have refused to let anyone move into its part of the land citing security issues even as Afghans cry and beg for a chance to enter the country for some life-saving treatment or a reunion with a loved one.Also read | UN refugee agency reveals how many Afghans recorded for registration in India since Aug 1According to an article in the New York Post, even cross-border trade has remained shut for days. The border crossing connects Spin Boldak in Kandahar province with Pakistan’s Chaman and Quetta.Earlier this month, at least one person died during a stampede when Pakistan temporarily closed the Chaman crossing, the second-largest commercial border point with Afghanistan.However, those patrolling the area on the Afghan side claimed several people have lost their lives from dehydration and heatstroke, while some met their end, unable to access medical care in Chaman district.Also read | Empires slay, publics pay: The global refugee crisis unfolding in AfghanistanThe article said two more Afghans died near the Mazal gate on Wednesday afternoon, a less frenetic exit to the primary thoroughfare and designated for local families and special cases.While officially, Pakistan has restricted entry at the key international intersection to Pakistani or Kandahar identification cardholders, locals say the gates have been sealed to almost everyone.Trucks were seen stranded for miles with perishable goods rotting and public services, including those in the health sector, have stopped operations.A lot of families have starved for days as they make regular rounds of the fortified checkpoint, only to be turned away.The area has become a "military zone" over the past several days as thousands have been making desperate bids to move across Pakistan ever since the Taliban took over Kabul after the fall of the Ashraf Ghan-led elected government.Taliban officials, who now patrol the overstuffed space, said Pakistan was creating problems and not sticking to its words"We have an understanding with Pakistan to allow Kandahar people to cross into Pakistan. In return, people from Chaman and Quetta can enter Afghanistan using National IDs," Mohammad Sadiq Sabery, authority in charge of the border area in Kandahar, was quoted as saying in the article.The Taliban are calling on Pakistan to open the border at least on urgent humanitarian grounds, but Pakistan has defended its move saying it had by far taken the highest number of Afghan refugees over the two-decade war.According to Islamabad, the country is currently home to some 1.4 million registered refugees and an estimated 2 million more who are undocumented.The United Nations estimates that about 10,000 refugees have come to Pakistan since mid-August, when the Taliban took over the Presidential Palace and secured control of the embattled country.Reports of smugglers exploiting the situation and taking thousands of money from desperate Afghans have also come in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-perish-at-border-town-as-pakistan-refuses-to-let-any-more-refugee-in-101632472390820.html
24-09-2021||World||‘Welcome to hell’: Chinese brand JNBY printed kids’ clothes with alleged anti-India imagery||A top Chinese clothing brand JNBY is facing backlash after one of its clothing lines produced children’s clothes with images of people identified as Indians being shot at and phrases like “welcome to hell” and “let me touch you” embossed on them.The brand JNBY apologised and pulled the clothing line in question after the complaint of a mother went viral on Chinese social media this week.A report in the state-run tabloid Global Times called the prints “inappropriate” and “horrific” but avoided mentioning the anti-India images that were found on clothes made and sold by JNBY.The woman, identified as Mogu Mogu on Chinese social media, wrote that her family bought one of the shirts for her 4-year-old son.She shared photos of a white shirt with the images and remarks in black, the meaning of which she realised only recently as it was bought by her son’s grandparents who don’t speak English.“Welcome to hell. Excuse me? Who are you welcoming? And all these images of purgatory … a child aged four wearing such a shirt. Just the thought of it disturbs me,” she was quoted as saying by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP).Soon after her post went viral, another user shared the photo of anti-India imagery. “The whole place is full of Indians. I will take this gun and blow them to pieces,” the SCMP report said.The company has since apologised on the lifestyle sharing app Xiaohongshu. “We apologise for the concern caused to customers caused by the design and will tighten regulation,” the customer service said on the official T-mall store of the brand, the Global Times report said.The company did not explain how inappropriate words and images ended up being printed on clothes.The Hong Kong-listed company, based in the city of Hangzhou in eastern China, describes itself as “the most influential designer brand fashion house in China”.The company says its “universal brand philosophy” is “Just Naturally Be Yourself”.According to Global Times, by the end of last year, the company had 1,931 stores nationwide, and overseas stores in the US and Canada.In the fiscal year ended June 30, JNBY saw sales rise 33.1 percent year-on-year to 4.126 billion yuan ($638.70mn).The angry mother, however, is still fuming.“Between 2018 and 2019, it produced and sold many such clothes. Thousands of children may be wearing them. As far as I know, several mothers protested at its T-mall shop or physical shop last year after buying this one, but the issue was left unsettled,” she said in a follow up post quoted by the SCMP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/welcome-to-hell-chinese-brand-printed-kids-clothes-with-anti-india-imagery-101632470225131.html
24-09-2021||World||Kamala Harris slams Pakistan on terror in meeting with Narendra Modi||US Vice-President Kamala Harris on Thursday called upon Pakistan to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil to ensure they do not threaten the security of both the United States and India and underscored the need to closely monitor Islamabad’s support for terrorism.Kamala Harris’s remarks came during her meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that lasted over an hour and “reflected warmth and cordiality”. She also accepted Narendra Modi’s invitation to visit India and said she had wanted to “go back”, reminiscing about her earlier visits and the time she spent there.The meeting with Kamala Harris was politically important for the Indian prime minister because Kamala Harris, a leading progressive in the Democratic party, had been severely critical of the Modi government’s decision to abrogate Article 370 guaranteeing special status of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir and the enactment of the Citizenship Act that speeds up Indian citizenship for Hindus seeking refuge in India from repressive regimes. Other progressives who had been critical of these measures were Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. Additionally, the vice-president’s niece Meena Harris brought the Modi government further grief by endorsing celebrities who came out in support of farmers protesting a legislation that they feared would strip them of government protection. Kamala Harris did not bring up any of these issues at the talks, according to all available indications.SHARED PRIORITIESKamala Harris and Narendra Modi had made initial remarks before their bilateral meeting, in which they had reiterated the importance of the relationship between the two countries and had stressed shared concerns and priorities such as climate change and Covid-19 and the need to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.The two leaders had a short one-on-one interaction without aides and officials, before starting the bilateral, during which time Vice-President Kamala Harris, whose late mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris was born and raised in India, reminisced about her visits to India and the time she spent with her grandfather, said people familiar with the conversation. She expressed the desire to “go back”, it was said. She has accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s invitation to her and first gentleman Douglas Emhoff to visit India, but there was no word on the timing.PAKISTAN AND TERRORISMPakistan came up at the bilateral meeting when the two sides were discussing terrorism. “The vice-president, suo moto (on her own, unprompted) referred to Pakistan’s role in that regard,” Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told reporters at a news briefing.The vice-president further said that there were terror groups that were working there. “She asked Pakistan to take action so that these groups do not impact on our security and that of India,” the foreign secretary said further, adding, “She agreed with the prime minister’s briefing on the fact of cross-border terrorism, and the fact that India had been a victim of terrorism for several decades now; and on the need to rein in and closely monitor Pakistan’s support for such terrorist groups.”Kamala Harris’s ringing rebuke of Pakistan’s continued support for terrorism came shortly after another senior member of the Biden administration, secretary of state Antony Blinken expressed US appreciation of Pakistan’s role in continuing diplomatic engagement over Afghanistan and help in evacuating people, to his Pakistan counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi in New York.The United States appreciates “the work that Pakistan has done to facilitate the departure of American citizens who wish to leave as well as others”, Antony Blinken said ahead of their meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He added, “but a lot to talk about there as well as our own bilateral relationship, including the economic relationship between our countries and working in the region as a whole”.US-PAKISTAN TIESUS-Pakistan ties have been extremely troubled in recent years and have not shown any sign of recovering despite Islamabad’s help in ending the war in Afghanistan, and the evacuation of Americans there. US President Joe Biden, for instance, has still not spoken to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.INDIAN PM MEETS AUSTRALIAN, JAPANESE COUNTERPARTSThe bilateral with the Indian-descent US vice-president was among three the prime minister held on his first day of this US visit. The others were with Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga, key Indo-Pacific partners. These were Modi’s first in-person meetings with these leaders and they will all join US President Joe Biden on Friday for the first in-person summit of the Quad.The meeting with Morrison started early - because the Australian leader arrived way early - and lasted longer than scheduled, which, both Indian and Australian officials said, was a “good thing”. Briefing reporters at the end of the day, foreign secretary Shringla said, “They discussed a broad range of issues, which covered bilateral, regional, and global issues of mutual interest. They noted with satisfaction the high level engagement between the two countries.”This was their first in-person meeting. Scott Morrison was scheduled to visit India in January 2020 but cancelled in view of devastating forest fires and then cancelled his March visit the same year because of Covid-19.“Outstanding,” Morrison said when asked about the meeting when he was leaving.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with his Japanese counterpart went off extremely well also, helped in no small measure by the fact they are staying in the same hotel, although a few floors apart. They are staying at Willard Hotel, just across the street from the White House, whose lobby now defines the practice of lobbying - people intending to meet and influence White House officials would typically hang out in Willard’s lobby.“They discussed a broad range of issues, which covered bilateral, regional, and global issues of mutual interest,” Shringla said of the Narendra Modi’s bilateral with Yoshihide Suga. “They noted with satisfaction the high level engagement between the two countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-slams-pakistan-on-terror-in-meeting-with-narendra-modi-101632461344609.html

In children, the lower dose triggered higher antibody levels than the dosage approved for use in adults in China, according to the peer-reviewed finding supplementary-data from a mid-stage trial.The trial recruited 150 children and around 300 adults.The results also showed that children given one lower dose had a stronger antibody response than adults who were given a booster shot 56 days after the first dose.But the antibody readings did not show to what extent the vaccine can offer protection against Covid-19, researchers from a Chinese disease control agency, CanSinoBIO and other Chinese institutes cautioned in a paper.CanSinoBIO's vaccine has not yet got the greenlight for children. China has approved two vaccines, developed by Sinovac and Sinopharm, for use in children from the age of three but vaccinations have yet to begin for those under 12.The paper said the booster shot for CanSinoBIO's vaccine improved antibody responses in participants of different age groups, especially for older adults.But cellular responses, another important part of human immune system, were not boosted by the second shot and researchers said a wider interval than 56 days should be considered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cansinobios-covid-19-vaccine-tested-at-lower-dosage-safe-for-children-aged-6-17-report-101632458827673.html
24-09-2021||World||Pakistan remains a problem for US and China for Japan and Australia||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is gearing up for the key bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden and the Quad summit after excellent conversations on Pakistan with Vice President Kamala Harris and on Chinese belligerence with Japanese and Australian PM. Narendra Modi will be the first PM of India in four decades to engage with three different US presidents in person as a prime minister. The PM Modi-Biden one hour meeting is at 11am EST in the White House while the Quad Summit will be held for two hours from 2 to 4pm.According to diplomats based in Washington and New Delhi, Pakistan based terror groups was raised by VP Harris during her “good” conversation with PM Modi with the former stating that theUS will take up this issue with Islamabad so that the security of both US and India are not threatened by these global terror groups.However, the Indian side detected that the US was in a bit of quandary over Pakistan. Just as it was quite evident to them that Pakistan was harbouring terror groups with global reach, it was equally clear that theUS was unclear about the role that Pakistan could play in Afghanistan as it has also harboured all the Taliban leaders in the past.While Pakistan dominated the conversation with VP Harris, China was the flavour of PM Modi’s bilateral meetings with PM Yoshihide Suga and PM Scott Morrison. Prime Minister Suga showed Japanese interest in the production linked incentive scheme announced by PM Modi and was keen on taking part in manufacturing in India. This move also dovetails into the Quad’s global resilient supply chains with India being a key hub of manufacturing. PM Modi and PM Suga shared notes on Indo-Pacific with both countries’ victims of PLA aggression in East Ladakh and Senkaku Islands respectively.Although the Australian trade minister is arriving in India to firm up bilateral ties, PM Modi’s conversation with PM Morrison was more China-centric and security related.Just as Australia is augmenting its naval capabilities through the AUKUS pact by taking an orbital jump to nuclear powered conventionally armed submarines, India is reforming its Navy with new and potent platforms in all three dimensions. India is now operating Predator drones for maritime awareness, P-8I and MH-60 R multi-mission platforms and will launch Visakhapatnam class of guided-missile destroyers in November. India has also built a new Kalvari class of diesel-electric submarines and is now looking at nuclear power conventionally armed submarines to deter belligerent players in Indo-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-remains-a-problem-for-us-and-china-for-japan-and-australia-101632457725131.html
24-09-2021||World||CIA fires its Vienna chief over handling of ‘Havana syndrome’ cases: Report||The CIA removed its Vienna, Austria station chief recently amid criticism the person did not take seriously a surge in mysterious "Havana syndrome" cases, the Washington Post reported Thursday. Dozens of cases affecting embassy staff and Central Intelligence Agency officers and family members have been reported in Vienna recently, but the unnamed station chief expressed skepticism and showed insensitivity, the Post said, citing intelligence sources.A CIA spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the report but said the agency takes seriously scores of possible incidents of the mysterious ailment in US diplomatic missions around the world.The cause and source remain enigmatic, CIA Deputy Director David Cohen said last week."Have we gotten closer? I think the answer is yes -- but not close enough to make the analytic judgment that people are waiting for," he said.The US government, including the CIA and Pentagon, has ramped up staff to investigate and provide treatment for the cases.Dubbed "Havana syndrome" because reports of the condition first showed up in the Cuban capital, the ailment is marked by bloody noses, headaches, vision problems, and other symptoms that resemble concussions.Some people experiencing it have reported hearing focused, high-pitched or sharp sounds that left them nauseated.The incidents are little understood and have sparked theories that they were caused by a weapon that used focused microwaves, ultrasound, poison, or are even a reaction to crickets.But for several years, senior government officials dismissed the complaints, judging them to be the symptoms of people under stress or reacting with hysteria to unknown stimuli.The administration of Joe Biden has geared up the investigation into what has been renamed anomalous health incidents, or AHI.If the cases are caused by something like a directed energy attack, US officials suspect Russia could be behind it.The Post called Vienna, where the United States has a large embassy and intelligence collection operation, a "hotbed" of AHI incidents, with dozens of people reporting unexplained symptoms.The issue has US officials around the world jittery. In August Vice President Kamala Harris delayed by several hours a visit to Vietnam after the US embassy there reported a possible case involving "acoustic incidents."And during a visit to India by CIA Director William Burns in early September, an official in his retinue reported symptoms and sought medical assistance, according to the Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-fires-its-vienna-chief-over-handling-of-havana-syndrome-cases-report-101632452765847.html

Patching up will take time||Top diplomats of France and the United States said on Thursday that patching up bilateral ties will take some time yet, as French discontent still sizzles over the trilateral AUKUS nuclear submarine deal that tore up one of its contracts with Australia. US secretary of state Anthony Blinken, a fluent French speaker who spent a part of his childhood in Paris, appeared remorseful as he spoke to reporters during the day, and said that he tried making amends with the French side on Washington's part. Later, a French foreign ministry statement confirmed that the process to repair ties have been initiated but resolving the matter completely will take time and further remedial actions.Also Read | ‘Give me a break’, says Boris Johnson as France upset over submarine dealThe development comes days after US president Joe Biden held a phone call with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and discussed the crisis between the two countries – a “friendly” conversation which had the two leaders, according to the White House, vowing to launch “in-depth consultations... for ensuring confidence” and to meet in Europe at the end of October.For context, France has been fuming ever since the US and the United Kingdom made the surprise announcement about the deal to build nuclear submarines for Australia – thus scuppering a previous French deal to sell conventional submarines. Paris called the US-Australian plan, which was launched as part of a new Indo-Pacific security group along with Britain, a stab in the back and also pulled its ambassador from Australia.French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian earlier accused Australia of back-stabbing and the US of betrayal, calling the move reminiscent of the unilateralist attitude of Biden's predecessor Donald Trump.Also Read | Aukus: Which countries have nuclear-powered submarines?However, in what comes as a positive development for both sides, Le Drian met US secretary of state Anthony Blinken on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on Thursday, days after he gave the US the cold shoulder. “He recalled that a first step had been taken with the call between the two presidents but underlined that resolving the crisis between our two countries would take time and require actions,” a French foreign ministry statement said.Blinken, in turn, said he would keep up talks with Le Drian, much as Biden agreed to meet late next month with Macron.

Some panel members cited the difficulty of implementing such a proposal.Still, the vote by the group, following US Food and Drug Administration authorization, clears the way for a booster rollout to begin as soon as this week for millions of people who had their second dose of the Pfizer shot at least six months ago.The CDC said that some 26 million people in the United States received the second Pfizer/BioNTech shot at least six months ago, including 13 million age 65 or older.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-panel-recommend-pfizer-vaccine-boosters-for-ages-65-and-older-101632431780374.html

They had spoken on phone some months ago when Harris had called to inform Modi of the Biden administration’s decision to send Covid-19 vaccines from the US stockpile.As the largest democracy and the oldest democracy, the prime minister said, India and the United States are “indeed natural partners. We have similar values, similar geopolitical interests, and also our coordination and cooperation is continuously increasing”.The prime minister then told Harris they had shared interests and concerns. Strengthening the supply chain, new and emerging technologies and space, he said, “are areas of special interest for you. These are areas which are of interest to me too and of special priority”.Welcoming Prime Minister Modi, Vice-President Harris spoke of shared concerns and priorities in the Indo-Pacific, climate change, and on democracy.“As democracies around the world are under threat, it is imperative that we defend democratic principles and institutions within our respective countries and around the world, and that we maintain what we must do to strengthen democracies at home,; Harris, said, adding, “it is incumbent on our nations to of course, protect democracies in the best interest of the people of our countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/modi-thanks-harris-for-covid-19-call-invites-her-to-india-101632430503066.html

He said 13 people in all were shot and the 12 of them were taken to hospitals, some with very serious injuries.He said a police SWAT team and other officers went aisle to aisle in the store to find people who sought cover or were in hiding, removing them to safety. He said the shooter was also found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.“We found people hiding in freezers, in locked offices. They were doing what they had been trained to do: run, hide, fight," the chief said.The identities of the shooter and the victims were not immediately released.Lane said it was a sad day for his department as he spoke at a news conference after the shooting near the scene.“I've been involved in this for 34 years and I’ve never seen anything like it," he told reporters.He added investigators are working to sort out what happened, adding, “It’s going to take a little bit before we know what happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-dead-12-injured-in-tennessee-store-shooting-shooter-dead-police-101632430117591.html

He refused to say more.The meeting lasted much longer than its appointed time, which, both Indian and Australian officials said, was “a good thing”.They discussed an entire range of issues including the recently launched military alliance of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States called AUKUS, which aims chiefly to equip Australia with nuclear-powered submarines for deployment in the Indo-Pacific region.Scott Morrison had briefed Narendra Modi on the AUKUS alliance before it was announced formally.Also Read: On the climate crisis, a four-point agenda for Quad meetingA source familiar with the planning of the prime minister’s visit and his bilateral meetings described India-Australia ties as an “important relationship (which) is developing very quickly” and said a meeting of the two leaders had been “long overdue”.

24-09-2021||India||‘Stronger, closer, tighter’: US heralds new India paradigm||US President Joe Biden on Friday said at a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the relationship between the two countries is “destined to be stronger, closer and tighter”, and the Indian leader rolled out a 10-year road map for growing ties based on Four Ts — talent, technology, trade, and trusteeship.The two were meeting for the first time since Biden took office, and it is one of the most crucial engagements for Prime Minister Modi who is on a three-day visit to the US. The President went on to express optimism about the relationship, saying that he has long believed — even back in 2006 — that by 2020, India and the United States will be “among the closest nations in the world”.The two leaders have spoken on the phone several times, and have participated in virtual meetings. They displayed an easy level of comfort with each other, which was visible immediately when President Biden began recounting a story he has told many times before -- of people in India with the same surname “Biden”. Modi took it forward this time and said that since Biden last told him about it, he got some research done into it and he now brought along some genealogy documents for the president.“Your leadership will certainly play an important role in how this decade is shaped. The seeds have been sown for an even stronger friendship between India and the US,” the PM told Biden.“Today we’re launching a new chapter in the history of US-Indian ties, and taking on some of the toughest challenges we face together, starting with a shared commitment to end the Covid pandemic,” Biden added.Biden said he and Modi will discuss what more can be done to end the pandemic and take on climate challenges that the world faces, and ensure stability Indo-Pacific, including with partners of the Quad, which was scheduled to hold its first in-person summit meeting later in the day. Afghanistan, economic cooperation and trade will also figure in their talks, officials said.Biden also said the relationship was more than a partnership between the two countries and included “family ties”, alluding to the four million Indian-Americans. Pointing to Mahatma Gandhi’s upcoming birth anniversary next week, the US president said people should be reminded that his “message of non-violence, respect, tolerance, matters today maybe more than ever”.In the morning, the US President tweeted about the upcoming bilateral and said: “I look forward to strengthening the deep ties between our two nations, working to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific, and tackling everything from Covid-19 to climate change.”Prime Minister Modi spoke of the decade starting 2021 as a transformative period for ties between the two countries. Modi then went on to unveil his four-Ts road map: He spoke first of the talent of Indian-Americans that Biden had referred to in his remarks. “When I look at the importance of this decade, and the role that is going to be played by this talent of the Indian Americans, I find that the people to people talent will play a greater role and Indian talent will be a full partner in this relationship,” he said.Technology, the second T, he said, will be the “most important driving force” and technology that is going to be for the service and for the use of humanity.Trade, the third T, will continue to assume importance in the relationship, the Prime Minister said, adding: “We find that the trade between our two countries are actually complementary”. “There are things that you have and there are things that we have, and then we in fact complement each other. I find that the area of trade during this decade, that is also going to be tremendously important,” he stressed.The fourth T: trusteeship, a concept advocated by Mahatma Gandhi, who, Modi said, “used to talk about the principle of trusteeship, trusteeship of the planet”. He added that the sentiment of trusteeship would assume increased importance globally and also in relations between India and the US.”Richard Rossow, head of India studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said though the public remarks had “less flash than President Trump’s public engagements with Prime Minister Modi, it reflects a return to normal diplomacy. Not simply for its sober, friendly tone, but also the fact that the leaders are focused on the global partnership. This appeared less transactional than recent summits. Of course, the public session has less importance than what might be announced after the formal bilateral later today.”He also noted that Biden did not use the remarks to “directly raise growing concerns in Washington about human rights interest in India. He reiterated our shared interest but did not turn this into a potential point of friction”.Atman Trivedi, a former Obama administration official who is now a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Center, said, “The two leaders meeting in person, separately and with the Quad, presents a rare opportunity to take advantage of the growing strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific, while working on the most consequential challenges of our times, from Covid-19 to climate change to cybersecurity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stronger-closer-tighter-us-heralds-new-india-paradigm-101632507671943.html

The editor of Crime magazine T P Nandakumar was also booked. The incident surfaced after a telephonic conversation between George and Nandakumar over mounting Covid-19 cases in the state. Later, excerpts of the conversation were posted in the magazine which carried some disparaging comments against the minister. During the talk George allegedly said she was not fit for the minister’s post and passed some comments against her. HT could not verify the authenticity of the conversation which later surfaced on social media also. The case was registered against the duo after a lawyer of the Kerala High Court BH Manzoor filed a police compliant. In the complaint he said George allegedly made some derogatory comment which was an insult to women in general. Both were charged under Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (insulting the modesty of women). George later said the case was based on a cooked up report and he would deal with it legally.

24-09-2021||India||BJP says parties should first disclose caste representation within their political outfits||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is under pressure from the opposition parties to clarify its stance on caste-based enumeration, on Friday, responded by asking the parties to first disclose the representation given to various castes in their respective organisations. Addressing the media, Rajya Sabha MP, Sudhanshu Trivedi said even those parties which were founded on the basis of caste politics have ended up as family-oriented parties. “Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav used to be called dharti putra (son of the soil) but he ended up promoting his son. Mayawati, addressed as behanji (sister) by her admirers, spoke of the deprived communities but only thought of her brother,” Trivedi said taking pot-shots at the opposition parties. He said unlike other parties that only speak about empowerment of people from the so-called lower castes, the BJP has walked the talk on development for all. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policy is clear. He believes in Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas…and welfare measures have been extended to all irrespective of their castes,” he said. Responding to a question on the Union government’s stand on the issue of caste-based enumeration he said the government’s reply to the apex court was based on “technical grounds”. The Union government in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court has ruled out a caste-based census. Declining to collect data on backward class of citizens during the upcoming census, the government maintained that this exercise is administratively complex, and against the policy decision of the government. Apart from the opposition parties, the BJP’s allies, the JDU and Apna Dal too have been in the forefront of seeking caste-based enumeration. JDU leader and Bihar CM, Nitish Kumar led an all-party meeting that met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to push for their demand for caste-based census.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-says-parties-should-first-disclose-caste-representation-within-their-political-outfits-101632503588749.html

This was something that Joe Biden had claimed long before he became the President. During a visit to Mumbai in 2013, Biden had said that his distant relatives lived in Mumbai."You have told about people with the surname Biden. You have personally told me about this. Since then I have been trying to look into this. I have brought some documents also if they may come to any use," PM Modi said in Hindi, with a smile on his face.As his comment was translated into English, Joe Biden burst into laughter and asked in disbelief whether he actually brought some documents. PM Modi nodded with a smile.'Known you for a long time,' says Biden, PM Modi praises US Prez's visionFollowing the light exchange, PM Modi started his remark in which he praised Joe Biden's leadership and hoped for a new era in the history of India-US ties. Biden too recalled the episode and said when he visited Chembur in Mumbai as the vice president of the United States, he was asked by the Indian press whether he had any relatives in India. "I said I don't know but I had received a letter from someone called Biden from India. The next day, Indian press told me that there are five Bidens in India," Biden said. Biden received the letter in 1981 when he was 29 years old. Are there 5 Bidens in India?Reports said Ian Biden, his sister Sonia Francis nee Biden, their mother Angelina Biden, Ian and Sonia's first cousin Rowena Biden are the Bidens of India. The letter that Joe Biden talked about was apparently written to him by Leslie Biden, paternal grandfather of Ian Biden. But they are based in Nagpur and the Joe Biden thinks they are from Mumbai as the letter was written from Mumbai, then Bombay.

24-09-2021||India||‘Not because of CoWIN’: RS Sharma on UK quarantine rule for Indians||NEW DELHI: India and the United Kingdom are yet to arrive at an agreement on accepting India’s Covid-19 vaccine certification so that vaccinated Indian travellers can skip a 10-day quarantine. India’s National Health Authority (NHA) chairman RS Sharma, who held discussions with UK high commissioner Alex Ellis on Thursday, said there was no problem with the digital platform CoWIN and the UK side hadn’t raised any concerns around it either at his meetings. Edited excerpts:So there is no problem with CoWIN or the certificate that India gives?There is none and this is a completely baseless controversy raised by some people.We saw the exchange of tweets between you and the UK high commissioner (who confirmed that no technical concerns were raised about the certification processes). Can you tell us what concerns were raised at the meeting?There were absolutely no concerns either before the meeting or during the meeting. The concerns were actually (in) the fertile minds of some of the people who started a controversy where nothing existed.But why is it then that the UK is treating us like the unvaccinated despite having the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield)?That’s a larger issue. I have not interacted or am competent enough to answer that question. The only question I am referring to is that they (the UK) have raised certain concerns about India’s certification process. I just wanted to put on record that they are happy and there are absolutely no concerns raised at any point in time by the British side.But couldn’t you help us understand where the problem lies?No, I cannot help you understand because that’s not my mandate. You ask the foreign secretary, you ask the health secretary or someone else. I am just in charge of the CoWIN platform so I will only answer questions about that.So there is no problem with CoWIN or the certificate that India gives?There is none and this is a completely baseless controversy raised by some people.Is the problem that India doesn’t share its Covid data? Or in coordinating data with NHS (United Kingdom National Health Service)?It is so unfortunate that despite my saying there’s no problem, you continue to persist as if there was a problem. What can I say?So you are saying it is a country-to-country issue. I wanted to ask you that IMF and airline associations across the world are pushing for a universal vaccine certificate. Do you and India support this?I am not competent to answer this question. That is being dealt with by the civil aviation ministry and the ministry of external affairs.There’s nothing that the UK wants clarity on, from us?Nothing related to the certificate or process on CoWIN.Finally, did you request the meeting with the UK envoy?The meeting was to understand each other’s system and a perfect understanding has been arrived at. They have even sent us a mail saying that there is no further information required and there is absolutely no concern. In the proceedings of the meeting, there is not even a single line that says that there is concern from either side.Did you ask for the meeting after you heard the reports (of concerns around CoWIN)?No. I didn’t ask for any meeting.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also present in the meeting.This is the second meeting between Rahul Gandhi and former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. The two earlier met on September 17 where both leaders discussed the political situation in the state, according to a report by HT. Pilot was the deputy chief minister and Rajasthan state unit president till July 2020 but resigned from both posts after he expressed his discontent with Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot.A person from the Congress who is familiar with the developments that happened last week during the meeting between Rahul Gandhi and Sachin Pilot said that no imminent change can be expected in Rajasthan, according to the report by HT.The leaders, however, said that if any changes do occur in Rajasthan, it will be done keeping an eye on the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and means to improve Congress’ performance. Pilot also told the Congress that he will require at least more than a year to prepare for the 2024 elections.Pilot’s second meeting with Rahul Gandhi following the removal of Punjab chief minister has created a buzz in political circles that a change of leadership is imminent but it is still unclear what both the leaders discussed during their meetings.Pilot earlier this year expressed his concern that Congress MLAs in his camp were not given what was due to them despite working hard in the previous legislative assembly elections to ensure Congress was victorious over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Pilot has also clarified earlier that he does not wish to join the BJP. The BJP however last month said that Pilot and Gehlot were fighting for the CM’s chair. Union labour minister Bhupendra Yadav while on Jan Ashirwad Yatra in Rajasthan targeted the Rajasthan Congress claiming that there was infighting between the two factions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-meets-rahul-for-2nd-time-in-a-week-priyanka-gandhi-also-present-101632495587734.html
24-09-2021||India||India says China’s ‘provocative behaviour’ on LAC disrupted normal ties||India on Friday blamed China’s “provocative behaviour” and unilateral attempts to alter status quo on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) for disruption of bilateral ties and rejected Beijing’s contention that the Indian side was responsible for the deadly Galwan Valley clash last year. The remarks by external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi were a response to the Chinese foreign ministry’s assertion earlier in the day that the Galwan Valley incident was the result of Indian forces illegally trespassing on the LAC to “encroach on Chinese territory”. The brutal clash in Galwan Valley on June 15 last year, which saw troops from both sides fighting each other for several hours with rods, clubs covered with barbed wire and rocks, resulted in the first fatalities on the LAC in 45 years. The Indian side lost 20 soldiers while China has acknowledged four deaths. The testy exchange on Friday reflected the tensions caused by the dragging military standoff on the LAC that began in May 2020. The two sides withdrew frontline troops from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February and from Gogra in August. India has insisted bilateral ties can be normalised only when disengagement and de-escalation is completed at other friction points on the LAC such as Hot Springs and Depsang. Responding to a question on the reorganisation of the Indian military into theatre commands and its impact on the Sino-India border at the Chinese foreign ministry’s regular news briefing, spokesperson Zhao Lijian said: “The Galwan Valley incident last year was caused by the Indian side’s illegal trespass of the LAC to encroach on Chinese territory, in violation of previously signed treaties and agreements.” Zhao added, “We hope that the Indian side will strictly abide by relevant treaties and agreements signed by the two countries and take concrete actions to safeguard peace and stability in the China-India border areas.” The series of treaties and agreements signed by the two sides over the years on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the LAC had “played an important role in upholding stability along the China-India border”, he said. The external affairs ministry spokesperson dismissed Zhao’s remarks that the Galwan Valley incident occurred because India violated all treaties and agreements and encroached on Chinese territory. Bagchi said: “We reject such statements. Our position with regard to developments last year along the LAC in eastern Ladakh has been clear and consistent. It was the provocative behaviour and unilateral attempts of the Chinese side to alter status quo in contravention of all our bilateral agreements that resulted in serious disturbance of peace and tranquillity.” He added, “This has also impacted the bilateral relations. As emphasized by [external affairs minister S Jaishankar] in his meeting with Chinese [foreign minister Wang Yi] earlier this month, it is our expectation that the Chinese side will work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols.” Following a meeting between Jaishankar and Wang on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Dushanbe on September 17, the Indian side had said both ministers had agreed on further meetings of military and diplomatic officials to speedily resolve the remaining issues related to the standoff. Several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have failed to end the tensions, the worst in decades. India has consistently rejected China’s accusations that Indian troops crossed the LAC in eastern Ladakh, and asserted that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach to border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity. Meanwhile, Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong said in a virtual address to a track II dialogue event on Friday that “peace and tranquillity in the border areas is important, but it is not the whole story of the bilateral relations”. His remarks reflected the Chinese position that the standoff be delinked from ties in other areas such as trade. Addressing the event co-hosted by the School of International Studies of Sichuan University (SCU), China Center for South Asian Studies and the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, Sun said the difficulties witnessed in bilateral ties since 2020 had been “unseen for many years”. The two countries should seek a “fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution” to the LAC standoff through dialogue, he said. “We hope that the Indian side will meet us halfway to move the situation towards stability and shift it from urgent dispute settlement to regular management and control, so as to jointly safeguard the peace and tranquillity of the border area,” he added. Sun contended it is important for India and China to cooperate to counter turbulence and change on the global stage, the Covid-19 pandemic, sluggish economic recovery and the sudden changes in Afghanistan. “The current status of bilateral relations [is] obviously not in the fundamental interest of either side. Many far-sighted people from both countries have advocated that China and India should improve their relations, and bring...relations back on track,” he said. In an apparent jibe at groupings such as the Quad and AUKUS, Sun said some countries with a Cold War mentality were seeking “closed and exclusive ‘small cliques’ with the aim of containing a third party, stoking bloc confrontation and geopolitical games”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-says-china-s-provocative-behaviour-on-lac-disrupted-normal-ties-101632494108148.html

24-09-2021||India||MoD inks ₹22,000-cr deal with Airbus for 56 C-295 planes||The defence ministry on Friday announced that it has signed a ₹22,000-crore contract with Airbus Defence and Space for 56 C-295 medium transport aircraft to modernise the Indian Air Force’s transport fleet, with the development coming a fortnight after India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) cleared the purchase to give a push to the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India campaign). The C-295s will replace the IAF’s fleet of ageing Avro-748 planes that entered service in the early 1960s. Airbus Defence and Space and Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) will jointly execute the programme under which Airbus will deliver the first 16 aircraft in flyaway condition from Spain while TASL will assemble the rest in India. IAF will become the 35th C-295 operator worldwide. “The aircraft is capable of operating from semi-prepared strips and has a rear ramp door for quick reaction and para-dropping of troops and cargo. It will give a major boost to the tactical airlift capability of IAF, especially in the northern and north-eastern sectors and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,” the defence ministry said in a statement. The C-295 can carry up to nine tonnes of payload or 71 personnel (or 50 paratroopers) and has a maximum speed of 480 kmph. It has a light footprint and can operate from short or unprepared airstrips. The Avro replacement project was in the works for almost a decade. The defence acquisition council --- India’s apex defence procurement body --- accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) to replace the Avro planes with 56 new aircraft in 2012. Under India’s defence procurement rules, AoN by the council is the first step towards buying military hardware. “The C-295 is a damn good aircraft. I hope we start manufacturing it in India soon to boost Atmanirbhar Bharat. The Avro was overdue for replacement,” said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal PV Naik (retd). The first 16 aircraft will be delivered to IAF in flyaway condition between September 2023 and September 2025, while the remaining 40 will be inducted by September 2031. Airbus Defence and Space and TASL are yet to announce where the aircraft will be assembled in India. “More than 100 locations across the country have been looked at and evaluated over the years. We have looked at aspects such as length of the airstrip, availability of infrastructure, social indicators and weather. A decision has not yet been made,” TASL CEO Sukaran Singh said at a media briefing after the contract was signed. The final assembly line in India will have a capacity of 12 aircraft per year. After the contract has been fully executed, subsequent aircraft manufactured in India can be exported to countries cleared by the government, the defence ministry said in its statement. Export opportunities could be there, but the current priority is to execute the project to the satisfaction of IAF, said Jean-Brice Dumont, executive vice president, military aircraft, Airbus Defence and Space. “Export potential is there, but we don’t want to divert attention from this project (for 56 C-295s),” Dumont said. The project is expected to boost India’s aerospace ecosystem and generate 15,000 skilled and 10,000 indirect jobs in the country. “It is the first ‘Make in India’ aerospace programme in the private sector involving the full development of a complete industrial ecosystem; from the manufacture to assembly, test and qualification, to delivery and maintenance of the complete lifecycle of the aircraft,” Airbus Defence and Space and TASL said in a joint release. This is the first time that an Indian private company will be manufacturing a military aircraft in India. “This endeavour demonstrates TASL’s capabilities as a defence manufacturer to build globally competitive complex platforms in India,” Singh said. While the C-295s are meant to replace the Avro-748 planes, the new aircraft will also be suitable for demanding roles that the AN-32 currently undertakes. The contract will also have an offset clause. India’s offset policy stipulates that in all big-ticket capital purchases, the foreign vendor has to invest at least 30% of the value of the purchase in the country to boost indigenous capabilities. Airbus Defence and Space will discharge its offset obligations through direct purchase of eligible products and services from Indian offset partners, officials said. “The clearance of the joint project between Airbus Defence and Tata Advanced Systems is a great step forward in the opening up of aviation and avionics projects in India…It will create a domestic supply chain capability to international standards, which has never been undertaken before,” Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mod-inks-rs-22-000-cr-deal-with-airbus-for-56-c-295-planes-101632492187606.html

They are doing hooliganism every day. They are bombing their own houses and saying they are being attacked. Who will attack you? We feel embarrassed by even touching you.

Such deaths are always unfortunate. They came with the body near my house. Several people were killed in Assam over NRC. Don't you have any shame? There is no law in BJP's rule,” the TMC supremo was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.BJP's newly appointed state chief Sukanta Majumder said earlier in the day the Kolkata Police had registered a ‘suo moto’ case against him and other party leaders, including Tibrewal, in connection with protests with the body of a BJP leader near chief minister Mamata Banerjee's residence in the city.BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra, who took part in a campaign during the day for Tibrewal, said the "violence unleashed in the aftermath of elections in West Bengal has led to a humanitarian crisis" in the state. He said members of his party should be lauded for putting up a "valiant fight against the goons of the ruling TMC".Banerjee said, “The BJP is insanely violent, cruel and murderous.

24-09-2021||India||Malayalam teacher from UP trains migrant students in local language amid pandemic woes||The local language being a huge impediment for children of migrant labourers in pursuing their education in Kerala, it took a Malayalam teacher from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh to help them to bridge the gap. Arshi Salim (21), the daughter of a wood work designer, has been teaching 40 children belonging to other states at a centre started by the Samagra Siksha Kerala (SSK) during the Covid-19 pandemic in Kothamangalam in Ernakulam district.Online classes were alien to these children when their very existence was in question due to pandemic-induced recession and job losses of their parents. When the SSK started 40 such centres to help children of migrant workers in Ernakulam, Arshi Salim chipped in. As a daughter of a migrant worker, she understood their pain and agony more than anyone else.“My father came to Kerala when I was 9 years old. Enrolled in a local school I was a mute spectator as the medium of instruction was Malayalam. One day, I mustered enough courage and approached the Malayalam teacher with a strange request-- I wanted to speak like a Malayali. The teacher was so moved that she started teaching me well,” she said. She got a distinction in both Malayalam papers in her Class X Board examination.She is the eldest daughter of M Salim who has four children. “Life was really tough in the initial days of the pandemic. My father even thought of going back. But many people helped us and the SSK selected me as an educational volunteer to teach migrant children,” she said adding she was really happy when she got her first salary of ₹6,000. She is pursuing a computer course now after completing her Plus 2 in humanities with distinction. Not a trained teacher, she imparts basic lessons in all subjects other than Mathematics.“Malayalam is a beautiful language very close to Sanskrit but some words are really tongue-twisting. But once you learn it the flow will come naturally. Now I read Malayalam novels and poems,” she said adding that her first priority is to help ease the burden of her father after assuming a permanent job. Now most of her students are from the north-eastern states. She hopes to pursue her studies after her siblings get basic education and her role models are Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi and former President A P J Abdul Kalam.“For us, it is easy to connect. Her flow in three languages (Hindi, English and Malayalam) bowled us over,” said Biman Sarkar, a class 8 student belonging to Manipur. “A hard working girl she handles children well. She takes teaching as a passion,” said co-ordinator of the SSK Siju Jacob.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malayalam-teacher-from-up-trains-migrant-students-in-local-language-amid-pandemic-woes-101632488167110.html

Stating discussions were held for four months and there was agreement on a peaceful eviction of encroachers, Sarma asked who could have instigated the violence.He said 11 policemen were injured in the clashes that took place at Sipajhar in Darrang district, adding a judicial enquiry would be held into the incident.A 12-hour bandh was called on Friday by various organisations to protest the death of two persons in police firing a day ago.Sarma said the eviction drive was initiated on an agreed principle -- that landless people will be provided two acres each as per land policy. “We expected no resistance, but about 10,000 people gheraoed the Assam Police, used violence. It was then that police retaliated,” Sarma was quoted as saying,#WATCH | You cannot demean state govt with one video...Since 1983 that area is known for killings...

24-09-2021||India||Ram, Krishna, Shiva were ancestors of Indian Muslims, says Yogi govt minister||Uttar Pradesh minister Anand Swaroop Shukla has said that Muslims in India should bow to Indian culture and Ram, Krishna, and Shiva were the ancestors of Indian Muslims. The minister of state for parliamentary affairs also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have defeated the mindset which intended to create an Islamic State in the country by raising the flag of Hindutva and “Indian culture”, news agency PTI reported.The minister's remarks come days after controversial posters were put up in Sambhal calling Sambhal the land of ghazis, ahead of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi's meeting earlier this week. The minister said this was an outcome of the Samajwadi Party supporting Islamic terrorists. He also referred to Samajwadi Party MP Shaifur Rehman Barq's statement supporting the Taliban. In August, Shafiqur Rehman Barq was booked for sedition as he defended the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and equated it with India's freedom struggle.There are still people with Islamic mentality and they are stupid as their ancestors became Muslims out of fear, Shukla said adding that this kind of thinking cannot flourish under the Modi and Adityanath governments.“The ancestors of the Muslims of India are lord Ram, Krishna and Shankar (Shiva). They do not need to see the land of Kaaba. These people should bow to the land and culture of India," the UP minister said. “After Syria and Afghanistan, some people from different countries want to make the world an Islamic State. Some in India have this mindset too. But, the Modi and Adityanath governments at the Centre and state have raised the flag of Hindutva and Indian culture in the country and defeated this mindset,” Shukla said. (With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-krishna-shiva-were-ancestors-of-indian-muslims-says-yogi-govt-minister-101632483370806.html

The meeting is being held days after Soren on September 7 wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking an appointment for the delegation over the issue. People aware of the matter said the Prime Minister’s Office instead suggested a meeting with Shah as census comes under his ministry’s preview.“The meeting has been fixed at 4 pm at home minister Amit Shah’s residence on Sunday.

There should be discussions and there should be no obstruction or ruckus in the House,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.This is the first time Birla addressed the joint session of the two Houses of a legislature.It is our duty to have extensive discussions on the laws we form, there should be more active participation of MLAs so that no questions could be raised on the laws that are formed: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla at Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru, KarnatakaThe Congress boycotted Birla’s address to the joint sitting held on the last day of the ongoing monsoon session, contending that it would set a “wrong precedent”. Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah said the Congress had taken a decision to boycott the joint session as "the BJP government is trying to create a new precedent in Karnataka Legislative Assembly. It has never happened before”.Also read | Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar reach K'taka House in carts to protest fuel pricesBirla further said it was our duty to have extensive discussions on the laws being framed with more active participation of MLAs so that no questions could be raised later.“When the Constitution was drafted, the sentiment was to make our legislature more aware, dutiful, honest and responsible so that a path could be paved for the social and economic betterment of people,” he added.Birla's comments came in the wake of repeated disruptions of the recently concluded Parliament session when a number of bills were passed with minimal discussions on the same amid chaos. Former chief minister BS Yediyurappa was named the best legislator of the year 2020-21 during the day.

The system is likely to intensify further into a depression by Friday night and bring widespread and heavy rain to parts of east and central India and then move up to Gujarat. This is the second depression of the season and the second also in September since no depressions formed between June and August.Normally 5 to 6 depressions form during the monsoon season bringing extensive rainfall to central and west India. Another cyclonic circulation is expected to form around September 28 which will again bring a fresh spell of rain to east and central India, according to forecasts by India Meteorological Department’s Regional Specialized Centre for Tropical Cyclones.There is only a 2 per cent deficiency in monsoon rain since June 1 with 0 per cent excess over central India; 4 per cent deficiency over northwest India; 9 per cent excess over peninsular India and 11 per cent deficiency over east and northeast India according to the IMD. The deficiency at the end of August was 9 per cent. The IMD in its forecast on September 1 said owing to above normal rains in September, the overall monsoon rain this year may be in the “lower end of normal category.” The weather department considers 96 per cent to 104 per cent of the long-period average to be in the “normal” category. The long period average is considered for the period of 1961 to 2010 period and is 88 cm. But considering that widespread rains are likely to continue till the end of the month, total monsoon rainfall may increase further.A well-marked low-pressure area formed over the east-central Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood on Friday morning and is very likely to become more intense during the next 12 hours. It is likely to move west-northwest wards towards the Odisha coast during the next 48 hours. A cyclonic circulation is also lying over northeast Madhya Pradesh and adjoining south Uttar Pradesh and a cyclonic circulation is lying over Saurashtra and neighbourhood. A number of systems are forming over the Western Pacific. The remnants of these systems are moving towards the Bay of Bengal leading to the formation of cyclonic circulations and low-pressure areas here.“A well-marked low-pressure area has already developed over east-central Bay of Bengal (BoB) which is likely to become a depression in the next 12 hours. When it crosses the Odisha coast around Sunday, very heavy rain is expected there and over Chhattisgarh and MP also. Another cyclonic circulation is expected to form around September 28. This is mainly associated with the tropical storm which has just crossed Vietnam. The remnants of the system are moving towards BoB. The favourable position of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) in the east of the Indian Ocean is supporting convective activity and cloud formation over the Bay of Bengal. The remnants from the South China Sea are also moving towards the Bay of Bengal,” explained Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD.“We can expect widespread rain in the next few days over Odisha, north Andhra Pradesh, Vidarbha, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh followed by Gujarat,” said M Mohapatra, director general of IMD.The extended range model guidance of IMD is indicating widespread rain over the country till October 7 and patchy rain till October 14. The monsoon is normally expected to commence withdrawal from northwest India from September 16. It is 8 days late already.“There is no chance of monsoon withdrawal for another week. After this depression moves away, remnants from the Gulf of Thailand may lead to the formation of another low this month. Patchy rain will continue over northwest India including Delhi/NCR. Monsoon may finish with normal rainfall around 99 per cent of LPA,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology at Skymet Weather. Two depressions and two low-pressure areas formed in September so far as well as more than two cyclonic circulations leading to 30.9 per cent excess rains only in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/depression-likely-over-east-central-bay-of-bengal-may-intensify-monsoon-101632480727680.html

SDRF is also looking for bodies of an elderly brother-sister duo from Kanpur who allegedly died by suicide by jumping into the Ganga in Devprayag area of Tehri Garhwal district, 110 km away from Dehradun. According to SDRF personnel, the four tourists hailed from Auraiya district of Uttar Pradesh and were going to the popular tourist spot of Harshil Valley from Bhatwari on Thursday night. “The incident happened around 10 pm and the SDRF base in Bhatwari was informed about it at the same time. While heading towards Harshil, the one driving the car, lost control over it and it fell into the gorge adjacent to the road after breaking the parapet,” said SDRF media in-charge Lalita Negi. She informed that one of the four tourists all aged 28-34, fell out of the car before it fell into the gorge. “He informed the locals about the accident. The locals soon went to the spot to check and then informed the SDRF which rushed to the spot to initiate a search and rescue operation. Braving bad weather and darkness, the team went down and recovered the body of one of the four men who died on the spot and rescued the remaining two who had sustained injuries,” said Negi. She informed that the injured are receiving treatment in the nearby hospital of Bhatwari while the body has been sent for post-mortem examination. According to the police, the deceased identified as Arvind, 65 and Suman, 62, hailing from Kanpur, had come to Devprayag on September 20 and booked a hotel room while informing the hotel manager that they would go to visit Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines. “After staying for a couple of days there, they went near the Ganga ghat on September 22 afternoon to perform some rituals. At around 6 in the evening, both of them went near a secluded Ganga ghat but didn’t return for an hour even after dark. It was after that the priests went to check on them only to find their footwear at the ghat with both missing. They then informed the police which tried to find their bodies in the river but failed,” said Constable Ravinder Chauhan who was among the police officers who reached the spot. Chauhan added, “Police are suspecting them to have died by suicide by jumping into the Ganga. However, no suicide note was found from the spot nor from their hotel room. A search is on to find their bodies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-tourist-killed-3-others-injured-as-car-falls-into-gorge-in-uttarkashi-101632479705827.html

No.1416/2020 filed by Kush KalraVs. UoI& Others, the Union Public Service Commission has decided to open the online portal of application on its website (upsconline.nic.in) for this Examination to enable the unmarried women candidates ONLY by issuing a corrigendum to the Notice No. 10/2021-NDA-II, which was published on 09/06/2021,” UPSC said in a statement.The corrigendum can be accessed on the UPSC’s website and the application window will remain open for women candidates from September 24 to October 8, the commission said.This comes after the Supreme Court on Wednesday stressed that it “cannot belie the aspirations of young girls” as it rejected the Centre’s request to delay the first-ever examination for women candidates for their entry into the NDA. The top court also directed that they shall be allowed to sit for the upcoming exam on November 14.Only male candidates who have cleared Class 12 level or its equivalent, and are in the age group of 16-and-a-half and 19 are eligible to apply under the current eligibility criteria. Those who clear the NDA exam are called for interview by the Service Selection Board (SSB), and following a medical exam, candidates are recruited in the army, navy, and air force wings of NDA, and for the INA course for pre-commission training.Also read | Why military has sought more time to induct women into NDAThe government on Monday said that women can sit for the entrance exam in April-May next year and join the academy in January 2023. But the Supreme Court said there cannot be a request from the authorities to make the aspiring women skip the upcoming exam in November. “What would effectively mean by the submission of the armed forces is – No jam today, jam tomorrow!” a bench of justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and justice BR Gavai said. “It will be difficult for us to accept that position, the aspirations of women having been arisen in view of the order, albeit subject to the final outcome of the petition. We would thus not like to effectively vacate the order passed,” the bench said in its order.The bench directed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to issue a revised notification for the entrance exam for NDA after consultation with the ministry of defence (MoD).Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, who was representing the Centre, said that women candidates will have to skip the exam in November in view of the sweeping changes that have to be brought about before women cadets are inducted and start their training at the joint defence service training institute of the Indian armed forces.However, the bench said “armed forces have been in far more difficult and tight situations…” “It is not very easy but it is not that complex as it is being projected. Armed forces deal with all kinds of emergency situations and they are the best people to handle such situations. What answers do we have for women who are now ready to take exams? Will we say you try your luck sometime in future?

24-09-2021||India||Vehicles in India may soon be powered by flex-engines. All you need to know||Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Friday said that he will be issuing an order in the next three to four months, mandating all auto manufacturers to power their vehicles with flex engines, which can run on more than one fuel. The statement comes about a month after Gadkari said that the central government will soon make it mandatory for auto manufacturers to offer vehicles running 100 per cent on bio-fuels.Nitin Gadkari has been advocating for the use of alternative energy sources and bio-fuels to bring down the environmental impact left behind by the Indian auto industry. Not only is alternative fuel less polluting and saves forex, but it is also cost-effective for customers, the minister said. Pointing out that a litre of bioethanol costs ₹65 as against ₹110 paid for petrol, Gadkari said last month, “We are committed to delivering vehicles with flex engine norms. We have taken a decision, we will make it mandatory by which there will be a flex-engine.” He added that state-run oil marketing companies have already been ordered to offer bio-fuels at the same facilities as the ones selling petrol and diesel.What are flex engines?Flex engines power what are colloquially known as flexible-fuel vehicles or flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs). These are vehicles running on alternative fuel, equipped with an internal combustion engine that is designed to run on more than one fuel. These FFVs usually run on gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel; however, both fuels are stored in a common tank. The resulting blend is burnt in the combustion chamber, generating power for the vehicle.Flex-fuel vehicles are different from bi-fuel vehicles, which use two fuels stored in separate tanks – and as such, might prove to be costlier than its alternative. The ethanol flexible-fuel vehicle is the most common form of commercially available flex engine in the global market. Most of these FFVs in Western countries run on E85, a blend of 85 per cent anhydrous ethanol and 15 per cent gasoline.Why could flex engines be essential for India?According to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, customers will be provided a choice between using conventional petrol-powered engines and those running on bioethanol. He said a switch to the alternative is essential for the country because of the surplus production of crops like rice, maize, corn, and sugar, from which bioethanol is made. In many of these crops, the minimum support price (MSP) offered to the farmers is higher than the commercial price or the one in international prices, making it essential for diverting the harvest for the overall betterment of the country.Earlier this month, Gadkari also said that the central government is mulling over the concept of an ‘electric highway’, to be built between the national capital of Delhi and Jaipur in Rajasthan. With the world moving on from conventional fuels to alternative sources of energy for powering transport, these options are currently among the most popular choices for powering motors of propulsion in vehicles. If the proposed electric highway comes through, it will see vehicles powered by electricity ply on the stretch – the first of these will be between Delhi to Jaipur; and later, if everything goes well, the Delhi-Mumbai stretch may see another of these electric highways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vehicles-in-india-may-soon-be-powered-by-flex-engines-all-you-need-to-know-101632468874033.html

Among 173, 120 died in elephant attacks. As many as 64 elephants also died over the last decade in the state. Wildlife experts say the straying of elephants into human habitations can be contained by protecting animal corridors. They say one of the main reasons for elephant attacks in Idukki is encroachment along Anamalai-Periyar Tiger Reserve’s elephant corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elephant-tramples-woman-to-death-in-kerala-101632469266049.html

Giri was also the mahant (chief priest) of the Bade Hanuman Temple in Prayagraj.A CBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Delhi unit of the federal agency’s special crime branch registered the case as soon as it took over the probe following a Central government notification in this regard. Officials familiar with the matter said CBI will recreate the crime scene and question people who worked closely with the seer.On Thursday, a five-member CBI team visited Prayagraj to collect the First Information Report and other details related to the case from an 18-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the state police that was earlier constituted to probe the death.The Uttar Pradesh government late on Wednesday night recommended a CBI probe into the death on the directions of chief minister Yogi Adityanath.The SIT was investigating the allegations of harassment the seer made in his purported suicide note, naming his disciples Anand Giri, Aadya Tiwari, and the latte’s son, Sandeep Tiwari. The three have been arrested in the case.Rohit Kumar Singh contributed to this story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-takes-over-probe-into-mahant-narendra-giri-s-death-101632463386467.html
24-09-2021||India||After 19 days, diesel becomes costlier amid surge in international oil prices||State-run fuel retailers on Friday raised diesel rates by 20 paise a litre, the first price hike after 19 days of pause as international crude oil prices surged 6.96 per cent at $77.25 a barrel since September 5 on rising demand. Diesel price, which had softened to ₹88.62 per litre three weeks ago after climbing to record ₹89.87 a litre in mid-July, has been priced at ₹88.82 on Friday in Delhi. Pump prices of petrol in the national capital, however, remained unchanged at ₹101.19 since September 5.Retail prices of petrol and diesel are under pressure due to rising international oil rates and auto fuel rates may see a northward movement, two executives working in different oil companies said, requesting anonymity. Benchmark Brent crude continued an upward movement in intraday trade on Friday with a gain of 0.14 per cent at $77.36 a barrel. On Monday, HT reported that fuel retailers would start raising rates soon.As international oil prices dropped below $70 a barrel in mid-August, fuel retailers had reduced diesel rates by 20 paise per litre on August 18 after an all-time high for 34 days. Petrol prices were also reduced by 20 paise a litre on August 22, after it maintained a record of ₹101.84 per litre in Delhi for 36 days. Subsequently, petrol and diesel had become cheaper in small doses by 65 paise a litre and ₹1.25 per litre, respectively. After that, the prices of the two fuels remained frozen since September 5. According to the people mentioned above, international crude oil prices rose on subdued US oil production in view of the Ida hurricane which tore through the Gulf of Mexico, and robust demand on optimism about global economic growth. “Companies were holding prices, and expecting some tax relief from the government in terms of GST [Goods and Services Tax] relief, but the proposal to include petroleum products in GST was declined in the GST Council meeting on Friday, forcing companies to think about raising fuel rates,” one of the people mentioned above said. International oil rates, which are often volatile, directly influence pump prices of petrol and diesel in India. Heavy loads of central and state taxes are also responsible for astronomically high rates of auto fuels. Throughout 2020, as global crude prices plunged (below $20 a barrel in April last year), the central government raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit as their revenues were hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the central and state levies on petrol and diesel are over 50 per cent of their retail prices. According to official data, the petroleum sector contributed ₹371,726 crore central excise revenue in 2020-21, and ₹202,937 crore state levies or value-added tax (VAT). Due to the high incidence of taxes and a spike in international oil prices, petrol and diesel rates had soared to a record ₹101.84 per litre and ₹89.87, respectively, in mid-July this year. While prices softened a bit in mid-August, a further spike in auto fuel rates is expected as international crude prices are again moving north and the value of the rupee is depreciating against the dollar. India imports more than 80 per cent crude oil it processes and pays in dollars. In Delhi, central levies account for over 32.5 per cent of petrol’s price, and state taxes (VAT) 23.07 per cent. On diesel, the central excise is over 35.8 per cent while VAT is more than 14.6 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-19-days-pause-diesel-becomes-costlier-amid-surge-in-international-oil-prices-101632462786686.html

According to reports, experts of the government bodies did not find enough evidence of a potential therapeutic effect of the widely used medicines against coronavirus.A study by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had earlier said the antiparasitic medicine Ivermectin did not reduce the viral load or duration of symptoms in patients with Covid-19 even at higher doses. This was found in a randomised controlled trial on 157 patients admitted with mild to moderate disease at the premier hospital during the first surge of infections between July and September last year.Also read | Govt drops Ivermectin, HCQ and favipiravir from Covid-19 treatment listA report in The Hindu Business Line said Hydroxychloroquine was dropped because of no mortality benefit, increased risk of address drug effect (ADE) when co-administered with Azithromycin.Studies also found there was no clarity on mortality benefit, no effect on length of stay and clinical recovery in case of Ivermectin.The World Health Organisation had warned against use of Ivermectin a day after Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane recommended the medicine for all adult residents of the coastal state to fight the deadly virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-removes-ivermectin-hcq-from-revised-guidelines-on-covid-19-treatment-101632461755113.html

24-09-2021||India||Govt reduces patent fees for educational institutions by 80 percent||The central government introduced Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2021 on Tuesday which reduced the fee for patent filing and prosecution for educational institutions by 80 percent. The move has been taken to strengthen innovation and creativity in the knowledge economy. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry in a press release on Thursday said, “In order to create a conducive environment for innovation, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade has been working towards promoting greater collaboration between industry and academia. This can be achieved by facilitating commercialization of research undertaken in educational institutions.”The high patenting fee was a hindrance for educational institutions in getting newer research and technologies patented and hence worked as a disincentive for the development of newer technologies, the ministry noted. While applying for patents, innovators had to apply for these in the name of institutions that were required to pay exorbitant patenting fees. However, now the official fees payable by them in reference to the Patents Rules, 2003, have been reduced through the Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2021. In addition, the government amended the patent rules in 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2020 to remove procedural inconsistencies and unnecessary steps in the processing of patent applications thereby. These have helped expedite the grant, registration and final disposal process, and make these more efficient, user-friendly, and compatible for e-transactions. The department has taken key initiatives in this regard. These include augmentation of manpower by recruiting new examiners; making the patenting process completely online; hearing of patenting cases through video-conferencing for speedy and contact-less proceedings; dynamic redesigning of the website and real-time based hassle-free dissemination of IP information to stakeholders. In addition, the mechanism of lodging feedback and complaints regarding the functioning of IP offices has been set up on the IPO website. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade in collaboration with the office of Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trade Marks (CGPDTM) is regularly engaged in the dissemination of information to IP stakeholders through awareness activities in IPR which are conducted for schools, universities, industries, legal and enforcement agencies and other stakeholders. The ministry also noted that these reforms have helped decrease the time taken for the examination of patents, and it is expected that the time for final disposal of patents, which has already been reduced to an average of 48 months at present as compared to a few years earlier, will be reduced further to an average of 24-30 months by the end of 2021.“An Expedited Examination System has been introduced wherein an application for grant of patent is being decided within one year of filing such request under Expedited Examination as compared to the period of few years required in case of normal examination route,” the ministry notified in the press release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-reduces-patent-fees-for-educational-institutions-by-80-percent-101632461285956.html
24-09-2021||India||Indian Army accelerates historic overhaul to counter China||India’s long-delayed plans to overhaul its military are getting a new life as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government moves closer to the US and its allies, which are strengthening defense cooperation against China. Modi, who will attend a meeting of Quad leaders at the White House Friday along with Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga, is taking steps to undertake the biggest reorganization of India’s military since independence in 1947. The moves to integrate the army, air force, and navy – which now operate with little coordination – come as the US and UK work with Australia to put more nuclear-powered submarines in Asia-Pacific waters.Last month, a newly created Department of Military Affairs ordered the Indian Army unit overseeing the Pakistan border to draw up a plan for integrating with the navy and air force, according to officials aware of the developments. That model will be replicated throughout the country so the entire military is under a new operating structure by 2024, said the officials, who asked not to be identified due to rules for speaking to the media. A more unified Indian armed forces would make it easier for the country to link up with militaries from the US and its allies in the event of a conflict. A key aspect of the AUKUS partnership announced last week by the US, Australia, and the UK involves interoperability in a range of defense areas – something India currently lacks within its own forces.“The Quad partners have previously found that they can only exercise with one Indian service at a time -- for example, the navy but no air force, or air force but not navy,” said David Brewster, a senior research fellow at the National Security College of the Australian National University who wrote the book “India as an Asia Pacific Power.” “This severely hampers cooperation when many if not most operations will be joint.”On Thursday in the US, Modi met separately with Morrison, Suga, and US Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the Quad meeting at the White House. In a tweet, his office noted India’s “shared values” with the US and said cooperation was “gradually increasing.”Over the decades, Indian leaders kept military command and control divided to avoid coups that were once common in the neighborhood. While bureaucrats and military officials have resisted proposals for unification that have been around since the 1990s, mostly due to turf wars, the current structure is proving a disadvantage in countering China, which moved to a similar model as the US and Australia in 2016.“The modernization of the Indian military is underway to meet the regional challenges and technological changes,” A. Bharat Bhushan Babu, a Defense Ministry spokesperson, said without providing more details on the plan. The Indian Navy, Army, and Air Force didn’t comment immediately.The reorganization would create at least four theater commands: One in the west looking at Pakistan, another in the east focused on China, a maritime command for the Indian Ocean region, and an air defense command, the officials said. The restive northern section of Jammu and Kashmir will remain untouched for now, they added.The move is designed to allow India’s military to operate seamlessly across land, sea, and air. The theater commands would pool warships, patrol craft, soldiers, and fighter jets, and work with other missile and gun regiments that have a network of ground radars to handle threats along its disputed borders with China and Pakistan, the officials said.While China has the largest standing army in the world, with more than 2.1 million troops, India is second with a bloated ground force of 1.2 million regular soldiers and 960,000 reserves whose pay and pensions absorb most of the defense budget. The Indian Army estimates that organizing along theaters will yield economies of scale, cutting expenditure by about one-third while concentrating power in a single office: the Chairman of the Joint Staff Committee.“India’s siloed approach to training, planning, and operations created a dissonance when working with other more ‘modern’ militaries,” said Anit Mukherjee, associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “Over the last five years, the challenges to the Indian military have grown manifold and it is an open question whether they have been able to match those challenges.”The Indian Air Force in particular has opposed the concept of multiple theaters, arguing that its scarce resources will be spread too thin if they aren’t able to respond to threats in different parts of the country, officials said.The three services still don’t have a common secure communication network, which was evident in 2019 when Indian Air Force jets fired missiles into Pakistan to destroy an alleged terror training camp in response to a suicide attack in Jammu and Kashmir that left 40 soldiers dead. Indian Army units were put on alert but they weren’t told why or what to expect, according to a senior officer who asked not to be identified. While India’s military answers to elected representatives, a tradition of political non-interference has also allowed feuds between the three main services to flourish. That has also strengthened the army, which commands more than 60% of total military spending, leading to a greater focus on land borders over building the capacity to become a force in Indo-Pacific waters.  “The problem with India’s reorganization so far is the tendency to reinforce army dominance of the defense force and reinforce a narrow focus on continental defense,” said Brewster from the Australian National University. “This may mean a reduced capability of Indian armed forces to project power around the Indo-Pacific region in cooperation with the Quad partners.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-accelerates-historic-overhaul-to-counter-china-101632459595675.html

The vaccination certificates will only be admissible if the individual has been doubly vaccinated, and RT-PCR tests cannot be more than three days old, he cautioned.“Devotees coming with online special entry tickets or slotted sarva darshan (SSD) tokens (issued to pilgrims to have free darshan of Lord) should possess either 2-dose vaccination certificate or come with Covid-19 negative test report, which they have taken three days before reporting on the allotted day of the darshan,” Reddy said.The Tirumala temple remained open throughout the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic but entry was restricted to only those who purchased tickets worth ₹300 for darshan and for VIPs. The SSD, or free darshans, was re-started from September 9, allowing only 2,000 devotees from the Chittoor district.Tickets for free darshan were being issued from the token counter at Alipiri, the foothills of Tirumala, but the administration pivoted to an online ticketing system fearing crowds near the counter might lead to a spread of Covid-19.Andhra Pradesh reported 1,171 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the total tally of cases to 2,043,244. To date, 14,108 fatalities have been recorded in the state, with 11 deaths being reported in the last 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirumala-tirupati-devasthanams-makes-covid-vaccine-certificate-test-mandatory-for-devotees-101632459397121.html
24-09-2021||India||New Android malware steals mobile banking data, money. Here's how to identify||A new Android malware is increasingly being used by cybercriminals in their attempts to steal data and user information, especially mobile banking details. Alerting users about the new malware which is targeting users of Indian banks, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), a government cybersecurity agency, released a notification elaborating on the manner in which this malware functions. According to the agency, the new mobile banking Android malware is known as ‘Drinik’, which has already targeted customers of more than 27 public and private sector banks in India.The Drinik Android malware was, until about five years ago, used for stealing short message service (SMS) data. However, with the prevalence of SMS declining and the majority of user data moving to the internet, the Drinik malware was updated by cybercriminals to adjust to a more modern age. In its new, updated avatar – the Drinik Android malware has evolved into a banking Trojan virus.How does the Drinik malware work?Like most Trojan and phishing-related malware programmes, the Drinik virus, too, functions by displaying the user a fake banking screen (the ‘phishing’ screen) where the user is persuaded to enter sensitive banking information – which is then collected by the cybercriminals and used to accumulate data and money from the actual bank servers.The victim usually receives an SMS or an e-mail containing a link that redirects to the said phishing screen. This e-mail or SMS may look entirely official and the screen it redirects to may resemble a similar website of the Government of India (such as the website of the Income Tax department, for example), thus tricking the user to go forward with the next steps.According to the cybersecurity agency, the Android malware is currently masquerading as an Income Tax (I-T) department app. Whenever a user ends up installing it, the app asks them to grant necessary permissions to access SMS records, call logs, contacts, and the like.Now, even if the user does not enter any of the said on the phishing website, the same screen with the form is displayed in the Android app. This form includes entries for full name, PAN, Aadhaar number, address, date of birth (DoB), mobile number, email id.The form also asks users to enter financial details such as account number, IFSC code, CIF number, debit card number, expiry date, CVV, and PIN.Next, the Android malware, presenting itself as a government form, asks the user to proceed with the option of transferring a potential refund amount to their account. The moment the user enters the amount and clicks on ‘Transfer’, the application shows an error and demonstrates a fake update screen.During this process, the Trojan virus sends the user details to the hacker/cybercriminal, including all the SMS data, call logs, and banking details.How can you identify the Drinik malware?The agency also shared indicators of compromise (IOC) to better track down the malware.File Hashes:103824893e45fa2177e4a655c0c77d3b28ef632aeee467678b9ac2d73519b00b78745bddd887cb4895f06ab2369a8cce8cc1e2baeb758b7424b6e1c81333a239e60e4f966ee709de1c68bfb1b96a8cf700313e685c293615cf2e1f39fde7eddd04c3bf5dbb5a27d7364aec776c1d8b3bC2 servers:jsig.quicksytes[.]comc4.mypsx[.]netfcm.pointto[.]usrfb.serveexchange[.]comFile Type: .apk||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-android-malware-steals-mobile-banking-data-money-here-s-how-to-identify-101632452541225.html

On Tuesday, a local court fixed the date for framing of charges as September 24 after eight of the nine accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots case – which includes the former UP minister, ex-MLA Kadir Rana, and ex-MLA Maulana Jameel – appeared before it.The clashes between the Hindu and Muslim communities in the Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh in the fall of 2013 had resulted in more than 60 deaths and the displacement of over 40,000 people. The riot, which has been described as “the worst violence in Uttar Pradesh in recent history” also saw the Indian Army deployed in the state for the first time in two decades to bring the law and order situation under control.As many as 98 individual cases of riots have been decided so far; however, more than 1,100 people have been acquitted due to a lack of solid evidence. On Monday, a local court in Muzaffarnagar acquitted 20 more accused persons, noting that the prosecution had failed to provide incriminatory evidence against them. The prosecution, for its part, said that charges were filed against 21 persons under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by a special investigation team (SIT) probing the Muzaffarnagar riots case. The charge sheet related to the alleged burning down of several houses and instances of loot at the Kutbi village in the district during the riots. However, most of the accused were acquitted due to the lack of direct evidence linking them to the incident.According to reports, as many as 510 cases have been registered by the police so far in relation to the Muzaffarnagar riots, while 1,480 people have been arrested. The special investigation team probing the separate incidents has till now filed charge sheets in 175 individual cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muzaffarnagar-riots-charges-to-be-framed-against-ex-up-minister-9-others-101632442720833.html

Eyewitnesses claimed the two had an argument during which the man, in a fit of rage, took out a small knife from his pocket and stabbed her in the neck, they said.The accused then attempted suicide by slitting his throat. Passersby alerted the police and called an ambulance.The woman was taken to Chrompet government hospital where she succumbed to injuries while the accused was admitted to Chennai’s Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital for treatment.Police said the woman knew the man for the past two years but had been “ignoring him” off late. The victim’s body was later sent for post mortem.“She got acquainted with him two years ago during train journeys. They were not in the same college,” a senior police officer said, seeking anonymity.“...The accused is in a stable condition. We have booked him for murder (under Section 302 of IPC) and investigations are underway,” the officer added.The accused, police said, is a native of Nagapattinam district and an employeae at a private firm in Maraimalai Nagar.Condemning the incident, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam said incidents like these are “very distressing.” “Hearing the news of the student’s murder in broad daylight has caused great anguish… It is distressing that the rise in the incidents of murders has caused insecurity and apprehension among women,” he said.The incident brought back memories of similar horrifying cases for the locals.In 2019, a 27-year-old man attacked a woman with a machete at Chetpet station and then jumped in front of a moving train.In 2016, a 24-year-old techie was murdered by a youth at Nungambakkam station for allegedly rejecting his advances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20yrold-woman-stabbed-to-death-by-stalker-in-chennai-101632432181354.html

Let’s not set a new precedent, also there is no scope for it in the constitution,” Leader of Opposition in the assembly Siddaramaiah said on Thursday.Speaking to reporters he said, the Assembly Speaker however tried to give an explanation by stating that he had addressed Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh Assembly.The senior Congress leader cited the government and the Speaker not agreeing to their demand for extending the session, joint sitting not being discussed with the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council, no scope for it in the constitution, and it setting a new precedent, as the reasons for his party’s opposition.“We suggested that, as the invites have been sent out, let the address be held at the banquet hall at Vidhana Soudha and not in the assembly hall, and we too will attend. But the Assembly Speaker is not ready to agree to it. So we have made it clear to the Speaker that we will boycott,” he added.The Lok Sabha Speaker is scheduled to address the joint sitting of the state legislature at 2:30 PM on the topic “Democracy - Safeguarding Parliamentary Values.” Siddaramaiah in response to a question on the topic, asked “does it mean that democratic and parliamentary values have gone, as they are going to safeguard it?” State Congress President D K Shivakumar said the government was trying to create a “new history” in the historic Karnataka Legislative Assembly.He said the Lok Sabha Speaker’s address will set a wrong precedent and the Congress will not be a party for legislative assembly being used as a political platform. “We have decided to boycott in protest.” “There is no scope for such an address (by the Lok Sabha Speaker) inside the Assembly as per our parliamentary system and our business rules,” he said, adding that from the topic of the address it seems that the ruling dispensation has agreed that democracy and parliamentary values have deteriorated under their rule.Friday is the last day of the 10-day long monsoon session of the state legislature that began on September 13.Siddaramaiah also said the government is not agreeing to extend the session by at least a week, pointing out that both houses have met after six months and there are a lot of issues to be discussed.“At the BAC meeting last week I had asked for at least a four week session, but they said we will decide it in the next BAC. No BAC meeting was called this week, so I wrote a letter to him (Speaker) to at least extend the session by a week, he said- the government is not agreeing, what should I do? ,” he said.In the parliamentary system of governance, assembly and parliament is the only forum to raise issues, he said, adding, the Congress had agreed to opposition’s demand to extend the session while in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-boycott-lok-sabha-speaker-om-birla-s-address-in-k-taka-legislature-101632431881413.html

The admission came after B Siramulu, Karnataka’s minister for transport and Schedule Tribe in the Lower House of the state legislature said that those who died of Covid have been given ₹1 lakh. The Congress jeered the statement forcing health minister DK Shivakumar to give out the details of compensation.In in response, Sudhakar said that the money has been kept but there were “procedural delays” in disbursing them. Former chief minister BS Yediyurappa also had to clarify the issue and calm the rising tempers in the House. “By mistake Sriramulu has said that we have disbursed money but we (government) have not been able to do so. The money has been released but is yet to be distributed,” Yediyurappa said, much to the embarrassment of Sriramulu who, until that point, kept defending that the money had been distributed. Taking a dig at the government, Siddaramaiah, the former chief minister and Congress’ leader of the opposition said that the government had announced ₹300 crore for compensation but no money has been released so far. He said that only 24 persons who died due to oxygen shortage in Chamarajanagar district were paid ₹2 lakh each because of a court order. The admission by the government comes at a time when the death toll in Karnataka continues to rise on account of the lingering virus and the impending third wave of infections. A total of 37,683 persons have died due to Covid- 19 since March last year, including 15 on Thursday, according to the daily health bulletin of the state health department. The government has been under pressure for its handling--or mishandling--of the pandemic and the problems it caused due to unscheduled lockdowns, shortage of hospital beds and life saving medicines, oxygen and even space to bury those who died due to the spike in deaths in the months between April and July this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yet-to-release-compensation-to-families-of-covid-victims-karnataka-government-101632431761561.html

According to the police and locals, the godown was a transit goods depot and there were around 80 boxes of firecrackers stored inside at that time. The owner of the godown has been arrested as he had no permission to store firecrackers, police said. Officials suspect that the blast occurred outside the godown when the workers were unloading the boxes which may have contained crackers. Harish Pandey, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) on Thursday said that two persons have died, while one was critical and at least two are injured, but are out of danger. The persons who died have been identified as Manohar (28) from Thiruvanamalai in Tamil Nadu and Aslam Pasha (45) who worked in the adjoining puncture shop, Pandey said. The police have ruled out any gas cylinder explosion or short circuit which was being suspected earlier. “It is a box of crackers (that exploded) that either fell or was casually thrown on the ground which caused the blast,” Pandey said, adding that it was a “directional explosion” which meant that the people who were killed were near the boxes or directly in line of its impact. He added that there were three boxes which were being unloaded and one of them exploded, triggering the other two as well. Pandey also said that there were 78 boxes of crackers inside the shop which remained intact . The locality where the blast occurred is often bustling with workers, trucks and even children playing around since there is no real demarcation in Bengaluru between residential and commercial spaces. This particular depot or godown houses a family of four who reside right on top, including two young children, who were not hurt in the incident. “Our FSL (forensic sciences laboratories) officials have gone there, fire and police have also viisted the spot to determine what caused the incident and how it happened,” Araga Jnanendra, Karnataka minister for home affairs said. He added that it was a major accident as people were seriously injured and the impact has damaged walls of homes as well as vehicles. Congress MLA Zameer Ahmed Khan, who visited the spot on Thursday, announced to give ex-gratia of ₹2 lakh to the families of those who died from his own pocket. He urged the Basavaraj Bommai-led government to also extend monetary help and compensation to those who have died and were injured in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-killed-in-suspected-cracker-blast-at-new-tharagupet-in-bengaluru-101632431521584.html

Bommai, who is also the minister in-charge of Bengaluru portfolio, made the revelation while responding to query in the ongoing monsoon session of the Upper House of the state legislature. “I agree that the roads in Bengaluru are discussed no matter which government is in power. We elected representatives get a lot of criticism,” Bommai said. In his response, the chief minister acknowledged that out of the 11,285.05 kms of roads in the city, just 1,344.34 kms are motorable, admitting to the one of the biggest infrastructural challenges gnawing at India’s IT capital for perpetuity. Bommai said that he would conduct a road maintenance audit to monitor and check the money spent on roads (arterial and sub-arterial), estimates when it started and final cost, maintenance history, potholes and would seek responses from contractors, officials and every person involved in the works to keep a watch on the amount spent on these projects. “I will fix the responsibility on officers,” Bommai added PR Ramesh, the Congress MLC who sought the responses on road infrastructure from the government, on Thursday said that the officials and others involved were “looting public money”. ‘They are only earning money with no intention of doing good work,” he told Hindustan Times on Thursday. Though Bengaluru aspires to be a global city, its administrators including the government, have only focused on just over 800 square kms area, leaving most of its residents without basic amenities despite it being one of the revenue generators in the country. Successive governments have often fallen back on the same excuse of “developing city” as a way to circumvent taking responsibility for its apathy on providing motorable roads without potholes, slush, dust and no life-threatening stretches. Over the years, several persons have lost their lives as a result of the administration’s apathy. Bengaluru led the country in registering cases against civic authorities for causing death due to negligence in 2020,as per the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) latest report. Its 18 cases account for 85% of all such cases reported in the country. Mumbai and New Delhi accounted for the three other cases reported in this category, while all other major cities didn’t book any civic authorities for death due to negligence, Hindustan Times reported on September 15.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has 198 wards and councillors elected from each of them. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been in power in the corporation since 2010 till September 2020. There has been no elected council for over one year in Bengaluru, leaving officers in-charge of most of the public works without much accountability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-crore-spent-on-bengaluru-road-works-in-last-5-years-karnataka-cm-bommai-101632430981689.html

According to the police, four members of a family – a 51-year-old woman, her two daughters aged 34 and 31 and her 25-year-old son — were found hanging while the body of her nine-month-old grandson, suspected to have died of starvation, was found in the house in Byadarahalli on Friday night. Police suspect the family members died by suicide. A two-year-old girl was found lying unconscious beside the bodies. Police said during the initial investigation, husband of the 51-year-old woman and the head of the family who worked as small-time journalist, claimed he had left home on Friday following an argument. According to his statement, he was unhappy with the fact that both his daughters were not living with their in-laws and his son was in financial trouble. Police said the head of family his statement also said the argument and his leaving home could have led to the suicide. Police said they were in the process of closing the investigation, when they found three notes in separate rooms in the house, which had initially gone unnoticed. Police said the letters, allegedly written by the head of family’s three children, accused him of constantly harassing them. “We can’t share all the details, but the son’s letter claims that his father used to physically abuse his mother. He also alleged that he was forced to marry the daughter of a woman with whom his father had an illicit relationship,” said an officer from Bydarahalli. The officer added that the daughters have also made similar allegations in their notes and claimed they were unable to handle their father’s harassment and so decided to take the extreme step. Meanwhile, police said they have begun questioning the head of family based on the purported suicide notes. “We have also sent these letters for handwriting verification. Once we get these reports, will take further action,” the officer added. The two-year-old girl, who was found unconscious, is with the ghead of the family, police said, adding that they are yet to speak to her since she is in trauma. In another incident, a 12-year-old girl was found hanging at her house while her mother and eight-year-old younger sister were rescued by their neighbours at Dibbur village in Bengaluru Rural district on Wednesday, police said. According to the police, the woman’s husband had died due to Covid-19 two months ago and since then she was under depression due to financial crunch. Police said they suspect the woman convinced her daughters to hang themselves and attempted the same herself. While the elder daughter was found hanging in her house, police said the younger daughter raised an alarm and alerted their neighbours, who rescued them. Police said the woman is receiving treatment at a hospital. Further probe is on, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suicide-case-bengaluru-police-question-byadarahalli-man-after-five-of-family-found-dead-101632430741066.html

Speaking at a public meeting for the bypoll, Banerjee asked the people of the Bhabanipur assembly constituency in south Kolkata to cast their votes even if it rains on the day of polling. Heavy rain has been occurring in the state for the last four months, Banerjee said.“My party has the majority. There is no dearth of people who can become the chief minister. But if you want me to continue, bless me with your votes.... Even if cyclone or tornado comes, come and cast your vote,” she said addressing the gathering.“India starts from Bhabanipur as B stands for Bhabanipur, Bharat Mata and Bharat Varsh,” she added.Meanwhile, Union minister Puri – who went around Bhabanipur constituency for the second consecutive day, campaigning for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Priyanka Tibrewal, who is pitted against Mamata Banerjee – on Thursday interacted with voters at a ‘cha chakra’ (tea session) and urged them to vote for BJP to fight the “misrule of TMC government which has unleashed a terror psyche” in the constituency and elsewhere in Bengal.“Mamata Didi is urging everyone to vote for her to get her elected. She is scared to lose. She had been defeated in Nandigram (in the April-May state polls). She will concede defeat again,” he told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vote-for-tmc-even-if-cyclone-comes-mamata-banerjee-in-bhabanipur-hardeep-puri-says-didi-will-lose-bypoll-too-101632429780921.html
24-09-2021||India||2011 caste census data unusable: Centre to Supreme Court||The caste census conducted in 2011 is “unusable” for any official purpose on account of grave “inaccuracies” in its data, the Union government has told the Supreme Court, while adding it is also against collecting any information on castes or backward classes, other than Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), during the upcoming population census in 2022.Submitting its affidavit in the court, the Centre opposed the Maharashtra government’s plea to make the 2011 caste census public, underlining that the data is “fraught with mistakes and inaccuracies”, and has been hence kept under wraps.“Either due to the mistakes by the enumerators, inherent flaws in the manner of conducting census, and several such other factors, there is no reliable dependable caste-based census data available which can be the basis of any constitutional or statutory exercise like reservations in admissions, promotions or local body elections,” stated the affidavit filed before a bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar.Refusing to collect data on backward class of citizens (BCCs) during the upcoming census, the government maintained that this exercise is administratively complex, and against the policy decision of the government.It added that unlike the constitutional mandate for collection of census data on SCs and STs, there is no obligation to provide the census figures of OBCs/BCCs. The census data on SCs and STs are used for delimitation of electoral constituencies as well as for reservation of seats, as mandated under the Constitution.The case came up before the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar, on Thursday. It was adjourned by four weeks as the state government sought time to reply to the Centre’s submissions.The 2011 caste census, collected during the United Progressive Alliance government, was the first caste-based census since the 1931 census of India. The first census was conducted in 1881, and since then, has been held every 10 years. While the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) was last conducted in 2011, the 2021 census was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and it is now expected to take place in February 2022.On August 23, an 11-member delegation led by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand caste-wise enumeration of OBCs in the 2021 census. Most advocates say that not knowing the numbers of the various OBC communities prevents the creation of targeted interventions for their welfare.However, in July, Nityanand Rai, the minister of state for home affairs, stated in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha that the Union government has decided as a matter of policy not to enumerate caste-wise populations other than SCs and STs in the census.Meanwhile, the affidavit, filed through the ministry of social justice and empowerment in the top court, pointed out that the socio-economic data in the 2011 census was used by the government to identify the poor households and in implementation of the anti-poverty programmes, but the caste data was kept confidentially with the office of the registrar general of India “primarily for the technical flaws that makes it unusable”.It added that the Union Cabinet also set up a committee in July 2015 under the chairmanship of then NITI Ayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya but the committee never took off, “as a result no action has been taken on the data in the past five years”.The Centre was responding to a petition by the Maharashtra government, which has asked for the release of the 2011 caste census data for implementing 27% reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) announced under the Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act.On March 4, the Supreme Court held that the Maharashtra government cannot implement the 27% OBC quota to the elections of these local bodies since the state did not have any empirical data. The Court further held that the cumulative reservation in these local bodies (for SC/ST/OBC) should not exceed 50% cap as mandated by the Supreme Court in its landmark judgment of Indra Sawhney in 1992.Citing this judgment, the Maharashtra government filed a fresh petition in the top court, arguing that without the Central census data, the proportional representation of OBCs, rural backward BCCs cannot be done in the elections.The state has also demanded that the court should direct the Centre to collect data on BCCs while conducting the national population census in 2022. The Centre has, however, opposed both the prayers of the state government.About collecting data on BCCs, its affidavit said: “Enumeration of OBCs/BCCs has been always adjudged to be administratively extremely complex difficult and cumbersome. It has suffered and will suffer both on account of completeness and accuracy of the data, as also evident from the infirmities of the 2011 census, making it unused unusable for any official purpose and cannot be mentioned as source of information for population data in any official document.”The Union government added that exclusion of information regarding any other caste from the purview of census is a conscious policy decision taken by it. “In such a situation, any direction from this court to the census department to include the enumeration of social-economic data to the extent relating to BCC of rural India in the upcoming census would tantamount to interfering with the policy decision,” underlined the affidavit. It said that based on the above policy decision, no information was collected about the castes except those of SCs and STs since the 1951 census in the independent India.The affidavit further highlighted that several high courts as well as the Supreme Court have earlier ruled against giving any direction to the Union government to carry out a caste census. It cited a 2014 Supreme Court judgment that had set aside the Madras High Court order directing the Centre to conduct caste-wise census in the country, terming it “as a colossal transgression of power of judicial review”.The affidavit further pointed out that the 2011 data shows more than 4.6 million caste names which have not been classified or categorised into the appropriate category of classes or castes till date. Collection of data in respect of backward classes in the upcoming census, said the Centre, will pose serious challenges to the enumerators who cannot verify the authenticity of information and more particularly, in regard to income. During the 2011 exercise, the government claimed there were thousands of instances when the enumerators spelt the same caste differently, leading to recording each one as a separate caste.In the case of Maharashtra, the Union government pointed out that the analysis of the 2011 caste census showed that more than 428,000 castes were recorded while the state identifies only 494 castes, including SCs and STs.Similarly, while the total number of castes during the first census in India in 1931 was 4,147, the 2011 data recorded more than 4.6 million different castes. “Even assuming that some castes may bifurcate into subcastes, the total number cannot be exponentially high to this extent... for the aforesaid reasons the details available in the record of the census pertaining to caste is not reliable either for the purpose of any reservation, whether in admission, employment or election to local authorities,” said the affidavit.It added that the preliminary exercise for the 2021-22 census is also over following a notification on January 7, 2020 which relates to instructions meant for census officers to ask all such questions from all persons for collecting information. Inclusion of any additional questions in the schedule at this stage is not feasible, said the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2011-caste-census-data-unusable-centre-to-supreme-court-101632429422444.html
24-09-2021||India||Is there space for ‘humiliation and insult’ in Congress, asks Amarinder||Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday referred to his “humiliation” by the Congress and asked the party leadership if he is treated like this, what would be the fate of common workers.Singh, who quit as the chief minister after a bitter fight with party colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu for control of the party, was responding to Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate’s “there is no room for anger in the party” remarks in Delhi.“Yes, there’s no space for anger in politics. But is there space for humiliation & insult in a grand old party like @INCIndia? If a senior party leader like me can be treated like this, I wonder what the workers must go through!” Singh said in a tweet posted by his media adviser Raveen Thukral.The former CM, in a statement on Wednesday, lashed out at the Congress leadership for his humiliation, calling party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra “inexperienced”. He also vowed to defeat his bête noire, state Congress chief Sidhu, by pitting a strong person against him in the 2022 state polls.“Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi are like my children...this should not have ended like this. I am hurt,” Singh said. “Fact is the Gandhi siblings are inexperienced and their advisors are clearly misguiding them.”Singh said he had tendered his resignation to party president Sonia Gandhi three weeks before he was removed, but she had asked him to continue. “If she had just called me and asked me to step down, I would have,” he said, adding, “As a soldier, I know how to do my task and leave once I am called back.”He also warned that with Sidhu as the CM face, Congress will struggle in elections scheduled for early next year.Singh said he asked the Congress president to ask someone else to take over as CM and lead the party to another sweeping victory. “But that did not happen, so I will fight,” he said, adding that he will leave politics on a high.On Thursday, the Congress refused to comment on whether Singh would leave the party after his “unceremonious” exit as the chief minister of Punjab, and said “if someone wants to leave, we have no comment to offer”.Party spokesperson Shrinate said Amarinder Singh is an elder and may have stated things out of anger.“He is our elder and the elderly often get angry and say a lot of things. We respect his anger, age and experience. We hope he does reconsider his words. But, there is no space in politics for anger, envy, enmity, vendetta and personal attacks and comments against political opponents,” she told reporters.“We hope that he will rethink on his own words while showing prudence, as he has remained a stalwart of the Congress party, which made him the chief minister for nine years and nine months,” Shrinate added.This is the first time Singh has publicly spoken about the Congress leadership since a feud erupted between him and Sidhu in early May. The party attempted to resolve the differences, but the fight raged on, ultimately culminating in Singh’s dramatic resignation on Saturday.A day later, three-time MLA and senior Dalit leader Charanjit Singh Channi took over as CM.In his comments, Singh praised Channi but questioned his lack of experience in tackling border issues. He reserved the sharpest attacks for Sidhu, a former state minister who resigned from the cabinet in 2019 after Singh changed his portfolio. Singh said he would fight any attempt to name Sidhu the party’s CM face tooth and nail, and added that he was ready to make any sacrifices to save the country from such a “dangerous” man. “Will pit a strong person against him to ensure his defeat in the 2022 assembly polls,” Singh said, without adding more details.Meanwhile, Haryana home minister Anil Vij termed Singh’s exit a ”political murder”, which he said was done as the “nationalist” leader was a hurdle in the party’s “gameplan”.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-there-space-for-humiliation-and-insult-in-congress-asks-former-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-101632428340484.html
24-09-2021||India||Odisha pharmacists can prescribe drugs for 12 ailments at primary health centres||Bhubaneswar: The Odisha government on Thursday allowed phramacists at primary health centres managed by a single doctor or without a doctor to prescribe medicines for 12 ailments including malaria, fever, skin diseases like scabies, diarrhoea and superficial burns.Director of health services, Dr Bijoy Mohapatra said the government took the step to address the acute shortage of doctors at primary health centres in rural areas as it has become difficult to treat huge number of patients.“In 2003 under the Panchavyadhi scheme for treatment of five illnesses - fever, dysentery, vomiting, headache and stomach pain - we trained the pharmacists to dispense medicines in the absence of doctors. We just modified the order so that people in rural areas can get treatment,” said Dr Mohapatra.He said the order was necessary as doctors at health centres needed to take a day off and some arrangement was necessary to run healthcare services smoothly in rural areas where the phramacists managed the primary health centres. The ailments for which the pharmacists can prescribe medicines are malaria, fever, upper respiratory tract infection, scabies, ringworm, helminthiasis, acid peptic disease, diarrhoea, minor injuries and superficial burns that are not medico legal cases, diastolic blood pressure, drainage of abscess and non-communicable disease.State president of Indian Pharmaceutical Association Smruti Ranjan Mishra said Odisha government may be the first among all the states of the country to allow the pharmacists prescribe drugs for a wide range of illnesses.“It’s a welcome step. If you go to developed countries, doctors only diagnose the disease while pharmacists prescribe the doses. As pharmacists, we know the composition of drugs better than doctors and can advise the patients much better. In most cases where medicines don’t work, it is because patients have not been prescribed drugs in proper dosages. The decision of the Odisha government is very good,” said Mishra.Odisha has 8,729 sanctioned posts of doctors in Odisha to be deployed across 1,288 primary health centres, 377 community health centres, 30 district headquarter hospitals and 7 government medical colleges and hospitals. But on the ground, the state government has only 7,443 doctors including those on contract. This number keeps changing every month as doctors leave after serving for a few months, often dissatisfied with the rural health infrastructure.The government has tried everything including raising the retirement age of doctors to 65 from 62 years, allowing non-domiciled doctors from other states to apply for posts in state government hospitals and giving special incentive to doctors working in backward areas of undivided districts of Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput, but the measurs have not been very successful.In its report this year, the 15th Finance Commission said the doctor to people ratio in the state was 1 doctor for 1,864 people while the national ratio was 1 doctor for 1,161 patients. According to the World Health Organization, there should be one doctor for every 1,000 persons. Last year, a record number of 4403 doctors were registered with Odisha State Medical Council but the shortage of doctors continues.According to the rural health statistics 2019-20 released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare in April this year, the primary health centres have only 827 doctors against the sanctioned strength of 1,288 doctors. At the community health centres, 1,508 surgeons and specialists were required but only 313 were in position. Similarly, there were 1,694 pharmacists in position against the sanctioned strength of 1868. Of the 3,927 posts of nursing staff sanctioned, 2504 were in position.The decision of the state government comes at a time when the BJD government is aggressively pushing its health insurance scheme called Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana under which beneficiaries can get treated in empanelled private hospitals across the state and outside by swiping a smart card. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday distributed the BSKY smart cards to people of Bolangir district ahead of panchayat polls scheduled less than 5 months away.However, former principal of SCB Medical College, the oldest government medical colleges in Odisha, Dr Siddharth Das said the move may not be well-advised.“If a patients has fever due to Covid, just paracetamol would not work. Pharmacists have studied only about chemical compositions in a drug, but can they diagnose a disease,” asked Dr Das.Incidentally, in July this year, the Union health ministry passed Pharmacy Practice Amendment Regulations 2021 under which pharmacists can practise after a five-year integrated Pharm D course. The clinical pharmacist can provide patient care, evaluate all medicare coverage requirement requests, assist all patients with assessment of patient orders and assist prescription infusion and ensure adherence to all laws and regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-pharmacists-can-prescribe-drugs-for-12-ailments-at-primary-health-centres-101632427140128.html
24-09-2021||India||Central goverment warns colleges against fake ads to mislead students||The Centre has directed higher education institutions not to publish “misleading” advertisements highlighting categories and ranks which have not been announced by the ministry of education’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), and also warned to debar them from future ranking exercise if found indulging in any such activity.The government raised the red flag days after it announced the sixth edition of the NIRF rankings 2021. Officials at the ministry who are familiar with the matter said the Centre’s direction came in view of several irregularities in some advertisements published by private universities and colleges. In a letter to all higher education institutions last week, the NIRF secretariat said, “It has been observed that many ranked and non-ranked institutions are advertising in newspapers and magazines highlighting the categories and ranks that are not announced by the NIRF and misleading general public, students, parents and other stakeholders. The institutes are highlighting state-wise or district-wise ranks whereas NIRF does not publish ranks in these categories.”Under the NIRF, the institutes are ranked under 11 different categories --- overall, university, colleges, engineering, management, pharmacy, law, medical, architecture, dental and research. These are all India ranks and are not further divided into any subcategories.“It has also been noticed that institutions have published advertisements in categories like private, government and self-financing institutions. However, NIRF doesn’t specify any such categories. It has also been found that some institutions have mentioned ranks on their website but do not specify the year they were ranked in,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity.In its letters, the NIRF secretariat also said that it has been observed that some institutions have been using “imitations” of the State Emblem of India Act, 2005, without an approval from the central government. “Some of the institutions that are ranked by both NIRF and private players are displaying the ranks given by the private players with the NIRF logo,” it said.Directing universities, colleges and other institutes not to bifurcate ranks state-wise or district-wise, the letter said: “Do not create additional categories or disciplines and rank your institutions in these self-made categories... The institutions are requested to comply with the mentioned advisory. Post this email, if any institution is found to advertise misleading advertisements or publish misleading information on their website, it will be barred from future ranking exercise.” When contacted, officials at three central universities and two private universities denied publishing any such advertisement or information on the website. However, they confirmed receiving the letter from the NIRF Secretariat. “We have been asked to submit a compliance report. But it has nothing to do with the public universities,” an official at central university in Delhi said, seeking anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-goverment-warns-colleges-against-fake-ads-to-mislead-students-101632425107038.html

24-09-2021||India||Kerala ruling front, Cong support farmer unions’ bandh call on Sept 27||Thiruvananthapuram: The ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) and opposition Congress in Kerala have supported the Bharat Bandh called by farmers’ unions on September 27 in protest against the Centre’s three farm laws.LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan said on Thursday that it will be a total shutdown in the state and some examinations scheduled on September 27 will be shifted to another day. “Farmers have been agitating for almost a year. The union government is ignoring their repeated pleas. The country never witnessed such an indifferent government. We will support their movement whole-heartedly,” he said, appealing to all parties and trade unions to make the bandh a success. Though many merchants’ associations and others asked the LDF to make it a symbolic protest in view of the pandemic situation, the front did not agree. “It is our duty to support such an agitation,” said Vijayaraghavan. The Congress said it will try to make the bandh a grand success as exhorted by party leader Rahul Gandhi. “Farmers are voice of the country. The BJP government ignored their protests. We will try to make the bandh a grand success to open the eyes of the government,” said party state president K Sudhakaran. Such protests usually turn a forced shutdown in the state crippling normal life. At least 40 farmers’ organisations under the banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) have given the call for the countrywide bandh on September 27 which the protesters said will make their movement stronger. They said many trade unions, banks workers’ associations, transporters and others pledged support to their agitation. Farmers have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill passed in parliament last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-ruling-front-cong-support-farmer-unions-bandh-call-on-sept-27-101632424141511.html
24-09-2021||India||Districts in south Bengal receive three times excess rain in last one week||Three districts in south Bengal received more than five to ten times excess rain on Tuesday compared to the climatic normal of three decades, while three other districts in the region, including Kolkata, registered three times excess rain in the last one week, as an intense spell of rain and thundershower, triggered by a cyclonic circulation, hit the state. But if one considers the rainfall amount the same districts received since the starting of the monsoon season on June 1, then the excess is not even more than 50%. “This is because monsoon has been vigorous of late. Back-to-back cyclonic circulations are developing over the Bay of Bengal, which on intensifying and approaching the coast, are triggering intense spells of rain. Kolkata received the heaviest rainfall in one day in September in 14 years this week,” said GK Das, director of the India Meteorological Department’s regional office in Kolkata. In the last one week, Kolkata received 268mm rain. This is 336% extra over the climatic normal of 61.5mm rain, which the city receives between September 16 and September 22. Similarly North 24 Parganas and West Midnapore received 376% and 335% excess rain over the 30-years of climatic normal during the week. While North 24 Parganas gets around 55m rain but received around 261.6mm rain in the last one-week, West Midnapore usually gets around 48.7mm, but last week it received around 211.7mm. Bankura, a district in the western part of the state registered 1052% more rain on Wednesday than it has been usually receiving on September 22 over the past three decades. Purulia and West Midnapore received 574% and 896% excess rain on the same day. But the same districts show very little deviation of the rainfall amount is taken for the period June 1 to September 22. Kolkata has just 31% extra rain, North 24 Parganas registered 48% excess rain and West Midnapore registered 42% excess rain over the climatic normal from June to September. “One of the primary reasons behind these intense spells is climate change. The water holding capacity of the atmosphere increases by around 7% if there is one degree rise in temperature. Across India incidents of heavy rain spells are increasing. This is just one consequence of climate change,” said KJ Ramesh, former director of India Meteorological Department. Data available with the Union ministry of earth sciences reveal that while in 2016 around 1864 IMD stations across India recorded very heavy rain and 226 stations recorded extremely heavy rain, in 2020 at least 1912 stations had registered very heavy rain and extremely heavy rain was recorded in 341 stations. In 2018 and 2019 such events were even higher. The ‘Assessment of climate change over the Indian region’ – a report published by the Union earth sciences ministry in 2020 suggests that there has been a shift in the recent period toward more frequent dry spells and more intense wet spells during the summer monsoon season. The frequency of localized heavy precipitation occurrences has increased worldwide in response to increased atmospheric moisture content. “Our analysis of 100 years of data of rainfall in West Bengal shows that the overall rainfall in the monsoon season has increased but the number of rainy days has dropped resulting in intense spells. What aggravates the situation is that while on one hand alteration of nature is going on in an unbridled way, we also lack the mitigation and preparedness,” said Tuhin Ghosh, director of School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University in Kolkata. The IMD’s regional office in Kolkata has warned of yet another spell of heavy rain over the coming weekend. A low-pressure system that is likely to form over the sea would trigger rain and thundershower in Kolkata and other districts of south Bengal on September 26 and 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/districts-in-south-bengal-receive-three-times-excess-rain-in-last-one-week-101632424019496.html
24-09-2021||India||No plan to include India and Japan in AUKUS security alliance yet: US||Washington: Though India has opted to publicly downplay the impact of the recently launched security alliance between Australia, the UK and the US (AUKUS) on the Quad – even as both groupings focus on the Indo-Pacific region – it is secretly pleased that the latter has been “de-securitised” as a result, a person familiar with the discussions said on the condition of anonymity.India has been wary about “militarising” the Quad — the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue it conducts with Australia, Japan and the US. However, AUKUS, with its unabashed security bearing, has “de-securitised” the Quad, and this “is what we have wanted”, the person added.“We have no intention of militarising the Quad,” the person said ahead of the crucial talks Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold with US officials over the next two days. The person insisted that a lot of people have mistakenly tied the Malabar military exercises — which India has hosted and conducted with Japan and US for years and now Australia joining it — to the Quad as the group’s security and defence aspects. “They are not linked,” the person added.There were some talks towards the end of the Trump administration of giving the Quad a formal structure, something like an Indo-Pacific version of the NATO military alliance.India has enthusiastically welcomed the non-military and non-security direction the Quad has taken in recent months as it has elevated its exchanges to the summit level, driven by President Joe Biden, the person said, pointing to the three working groups launched at the virtual summit of the leaders in March: on Covid-19 vaccines, emerging technologies, and climate.PM Modi will join President Biden, Australian PM Scott Morrison and Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga for the first in-person summit of the Quad leader on Friday. Biden, who will host the summit, indicated in his maiden UNGA speech on Tuesday that the talks will focus on tackling “challenges ranging from health security to climate to emerging technologies”.The Indian side is going into the in-person summit with the expectation of building on the initiatives of the March meeting.PM Modi, who is on his seventh visit to the US as prime minister, has a packed calendar of engagements before and after the Quad summit. On Thursday, he will have a key ceremonial meeting with Vice-President Kamala Harris, the first Indian American to hold the post, in Washington DC.Their discussions could range from the “management of Covid-19 to issues like cooperation in the high-tech sector and the space sector, where the Vice-President has an interest and a number of areas including resilient and secure supply chain, which is something of great interest to both sides,” the person cited before said.There is a possibility of an announcement of an India visit by Harris at some stage, with people familiar with the discussions asked to “wait till tomorrow”.The PM will also take part in a long-overdue bilateral meeting with his Australian counterpart, Morrison, whose last two scheduled visits to India were cancelled. Morrison had given Modi a heads up on the AUKUS announcement.Modi is scheduled to meet Japanese PM Suga for the last bilateral of the day of Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plan-to-include-india-and-japan-in-aukus-security-alliance-yet-us-101632423848914.html
24-09-2021||India||After Centre’s ex gratia announcement, Kerala to update list of Covid deaths: Health minister||Thiruvananthapuram: After the Union government’s announcement to give a relief of ₹50,000 to dependents of those who died of Covid-19, Kerala health minister Veena Geroge said on Thursday that the state government will update the list of the dead. She said the state will go by the directive of the union health ministry and make necessary changes. Medical experts said the state will have to at least double the existing deaths (24,191) to include all Covid-19-related fatalities. “It is a fact many deaths failed to get into the list due to weird reasons put forward by the state government. No doubt, deaths will go up considerably if the government follows the latest directive in letter and spirit,” said Dr S S Lal, a public health expert. There were complaints that the state was underreporting deaths to maintain the low fatality rate, which is one of the lowest in the country, below 0.5% against the national average of 1.30%. “The state will prepare an updated list of those who succumbed to the pandemic. We will include those who died even after testing negative for the virus after a month,” the minister said, adding the government will help all families who lost their family members to the virus. Many hospitals said they are getting frequent enquires for proper death certificates identifying the exact cause of death. “We are flooded with inquiries. Even relatives of those died due to non-Covid complications are also calling us. It will be a herculean task to go back to many cases and pinpoint exact cause of death,” a senior doctor, who did not want to be named. at the Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital said. Earlier the union health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research had released fresh guidelines which stated that those who succumbed to Covid-19 at home or hospital within 30 days of testing positive and those who stayed in a hospital beyond 30 days of testing positive and succumbed to the virus will now be counted as Covid-19 fatalities. Later the union government submitted an affidavit to the Supreme Court in this regard. Meanwhile, the state reported 19,682 new cases with a test positivity rate of 16.14% after 121,945 samples were tested, said the state health ministry. It also reported 152 deaths taking total fatalities to 24,191. Active cases are 160,046 and recovered cases stand at 20,510. Thrissur district topped the virus list with 3,033 cases, followed by Ernakulam with 2564 and Kozhikode with 1735. Statistics show cases and TPR are coming down gradually after the state remained the top contributor of cases for more than three months. The second stage of infection aggravated after the Onam festival in August-end. Though it reported high cases, there were no health crisis or shortage of oxygen in any part of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-centre-s-ex-gratia-announcement-kerala-to-update-list-of-covid-deaths-health-minister-101632423842046.html
24-09-2021||India||Opposition parties, activists target Assam govt. over deaths during eviction||The killing of two people during an eviction drive in Assam triggered a political storm on Thursday as Opposition parties and activists targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government and the administration hit back, blaming a thousands-strong mob for the deadly violence.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted that the state of Assam was on “state sponsored fire. “I stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the state- no children of India deserve this,” he said.The Congress party condemned the violence. “Assam, like the rest of India, is burning because of the hatred BJP is spreading,” it tweeted.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, however, backed the police action.“Police are doing their duty. As per my information, people attacked police with machetes, spears and other things,” he said, making it clear that the eviction drive will continue on Friday.The political tug-of-war came hours after police bullets allegedly killed two people, and at least nine policemen were injured in clashes during a controversial drive to evict “illegal settlers” in Assam’s Darrang district.Police said a mob of nearly 2,000 people attacked personnel during the eviction drive at Dholpur village in Sipajhar, forcing security men to lathi charge the crowd and open fire, resulting in the deaths and injuries. But local residents and Opposition members blamed the police for the violence and alleged that one villager was shot at point-blank range.The eviction drive was being conducted in a region largely inhabited by Bengali-speaking Muslims.“These residents are mostly cultivators and their source of sustenance is being attacked. A government’s job is to work for welfare of people and not create problems for people by making them homeless,” state Congress president Bhupen Kumar Borah said.Former MP Sushmita Dev, who recently quit the Congress for the Trinamool Congress, said, “Is this really happening in Assam ? @CMOfficeAssam Is this the new model of governance?”All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) condemned the incident and termed it as unfortunate and barbaric. The party said that the government should have given adequate time to the residents and offered them alternate measures before forcing them out.“The process could have been carried out in an amicable manner. But chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma seeks to get sadistic pleasure by targeting innocent civilians. Assam seems to be turning into a police state with no rule of law. People of the state are watching and will give a befitting reply in due time,” said AIUDF organising secretary Md. Aminul Islam.Sivasagar MLA and president of Raijor Dal, Akhil Gogoi, demanded the eviction drive be stopped immediately and alternate housing provided to those evicted earlier.The controversial eviction was first mooted when Sarma visited the area on June 7 and instructed the district administration to clear the area occupied by “illegal settlers” for a community farming project for young people hailing from the state’s indigenous communities.Activists also said that the local residents were living in the area since the 1970s and demanded adequate rehabilitation processes.“Encroachment of government land is illegal. But government should give enough time to residents before carrying out evictions. From a humane point of view, alternate arrangements like a rehabilitation package, housing and other basic necessities should have been ensured before taking drastic measures,” activist Dibyajyoti Saikia said.These families had been residing in the area for 40-50 years, said Saddam Hussain, another activist and local resident.Ainuddin Ahmed, an adviser to the All Assam Muslim Students Union (AAMSU) who was present when violence broke out on Thursday, termed it as pre-planned attack on Muslims by the state’s BJP-led government.“All this was planned and part of communal politics of CM Sarma targeting Muslims. The government must announce a rehabilitation package for all residents or else we will not perform last rites of the deceased and intensify protests. The deputy commissioner of Darrang and the superintendent of police, who is the CM’s brother, should be removed and their roles in Thursday’s incident investigated by an independent agency,” he said.The BJP dismissed the charges and said the police acted in self defence.“We have to understand that these people were staying in government land illegally for years. They were given notice and also assured about some alternate measures. But today they took law into their own hands and police had no option but to resort to firing in self-defence. Government has already ordered an inquiry and it will reveal the truth,” said Assam BJP spokesperson Rupam Goswami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-parties-activists-target-assam-govt-over-deaths-during-eviction-101632423478708.html
24-09-2021||India||Food stall owner, irked by poop near oven, poisons 20 street dogs; arrested||Bhubaneswar: A food stall owner in Cuttack district was arrested on Thursday on charges of cruelty to animals after local shopkeepers accused him of poisoning at least 20 street dogs over 3 days. Police said he was angry that some dogs pooped near his stall’s oven.Ajay Kumar Sahu, a street food stall owner at Shankarpur village under Choudwar block of Cuttack district, has been arrested for killing the animals and criminal intimidation, said inspector Biranchi Narayan Pati of Choudwar police station.Pati said villagers suspected something was amiss on Wednesday when they realised that 20 street dogs had died in a span of just three days. “Since the dogs usually roamed around Sahu’s shop, the villagers suspected him to be the accused as he had been furious at the dogs pooping around his oven,” said the police officer.When confronted by the villagers, Sahu allegedly admitted that he killed the stray dogs and threatened the villagers. He told them that he mixed an insecticide used by farmers with some sweets and fed them to the dogs.The shocking incident comes days after street food stall owners in Charampa town of Bhadrak district 100km away organised a community feast on Tuesday in memory of a mongrel they had taken care of for 13 years. The dog, who was affectionately called Champi by the stall owners, died on September 10.Sushant Biswal, the stall owner who first adopted her, said Champi was going to be abandoned by her owners when he took her in.“It was like no other dog in the area. I got her from a man 13 years ago when she injured one of his family members. I treated the mongrel as my daughter. It never mingled with other dogs and would prowl around my shop most of the time. At night it slept inside my shop while I downed the shutters. She was like a part of my family,” said Sushant Biswal earlier this week, standing near a framed photograph of the dog in front of his shop. Some other shopkeepers in the area also got their heads tonsured.Biswal said the mongrel would not eat food thrown on the ground. “We would give it biryani, rassagola, roti or rice on a plate. Even if someone gave a biscuit, it would be put on a plate or else the dog would not touch it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/food-stall-owner-irked-by-poop-near-oven-poisons-20-street-dogs-arrested-101632423359825.html
24-09-2021||India||People with disability can get Covid vaccines at home||Differently-abled people, senior citizens and those with restricted or limited mobility across India will soon be administered the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine shot at home if they are unable to go to vaccine centres, the government announced on Thursday.Only 6% of all doses of vaccine shots administered between May 1 and September 22 were done at private hospitals, while the remaining were all at public health facilities, senior health ministry officials said during the government’s Thursday’s media briefing on Covid-19 updates.“I am pleased to inform that the government has made a provision wherein those with restricted mobility, who cannot step out of their house to get vaccinated, such as those who are differently-abled, elderly or those with some special needs, will be administered vaccine shots at home under the supervision of trained vaccinators, following the requisite standard operating procedures (SOPs). The advisory in this regard has been issued to states,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.“Those who have not been able to take the shot because of this reason will benefit from this. The arrangements we will make for providing the vaccination facility at home will be safe, effective and supportive,” he added, without elaborating when the programme would start.In a letter issued on Thursday, states and Union territories have already been directed to make suitable arrangements for the rollout. The at-home vaccination drive will be in addition to a citizen-friendly intervention for near-to-home vaccination centres for elderly and differently-abled citizens, started in May 2021, which is already in place. Around 162 million doses have been administered under the latter scheme.“…there are still some persons who might be bed-ridden or have extremely restricted mobility or disability and/or special needs that may hamper their accessibility even to near-to-home vaccination centres. It is advised that a line-list of such potential beneficiaries and their care-givers may be prepared in the catchment area of every planning unit and collated at district level. Subsequently, vaccination of such beneficiaries may be facilitated at their place of residence using mobile vaccination teams…,” reads Union health ministry’s letter to states/UTs.“We are urging those who are eligible but have not taken the vaccine (men, women, pregnant women, everybody), more so who are of a higher age above 50 years to make an effort to come forward and get vaccinated. We are there to help,” said Paul.Meanwhile, government data shows that public health facilities have been overwhelmingly favoured by people as their choice of vaccination centre across India, accounting for 94% of all doses administered since May 1.“If we take the figures from the first of May to 22nd of September, roughly 6% doses have been administered in private hospitals, and remaining doses have been administered in public health facilities,” said Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, ministry of health and family welfare. Initially, the private sector was allowed procurement of up to 25% available supplies. However, in one of the earlier press briefings, the Union health secretary said there was no earmarked quota of Covid-19 vaccine supplies for the sector.“There is no earmarked quota for the private sector; there is an indicative percentage of what the government would procure and what would be available for the private sector to procure. This in effect means that if the private sector is either unable to procure or utilise the earmarked percentage, then whatever is the shortfall will also be procured by the government; because at the end of the day, whatever is produced in the country must be utilised,” he said.Nearly two-thirds of country’s adult population (66.2%) has been administered at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot, and just under a quarter (23.2%) of the adults have been fully vaccinated, shows government data. India has administered at least 840 million shots of the vaccine since start of the immunisation drive on January 16, this year.Meanwhile, the health ministry has also shared guidelines with states keeping in mind the expected festive season rush in coming months. The SOP says that mass gatherings should be avoided in areas identified as containment zones and in districts reporting more than 5% case positivity; gatherings with advance permissions and limited people to be allowed in districts with the positivity rate of below 5% and below etc. “The letter was sent on September 21, with detailed SOPs for states to be implemented particularly in the months of October and November when we expect mass public gatherings owing to the festive season. Weekly case positivity must be used to make decisions regarding imposing or lifting movement related restrictions,” added Bhushan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-with-disability-can-get-covid-vaccines-at-home-101632423306719.html
24-09-2021||India||24 arrested for gang rape of Thane girl, SIT to probe case: Police||At least 32 people have been booked on charges of gang-raping a 15-year-old girl several times over a period of nine months in Maharashtra’s Thane district, police said on Thursday. Of the total, 24 have been arrested while two minors have been detained, and a special investigation team (SIT) has been formed to probe the case, they added. In her complaint on Wednesday, Manpada police said, the survivor alleged that it all started in January when a man she was in a relationship with, threatened to leak their private videos and forced her to have physical relations with some of his friends and acquaintances. All the accused raped the girl, a resident of Dombivli (East), at various locations such as Dombivli, Murbad and Badlapur in Thane district and Rabale in Navi Mumbai on multiple occasions, officials familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The matter, however, came to light earlier this month when the survivor approached a relative over the prolonged sexual abuse. “The girl’s aunt approached a local social worker and decided to nab the accused. On Wednesday, six of the accused called the victim to a lodge in Murbad. While her aunt and the social worker tried to follow her, the auto they were travelling in broke down midway. Since the girl had shared her live location, her aunt immediately informed us,” an officer, who is part of the probe, said on condition of anonymity.A police team immediately rushed to the lodge and managed to arrest two persons as the other four had already left. Based on their and the girl’s statement, police gradually began apprehending the remaining accused from Wednesday night onwards, the official said. “Based on the victim’s statement, a FIR was registered on Wednesday evening. We booked all the accused under various sections of the Indian Penal Code as well as the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,” Sachin Gunjal, deputy commissioner, zone III, Thane police, said. Additional commissioner of police (East region) Datta Karale added that a SIT has been formed to investigate the matter. “Assistant commissioner of police (administration) Sonali Dhole will head the SIT,” he said. While the minors were sent to a remand home, the arrested people -- all in their early twenties -- were remanded in police custody till September 29. The girl, meanwhile, was sent to a government hospital in Kalwa for medical examination. “A few more names came up during the investigation and the total number of accused has now gone up to 32,” senior inspector Dadahari Choure at Manpada police station said. The developments came weeks after a 34-year-old woman was brutally raped and murdered by a 45-year-old man in Mumbai’s Sakinaka area, prompting Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to urge chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to hold a special session of the assembly to discuss women safety in the state. The accused was later arrested in the case.In a statement, Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde said: “The incident of gangrape on a minor girl in Dombivli is extremely unfortunate, reprehensible and a blot on humanity. I have spoken to the Thane Police commissioner and issued instructions to arrest whoever is involved in the offence. In order to ensure that there are no repeats of such a grave crime, not only will the accused be punished in the strictest way possible, but instructions have also been given to handle every single complaint of crimes against women speedily and strictly.” Condemning the alleged gang-rape of the teen, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis demanded that the Maharashtra government make special efforts to prevent such crimes. “An atmosphere of fear is prevailing in the state. The increase in the number of such incidents is worrisome,” the former chief minister told reporters in Nagpur. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena general secretary Shalini Thackeray tweeted: “The gang-rape in Dombivli sends a shiver down the spine. What more needs to happen for the chief minister to realise that Maharashtra is no different than Delhi or Uttar Pradesh?” Meanwhile, police dismissed reports that some of the accused had political connections. “None of the accused come from politically-connected families and there was no political pressure,” Gunjal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-arrested-for-gang-rape-of-thane-girl-sit-to-probe-case-police-101632423180297.html
24-09-2021||India||BJP MPs top attendance chart in House panel meets: Data||On average, Rajya Sabha members belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party attended parliamentary committee meetings more frequently than their Congress counterparts in the last year, according to the data shared by the Rajya Sabha secretariat. This was even as the principal opposition party remained vocal for closer scrutiny of legislation in House panels. Secretariat data shows 92 BJP members of the Upper House had an average attendance of 56.56% while those of the Congress (38 MPs) had 41.86%. A total of 361 meetings were held of various committees between September 2020 and August this year. However, the overall attendance for Rajya Sabha was 46%. Explaining this, some lawmakers said large parts of India were plagued by Covid-19 during this period and virtual meetings were not allowed. Among the smaller parties, Telugu Desam Party’s lone member in the Rajya Sabha, Ravindra Kumar, attended 9 out of every 10 meetings. Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party had an impressive 77% attendance rate with 3 MPs, followed by Shiv Sena (75%) with 3members and YSRCP (67%) with 6 MPs. The data is part of a review ordered by Rajya Sabha chairman, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu, in a bid to improve the attendance of MPs in House panel meetings. Higher participation in standing committee meetings is essential for their functioning as these panels have often suffered due to lack of quorum (5 members) in the past, said officials, adding that Naidu has requested all panel heads to ensure a minimum of 50% attendance in all meetings even as the minimum requirement or quorum is much lower. Earlier this week, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, too, sought a report on the attendance of Lok Sabha MPs in parliamentary committee meetings. Meetings with the highest attendance were those of the committee on defence (88%) followed by chemicals and fertilisers (83%); the panel on home affairs saw 78% attendance. The attendance reports also assume significance as the two presiding officers have often spoken about shifting MPs with low attendance to other panels. “This latest exercise also comes ahead of the reshuffle in the House panels,” said a senior Rajya Sabha official on condition of anonymity. There are 16 panels under the jurisdiction of the Lok Sabha and eight under Rajya Sabha. All parliamentarians are entitled to be members of at least one committee. Samajwadi Party’s Ramgopal Yadav, BJP’s Rakesh Sinha, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s P.Wilson, Telangana Rashtra Samithi’s K Keshava Rao and Congress veteran Anand Sharma are among the 16 members in the House of 231 who have 100% attendance. The list includes 10 BJP MPs, 3 from Congress and one each from SP, DMK and TRS. A total of 131 members, accounting for 54% of the Upper House, have attended at least half of the panel meetings. But senior opposition leaders said that insistence on regular attendance during a pandemic is unnecessary. “These average comparison figures may actually be far more misleading than revealing because the period is bang in the middle of Covid-19. Attendance of members, as it must be, was dictated by personal consideration,” said Abhishek Manu Singhvi, senior Congress leader in the Rajya Sabha. “The correct solution would have been to ensure virtual meetings. In the absence of such digital meetings, to expect people of different levels of morbidity, age and other factors to attend more meetings is absolutely unrealistic,” he added. But experts thought regular attendance was crucial in the functioning of democracy. “MPs should be committed to their legislative responsibilities both in the House, whose sittings are televised, and also in committee meetings where important technical work takes place,” said Chakshu Roy, head of outreach of PRS Legislative Research. He said the latest data “highlights the seriousness with which MPs take their legislative responsibilities, in a closed-door setting”. “Such regular release of data is critical in making the working of our parliamentary committees transparent,” Roy added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpmps-top-attendance-chart-in-house-panel-meets-data-101632422939711.html
24-09-2021||India||Twitter has abided by new rules, Centre tells HC||The Centre has told the Delhi high court that social media company Twitter has complied with the Information Technology Rules, 2021 and has appointed three-tier grievance redressal officers as their employee and not as a contingent worker.In an affidavit filed before Justice Rekha Palli, the Union government has said that IT rules are the “law of the land” and Twitter has to “mandatorily” comply with it, failing which it would lose its protection from prosecution in case content of unlawful nature is posted by its users.“I submit that Twitter has appointed the personnel in compliance to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 hereinafter referred as IT Rules, 2021,” Centre’s response in the high court said.It said that Twitter has provided the names of the personnel appointed along with their respective positions, date of employment and contracts.“Twitter has clearly acknowledged that the said personnel Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), Nodal Contact Person (NCO), and Resident Grievance Officer (RGO) are appointed as Twitter’s employees and not as ‘contingent workers’. Twitter has provided the names of the said appointed personnel and their respective positions also….”“The said affidavit (Twitter’s affidavit on August 6) mentions their employment start date as August 4, 2021. Twitter has further enclosed their employment contracts along with the said affidavit as proof of such appointments,” the document read.The affidavit was filed on September 22, in a petition by lawyer Amit Acharya who had contended that IT Rules came into effect from February 25 and the Centre had given three months to every social media intermediary, including Twitter, to comply with them.However, even after the lapse of three-month period on May 25, till date no resident grievance officer was appointed by Twitter to deal with complaints regarding tweets on its platform, due which, he could not take action against two alleged offensive tweets by TMC MP Mohua Moitra and journalist Swati Chaturvedi.Twitter had later disposed of his plea saying that the tweets in question were not offensive according to its policies.On August 6, Twitter, through an affidavit, had told the court that it had appointed Vinay Prakash, an Indian resident, as the RGO and CCO on August 4. It further added that Shahin Komath has been employed as the NCO.However, the Centre had said that the position was “yet to be verified” and had sought time to recheck the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-has-abided-by-new-rules-centre-tells-hc-101632422759526.html
24-09-2021||India||PM Modi to roll out National Digital Health Mission on Sep 27||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will announce the nationwide roll-out of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), which has been renamed as Pradhan Mantri Digital Health Mission (PM-DHM), on September 27, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Thursday. “PM Narendra Modi ji to announce nationwide rollout of Pradhan Mantri Digital Health Mission on September 27. Under this, a unique digital health ID will be provided to the people, which will contain all the health records of the person,” he tweeted. The id will be created using details such as Aadhaar and the user’s mobile number, people familiar with the matter said. The initiative will be rolled out on the final day of Arogya Manthan, which was kicked off on Thursday to mark the third anniversary of the government’s flagship health insurance scheme — Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. The project is currently in its pilot phase in the Union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry.The mission essentially consists of four main building blocks -- unique digital health id, health care professionals registry, health facility registry and electronic health records. To begin with, three components — unique health id, doctor’s registry and the health facility registry — have been made operational, the officials cited above said. The health id is to standardise the process of identification of an individual across health care providers which aims to ensure that the created medical records are issued to the correct individual or accessed by health information users through appropriate consent. In order to issue the id, the system will collect certain basic details such as demography and location, family or relationship, and contact details that can be updated from time to time. The id will be used for uniquely identifying persons, authenticating them and threading their health records (only with the informed consent of the patient) across multiple systems and stakeholders.The doctors’ registry will carry details of all healthcare professionals involved in the delivery of healthcare services across both modern and traditional systems of medicine.The health facility registry will act as a database of all health facilities across different systems of medicine, including both public and private health facilities such as hospitals, clinics, diagnostic laboratories and imaging centres, pharmacies, etc. The initiative supports Universal Health Coverage in an efficient, accessible, inclusive, affordable and safe manner through provision of a wide-range of data, information and infrastructure services. “The mission has been designed keeping in mind the needs of the future; it will benefit not just patients but doctors, policy makers and researchers alike. Since almost everything will be electronically handled, it will do away with the requirement of paperwork, like Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY is implemented,” a senior government functionary said, seeking anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-roll-out-national-digital-health-mission-on-sep-27-101632422459212.html
24-09-2021||India||India did what no country could: Supreme Court on Covid ex gratia||The Supreme Court on Thursday said it was happy at the Centre’s decision to pay ₹50,000 compensation to families of people who died due to Covid-19, underlining that “we are certain what India has done, no other country in the world has done”.“We are happy that something has been done to wipe out the tears of persons who have suffered due to Covid-19,” said a bench of justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna after reserving orders on two affidavits filed by the Centre in compliance with the top court’s June 30 ruling that families who lost their dear ones due to Covid-19 were entitled to ex gratia payment under the Disaster Management Act 2005.The bench, which has posted the matter for October 4, said its order would clarify some aspects of the guidelines and make the process binding on the states as well.On Wednesday, the Centre informed the court through an affidavit that the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued guidelines on September 11 for payment of ₹50,000 ex-gratia for Covid deaths. A second affidavit by the Centre said the government has decided to extend the ex-gratia benefit to those who suffered Covid and died within a month by committing suicide.Lawyer Gaurav Kumar Bansal, one of the two lawyers who filed the petition earlier this year that led the top court to order compensation, also produced a report by the National Institute Of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHAS) Bengaluru to underscore that deaths by suicide during the Covid waves exceeded the national average suicide rate reported in the country.At Thursday’s hearing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, who appeared for the Centre, said the Centre has agreed to give the ₹50,000 financial assistance to families of people who died by suicide within 30 days of testing Covid positive.Mehta said, “If suicide takes place within 30 days of a person who tested Covid positive, irrespective of the cause of suicide, it will be treated as suicide due to Covid-19.”He added that in cases where the death certificates and hospital records show “heart attack” or any other reason as the cause of death, the family of the deceased could seek rectification of the death certificate if there are contemporaneous records of past 30 days to show that the person had suffered or tested Covid-19 positive.The court appreciated the Centre’s decision to notify the compensation scheme.“We know about the financial constraints that are there as the government is spending money on procuring vaccines, migrants and providing food to vulnerable sections. Despite facing problems of a large population and financial constraints, we are certain what India has done, no other country in the world has done.”The judges asked the Centre about the procedure for families who did not have the death certificate.When the second national wave of Covid-19 peaked, the bench said, “Hospitals considered themselves monarchs. People were under tremendous pressure. And many persons who died in the hospital, their dead bodies were disposed of. Many a times, the hospitals do not give medical papers to the patient’s families.”Mehta said that the guidelines proposed a district-level committee to deal with any dispute arising between the hospital and the family regarding the cause of death. Mehta aso said that the committee can be asked to call for the relevant records from the hospital in such cases.“We will clarify it in our order as it will be in larger interest and will have a binding effect on states,” the Supreme Court said.The Centre also sought another direction from the Court for states to set up the district-level committee within 30 days.While fixing the ex gratia amount at ₹50,000 the stakeholders at the Centre considered the present uncertainty about likely future waves, the financial burden already existing on SDRF and Central government to provide succor to the vulnerable sections of society, and the allocation for timely and effective response to other natural disasters as well.Solicitor general Mehta said, “The SDRF fund is being utilised for various purposes. We do not know about the future.” The bench asked Mehta, the Centre’s second senior-most law officer, if the third wave of the pandemic is over as it came across a statement by AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria in this regard.“Sometimes such a statement creates a wrong impression. You know the people of this country. Everybody will say Covid is gone and there will be no fear. Still there are two to three lakh cases reported in the country. Technically speaking, we cannot say that the third wave has gone.”Mehta said that in other countries even the fourth wave of the pandemic had begun, and unfortunately, people there are resorting to courts to protest wearing of masks and other restrictions associated with Covid-19. The court said that in an earlier decision, it had noted the importance of wearing masks by persons. “It is not your life only that you risk by not wearing masks but the lives of others. You have no right to play with the lives of others,” the bench held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-did-what-no-country-could-supreme-court-on-covid-ex-gratia-101632422280663.html
24-09-2021||India||Three terrorists killed as Army foils another infiltration bid in Uri sector||Three terrorists were killed as security forces foiled an infiltration bid in North Kashmir’s Uri sector on Thursday, Army officials familiar with the development said. A huge cache of arms and ammunition, including grenades and pistols, were also recovered from the terrorists, they added.The incident took place when the troops spotted five terrorists trying to infiltrate into the Uri sector from across the Line of Control (LoC). “The terrorists were challenged and that resulted in an encounter, in which three of them were killed and a large quantity of arms and ammunition were recovered,” a commanding officer of the Army battalion involved in the operation at Hathlanga village, the last village near the LoC, said. The officer added that five AK rifles, seven pistols, one revolver, five AK magazines, 80 grenades, some food items and both Pakistani and Indian currency were among items recovered by the forces. This is the second infiltration attempt that was foiled by forces in the Uri sector in the last five days. On September 18, a combing operation was launched in the sector by the Army after it detected suspicious movement. All telecommunication facilities in the border town were suspended as a precautionary measure but restored later. Briefing reporters at the Army’s Chinar Corps headquarters here, General Officer Commanding Lt General D P Pandey said there has been increased activity at the launch pads on the other side of the LoC recently.“There are credible inputs that there have been large activities going at the launch pads across the LoC for some time and today’s attempt couldn’t have been possible without the help of Pakistan’s army,” he said. Asked about the identity and nationality of the deceased terrorists, the officer said according to the documents recovered from their person, “one of them was a Pakistani while we are not sure about the other two yet”.Inspector general of police, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said 97 pistols were recovered from different terrorists in various operations this year. “We have seen that the attacks carried by terrorists this year were either on innocent civilians who were wrongly labeled as informers or policemen who were unarmed or on leave,” he said, adding that peaceful activities in the Valley had left handlers in Pakistan frustrated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-terrorists-killed-as-army-foils-another-infiltration-bid-in-uri-sector-101632422039264.html
24-09-2021||India||Exclusive: CBI seeks nod to prosecute 3 IAS officers in arms licence case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has sought prosecution sanction against Dr Shahid Iqbal Choudhary and two other Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officers in its probe related to alleged irregularities in the issuance and renewal of hundreds of thousands of arms licences to non-residents in Jammu & Kashmir, officials familiar with the development told HT. Choudhary, a 2009 batch officer who was awarded the Prime Minister’s Award for Excellence in Public Administration in 2015, is currently posted as secretary in the tribal affairs department as well as chief executive officer (CEO) of Mission Youth in the Union territory. The central agency’s request for sanction is mandatory to file a charge sheet.The CBI is probing irregularities in the issuance of more than 278,000 arms licences between 2012 and 2016 (out of 449,000 issued in this period in the erstwhile state) in several districts of J&K to non-entitled people by district magistrates (DMs), deputy commissioners and licencing authorities in lieu of monetary considerations by abusing their official positions. Choudhary’s role as district magistrate in three districts, Reasi, Kathua and Udhampur, during this period was probed by the agency. The central agency raided his home in July, along with that of several other IAS officers, Kashmir Administrative Service (KAS) officers, former district magistrates, additional district magistrates, and gun houses or dealers. Apart from Choudhary, two other IAS officers against whom sanction has been sought are Niraj Kumar, who currently holds the charge of additional resident commissioner of J&K in Delhi, and Rajeev Ranjan, posted in the revenue department in J&K. CBI arrested Ranjan in March 2020, after which he was suspended, but the government reinstated him this February. “Sanction for five others from the state services was also sought in the case, which has already been granted to the CBI while sanction request for three IAS officers has been forwarded to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT),” said an official, requesting anonymity. This officer said a charge sheet will be filed against the three IAS officers as soon as the sanction is granted. “I am not aware of any latest developments in this case. I am absolutely sure of having done no wrong at any stage. Even as DMs are empowered to issue arm licences, I am among those who brought the annual figure to lowest in the erstwhile state. This is suggestive of the fact that we employed strict process of scrutiny. I cannot comment further without knowledge of charges, if any,” Choudhary said. Niraj Kumar, a 2010 batch IAS officer, said: “The CBI had come to my place in July but they didn’t find anything.” His batch mate Rajeev Ranjan declined to comment. Following the raids at his premises in July, Choudhary issued a statement on Twitter saying that in Reasi, Kathua and Udhampur districts, where he was posted, only 56,000 (12.4% of the total 449,000) arms licences were issued during 2012-16. “This is not disproportionate... of the 56,000 licences issued in three districts — Reasi, Kathua and Udhampur — between 2012-16, only 1,720 were issued in my tenure — 3% of all licences issued in three districts in four years or during the period under investigation and 0.38% of all such licences issued in J&K,” he said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exclusivecbiseeks-nod-to-prosecute-3-ias-officers-in-arms-licence-case-101632421619071.html
24-09-2021||India||12 Indian institutes in QS employability rankings; IIT-B tops the list||As many as twelve Indian higher education institutions, including six Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), figured in the top 500 universities in Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) graduate employability rankings 2022 announced on Thursday, with IIT-Bombay emerging as the best institute in India in the category.IIT-B moved up to the 101-110 group, from the 111-120 bracket in 2020. “India’s national employability leader – those implementing the nation’s strongest employability processes and achieving the strongest employability outcomes – IIT Bombay,” QS, a global higher education analyst, said in a statement.According to over 50,000 employers surveyed by QS, IIT-Bombay produces India’s highest calibre of graduates. IIT-Bombay is followed by IIT-Delhi, which jumped from the 151-160 band in 2020 to the 131-140 group in 2022. IIT-Madras, too, has risen from the 171-180 band to the 151-160 category.Three central universities -- Delhi University (131-140 ), University of Mumbai (250-300) and University of Calcutta (500+) -- have made it to the list. The other institutes were IIT-Kharagpur (201- 250); Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) in Pilani, IIT-Kanpur, both under the ranking 251-300; and Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, and OP Jindal Global University, both in the 301-500 bracket; and IIT-Roorkee (500+).Ben Sowter, director of research at QS, said, “With students becoming increasingly conscious of the competitiveness of the global graduate jobs market, and of the ever-increasing financial costs of their educational investment, it has become correspondingly crucial that independent data of this sort is available to them, so as to inform evidence-based decisions about their educational futures.”“The data that contributes to this ranking shows that Indian universities are consistently producing high numbers of entrepreneurs, business leaders, and other highly successful individuals. However, with consistently low scores in our Partnerships with Employers indicator, it is also clear that India’s higher education leadership must strive to create stronger links with industry, facilitating more employer-student connection opportunities on campus,” he said.Among the parameters used to calculate employability rankings are: Employer reputation (30%), Alumni outcomes (25%), Partnerships with Employers per Faculty (25%), Employer/Student Connections (10%) and Graduate employment rate (10%).Meanwhile, three institutes were placed in the top 100 scores under the “alumni outcome” parameter. Delhi University ranks 21st globally and number one in India in this metric by scoring 96 out of 100.Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-Bombay, said that he expected a rank within the top 50. “Training at IIT Bombay emphasises as learning outcomes on developing skills for analytical problem solving, capability to address unseen problems and an appreciation for the constraints that beset a specific problem. These are the terms of endearment for any technology oriented company. Hence I am not at all surprised at this ranking. As a matter of fact, I expect the rank to be within the top 50 if it is truly measured,” he said.IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao welcomed the rise in its rank. “IIT-Delhi is happy to jump by 20 places in the QS Graduate Employability rankings. We have been consistently improving our rankings in both domestic and international rankings in the last few years. We have taken various measures in the last few years and they are beginning to show their impact,” he said.Naveen Jindal, founding chancellor of Jindal Global University, which entered the QS employability rankings for the first time, said, “It is a true reflection of the vision and imagination that led to the creation of JGU in 2009. It is indeed the result of the outstanding contributions of the faculty members, students and staff of JGU across all these years.This is a commendable accomplishment during this year given the impact of the global pandemic on the employment of students worldwide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-indian-institutes-in-qs-employability-rankings-iit-b-tops-the-list-101632420844061.html
24-09-2021||India||Brutal eviction drive in Assam, two killed||Police bullets allegedly killed two people, and at least nine policemen were injured in clashes during a controversial drive to evict “illegal settlers” in Assam’s Darrang district on Thursday, sparking condemnation and prompting the government to set up a probe.Police said a mob of nearly 2,000 people attacked personnel during the eviction drive at Dholpur village in Sipajhar, forcing security men to lathi charge the crowd and open fire, resulting in the deaths and injuries.But visuals of the incident showed scores of policemen firing at unseen targets behind a mass of trees, huts and chaff, and a man in vest and lungi chasing a policeman and a photographer -- a man employed with the district administration -- down a dusty slope.Groups of policemen are then seen surrounding the local resident, who suddenly collapses to the ground due to an apparent gunshot, raining him with blows of the stick, with gunfire in the background.When the melee clears, the man is seen lying motionless on the ground with an apparent gunshot wound on his chest even as the photographer, later identified by police as Bijay Shankar Baniya, repeatedly kicks and jumps on the apparently lifeless body. Gunfire rings in the background. Later, visuals show policemen trying to pull Baniya back and carrying the body away.The visuals were tweeted by some state lawmakers and local residents, but their origin was not clear. HT couldn’t independently verify the visuals.The eviction drive was being conducted in a region largely inhabited by Bengali-speaking Muslims. Baniya was arrested late in the evening, said police.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma appeared to back the police. “Police are doing their duty. As per my information, people attacked police with machetes, spears and other things,” he said, making it clear that the eviction drive will continue on Friday.Later in the evening, the government instituted an inquiry by a retired Gauhati high court judge. A formal notification detailing terms of reference of the inquiry would be issued later, officials said.Darrang district superintendent of police, Sushanta Biswa Sarma, identified the two dead men as Saddam Hussain and Sheikh Forid. He said that two policemen sustained serious injuries and were shifted to Guwahati while the others were getting treatment at Mangaldai, the district headquarters. The SP is the brother of chief minister Sarma.The killings triggered a political war with the Congress and other Opposition parties pushing for a judicial probe. “Assam is on state-sponsored fire. I stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the state- no children of India deserve this,” tweeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.The controversial eviction was first mooted when Sarma visited the area on June 7 and instructed the district administration to clear the area occupied by “illegal settlers” for a community farming project for young people hailing from the state’s indigenous communities.The evictions began at four places in Dholpur on Monday, and nearly 800 families – most of whom were Bengali-speaking Muslims – were removed from 4,500 bighas of land the government claimed ownership. The district administration cleared 602.04 hectares and demolished four “illegally” constructed religious structures at Sipajhar, officials said.But local residents said they were living in the area since the 1970s and had valid government documents to prove their ownership of the plots.Darrang SP Sushanta Biswa Sarma said nearly 1,500-2,000 persons gathered when the eviction drive began on Thursday. “At first there was no issue, but when police started removing encroachments using JCB vehicles, the mob started pelting stones and attacking the police with machetes, spears and other things,” he said.“One police officer was hit with a machete on his head and sustained serious injuries. We had to resort to firing to disperse the crowd and protect our personnel. As per our information, two civilians have been killed and 9 policemen were injured. Additional force was deployed in the area and the situation is under control now,” he added.Local activists contested this version and blamed the government for the violence and deaths. “A total of 246 persons from the area where evictions took place on Thursday had filed a petition in [Gauahati] HC seeking a stay. A hearing was slated today, but it has been deferred. There are nearly 10,000 families in the area who have been residing there for the past 40-50 years,” said Saddam Hussain, a social activist and resident of the area.“Residents were served a notice late on Wednesday night and the evictions started on Thursday. At first, people were protesting peacefully. But when police forcibly destroyed huts the residents turned hostile and the situation turned violent,” he added.State Congress president Bhupen Kumar Borah said the eviction was in violation of the Supreme Court directive not to evict anyone during the pandemic. “Yet the Assam government is behaving in an autocratic manner to evict the residents of Dholpur who have been living in the area since the 1970s. Before eviction government should have arranged for rehabilitation and alternative housing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brutal-eviction-drive-in-assam-two-killed-101632420779127.html
24-09-2021||India||In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, workers stand up for the ‘right to sit’||Her heels are cracked. All around, in a semi circle along both her feet, are sharp, deep, hardened crevices, the skin peeling off. There is pain along her heel, running through her legs. But V Saraswati is accustomed to the feeling. The hurt is a way of life. “We are treated like machines. Not like women, not like human beings. Like machines,” she says. Earlier this month, the 36-year-old watched on television, as the Tamil Nadu government became the second state in the country to mandate seemingly the most basic of rights, the right to sit, for workers in commercial establishments. Saraswati lauded the motive, but her enthusiasm was tempered by experience. “The owners will never comply.” Saraswati works at a textile shop along Chennai’s East Coast Road. The shop is small, in the basement of a building, has two sales people, but one stool. Even this is an improvement on every other place she can think of. “Because this is a small shop, only two sales people work at a time so we can sit on the stool taking turns,” she says. But these moments of deserved rest are stolen, small acts of rebellion. Saraswati first worked at a saree shop in Puducherry, before she moved to Chennai a few years ago after she was married. “In those years in Puducherry, I used to stand for eight hours straight every day. All of us in the shop were women workers and we used to rest in the toilet for a few minutes without anyone’s knowledge. The owners had strictly instructed us not to sit even if there is no customer. In bigger shops, it is much more crowded, and impossible to sit without the facility being there. But none of us can speak up because we cannot afford to lose our jobs. We need this to survive but as we grow older several health problems are showing up. We have learnt to live with the pain,” Saraswati said. On September 6, the Tamil Nadu assembly tabled a bill that proposes to amend the Tamil Nadu Shops and Establishment Act, which provides for “regulation of conditions of work in shops, commercial establishments, restaurants, theatres and other establishments”. The bill was passed by the state assembly, amidst no opposition, in a voice vote on September 13. The newly introduced section 21B mandates that in every shop and establishment, suitable arrangements for sitting shall be provided for all workers so as to avoid ‘on the toes’ situation throughout the duty time, so that they may take advantage of any opportunity to sit which may occur during the course of their work.The Tamil Nadu Act closely mirrors an amendment in the Kerala Shops and Commercial Establishment Act made in January 2019, when the latter became the first in the country to mandate the right to sit. In Kerala, the struggle for the right to sit, traces its origins to 53-year-old Palithodi Viji, and an insult she bore in response to a mundane question to her employer in 2007. She asked if she could go to the toilet. Then working at the shop of a tailor in a shopping complex at the Sweet Meat Street in Kozhikode, Viji posited the question, and was met with the suggestion to “either control herself or consume minimum water”. By that time, Viji already had a history of social struggles, founding the non-governmental organisation “Anweshi” with former Maoist leader K Ajitha in 1993 for taking up women’s issues. Stung by the comment, Viji began working on rallying support, with more and more women joining the cause, complaining of kidney ailments and infections due to the lack of menstrual hygiene and prolonged delays. In 2010, Viji created a collective of women workers called “Penkootu”, and in the same year forced the Kozhikode Corporation to take note and build a toilet on SM street. A decade later, and all commercial buildings in Kochi now have separate toilets on each floor. By 2012, with women workers constantly in discussion around her, Viji and Penkootu began a struggle for the “right to sit”. “While the struggle for toilets took three years to fructify, the right to sit took six years. Initially merchant associations said that if women wanted to sit, they could sit permanently at home. But we forced them to come around,” Viji said. Viji said that in Kerala at the time, textile shops refused to let women employees sit even if the place was empty, with many developing symptoms like swollen legs and varicose veins. “In 2012, I became furious that I received a complaint that the salary of a sales woman was cut by a textile unit in Kozhikode for leaning against a wall when a group of customers were saree shopping for a wedding. It was a major trigger, and we decided to intensify our stir,” Viji said. For her troubles, in that decade, Viji faced near constant pressure, from court cases to constant summons to police stations and labour offices. At one point, Viji says there were three cases against her, one for forcibly opening a shut toilet, and two on charges of creating unrest among workers, all three of which were later dismissed by court. There were other bureaucratic challenges too, such as the government refusing to engage with “Penkootu”, claiming that it was not a registered union. “I was forced to float another union, Asanghaditha Mekhla Thozilali Union (employees union of unorganised sector). It is still an all-women trade union working among marginalised,” Viji said. As the struggle began gaining traction throughout Kerala, in 2014, support began pouring in from across the state, including a major agitation by women textile showroom employees in Thrissur. The same year, Viji petitioned the state government, the state commission for women and then the human rights commission. Two years later, the National Human Rights Commission sought a report from the state on the poor working condition of women workers in textile shops. By 2018, the state government brought the amendment to bring the right to sit, and in January 2019, the law was passed by the state assembly. In 2018, BBC named Viji on its list of the most powerful women in the world. Gender and labour activists in Kerala say there has been a reduction in complaints after the law was amended. “After the amendment came into force, complaints came down by 80%. With changing times and job patterns we need new laws to end the exploitation of women,” said K Valsala, an activist working among women workers. In the two years that have passed since, senior police officials said that 16 cases of violations of the new law have been registered, of which 8 have been withdrawn and the rest are in court. Despite the genesis of the law in Kerala, the origin story of the bill in Tamil Nadu, is not quite of a sustained movement, but a more happy accident and an enterprising employee representative of a Labour Board that jumped at a bureaucratic stroke of luck. In the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s first tenure in power beginning 1967, when CN Annadurai was chief minister, with M Karunanidhi taking over when he died two years later, the State Labour Advisory Board (SLAB) was formed, a body with representatives of employers, employees and the state government. In the decades that followed, particularly the eighties, the SLAB was a powerful body where the state’s actions, legislations and regulations were discussed threadbare, but then slipped into a sense of redundancy. TM Murthy, general secretary of Tamil Nadu’s AITUC, and a member of the SLAB as a representative of employees, said that ordinarily, the board is meant to meet four times a year, but has had three meetings over the past decade. In 2019, he said, the Tamil Nadu government, then run by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, received word that a delegation of the International Labour Organisation was visiting the state to “understand the working of the SLAB”. “So they convened a meeting in September 2019 to show that the body is functioning and we made use of that opportunity,” Murthy says. Among the several proposals they made at the meeting was the right to sit. “Though there was no movement or demand for this, we shared with the other members that we should follow Kerala’s direction on the basis of human rights.” Sure enough, the SLAB soon received a response that the proposal had been accepted and the state government was considering it. And that was the end of it until the new government was formed in May. In July, nine trade unions held an informal meeting in July with the new labour minister CV Ganesan. “We submitted 14 proposals including the initiative to provide seating for employees,” said M Shunmugham, Rajya Sabha MP and general secretary of the DMK-represented Labour Progressive Federation. He said that over the years, employee unions fought for the right on an individual case by case basis in the state, such as in the showrooms of The Tamil Nadu Handloom Weavers’ Cooperative Society, popularly known as Co-optex. “We wanted this to be implemented universally across the state,” Shunmugham said. Two months later, the bill was passed. The bill has brought back conversations of a popular 2010 film called “Angadi Theru”(market street) that looked at the exploited lives of workers employed in a textile shop called “Senthil Murugan Stores”, with a vicious and unreasonable shop owner. Director Vasantha Balan said that he happened to observe Ranganathan street one night and was witness to how workers were being treated. “I stayed in a lodge on the street for eight months and brought in the workers to share their bitter experiences with me. It was like doing investigative journalism because they would have been fired if people knew they were speaking out. They had no support then and no support now. It is sad that the government has to bring a law instructing for them to be given stools or fans or water. They have to be treated with respect -- that was the point of the film,” Vasantha Balan said. A senior official of the Tamil Nadu labour department who did not wish to be named said that they received the minutes of last year’s meeting. “The State Labour Advisory Board has representatives from trade unions and employee unions and they had all unanimously agreed that all employees had to be provided with seating. But it didn’t move from that stage and when the new government took over they felt that it was a good initiative and it has to be introduced at the earliest. Once the bill becomes an act by notifying it in the gazette, labour inspectors for each districts would start inspecting shops to check if it’s been enforced,” the official said. Back across the state border in Kerala, Viji says she is overjoyed that Tamil Nadu too is implementing the right to sit. “Such small steps will earn dignity to working women in the unorganised sector. They are the most exploited lot in the country,” she said. But while Viji urges states across the country to similarly legislate for its employees, there is already a new struggle she has embarked on, which she hopes will find legal and administrative acceptance like the right to sit. Parity in pay in the unorganised sector. She says fiercely, “In government service, men and women draw the same salary as in the private sector. Why two payment structures in the unorganised and labour sectors? This has to stop.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-tamil-nadu-and-kerala-workers-stand-up-for-the-right-to-sit-101632420778402.html
24-09-2021||India||SC will set up expert panel on Pegasus row||The Supreme Court will set up an expert committee by itself to inquire into the alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance on Indian citizens, Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana said on Thursday. The CJI’s statement suggests that the court has virtually rejected the Union government’s plea to let it set up an “independent committee” to look into the controversy. Justice Ramana, who heads the bench which has been hearing a clutch of petitions demanding a court-monitored investigation into the unlawful snooping, added that the order will be passed next week. “We were expected to pass the order this week but it got delayed because some of the members of the technical expert team we contacted expressed personal difficulties in being part of the committee. That is why it is taking time. But we will be able to finalise the members of the committee soon. You please inform the other lawyers too that we will pass the order next week,” justice Ramana told senior advocate CU Singh, who represents one of the petitioners, during the hearing of an unconnected matter. Singh replied in the affirmative. But CJI Ramana did not elaborate on the terms of references of the proposed committee and the areas that it will look into. The detailed order, which is now expected next week, will specify those aspects.Leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha and senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge welcomed the court’s decision. “On behalf of all progressive parties, I welcome the Supreme Court’s decision to set up a committee to investigate the Pegasus snooping scam. Given its grave national security and privacy implication, every Indian hopes for an efficient and transparent probe,” Kharge said in a tweet. The court, on September 13, reserved its order in the case after the Union government said that it could not make public whether its agencies used the Israeli spyware as such disclosure will be against national interest. With this statement, the government returned to a position it articulated on August 17, before suggesting on September 7 that it could reconsider its stand. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, said at the time that the government was open to having a committee of independent domain experts who could go into all aspects of the controversy and submit its report before the bench while adding that the use of a particular software “cannot be made a part of the public discourse in the larger national interest and in the interest of the security of the nation”. The SG requested the bench to allow the government to set up an expert committee. But most of the lawyers for the petitioners, including senior counsel Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan, Rakesh Dwivedi, Dinesh Dwivedi, Colin Gonsalves and Meenakshi Arora, urged the court to reject the government’s proposal, contending that the “wrongdoer” could not be allowed to have the liberty of choosing the forum of inquiry. The lawyers submitted that the court should set up a panel consisting of members of its choice to go into the issue and report back. While reserving its order in the matter on September 13, the bench, which included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, said the court will pass an interim order shortly on the constitution of an expert committee and on other ancillary issues related to an independent inquiry after considering the materials placed by the petitioners before it and the submissions made by the counsel for the parties. Reiteration of its stand by the government also prompted the court to remark that the Centre was “beating around the bush”. The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international consortium of media outlets and investigative journalists reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. According to this consortium, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning the phone into a pocket spy. Responding to a bunch of petitions filed by lawyers, politicians, journalists and civil rights activists, the Union ministry of electronics and information technology filed a three-page affidavit on August 16 that refused to confirm or deny whether it had used Pegasus spyware for surveillance of Indians. The Centre instead offered to set up an expert committee to look into the controversy and “dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests”. On August 17, the court observed that it is “not averse” to set up an expert committee but that it expects the government to bring sufficient facts on record regarding the interception regime in India. The government, however, replied that any disclosure on its using or not using Pegasus spyware would come at the cost of national security and insisted that it will divulge such information only before the proposed committee, which, it said, can report to the top court. It also added that all interceptions were being done as per the statutory procedure, and it would not wish to put out in the public domain details of the software used for lawful surveillance by filing any additional affidavit. Following the Centre’s refusal, the court on August 17 issued a formal notice to the government on the batch of pleas filed by petitioners in the case, a list that includes advocate ML Sharma; former minister Yashwant Sinha; Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas; the Editors Guild of India; journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar; journalists Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, Rupesh Kumar Singh, Ipshita Shatakshi, SNM Abdi, and Prem Shankar Jha; and civil rights activists Jagdeep S Chhokar and Narendra Mishra. Deferring the matter for September 7, the bench had once again asked the SG to consider filing a detailed reply while observing that the court would ponder over the future course of action. On September 7, the SG asked for some time to reconsider its earlier stand, following which the matter was fixed for hearing on September 13. However, on September 13, the Centre went back to its previous stance. The SG said the government stands by its August 16 affidavit, which neither confirmed nor denied the use of the military-grade spyware to hack phones of ministers, politicians, businessmen, activists, and journalists, and which offered to set up an expert committee instead. Raising the issue of national security, Mehta added that a facade is sought to be created that the government is hiding the truth whereas its stand is clear that it is not evading any inquiry but is rather willing to have it done on its own through a committee of independent experts. But the bench remained unimpressed with the SG’s submissions on the national security aspect, pointing out that the court has already clarified it several times that it is not interested in details of national security or defence but needs some pertinent information on the surveillance module to ascertain what kind of orders should be passed. “Ultimately it is your prerogative and you have decided not to file anything. We will now pass an interim order what we have to pass,” the bench had said while reserving its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-will-set-up-expert-panel-on-pegasus-row-101632420718311.html
24-09-2021||India||Is the economy on track to exploit the festive season?||Once the pitru paksha, a fortnight considered inauspicious for new transactions by a lot of Hindus, ends on October 6, India’s much-awaited festive season will begin in earnest. The Indian economy was facing a prolonged slowdown even before the pandemic hit. Then it faced its largest-ever contraction of 7.3% in 2020-21. The sequential recovery which followed was interrupted once again by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, which peaked on May 9 if a seven-day moving average of daily new cases is taken as an indicator.With new infections under control in most parts of the country, and the pace of vaccination having risen significantly, the festive season is being looked at with anticipation as one that will give a much-needed boost to the economy. To be sure, there are both demand (long-term scars of the pandemic) and supply (such as shortage of microchips) side factors that can generate headwinds for the economy. However, it is also worth asking whether mobility levels and the general state of the economy have recovered enough to place it optimally before the festive season. Here are four charts which explain the situation.Pandemic situation has improved significantly in most parts of the countryThe seven-day average of daily new cases in India was 30,887 on September 22. While cases were declining at a much faster rate earlier, there has been no significant increase in Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks. The national picture, to be sure, is a bit misleading, because more than 60% of the total daily new cases have been coming from just one state, Kerala. While the Kerala situation continues to be critical, it has improved compared to what it was at the start of September, immediately after Onam, the biggest festival in the state. Once Kerala’s numbers are taken out, the nationwide Covid-19 scenario looks more benign. If this trajectory does not reverse itself, it will definitely give a boost to economic activity, including consumer demand, during the festive season. But workplace mobility gains seem to have stagnatedThe period after the second wave saw a significant improvement in high-frequency indicators. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI), for example, crossed 100 for the first time after the pandemic in the week ending 15th August. While NIBRI has not fallen below 100 for six weeks now, it has not increased significantly either. Similarly, the Google workplace mobility index has also stagnated to around 85-90% of baseline level of February 2020. Even on these indicators, there are state-wise differences. Mobility levels are the highest in states such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and especially lower in the North-East states.
24-09-2021||India||New simulator policy seeks to cut defence training costs, preserve military gear||The defence ministry on Thursday came out with a policy for enhanced utilisation of simulators by armed forces to impart safe and cost-effective realistic training while preserving expensive equipment.The policy seeks to reduce live equipment utilisation, ensure capability plans cater for phased induction of simulators, factor in the requirement of simulators when procurements are planned and create a coordination mechanism among various agencies for a combined purchase of simulators, the ministry said in a statement.The use of simulation is expected to reduce defence spending when military budgets are under pressure because of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.From infantry weapons to air defence systems and tanks to fighter jets, simulators play a critical role in providing training to military personnel in realistic scenarios without exposing them to operational equipment.Welcoming the new policy, former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd) said simulators are an effective way to analyse the prowess of trainees and keep honing their skills without resorting to heavy expenditure on complex operational equipment.“Factoring in that the availability of firing ranges, along with other training infrastructure, is shrinking, men should be trained on simulators and practical on-ground training can follow. All-weather training is the biggest advantage of simulators,” Jaswal said.He added that while simulators have their own benefits, they cannot offset training on actual platforms.The ministry’s statement said the aim of the policy is to transform to simulation-based training across all military domains to achieve cost-effective, safe and smart training. “The emphasis will be indigenous design and development of simulators, with outsourcing of operation and maintenance of simulators by Indian companies,” the statement said.It added that the plan was to switch to simulation-based training across all domains for combatants, leaders, maintainers, administrators, life science experts and, procurement and financial agencies.A detailed action plan with assigned responsibilities will soon be issued to all the constituents of the defence ministry and industrial associations for adequate use of simulators by the three services and the coast guard.The Indian agencies involved in the development, production and maintenance of simulators will be engaged by the armed forces to ensure the highest level of indigenisation in the production, deployment and maintenance of the equipment, officials familiar with the matter said.“The policy will be applicable to all types of simulators in use/to be procured. Avenues of application of simulation technology will be constantly explored to achieve a high level of operational preparedness while reducing expenditure on training and preserving the life of equipment,” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-simulator-policy-seeks-to-cut-training-costs-preserve-military-gear-101632398262745.html
24-09-2021||India||No technical concerns with India’s vaccine certificate: UK envoy||UK high commissioner Alex Ellis and National Health Authority chairman RS Sharma discussed vaccine certification for Indian travellers on Thursday, with the envoy describing the talks as “an important step forward”.The discussions came a day after the UK government added India’s Covishield to its list of approved Covid-19 vaccines, though the two sides are yet to reach common ground on certification so that fully vaccinated Indian travellers can skip a 10-day quarantine on arrival.Ellis said in a tweet that neither side had raised technical concerns about each other’s certification process.“Excellent technical discussions with @rssharma3 @AyushmanNHA. Neither side raised technical concerns with each other’s certification process. An important step forward in our joint aim to facilitate travel and fully protect public health of UK and India,” Ellis tweeted.Sharma responded with a tweet that said the discussions will help in the resumption of socio-economic activities between the two sides.“Echoing his excellency @AlexWEllis’s views, this will be instrumental in resuming socio-economic activities between India and UK. We also look forward to deepening ties between @AyushmanNHA and @NHSX, as we collaborate to build a digital continuum of healthcare services,” Sharma said.Both countries have stepped up efforts to sort out the vaccine row, which emerged in the open at a time when overall bilateral relations are on the upswing. The vaccine certification issue has become a problem as growing numbers of Indians, especially students, are travelling to the UK.On Tuesday, India had warned it could resort to reciprocal measures as the controversy around UK’s new travel rules, which come into force on October 4, sparked allegations of racism.Ellis had on Wednesday attributed the issue to a significant shift in the UK’s travel policy that was announced only on September 17 and made it clear that Covishield is “not a problem”. He declined to set a deadline for resolving the matter and said things are moving “at a rapid pace” on recognising India’s vaccine certification.Sharma, who supervises the functioning of the CoWIN platform, said on Wednesday that officials from both sides had two meetings this month to discuss technical aspects of each other’s certification systems, and the discussions were now closed.“In the first [meeting], the British high commissioner met me on September 2, and the second one was yesterday (September 21) between the technical teams. We made them understand how our system worked and they explained the functioning of their system to us. Both these meetings were quite fruitful,” Sharma said.People familiar with developments, who asked not to be named, said the discussions had focused on certification done through the CoWIN app, the security of the system, data sharing between the two sides, and reconciling the CoWIN system with the NHS Covid Pass developed by Britain’s National Health Service (NHS).There were also some concerns about the security of the certification system, the people said without going into details.Ellis too had confirmed the NHS was in talks with officials managing CoWIN. The UK has to have confidence in the Indian app as the movement of people from both countries could affect public health, he said.He also told NDTV channel that India continued to be in the UK’s amber list of countries as it still has some cases of Covid-19.“We’re clear Covishield is not a problem. The UK is open to travel and we’re already seeing a lot of people going from India to the UK, be it tourists, businesspeople or students. Over 62,500 student visas have been issued in the year ending June 2021, which is an increase of almost 30% as compared to the previous year. We want to make the process of travelling as easy as possible,” Ellis said in a statement.Britain’s earlier move of recognising AstraZeneca but not Covishield led to allegations of racism since the bio-equivalence between both doses has been established in scientific studies.However, the UK updated its travel guidance on Wednesday to include Covishield among the list of approved vaccines, along with the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson jabs and their formulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-envoy-talks-to-nha-chief-on-vaccine-certification-101632397242638.html
24-09-2021||India||India expresses concern over continued instability in Myanmar||NEW DELHI: India has expressed concern at the escalating situation and continued instability in neighbouring Myanmar and said it will continue to support efforts aimed at restoring the democratic process in the wake of the February 1 military coup.In a statement made during an interactive dialogue with the special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Wednesday, India said the developments in Myanmar have direct implications for the country.The special rapporteur, Tom Andrews, told the council that conditions in Myanmar following the coup have worsened and urged a “change of course” to avert further human rights abuses and deaths.The military junta and its forces have murdered more than 1,100 people, arbitrarily detained more than 8,000, and forcibly displaced more than 230,000 civilians, bringing the number of internally placed people in Myanmar to well over half a million, Andrews said.As of July, the junta has also killed at least 75 children, ranging in age from 14 months to 17 years, he said.Also Read | US court orders Facebook to release data related to violence against RohingyaIn response to Andrews’ report, the Indian representative said: “For a country that shares a long land and maritime border with Myanmar, the escalating situation in Myanmar is a matter of concern. Continued instability in Myanmar has direct implications for India. We have also been facing the situation of people crossing over the border into India from Myanmar.”Thousands of Myanmarese nationals have crossed into India’s northeastern states, especially Mizoram and Manipur.“As a democratic neighbour of Myanmar, India remains committed to strengthening the process of democratic transition in Myanmar. We have worked with various stakeholders in Myanmar to develop capacities on democratic systems and practices and we are continuing these efforts,” the Indian representative said.Reiterating India’s support for restoring the democratic process in Myanmar, the Indian representative added: “We urge the international community to work together and lend constructive support to the people of Myanmar.”The Indian side also expressed concern at the Covid-19 situation in Myanmar and in bordering regions, and said the pandemic and political situation had led to a decline in economic activity.India has provided urgent medical assistance to strengthen Myanmar’s Covid-19 response and also contributed to the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance to deliver aid to the people.“Our developmental and humanitarian efforts in Myanmar, including in the Rakhine state, have been aimed at the socio-economic development of the country,” the Indian representative said.Referring to efforts to send back displaced Rohingya people to Rakhine state, the Indian side said it was important to speed up ongoing efforts for the “safe, speedy and sustainable repatriation of the displaced persons currently in Bangladesh”. India will continue to support the Bangladesh Government in this regard.India also welcomed the appointment of Brunei’s second minister of foreign affairs Erywan Pehin Yusof as special envoy of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) chair on Myanmar and his call for a peaceful solution through constructive dialogue. “We look forward to the visit of the Asean special envoy to Myanmar and early implementation of the five-point consensus,” the Indian representative said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-expresses-concern-at-continued-instability-in-myanmar-101632390762560.html

24-09-2021||Today's||AUKUS: How not to win friends||Last week witnessed the aukward birth of a new security alliance — AUKUS — bringing together Australia, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US), coupled with a deal involving the US and the UK building eight nuclear attack submarines for Australia. The announcement was guaranteed to create waves in the Indo-Pacific, but the fallout of Australia cancelling the five-year-old deal with France for a dozen diesel-powered attack submarines created bigger waves across the Atlantic.
24-09-2021||Today's||The significance of the Modi-Harris meeting||Seconds turned into minutes, and minutes turned into an hour. A little over an hour, actually. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s meeting with the United States (US) vice-president, Kamala Harris, was now well past the outermost expectations of Indian diplomats, who were watching the clock, and dreading the worst.

24-09-2021||Editorials||2021: Focus on census, not caste||In an affidavit to the Supreme Court, the Centre has outlined the flaws in the 2011 Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC); pointed to the political, administrative and sociological challenges in enumerating caste-specific demographic assessments (Dalits and tribals are already counted); and taken a position that the 2021 census should happen as planned. This was in response to a plea by the Maharashtra government, which first decided to create separate reservations for Marathas. This breached the 50% cap set by the SC, and was overruled by the apex court. Maharashtra wanted the Centre to collect information on backward castes in the 2021 census.
