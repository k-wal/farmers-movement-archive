Over the past few years, Trinamool, the second-largest party in Parliament, has seen several leaders being moved from the Rajya Sabha even as it remains a key Opposition powerhouse.During this year’s Budget session, senior Trinamool leader and former Union rail minister Dinesh Trivedi was speaking on the motion to thank the President for his speech, when he suddenly veered to the situation in West Bengal and claimed feeling ‘suffocated’. The speech ended with his dramatic resignation from the Rajya Sabha.Trinamool had nominated doctor-turned political leader Manas Bhunia in Rajya Sabha in 2017, but he was made Bengal’s water resource minister and left Rajya Sabha this May. In the upcoming bypoll to fill that vacancy, TMC has nominated Sushmita Dev, daughter of former Union minister Santosh Mohan Dev. She left the Congress a month ago. Trivedi’s seat has gone to former Prasar Bharati CEO Jawhar Sircar, who was one of the first to frame this year’s Bengal’s assembly poll as a battle between top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and a woman (Mamata).Even Mukul Roy, once Banerjee’s most trusted aide, left the party’s Rajya Sabha seat when he resigned in 2017 to join the BJP. Roy is now back in TMC in a complicated relationship as he remains an MLA elected on a BJP ticket.While a series of Trinamool leaders have quit Rajya Sabha mid-way, former Communist Party of India (Marxist) CPI(M) leader Ritabrata Banerjee aligned himself with Banerjee’s party when he was expelled in 2017. He turned into an associate member of Trinamool before joining the party as state general secretary of its trade union wing..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/arpita-ghosh-s-resignation-from-rajya-sabha-part-of-recent-churning-in-tmc-101631758565113.html

16-09-2021||Bhopal||Three held for killing popular tigress of Bandhavgarh, fourth accused still at large||Three people were arrested on Thursday for killing Bandhavgarh’s most popular tigress, Amanalabali, and dumping her body in a well, a forest department official said. The tigress was 14 years old. A team of forest officials arrested Shivlal Baiga, Babulal Baiga and Kailash Baiga, all residents of Kanchhoha village which falls in the buffer zone of the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR). The fourth accused-- Kalyan Baiga is absconding. “They pulled out teeth, whiskers and nails of the tigress after she was killed,” said Vincet Raheem, tiger reserve’s field director. On September 1, forest officials recovered the carcass of a tigress from a well in Manpur forest range, which falls in the buffer zone of the tiger reserve. The carcass was stuffed in a sack and it was thrown into the well after loading the sack with heavy stones. There were injury marks on the carcass of the tigress. The carcass was identified as T-32, the most popular tigress in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve. “Forest officials detained Shivlal Baiga. During interrogation, Baiga confessed his crime. He said they laid a live electrified wire trap near the Damna beat of the forest to kill wild boar. But when they saw that a tiger was trapped in the wire, they disconnected the wire. They pulled out the teeth, whiskers and nails with the help of an axe,” said Raheem. The accused kept the teeth, whiskers and nails for occult practice and as a lucky charm. To hide the crime, they stuffed the carcass into a sack and threw it into the well.Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve has 124 tigers, of which 45 tigers are in the buffer zone. It is considered Madhya Pradesh’s most congested habitat for tigers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/three-held-for-killing-popular-tigress-of-bandhavgarh-fourth-accused-still-at-large-101631813836007.html

However, due to delays in shifting MCD (Delhi municipality) toll booths and lockdown imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the project was delayed, said officials.The length of the underpass, including the roads, is 1.5 kilometres, while the underground stretch is 377 metres long and seven metres wide across.Speaking at the event, Gadkari said that this U-turn underpass will ease congestion and provide relief to commuters. “We have worked on several projects to decongest Gurugram and these include several underpasses and flyovers at Signature Tower, Iffco Chowk, Rajiv Chowk and other points. We have also sanctioned new projects to ease traffic at Manesar, Bilaspur and Kapriwas,” he said.Gadkari said that besides these projects, several more worth around ₹1,200 crore have been sanctioned for smoother traffic flow on the Delhi-Jaipur highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gadkari-in-gurugram-u-turn-underpass-at-sirhaul-near-ambience-mall-to-open-by-october-15-101631813833288.html

DTCP officials said 12 shops constructed illegally on residential EWS [economically weaker section] plots were also sealed despite strong protestations by residents and owners, who were asked to abide by the rules and not to interfere in the drive.RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that to check the movement of the crowd and to prevent any miscreants from creating trouble, they deployed a drone to keep a watch on the situation. “We were supported by a large police team, which effectively maintained law and order. We had hired 50 labourers, who were directed to demolish internal walls of illegally constructed storeys on these EWS plots,” Bhath said.Bhath said that they conducted a survey of 2,600 EWS plots recently and identified several instances of illegal constructions, extensions and violations of building plans. “There is clear direction from the government that illegal structures have to be removed. We will continue the drive in coming days,” he said.DTCP officials said that the drive started around 1pm and went on till around 5pm, with around 100 police personnel keeping the crowd in check.Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement), said that they have appealed to the plot owners to restore the violations themselves, failing which their properties might be sealed. “The construction of additional storeys is in violation of Haryana Building Code of 2017 and it can’t be condoned. These structures are unsafe and in an emergency, such as an earthquake, would become difficult to manage,” he said.DTCP officials said that commercial enterprises, such as shops, restaurants and service centres, are also not allowed on these plots and such establishments must be closed.In March, the enforcement team had sealed around 150 shops in DLF Phase-3, where commercial activities, including saloons, property dealer offices, restaurants, medical shops, grocery shops, and other businesses, were being run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dlf-phase-3-amid-resistance-walls-of-10-under-construction-houses-demolished-for-norm-violations-101631813832167.html
16-09-2021||Gurugram||Gadkari in Gurugram: Electric ropeway, rail projects on the cards to ease commute between Gurugram and Delhi||The Union transport ministry is considering an electric ropeway and electric rail projects to ease commute between Gurugram and Delhi. While the ropeway project, which was earlier proposed as a pod taxi project, will connect Dhaula Kuan and Kherki Daula on the NH-48, while the electric rail project is under consideration for Dwarka Expressway, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said during a visit to Gurugram on Thursday.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had announced an electric ropeway project on the National Highway (NH-48) in 2015, but there has been little progress on the project.Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, while speaking at a gathering in Sohna on Thursday, said that the proposed cable car was his “dream project” but it could not be executed earlier as innovative mobility solutions such as ropeways, cable cars and funicular railways were not under his mandate earlier. These mobility solutions were given to the transport ministry recently.“The ropeway project is under consideration and the ministry would conduct a feasibility study for the project to connect Dhaula Kuan and Kherki Daula. Such projects will not only ease commuting but also reduce pollution,” he said.The minister also said that he was envisioning an electric mass transport system along the Dwarka Expressway. “We can look at how the existing space can be used to set up an electric rail or bus system for mass transit,” he said.Gurugram Lok Sabha member, Rao Inderjit Singh, said that the “futuristic transport projects should be planned on the lines of Rapid Rail project”, which is being set up along the main carriageway of Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. “No land acquisition has been done for this project and similar projects could be set up on Dwarka Expressway and Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway,” he said.Gadkari announced that the Sohna elevated road, being constructed at a cost of ₹1,700 crore, will be completed by March 2022. Likewise, the Dwarka Expressway in Gurugram would be completed by December 2022. “The completion of both these roads would ease traffic movement in the city,” he said.Referring to the incident where a concrete span had collapsed on Dwarka Expressway a few months ago, the minister said that NHAI would look into every aspect of the incident and that a report has also been filed by a technical committee in this regard.Gadkari said that for better roads, commuters will have to pay toll as world-class facilities can be made and maintained only if the user is ready to pay. “Better roads reduce travel time, cut pollution and ensure savings in the long run,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gadkari-in-gurugram-electric-ropeway-rail-projects-on-the-cards-to-ease-commute-between-gurugram-and-delhi-101631813830900.html

Vig, who was attending a seminar on the World Ozone Day at the Pal Auditorium of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), said, “We will pay attention on the 10 districts that reported most stubble burning cases in 2020. Some of these are Sangrur, Ludhiana, Moga, Bathinda, Ferozepur and Patiala. We will also zero in on villages with a similar poor record.” In 2020, Sangrur was the worst offender on the stubble burning front with 9,705 cases followed by Bathinda (7,806); Ferozepur (6,947); Moga (5,843); Muktsar (5,458) and Patiala (5,304). Vig added that the PPCB and the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre has developed a mobile application through which fire incidents could be tracked on phones. “Patwaris across the state have been linked through the app. They will be directed to mark a red entry in the land record of farmers found violating government guidelines. Paddy residue management is a money-spinner. The farmer needs to be a little innovative and industrious,” he added. He added that stubble management was laborious and a bit costly, but polluting the environment and making your own children and elderly sick was not a viable option at all. PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg added that the state government had allocated ₹25 crore to be given as subsidy to industrial units that incorporate stubble with rice husk for burning in their furnaces. “The department has identified 50 such industries and each unit will be given ₹25 lakh. The objective is to use one million tonne of paddy stubble for industry in the first phase,” Garg added. ‘PUNJAB WRONGLY BLAMED FOR POLLUTION IN DELHI’ PAU soil department head OP Choudhary while sharing a recent report stated that stubble burning had nothing to do with the pollution in Delhi and the national capital has to cut down on carbon emission to decrease it pollution level. “Stubble burning is a localised problem and caused more harm to residents of Punjab than any other location,” he said, adding that chlorine rich particulates from e-waste and plastic waste- burning emissions were responsible for reducing the visibility of Delhi in winters. Meanwhile, PPCB has started a state-wide two-month awareness programme against stubble burning as well with Patiala its first stop. Chairman Vig added that with the burning of stubble, environment is polluted, land fertility depletes and friendly insects die. He added that the Centre had set up an air commission to cover Punjab, Haryana, UP and National Capital Region (NCR) areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ppcb-to-come-down-hard-on-stubble-burning-10-districts-on-its-radar-101631813709889.html
16-09-2021||Pune||Phadke subway in Kothrud reopens, others need attention||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday reopened Phadke subway in Kothrud, much to the relief of pedestrians. While Phadke subway was opened following complaints by civic activist Vivek Velankar, other subways in the city are either closed or filled up with mud and rainy water.The city has a total of 17 subways for pedestrians. The subways at Deccan Gymkhana and Pune railway station has been operational with good response, but other such structures are lying idle due to lack of or mixed response.Of the 17 subways, three are allowed only for vehicles with one each at Bharati Vidyapeeth on Satara road, Wakadewadi and the third near Pushpamangal hall close to Bibwewadi.PMC additional engineer Shrinivas Bonala who is in charge of subways in the city accepted that some subways are closed citing various reasons.“Some subways are indeed closed for various reasons, but right now I do not have the exact numbers. PMC had given the responsibility to regional ward offices to take care of the subways and take a call on reopening or keeping them closed. Even the maintenance work of the subways is carried out by regional ward offices,” said Bonala.Residents and activists complained that PMC has not scientifically planned the subways, and so some of them did not get any response.“PMC is interested only in erecting infrastructure and do not care for its maintenance. Ideally, the civic body should have carried out maintenance work during the pandemic. Even most of the underpass erected are unscientific. PMC didn’t check whether there is a need for an underpass or overhead bridge in the area. That’s why they are getting mixed responses from people. For example, PMC built a foot over bridge (FBO) at Mayur Colony in Kothrud and also installed a lift. But no one is bothered whether the lift is functional or not,” said Velankar.One such subway on Jungli Maharaj road near Modern College has not been used as pedestrians find it inconvenient. It was reopened for a brief period before lockdown but was closed again as schools and colleges are closed. At many places, garbage and mud have blocked the way.Earlier in May 2021, Parisar NGO had found the conditions of FOBs and subways across the city to be in a poor state in an independent survey conducted earlier this year.The survey assessed the condition of 13 pedestrian subways and nine FOBs in Pune after a physical site visit and conditions using parameters defined in the city’s pedestrian policy.The report submitted to the PMC showed that many facilities of subways and FOBs are poor in terms of lighting, ventilation, have no fire fighting equipment, and have water seepage.Ramesh Bafna, a citizen said, “The subway at Pushpamangal was built for pedestrians first but allowed later for two-wheelers. It was filled with mud due to rains and has become very difficult to walk from there. By considering that citizens prefer to cross the road by taking a risk.”The elected members are also pressing to reopen the subways though officials at PMC ward offices are reluctant.“As schools, colleges and most of the offices working on less capacity, the traffic on roads is less. By considering this, PMC administration prefers to close the subways,” said a civic officer on condition of anonymity.“I have given instructions to our department to carry out inspection of subways in the city. During lockdown for security reasons, all the subways were closed. As per citizens demand, some subways were reopened. We are conducting a survey mainly for electric works and whether tubes are operational, leakage and whether ward offices have provided the security,” said Bonala.Other officers from Bibvewadi ward said on the condition of anonymity that the subway near Sai Temple at Swargate has been closed for years as it was used playing cards or became the den for drinkers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/phadke-subway-in-kothrud-reopens-others-need-attention-101631812870748.html

16-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders eviction of abusive son from parents’ flat||The Bombay high court (HC) ordered a Santacruz resident to be evicted from the flat of his 90-year-old father and 89-year-old mother on the grounds of harassing the elderly couple with an intention to grab the premises. A single judge bench of justice Girish Kulkarni rejected the petition by the Santacruz resident after noticing that his aged parents were suffering at the hands of their only son and his wife. “This is a classic case where the petitioner intends to prevent his parents from leading a normal life at their old age,” said justice Kulkarni. Noticing that this was a case of old parents suffering at the hands of their only son and his wife, the court observed, “It appears that there is certainly some element of truth in the popular saying that daughters are daughters forever and sons are sons till they are married.”The petitioner had moved the Bombay HC challenging the October 21, 2020 order of the Senior Citizens Tribunal, directing him and his wife to vacate the Santacruz (West) apartment of his parents in 30 days, after noticing that the elderly couple was being harassed for years.His lawyer pointed out that in February 2010, the petitioner’s mother had filed a complaint under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (DC) Act, and in the final order passed on it in January 2016, the magistrate court had clearly that the complainant was not be entitled to orders evicting her son and daughter-in-law from the flat. He submitted that the tribunal could not have passed the eviction order in view of the magistrate’s observations.The HC, however, noted that the magistrate himself had noted that the aged parents were living in terror and suffering at the hands of the son and daughter-in-law. The magistrate had seen strong possibility of dispossession of the aged couple and had passed protection orders.Justice Kulkarni also noted that the son owned three residential premises — two in Navi Mumbai and one at Dahisar, but was insisting on staying at the Santacruz flat.The Bombay HC, therefore, rejected the petition observing that the provisions of the Senior Citizens Act are required to be construed to take within the ambit of maintenance all facets that would aid the senior citizens to lead a normal life and would certainly include the senior citizen’s right to property.Besides, the court said, the flat was not an ancestral property on which the son can claim any legal right so as to keep himself on such property along with his family and foist themselves on the parents against their wishes. “This itself is a harassment and/or defeating the parents right to lead a normal life,” said the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-eviction-of-abusive-son-from-parents-flat-101631812749605.html

16-09-2021||Pune||Researchers from Deccan College, IIT Kharagpur to study climate change during Indus Valley Civilisation||Researchers from Pune-based Deccan College and IIT Kharagpur have undertaken a study to understand the human response to a similar climate change that could have affected the Indus Valley Civilisation. The project aims to establish biological relations, if any, to climate change that is believed to have contributed to the downfall of the civilisation starting approximately 2,000 BCE.According to researchers, the project will study isotopes in land shells from archaeological sites to retrieve data on past changes in seasonality over century-level timescales.Aarti Deshpande-Mukherjee, archaeologist, Deccan College, is the principal investigator of the project along with professor Anindya Sarkar from the geology department of IIT Kharagpur, co-investigator in the project. Sushama Deo, a retired professor at Deccan College is also one of the investigators in the project.The research will also involve researchers from the physical research laboratory, Kutch University, and the Archaeological Survey of India.Mukherjee said the main aim of the project is to study the climate change, environment and various other factors of the civilisation which exists thousands of years before.“Also, how the people responded to the change of climate and weather conditions during that period was it similar to the existing conditions or was completely different. All this is going to be a part of our study and when the results will come then only we can tell more about it. For this, we have identified two sites in our country - Gujarat and Haryana state. It is a three years project and will probably complete by the end of 2024,” she said.The project was sanctioned and to be funded by the Science Engineering Research Board (SERB) under the Department of Science and Technology (DST) of the Government of India.“Today is the world of collaboration and for such research and findings, we need to work along with other institutes in the country. So the project is done in integration by Deccan College with IIT Kharagpur. It is a unique project to work on, we have already started the work on it, one of which is Bhirana in Haryana and Dholavira from Gujarat. This is an interesting subject to work on, people have a curiosity about how was civilisation in our country around 4,000 years back and what happened to it later. It will be a fruitful project and interesting results will come out once the studies are completed,” she saidRecently, Dholavira was tagged as a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage site, becoming the third such site in Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/researchers-from-deccan-college-iit-kharagpur-to-study-climate-change-during-indus-valley-civilisation-101631812629578.html
16-09-2021||Mumbai||Active Covid cases in Mumbai surge by 62% in a month, BMC on alert||In the past one month, the number of active Covid-19 cases has increased by 62.3% in Mumbai, as per the civic body. Anticipating a further rise in cases in the next 14 days, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has instructed ward officers to activate buffer beds at Covid Care Centres (CCCs). On August 15, the city had 2,834 active Covid cases, which on September 15 increased to 4,602, according to BMC. However, as per data by the public health department, active cases in the city have seen a surge of 77.2% with active cases increasing from 3,096 on August 15 to 5,488 on September 15. On Wednesday, Mumbai recorded a test positive rate (TPR) of 1.71% with 514 new Covid-19 cases. As a result, BMC has started taking preparatory measures. “We have already instructed ward officers to increase buffer beds reserved in CCCs to avoid any shortage of beds in case the number of patients increases. We will also station more healthcare workers (HCWs) at these centres to attend to these patients, in addition to making arrangements to keep oxygen supply facilities at a stand by,” said Suresh Kakani, additional BMC commissioner. “For the third wave, we will keep 70,000 beds in CCCs,” he added.State health minister Rajesh Tope had earlier said the government might impose restrictions if the daily consumption of oxygen reaches 700 metric tonnes per day. Some wards like E and A that cover Byculla and Fort, respectively, are recording a surge in cases. As of September 15, both these wards have recorded seven-day positivity rate of 0.09% — the highest in the city. Of the 508 active beds, where patients can immediately get admitted to, in E ward, 272 beds are occupied which accounts for 55% occupancy. Private hospitals are recording higher admission rates of Covid-19 patients as compared to August. Of the eight beds reserved in Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU) at LH Hiranandani Hospital in Powai, seven are occupied. “As the global trend predicts, Mumbai will also face the third wave, mostly by the end of September or middle of October. In the past two weeks, we are seeing a steady rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. In this festival season, testing has gone down, so, many Covid-19 patients are going undetected. But with the end of the festival, we might see a surge in the next two-three weeks,” said Dr Neeraj Tulara, infectious disease specialist at the hospital.As HT reported earlier, BMC has predicted that in the possible third wave, the city might record around 125,000 new Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/active-covid-cases-in-mumbai-surge-by-62-in-a-month-bmc-on-alert-101631812509479.html
16-09-2021||Mumbai||304 samples positive for Delta variant of Covid virus in genome sequencing in Mumbai||In the second cycle of genome sequencing done at Kasturba Hospital, 304 samples, of the total 376 samples that were collected, tested positive for the Delta subtype of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. None of the samples tested positive for the Delta Plus variant, which is considered more communicable. Results of the second cycle were declared by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday.The Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, was first detected in India in late 2020 and is largely the more dominant variant. Delta Plus (AY.1) is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant and was detected in the state during the second wave. In June, the Union health ministry declared it as the variant of concern.According to the results of this second cycle, two samples were tested for the 19A subtype, and four samples were of the 20A subtype. The remaining 66 samples were tested for the common Covid virus.Similarly, in the first cycle of genome sequencing, results of which were declared in August, none of the 188 samples had tested positive for the Delta Plus variant. However, 128 samples out of the 188 had the Delta variant. Giving details of the first cycle on Thursday, BMC said, out of the 128 samples, 93 patients were from Mumbai. Of these 93 patients, around 58% or 54 patients needed hospitalisation, while 42% or 40 patients showed no symptoms at all. Also out of the same 93 patients, 27 patients had taken both vaccine doses, and 20 patients had taken their first dose. Only four patients out of those who had been fully vaccinated needed oxygen support.Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant. Kasturba Hospital has a genome sequencing laboratory, that was inaugurated at the hands of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on August 4 this year, making it the first civic-run hospital to conduct the tests in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/304-samples-positive-for-delta-variant-of-covid-virus-in-genome-sequencing-in-mumbai-101631812329502.html

Some districts have a high weekly positivity rate, but that is also reducing week-on-week. It is not so that their positivity is increasing, it is higher than the state’s average,” he said. However, Ahmednagar’s weekly positivity rate is on an upward trajectory. The data showed that its positivity rate was 4.70% between August 18 and 24. Subsequently, it rose to 4.85% between August 25 and 31. It breached the 5% mark in the subsequent week at 5.35%. Ahmednagar, along with four other districts, have been designated as districts to keep a watch on by the state health department. The four districts include Pune, Sangli, Nashik and Satara. Nashik district’s weekly positivity saw a jump. Between August 25 and 31, it was 2.52%, which climbed to 3.34% between September 1 and 7. Between September 8 and 14, it was 3.76%. A state health department official, who did not wish to be named, said, “We carry out weekly review of the Covid-19 situation. We are not just looking at these five districts, but also other districts as the spurt can happen from any location. Weekly monitoring will give us time to act. With activities opened up across states, coupled with festival season, there is a fear of increase in viral activity. However, whenever the possible third wave come, we are prepared for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/70-of-active-covid-cases-since-sept-5-are-coming-from-five-districts-of-maharashtra-101631812149525.html
16-09-2021||Lucknow||Schools, colleges in Uttar Pradesh to remain shut on Friday, Saturday amid heavy rainfall||All schools and colleges in Uttar Pradesh will remain closed for the next two days in the wake of incessant rainfall, the chief minister's office said on Thursday. The decision was made after reports of deaths and injuries in separate rain-related incidents across the state since Wednesday night.Ranvir Prasad, the relief commissioner of UP, had earlier confirmed to HT about incidents of kuccha houses caving in due to heavy showers. Citing information provided from respective district magistrates, Prasad said that about 14 deaths were reported in those incidents till Thursday evening."The information is being compiled and districts officials have been directed to ensure proper medical treatment to the injured and monetary relief to the kin of the deceased,” he added. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has indicated that monsoon is unlikely to retreat from north India by September-end. The weather department said rainfall activity is likely to increase over Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal with fairly widespread to widespread rainfall and isolated heavy falls over above areas on September 18-19. "There are no signs of monsoon withdrawal from north India for the next 10 days," news agency PTI quoted IMD Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra as saying.Meanwhile, Delhi is also witnessing record rainfall as it breached the 400-mm mark this month. Till Thursday evening, the national capital recorded 404.4 mm of rainfall, the maximum rainfall recorded in September since 417.3 mm in 1944 in the same month."On and off rains will continue till September 23-24 due to the expected late withdrawal of monsoon," PTI quoted Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Skymet Weather, as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/schools-colleges-in-up-to-remain-shut-on-friday-saturday-amid-heavy-rainfall-101631809178765.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||Expert suggests opening all gates of metro stations, DDMA yet to take a call||During a recent meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), the director of the National Centre for Disease Control, Dr Sujit Kumar Singh suggested that all gates of Delhi Metro stations should be opened in order to reduce congestion for passengers, PTI reported. The DDMA is yet to decide on this matter as Delhi Metro continues operating at its full seating capacity with no standing travel to avoid overcrowding.The meeting was chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal. Dr Singh pointed out that only some gates of metro stations were opened and advised opening of all gates at the earliest as this would lead to lesser congestion.At present, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is facilitating the entry of passengers at all stations through 276 gates. A DMRC official told PTI on Thursday that the opening of more gates would lead to more passengers entering the metro stations. “We are following the guidelines of the DDMA and some gates are closed at metro stations. The opening of more gates would lead to more people inside the station. We will follow the guidelines of the DDMA,” the official said.In 2021, Delhi Metro services were suspended when the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government imposed a complete lockdown in the national Capital on April 19 due to a massive increase in coronavirus disease cases during the more infectious second wave of the pandemic.As the situation started improving in June, the DMRC started metro services with 50% seating capacity and no standing travel. Since July 26, trains have been running at full capacity with no standing passenger allowed.Hindustan Times reported last week that despite the DMRC allowing full seating capacity in trains, Delhi Metro is running at just 20% of its capacity. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy, CSE, told HT that there are apprehensions among people that travelling in close proximity with others will increase the chances of getting infected with Covid-19.Delhi has so far recorded 1,438,373 cases, 25,084 deaths, 1412880 discharges and 409 active cases due to the viral disease. On Thursday, 28 people were detected as Covid-19 positive while 22 patients recovered. After seeing zero deaths for more than one week, one Covid-19 patient died on Thursday, the second fatality reported in September -- the earlier was on September 7.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/expert-suggests-opening-all-gates-of-metro-stations-ddma-yet-to-take-a-call-101631810194330.html

This is despite the education department being aware of the matter and promising to check this blatant toying with the system. This HT reporter did a reality check outside a Government Senior Secondary School in the city and found that the this time, history question paper of Class 11 had been leaked. A couple of students had the question paper on their phones, outside the centre. Later, the same question paper was distributed inside the hall. HT has photographs to prove this. A student claimed he had got the question paper from a YouTube channel. Source said that on Tuesday evening, a YouTube channel, Virdi Blog, had uploaded question papers of exams scheduled for Thursday (September 16)Responding to the leaks that started from Monday, Punjab education secretary Krishan Kumar has ordered the department to conduct exams in two shifts. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had also ordered immediate steps to plug this breach in the system. Meanwhile, the principal of the school that HT visited on Thursday claimed to unaware of the leak. When shown the two photos of the question paper on mobile and the one distributed to students, she said, “We are working hard to check this. After receiving the question paper over e-mail around 8am today, we got them photocopied, strictly as per department guidelines. I was not aware that the department had not changed the question paper.” She added that the entire examination system had now become an object of ridicule. Sukhdarshan Singh, the whistle-blower in the entire matter, claimed, “The social studies question paper of Class 10 held today was also leaked on YouTube. I fail to understand that why has the department not approached the police to date.” Sukhdarshan is the president of Anti-Cheating Teachers’ Front, Punjab, and he has also uploaded his complaint online on a request from chief ministers’ office (CMO). Despite messages and calls, district education officer Lakhvir Singh Samra remained unavailable for comment. Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma also chose not to respond to text messages and calls from this reporter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-stopping-pseb-question-paper-leaks-class-11-history-exam-out-this-time-101631808789355.html
16-09-2021||Other||New room coming up at Rabri’s Patna residence for Lalu||PATNAPreparations are afoot at the sprawling 10, Circular road bungalow in Patna, allotted to former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi, ahead of the imminent return of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad, who has been away from the state since his conviction fodder scam cases and subsequent incarceration in December 2017, party sources said.A new room is coming up at the bungalow and will be equipped with medical facilities and a visitors’ enclosure for Prasad, who has been undergoing treatment for several ailments in New Delhi, where he is currently staying at his daughter and Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti’s official residence. Party insiders said the new room is being constructed at the ground floor of the main house inside the bungalow where there will be adequate medical facilities, a doctor’s enclosure, one medical bed and a separate visitors’ enclosure for Lalu Prasad once he returns to Patna, possibly in October. The bungalow is allotted in the name of Rabri Devi in her capacity as the leader of the opposition in the state’s Legislative Council, sources said. A party source said the new constructions would take another 10-15 days to complete. Prasad, who has also served railway minister and Bihar’s chief minister, was released from jail on bail in April this year while undergoing treatment at AIIMS in New Delhi. “Previously, Laluji used to stay on the first floor of the main house, but now he has been advised against climbing stairs. So the ground floor is preferable,” said Bhola Yadav, RJD’s ’ national general secretary and a close aide of the 74-year-old Prasad. “We are hoping Laluji will return back by end of October. It will all depend on the suggestions of doctors attending to him in New Delhi and decision by family members,” said Yadav. RJD chief’s family doctor in Patna, Dr S K Sinha, could not be reached for comments. A frail looking RJD chief has been seen in public quite a few times in recent months and has interacted with the party workers through video conferencing, including on RJD’s foundation day event on July 11. “We are hoping that RJD chief would be in Patna during the Chhath festival, which has been a big event in the his family for years,”said another RJD leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-room-coming-up-at-rabri-s-patna-residence-for-lalu-101631808250412.html
16-09-2021||Lucknow||14 killed, several injured in rain related incidents across UP||LUCKNOW/ PRAYAGRAJ/ VARANASI At least 14 people, including three children, were killed and several injured in separate rain related incidents across Uttar Pradesh on Thursday, state relief department officials confirmed. “Several incidents of kuccha houses caving in due to heavy showers have been reported across the state since Wednesday night. Around 14 deaths were reported in these incidents till Thursday evening, as per information provided by the respective districts magistrates. The information is being compiled and districts officials have been directed to ensure proper medical treatment to the injured and monetary relief to the kin of the deceased,” said Ranvir Prasad, relief commissioner of UP.Seven deaths were reported from Prayagraj and Pratapgarh districts. A woman identified as Anita, 55, died when a mud wall caved in and fell on her in Muthiaganj of Prayagraj on Thursday morning.A mud house also collapsed due to heavy rain in Semra Veerbhanpur village of Mauaima area of Prayagraj resulting in the death of one Rammurat Yadav, 49 while two persons were also injured in a similar incident at Bongi village in Ghoorpur area of the district. Similarly, one Ramzan Ali, 18, died while four of his family members sustained serious injuries when their house collapsed in Reri village in Jethwara area of Pratapgarh. One Kalawati, 65, of Lauli village in Kohdaur area of Pratapgarh died when her house collapsed on Thursday morning while one Urmila Devi, 67, also succumbed to her injuries, which she sustained when her mud house collapsed in Gehrichak village of Kandhai in Pratapgarh.Meanwhile, three of a family died in two incidents of wall collapse in Jaunpur.

16-09-2021||Other||Bihar panchayat polls: Trend reverses,women emerge as ‘better half’ after 50% quota||PATNAA former commissioner with Chief Vigilance Commission is set to contest the panchayat election in Bihar from Raj Singhwahini panchayat in Sonbarsa block of Sitamarhi district, which was represented for the last five years by his wife, who now wants to move on to state-level politics, breaking the stereotype that men use women as proxy in grassroots politics, in which Bihar was the first state to provide 50% reservation to women in 2006.Arun Kumar’s wife Ritu Jaiswal, as mukhiya of Raj Singhwahini panchayat, has been a recipient of the “Champions of Change” award from vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu and the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Panchayat Sashaktikaran Puraskar (DDUPSP), 2019, by union minister of panchayati raj Narendra Singh Tomar for her work.Ritu had contested the last Assembly election on RJD ticket and narrowly lost. This may be an isolated case, but it also underlines the changing trend. Despite reservation, Ritu had won from a general seat and contested against male counterparts. The statistics this year also indicate that more women are interested in jumping into the election fray than the 50% quota.Woman candidates have outnumbered men in the forthcoming panchayat elections by a good margin in the first two phases and the trend is likely to continue, considering the growing awareness among women in the rural areas, which was reflected during the last panchayat elections as well as Assembly and Lok Sabha voting patterns.In the first phase, 15,328 candidates filed their nomination for different panchayat posts, of which 9,093 were women, which comes to 52.79%. For the second phase, 76,279 candidates filed their nominations, including 40,168 women, ie. 52.65%. Bihar had 71,046 women out of 1,36,573 panchayati representatives after the 2016 panchayat polls. This comes to 52.025% representation of women. “It shows gender imbalance in Bihar’s rural governance is gone, gender stereotypes are breaking and it would gradually end apprehensions about women being projected as proxies for their husbands. Women enjoying empowerment has started making a difference, as it will gradually help change the male-dominated climate not only in grassroots politics, but also in improving their much-needed participation in workforce. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has been assiduously working on this from day one and now women are in every field,” said Bihar’s information and public relations minister Sanjay Kumar Jha.Female literacy in Bihar went up from a mere 37% in 2005-06 to 60% in 2015-16, though still the lowest in the country, and is expected to go further up in the new Census, as girls have been outnumbering boys at the secondary level also. As per the National Statistical Organisation report released in 2020, the female literacy rate in rural Bihar stood at 58.7% while it was 75.9% in urban areas.Despite constituting less than 9% of the total number of candidates in the fray, women showed far greater enthusiasm than their male counterparts in voting in Bihar during the Lok Sabha elections. In the moderate overall voter turnout of 57.46% in the state, women’s share was close to 60%, even though Bihar has an adverse sex ratio.In the 2020 assembly elections also, women outnumbered men in voting. While the voting percentage for women was almost 60%, it was just 54.6% for men.“The reservation to women at the panchayat level has certainly contributed to their empowerment, as their voting behaviour has changed since 2006. Women have outnumbered men in voting consistently since 2010. It has strengthened the democratic process through gender participation and equality and now their participation in grassroots politics will created upward pressure and make more room for them with or without reservation,” said former DM Diwakar, former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.“Such is the level of enthusiasm that many women have resigned from the posts in the self help groups (SHG), formed by JEEVIKA, the Rural Livelihood Project of the rural development department. They want to fight Panchayat elections and so they resigned from the JEEVIKA group before filing nominations,” Nagendra Kumar, a social activist from Nalanda, said. Akhtari, another social activist who has been working among rural women for year, said awareness about the constitutional rights of women and of the power system has grown among women in rural areas. “I feel more enthusiasm among rural women for the Panchayat elections this time in comparison to the previous elections after the reservation of 50% seats for women in Panchayats by Nitish Kumar government in 2006. In the first post reservation Panchayat elections in 2011, not many rural women were aware about the reservations they were given while in the second Panchayat elections in 2016, women were not so confident of being candidates for Mukhiya or ward members,” she said. But the saddest part is that participation of women from the Muslim community in the entire exercise seems to be quite low, she says.

16-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra objects to GST Council meeting in Lucknow||Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday raised objections and asked why the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting was being held in Lucknow instead of online. He said his request to attend the meeting online is yet to be accepted. Pawar, who handles the finance portfolio in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, also indicated that Maharashtra will oppose any attempt to encroach on the state’s power while adding more provisions to GST. He was speaking in the context of the speculations over inclusion of petrol and diesel in GST. The GST Council is meeting in Lucknow on Friday and is likely to discuss bringing petrol, diesel and other petroleum products under its ambit. If the proposal is accepted, it will lead to a drastic reduction in central and state levies on petrol and diesel, and bring down consumer prices of automobile fuels substantially. The matter will be brought before the council for discussion as per the direction of the Kerala high court that had, in June, issued directions to decide on including petrol and diesel under the ambit of GST, as per reports.“There are reports that petrol and diesel are likely to be brought under GST and only one tax is levied, but we have yet to be officially informed about it (by the GST Council). We have formed our strategy in case any such proposal is coming for discussion. I am of the view that the Centre should do its work and the powers of the states should not be reduced. Stamp duty and excise are revenue sources for the state but maximum revenue comes from GST, thus we want the status quo to be maintained,” Pawar said.“If they want to discuss bringing petrol and diesel under GST ambit then we all will express our opinions. We will take a clear stand if any attempt is made to reduce the state’s power,” he added.“I have also submitted our opinion in writing which was sought by the GST Council, which I will not be able to disclose, but our opinion is clear that the states should not be left to face (financial) losses. The commitment given on the floor of the House (Parliament) while implementing GST should be implemented in letter and spirit,” the minister said.He further said that they have also expressed their stand before Niti Aayog officials who visited Mumbai and had a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and senior ministers including Pawar recently.Objecting to the meeting at Lucknow, Pawar said, “We have demanded that the meeting be held in Delhi but they refused to budge. Later, we demanded permission to attend it online, which we have been doing owing to Covid-19 pandemic. The request was made in the backdrop of Covid-19 and new rules for flights, but they have to give any permission.”The state finance minister said he was hoping to get permission to attend it online as Prime Minister Narendra Modi took online meetings of the chief ministers. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, too, has held many online meetings apart from online meetings of GST Council held during Covid lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-objects-to-gst-council-meeting-in-lucknow-101631807889466.html
16-09-2021||Mumbai||NGT admits petition challenging Mumbai’s Versova beach revamp||Mumbai: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) this week admitted the hearing of a petition challenging ongoing development works at Versova Beach, which is alleged to be in violation of coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearances granted by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA). The petition, filed by environmentalist Zoru Bhatena, also emphasised that the beach has previously been known as a nesting site for protected Olive Ridley turtles while seeking the court’s intervention in stopping the construction work.A two-judge bench led by justices M Sathyanarayanan and Dr Arun Kumar Verma found, prima facie, that merit in the grievances detailed in Bhatena’s petition, and has ordered the respondents to be given notices in the matter. These include the PWD, MCZMA, the state environment impact assessment authority, the municipal corporation and the district collector. The matter will be next heard on September 29. The NGT also cited an October 2020 order of its principal bench which called for the protection of beaches in Goa on account of them being nesting sites for Olive Ridley turtles.Public works department (PWD) officials had anonymously confirmed to HT last month that an elevated walkway is being constructed along Versova beach and will be completed in the next three to four months. The project, however, seemingly violates Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) instructions laid down at the time of recommending the project for Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) clearance in 2017.The minutes of an MCZMA meeting from June 2017 state that PWD has not been allowed to construct an elevated walkway or undertake any work of the scale that is currently happening on site. The sandy beach is a CRZ-I area where construction activities are prohibited, the coastal authority has noted in response to similar proposals by Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) and Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada), which have, at different times, sought to carry out “beautification” of the beachfront.PWD was allowed to go ahead with the ostensible purpose of their proposal to reconstruct an existing 1.2-km anti-erosion bundh from Picnic Cottage to the Hindu crematorium before Versova Koliwada. This bundh, PWD had submitted, was essential for protecting properties along the stretch “from further damage caused by the tidal action”. MCZMA had categorically prohibited any promenade construction or reclamation of the CRZ-1 area and allowed for the bundh to be remodelled into a sea wall.“But the current work of constructing a new wall, eight metres from the original bundh, has neither been recommended nor approved by MCZMA. The eight-metre gap has been backfilled to about 16 feet above sea level and the walkway is to be built over that, according to the plans we have obtained. What is expressly not permitted cannot be done by creative engineering. A walkway cannot be created in the garb of anti-erosion measures,” said Bhatena, who has raised the issue with various authorities in three complaint letters dating to early 2020.Shiv Sena member of Parliament (MP) Gajanan Kirtikar and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of legislative assembly (MLA) Bharati Lavekar have also written to authorities seeking clarification on the project. Their letters also reveal that Aaditya Thackeray, state environment minister and guardian minister for Mumbai suburbs, has ordered a “temporary stay” on the work, which has led to the creation of a 1.2km long wall about eight metres from the original high-tide line, with tetrapods dumped on its seaward side. Earth has been backfilled into an eight-metre space between the original high-tide line and the new anti-erosion wall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ngt-admits-petition-challenging-mumbai-s-versova-beach-revamp-101631807830461.html

The injured were currently undergoing treatment, and condition of one of them was said to be serious. Fire tenders and jumbo tankers were pressed into service following the mishap. The plant was later sealed, Begusarai district magistrate (DM) Arvind Kumar Verma said, adding that security personnel were deputed there.A team was also constituted to probe the incident, said refinery officials.As per available information, the blast, which took place around 11.45 am, could be heard as far as three to four kilometres from the refinery and shattered the windows of some houses.Enraged over the incident, scores of locals, including family members of the injured, staged a protest against the refinery authorities on its premises, alleging that authorities were not maintaining a proper security system in the plant. DM Verma said of the 17 injured persons, six contract labourers were discharged after preliminary treatment at the refinery’s first-aid centre. Six more labourers were admitted to Sadar hospital, of which one was said to be serious due to head injury. The remaining five were employees who were undergoing treatment at Barauni refinery hospital and all of them were out of danger, he said. When contacted, executive director of the refinery, Shukla Mistry, said the reason behind the incident was said to be a blast in one of the atmospheric vacuum Units. “The plant was shut down for last one month. In last two days, employees and labourers tried to start the plant. On Thursday morning, a blast in the furnace occurred due to technical error, causing injuries to people. A probe team has been constituted in this connection,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/17-injured-in-barauni-refinery-blast-101631807829226.html
16-09-2021||Patna||Sand mining raids: Ex-Bhojpur SP didn’t touch salary in his 11-yr service, says EOU||Former Bhojpur superintendent of police (SP) Rakesh Kumar Dubey, who was suspended in June this year for his alleged links with the sand mining mafia, hardly touched money in his salary account during his 11-year service period, according to sleuths of Bihar Economic Offences Unit (EoU) who carried out simultaneous searches at his properties on Thursday. Dubey was earlier booked in a case of disproportionate assets (DA) worth ₹2.55 crore.The searches were conducted at the suspended SP’s residential house at Gandhi Park in the state capital, a flat in Danapur locality, Sachin Residency Hotel and his ancestral house in Jharkhand’s Jasidih. Dubey joined as a deputy SP in Bihar Police in 2010. During his 11-year tenure, he was posted at Patna, Gaya, Special Task Force, Anti-Terrorism Squad and as an aide-de-camps to state Governors. EoU officials said they were preparing a list of all his properties, including fixed deposits, vehicles and plots, adding that a DA case under Sections 13 (2) and 13 (1) (B) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, was lodged Wednesday with the EoU police station against Dubey. During investigation, EoU found that the suspended SP had invested his money in real state companies across the country, including in Patna. Dubey has allegedly invested in IPC Infrastructure, Ranchi, Kamini Infrastructure Private Limited, Patliputra Builders, Khyati Construction, Max Blif in Noida, Build Con and other real state companies. Additional director general of EoU, Nayyar Husnanin Khan, told HT that a court in Patna had on Wednesday issued a search warrant for locations that were searched. “During the search, EoU found a transaction of ₹25 lakh in the account of one Khyati Construction Company Pvt Ltd. Dubey also amassed properties in the name of his mother and sister. He also has investment in Sachindra Residency Hotel, Sukhdani Restaurant and a marriage hall in Jharkhand,” said Khan, adding that during his tenure as Phulwarisharief DSP, Dubey purchased expensive land. The EoU also seized incriminating documents, including those showing ₹12 lakh investment in mutual funds, the official said.“This is the first major crackdown on a SP rank officer this year,” said a senior police officerThe EoU had carried out searches at houses, flats and other known properties of four other suspended officers since May 1 this year — Dehri subdivisional officer Sunil Kumar Singh, Paliganj subdivisional police officer Tanvir Ahmad, Ara SDPO Pankaj Kumar Rawat and motor vehicles inspector Binod Kumar of Ara. Sources said Dubey was under EoU’s surveillance since May 1 this year after they discovered that Bhojpur was allegedly turning out to be a hub of illegal mining trade. Sand mining is banned in Bihar. On May 17 this year, principal secretary of mining and geological department, Harjot Kaur Bamhrah, had written to Bihar police chief S K Singhal, mentioning that illegal mining, storage and transportation of sand could not be possible without connivance of police. Sources in the home department said that several IPS and IAS officers in charge of districts were also under EoU’s scanner. “Such officers indulging in the illegal trade have stopped using their cell phones and were instead using phones of middlemen to carry out the illegal acts,” sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/sand-mining-raids-ex-bhojpur-sp-didn-t-touch-salary-in-his-11-yr-service-says-eou-101631807709767.html
16-09-2021||Mumbai||610 Covid patients in Mumbai given antibody cocktail, get speedy relief: Doctors||A dozen Covid-19 patients have received the monoclonal antibody cocktail on a daycare basis at the civic-run SevenHills Hospital. In all, the hospital has administered the experimental therapy to 610 patients and have found that it offers speedy symptom relief. “The 12 patients underwent mandatory investigations and were then administered the antibody cocktail through an intravenous drip,” said Dr Maharudra Kumbhar, an officer on special duty at the SevenHills Hospital. “It takes about an hour to administer the therapy. Post that, they were observed for an hour or two and sent home. All the patients were called for a follow up after seven days,” he said. Monoclonal antibodies are artificial antibodies injected into a patient to mimic the action of the natural antibodies. They are similar to natural antibodies that are produced in our bodies to fight attacks by viruses or bacteria, except that they are laboratory-made. Monoclonal antibodies are designed to target a specific disease and are often referred to as ‘designer antibodies’. The cocktail drug used at SevenHills Hospital includes two monoclonal antibodies — Casirivimab and Imdevimab. One pack of the drug, containing the two monoclonal antibodies can be used on two patients. India’s drug regulator granted emergency approval to the Casirivimab and Imdevimab cocktail in May. The drug is indicated for adults and paediatric patients (12 years of age or older weighing at least 40 kgs) who are at the risk of progressing to severe Covid-19. These include Covid-19 patients with high-risk factors such as age and comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, existing lung disease among others. Kumbhar said they have observed good outcomes from the antibody cocktail drug and have not recorded any fatality among the 610 patients. “All patients experienced symptom relief within 48 hours. None of the patients’ conditions deteriorated further — they did not require oxygen support; their chest scan did not worsen. Also, their swabs came negative within four to five days, which means that the antibody cocktail helped in reducing the viral load and hindered the process of viral replication,” he said. The medical team at SevenHills has minutely categorised the patients who are eligible to get the cocktail drug. “We are picking up high-risk patients in the early stage of the disease. That’s when the cocktail drug proves effective,” he said.The 610 patients who have received the cocktail drug include additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani who was hospitalised at SevenHills last month after testing positive for the infection. “It is a good drug, but it should be administered with proper medical advice,” Kakani told Hindustan Times. He was fully vaccinated in March. The hospital is in the process of compiling its observations on the cocktail drug in the form of a study. At present, they are in the stage of getting approval from their ethics committee.Infectious disease expert Dr Om Shrivastav agreed that the selection of patients and timing is crucial for the antibody cocktail to work. “If we pick our patients carefully, and time the antibody cocktail well, the results are very good,” said Shrivastav, who has administered the therapy to nearly 100 patients of which about 25 were on a daycare basis. “It is ideal to start the therapy within 72 hours of symptoms. Patients who have already developed full-blown pneumonia or other complications may not benefit from the therapy,” he said. The drug costs about ₹1.20 lakh. Since it can be used for two patients, the cost comes to ₹60,000 each. The vials need to be stored at 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius. Once opened, the vials should be stored at the same temperature and used within 48 hours. While patients are getting the drug free of cost at the SevenHills Hospital, it can be an expensive therapy for those taking treatment in the private sector. Offering the therapy on a daycare basis saves the cost of hospitalisation. Doctors, however, warn that not all patients can qualify for daycare, as some may require close monitoring. “Even those who are chosen for daycare should be followed up closely,” said Shrivastav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/610-covid-patients-in-mumbai-given-antibody-cocktail-get-speedy-relief-doctors-101631807529064.html

They returned my two-wheeler just three days back. Meanwhile, all of these months I had to visit their office to get it back. During this time I studied the issue of the traffic and parking and realised that it has been worsening day by day. So I want to draw the administration’s attention to the problem,” said Dhankude.“I realised that the problem cannot be solved by any single agency. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), urban planning department, traffic police have to work hand in hand to resolve the issue. But unfortunately, this is not happening. If the administration doesn’t take note of this then I will keep the monument permanently on my private land to keep highlighting the traffic and parking woes. Why only residents have to suffer through this?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/puneite-highlights-parking-woes-through-bike-monument-pictures-go-viral-101631807469295.html

The move comes after a decision was taken during a meeting chaired by urban development minister Eknath Shinde and attended by PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar and Pune city mayor Murlidhar Mohol among others.On Wednesday this week, Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar, too, had promised the PMC employees’ union and officers’ union that the government would take a decision on the 7th pay commission by this week. The Hindustan Times had published a report in this regard in its Thursday edition.Accordingly, Shinde held a meeting through video conferencing with Mohol and Kumar along with other state government officials and made the announcement.In Maharashtra, other municipal corporations have already implemented the 7th pay commission for their employees. The urban development department of the state government in its order on August 2, 2019, had asked civic bodies across Maharashtra to start the process of implementing the 7th pay commission. Accordingly, the PMC general body approved the proposal on March 10 this year. The employees, according to the state government, will get the difference in pay from January 1, 2016. S0hinde said that for the last 10 months, the difference will be given in cash whereas the remaining difference will be given in stages.Mohol welcomed the state government’s decision to announce the 7th pay commission for employees saying, “The general body of the PMC had given its nod for implementing the pay commission and submitted the proposal to the urban development ministry for approval. We have followed up several times. This decision will bring a financial burden to the PMC but as municipal employees working for citizens, we need to consider their demands.”It is expected that by coming December, employees will start getting their revised salary as per the 7th pay commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-issues-gr-for-implementing-7th-pay-commission-for-pmc-employees-101631807289122.html

The cash reward will be given under the Mukhyamantri Chiranjeevi Jeevan Rakshak Yojna. In addition, the person concerned will also be given a certificate.A senior official of the finance department said the execution of the scheme will be through the health department and expenditure of the scheme will be borne by the road safety fund. The scheme will apply to both private and government hospitals. ‘The scheme is aimed to motivate people so that people injured in road accidents can reach nearby hospitals in golden hour and get treatment,’ he said.A casualty medical officer of the hospital in the emergency room will deal with the person who has brought an injured to the hospital and note down the person’s details. “The cash reward will be given in serious cases only where the injured needed to be admitted or be referred to the hospital for treatment. If there are more than one good Samaritans in a particular case, the cash reward will be divided equally among them, and appreciation letters given to all of them,” said the official. Employees of 108 and 1033 ambulance staff, private ambulance; policemen and relatives of the injured will not be eligible for the scheme.Mridula Bhasin from Muskan, an NGO that promotes road safety, welcomed the new scheme. “The scheme will encourage good Samaritans. The SOP will simplify the rules dealing with police and health department, and the incentive will add on to the cause,” she said. She said a WHO report also says that 50 per cent of road accident fatalities can be avoided if treatment is given on time.Delhi started a similar cash reward scheme for good Samaritans in May 2018 under which, people who take a road accident victim to hospital are entitled to get a cash reward of ₹2,000.

16-09-2021||Lucknow||Heavy rain, water-logging throw life out of gear in Lucknow||LUCKNOW Continuous heavy rain on Thursday threw life out of gear in Lucknow and exposed the tall claims of the municipal corporation. The downpour resulted in water-logging, power disruptions, uprooted trees at several places and caused inconvenience to people.“When it began to rain during the wee hours of Wednesday, it seemed like normal rainfall. But as the day progressed, the showers turned out to be a bane for people,” said Sushmita Singh, a resident of Indira Nagar – the area that witnessed heavy water-logging. POWER BREAKDOWNSEven VVIP areas like Dilkusha Colony, Gomti Nagar and Mahanagar witnessed power breakdowns. Supply to these areas had to be switched off after rainwater entered around 40 sub-stations of Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration (LESA). Water also entered the premises of Lucknow Municipal Corporation’s office.Due to power cuts, a number of students were not able to attend their online classes. Many employees working from home missed online meetings and work.“Due to prolonged power cuts, the inverters didn’t work and generators ran out of fuel,” said Jai Prakash Shukla, a government employee from Gomti Nagar area. RESIDENTS COMPLAINRishikant Gupta, a resident of Alambagh, said: “The phone of LESA sub-station in Chander Nagar was switched off. Residents also complained that their phone calls were not responded by the 1912 helpline of LESA.” LESA chief engineer (Cis Gomti) Madhukar Varma said, “At several places, trees have fallen on the power lines. In Hind Nagar, Ashiana, Cantt, Hardoi road etc, water entered a number of sub-stations and that’s why power supply was switched off in many areas. LESA teams are removing uprooted trees and flushing out water from the sub-stations.”“Our homes are waterlogged and LMC’s phones are busy. The open nullah has overflowed into people’s homes, which poses risk of infection,” said Deeksha Sharma of Sector N, Ashiana. Heavy water-logging was also reported from Faizullaganj, Mahanagar, Aliganj, Alambagh, Barha, Hazratganj, Charbagh, Moulviganj and Balaganj.In front of Inox area in Gomti Nagar, pedestrians were seen wading through knee-deep water while dug-up roads in Qaiserbagh added to the woes of commuters. “Several roads and drains in the city have been dug up. This is one of the reasons for water-logging,” said Sayyed Yawar Hussain ‘Reshu’, leader of opposition in LMC House and corporator of JC Bose ward in Qaiserbagh.Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said, “All the 48 pumps were running at full capacity to clean the flow of major nullahs into river Gomti. I have directed officials to attend each and every complaint coming to the LMC control room.” The situation was worse in the Old City area where roads are lying dug up in wake of the ongoing smart city project. “Heavy rains have made the ground situation worse. The showers have exposed the tall claims of the municipal corporation,” said Izzat Hussain, a resident of Hussainabad. FLIGHTS AFFECTEDAs a result of the inclement weather and low visibility, three flights to Lucknow were diverted to other destinations. International flights coming from and going to Sharjah was cancelled. “We request all passengers to connect with their respective airline and check the schedule before leaving their homes. Special ferry vehicles have been arranged for transporting passengers. Pumps have been deployed to flush out water from the approach road,” said the spokesperson of Adani Airports Limited.EXORBITANT CAB FARESPeople said cab services were also hit hard by the inclement weather and drivers charged exorbitantly. “Cab providers charged three times more fare even for small distances. The scene was no different for food delivery mobile apps that were charging hefty amounts to deliver the food,” said Mohammad Shahdab, a student.

At least 100 units of blood were seized from their possession, said police.The accused smuggled blood from other states like Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan at the rate of ₹1,200 per unit and sold it at ₹6,000 per unit. The duo also used to mix saline water in blood to increase the quantity, said officials.Those arrested were identified as Dr Abhay Pratap Singh and his aide Abhishek Pathak. The accused doctor had done his MBBS course from the King George’s Medical University in 2000 and later completed his MD in transfusion medicine from the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in 2007, said Amitabh Yash, ADG, STF.“Dr Abhay Pratap Singh is a highly qualified doctor and currently posted at UP University of Medical Sciences, Saifai, Etawah. He was associated with several renowned hospitals in the past but apparently got involved in this illegal business of blood to make a quick buck,” said another senior police official.The doctor and his aide landed in the police net when the UP STF was tracking the links of five people arrested for operating a blood supply racket on October 26, 2018. The doctor was taken into custody from Agra-Lucknow expressway toll plaza and 45 units of blood were seized from his SUV while his aide was arrested from his flat in Awadh Vihar later. The remaining 55 units of blood were recovered from a fridge in the flat, added the official. The official said the doctor initially claimed that he had proper papers for the blood supply from different blood banks and kept on misleading the STF team for a few hours, but it was later discovered that all papers produced by him were forged. He said the doctor even used to organize blood donation camps in Lucknow to pose that he had collected the blood through these. The accused and his aide were booked under multiple IPC sections of fraud and forgery in an FIR registered against them at Sushant Golf City police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/illegal-blood-supply-racket-busted-doctor-and-aide-in-police-net-101631798348462.html

Dr Nizami, in her early 40s, works at a Srinagar hospital and runs a trust for cancer patients besides pursuing her hobby of being an extreme mountain trail motor-sport traveller. Since childhood, she has pursued her passion whether it was studying medicine in the 1990s when militancy was at its peak in Jammu and Kashmir or her love for jeeps. Her biggest challenge in life came when her husband was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2007 within six years of their marriage, leaving her to bring up their two children, a three-year-old son and a year-old daughter. “It was a traumatic phase. I struggled but my parents supported me. Initially, being a single parent appeared tough but gradually I came to terms with reality,” she says. As time went by, she decided not to remarry and moved back to her ancestral home in Srinagar from her husband’s house in Jammu. Dr Nizami, who is now the medical officer in-charge at a Srinagar hospital and on Covid duties, says that her experience during her husband’s illness pushed her towards helping patients and the needy. “Though we were relatively well off, we had to go outside for treatment as he was suffering from pancreatic cancer. We realised that the treatment is expensive and drains most families’ savings,” she says. Even before her husband’s death, she would collect money from attendants using charity boxes outside OPDs. Later, friends and colleagues asked her to setup a trust with a separate account where people could donate money. “We get a lot of donations during Ramazan, which are primarily used to help cancer patients and those needing a kidney transplant. The trust also helps widows and orphans who have no source of income,” she says. Nizami, the eldest of four siblings, says that her parents Mushtaq Nizami, a military contractor, and Shahida Parveen, a homemaker, have been her strength. “Any girl can do big things in life when her parents support her,” she says. Ask her what got her interested in jeeps, and she says, “I have imbibed my father’s passion for driving jeeps. In 2018, I came upon some videos of the Kashmir off-road club which organises competitive events and overland expeditions, and decided to participate in a snow-race event (Frozen Rush) at Gulmarg.” Nizami, who always wears a hijab, was the only woman to participate in the adventure sport and created quite a buzz on social media. “I hadn’t realised that I was breaking stereotypes , until I saw people’s reactions,” says Nizami, who has since participated in dangerous events like mud race and river crossing. “Some people tried to dissuade me saying it was risky, but I remained unafraid,” says Nizami, adding that she gets a lot of messages from young girls who admire her. She says her faith in the Almighty has never wavered despite the many challenges in her life. “Not just driving, but life in general throws a lot of challenges at us. We have to accept the challenges and move forward,” she says.

Thereafter, we pursue the matter and visit the suggested spots. During the meeting, the PMC commissioner gave verbal orders to ward- and zonal- officals to visit the development works and review doubtful works.”“A few days ago, we found the same drainage work in different areas within the same ward. However, we conducted a series of meetings and cross-checked the details of the work. Thereafter we found that different small works had been combined under one work. In another case, work completed last year was suggested in the same area and investigation revealed that last year, the work area had been changed and that this year, the same work was proposed. In such cases, we check the documents and visit the places. If we find any misleading information or irregularities, the concerned officials are punished,” Khemnar said. There have been a few instances of duplication of work. For example, the gardens’ department issued two tenders for the same work in February 2021, including development works at Unity Park located in ward number 27. While the civic administration assured inquiry, nothing happened. Similarly in July, the Warje-Karvenagar ward office issued two tenders for the same work of shredding in ward number 13 (C) named Erandwane-Happy colonies. In the tender notice, the ward office mentioned two jobs of shredding in ward number 13 (C) at an estimated amount of Rs177,911 (PMC/zone 3/2021-22/Warje-Karvenagar/79) and the other tender worth Rs2 lakh (PMC/zone 3/2021-22/Warje-Karvenagar/77) for the same work.In a third instance in the first week of July, the PMC received complaints of multiple tenders for the same work. At that time, the administration explained that the work was divided into different parts, which included changing drainage pipelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-chief-instructs-visiting-and-cross-checking-doubtful-works-under-ward-development-funds-101631792348092.html

16-09-2021||Kolkata||CBI questions Mamata’s election agent in Nandigram in post-poll violence probe||Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Sheikh Sufiyan, who was chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s election agent in the Nandigram assembly election in East Midnapore in April, was questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for more than four hours on Thursday in connection with post-poll violence in the district. Sufiyan was summoned to a central government guest house in Haldia town where a CBI team is camping. He was accompanied by a lawyer. On September 3, the CBI recorded the statement of the family of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Debabrata Maity at Nandigram. Maity was attacked, allegedly by TMC workers on May 3, a day after the Bengal poll results were announced. He died at SSKM Hospital in Kolkata on May 13. The CBI lodged a case in this connection on August 31. Though the CBI has questioned many TMC district leaders during the probe ordered by the Calcutta high court on August 19, this is the first time a leader known to be close to the chief minister was summoned. No CBI officer commented on the development. Also Read | Retired justice refuses honorarium for overseeing probe in Bengal violenceSufiyan told HT that he was unnecessarily harassed. “I was not involved in any violence. Leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari made the CBI question me. He is pulling the strings. We are the soldiers of Mamata Banerjee. We are not scared easily,” he said. Adhikari resigned from the TMC government, where he was a cabinet minister, and joined the BJP in December last year. He defeated the chief minister by around 1,500 votes in Nandigram, the seat he bagged in 2016. Banerjee is now contesting the September 30 bypoll from Bhawanipore, her old seat. The Bengal government moved the Supreme Court on September 13, challenging the CBI probe into post-poll violence. The CBI has registered more than 40 cases so far and filed charge sheet in at least three. It has formed several teams, each comprising deputy inspector generals and superintendents from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka and other states. Each team is headed by a joint director. The teams are accompanied by forensic experts and Central Industrial Security Force personnel who are providing security to the officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-questions-mamata-s-election-agent-in-nandigram-in-post-poll-violence-probe-101631791148027.html

I am going to direct the officers to take action as per the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act for dancing at traffic signals in Indore so that such acts can be prevented in future,” PTI quoted Mishra as saying. The minister also said that the method the woman had chosen was wrong irrespective of her intention.Kalra, in a separate video released later, had clarified the issue saying that she had made the original video, which garnered widespread attention, to create awareness among the people about traffic rules and wearing masks as a measure against the Covid-19 disease.

His wife Neena Marathe, who was the complainant in the case against an investor for driving her husband to suicide, is also an accused in the cheating case.The cheating case was registered on March 11 at Kothrud police station under Sections 406, 420 with 34 of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and Section 3 and others of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act, 1999.During the argument of the anticipatory bail in the high court, the lawyer for Manjiri and Kaustubh had alleged that the now-deceased jewellery baron had siphoned money from the company and formed another firm to buy hotels and resorts without the knowledge of other partners including Kaustubh and Manjiri.The husband-wife duo’s lawyer accused the deceased man of siphoning off ₹7,75,81,920 between 2013-2014 and 2019-2020.“Manjiri Marathe was asked by the Supreme Court to appear before the sessions court before the stipulated time due to which she appeared before the sessions court on September 13 along with Kaustubh Marathe.

16-09-2021||Pune||Taste of life: Food for the Gods, steamed, sweet modaks and served with devotion||Neelkanthshastri Lele came to Pune from Kashi sometime in January 1873. He had spent more than 25 years studying various aspects of the Hindu Dharmashastra at Varanasi, and was in Pune upon an invitation by someone from the illustrious Khasagiwale family. His discourses on Hindu religion had been arranged at the Tulshibaug and Belbaug temples. It was his first visit to the city.Though initially he was supposed to spend no more than a couple of months in the city, his discourses became immensely popular and he ended up staying for more than a year.Lele wrote about his experiences in Pune in a series of brief articles which appeared in the newspaper “Jnanaprakash”. The first of the lot appeared in June 1874. As I have been able to find only three articles from the series, I do not know the exact number of articles Lele wrote for the newspaper.In the write-ups, he gripes at the way people carried on with religious rituals in Pune. The priests and their patrons were lazy, he thought, and “did not pay enough attention to details”. One of his complaints was centred on a feast (Brahmanbhojan). The aforementioned feast was a part of the then prevalent Ganesh Chaturthi ritual, where a Ganpati idol was made in the morning and immersed the same day, every day for a month, from Shravan Shukla Chaturthi to Bhadrapad Shukla Chaturthi, i.e. Ganesh Chaturthi. Priests chanted Brahmanaspatisukta daily and fasted during the entire course of the ritual. A feast would be organised at the end of the month on Panchami. Kheer, a dessert made from slow-cooked rice, milk, and sugar, and laddoos would be offered to God and then served to the priests and the common public. It was not unusual for entire towns and villages to participate in these feasts.Lele was the guest of honour at one such feast which took place at Ranjangaon, near Pune. His article suggests that he was beyond pleased by the hospitality of the patron of the event. What irked him was the presence of Gulab-jamuns, a dessert not so common then, along with the customary kheer. “It was preposterous on the part of the patron to include Gulab-jamuns in the meal. Kheer is the favourite dish of the Mooshaka, the vehicle of Lord Ganpati, and it should not be accompanied with any other dessert than laddoos, which are a favourite of Ganpati. One should not deviate from customs, and let the greed to show off wealth overpower the sanctity of religious rituals”, he wrote.The use of food as a ritual is not often too obvious, but food has always been linked with certain occasions and festivals. Specific foods and dishes are associated with specific deities and religious rituals. The Gods have their favourite dishes, which are supposed to be offered to them (naivedya) first. The devotees then consume the leftovers.Special food serves to mark the special occasion and bring home to us its significance. Out of innate conservatism, or because this also provides one with a sense of being the guardian of traditions, or out of the need to differentiate oneself, one is supposed to safeguard these heirloom foods and carry the tradition forward.19th century Pune was one place where food was an integral part of religious rituals, and this would be on display during the Ganeshotsav. Even before the festival went public in the early 1890s, it was celebrated in Pune with extraordinary aplomb. The Peshwas were great devotees of Ganpati, and the tradition of the festival continued during the days of the Raj.While some families chose to perform the rituals for a month during the months of Shravan and Bhadrapad, many affluent families would install the Ganpati idol on Ganesh Chaturthi for one-and-a-half or 10 days. People thronged their wadas to look at the decorations and sometimes, fireworks. And, to feast.A report published on September 12, 1861, in “Jnanaprakash” gives an elaborate account of the festivities held at the residence of Sardar Dajisaheb Kibe – “Ganpati Utsaah is being celebrated all over the city like every year. Today is the fourth day of the festival. Shrimant Dajisaheb Kibe is in Pune especially for the festivities, and thousands of men, women, and children are gathering at the Kibe wada to marvel at the decorations. A spectacular frame made up of colourful pieces of glass has been installed above the idol. The hall where the idol is kept is decorated with glass, flowers, and silk. Every morning there is a vocal recital, while a senior priest has especially been summoned from Kashi to perform kirtan every night. Laddoos, karanjis, and pedhas are being distributed as prasad to everyone every day”.The report also mentions 3,000 Brahmin priests being fed by Kibe daily during the 10 days of the festival.  Besan laddoos were served to the priests and other guests. The priests were given Rs5 each daily.Similar feasts were organised every year by wealthy and influential families like Mehendale, Khasagiwale, Gadre, and Gajre. In 1861, Gajre organised feasts for 10 days from Ganesh Chaturthi to Anant Chaturdashi. Re1 was given to every priest and guest as a mark of obeisance and gratitude. According to “Jnanaprakash”, Gajre spent Rs7,000 every day on feeding his guests. Laddoos and Jalebis were on the menu, along with Masale Bhat (tempered rice with vegetables) and Aluche fadfade (colocasia curry).Vatli kairichi daal (tempered, ground dal mixed with grated raw mango), dadpe pohe (tempered rice flakes), and karanji were usually offered to the deity and to the guests on the last day of the festival, i.e. Anant Chaturdashi.Prof Kerunana Chhatre, the Mathematics teacher par excellence, whose students included VK Chiplunkar, BG Tilak, and GG Agarkar, would have an open house on Anant Chaturdashi where hundreds would come to relish dadpe pohe or dahi pohe (curd and rice flakes), and karanjis.Modak (steamed or fried dumplings with a coconut-jaggery stuffing) started replacing laddoos as Ganpati’s favourite food around the same time. Steamed modaks were considered superior to the fried ones, because the former was assumed to be a mark of affluence, class, and taste. Koknastha Chitpavan Brahmin families who cooked ukadiche modak controlled most of the financial and educational institutions in Pune then. Even though specifics of ritual eating keep changing slowly and inevitably, food continues to define how people interact with each other. It signifies belonging and is a symbol of a community rooted in long-standing traditions.After all, society feeds on symbols, myths, and fantasies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-food-for-the-gods-steamed-sweet-modaks-and-served-with-devotion-101631789228405.html

16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Having a way with words puts one on the write track||It’s more than two decades since I started writing; it seems like a miracle to me. I have had the sublime company of words to keep me safely away from tension or depression. Feels like a dream! Thanks to my father, I developed reading for pleasure, as a hobby quite early in life. I was always a voracious reader as far back as I can recollect; so much so that during the good old days, I never missed reading even the printed paper bags that accompanied the shopped goods. Even now when I go somewhere, I take a newspaper or a good book to keep me occupied, in case I have spare time on my hands. And then to my disbelief and astonishment, the urge to write something myself took over. Things came to such a pass that writing took precedence over all my other hobbies. The company of words became my main source of ecstasy in all situations, giving my life an altogether new meaning. The proximity of words also introduced me to a hitherto unknown aspect of myself. It is truly an enlightening experience, and you learn so much while writing. One becomes answerable to words so as not to ever underestimate their power. They are in fact such an invigorating company, as never stops surprising you! There just needs to be a blank page in front and the magic of apt words materialising on paper gets going. With the passage of time, one starts nurturing the notion that one probably has a way with them. While writing, often I have this feeling that I am arranging flowers in vase or creating some artefact with a medley of multicoloured beads and baubles. At other times, it feels like painting with words. Focus, fortitude and hard work are the prerequisites to achieve the desired results. The satisfaction that comes from a job well done is worth all the effort. You tend to have a different experience with each write-up; one piece calls for a lot of effort and time, while some other might just land up on the paper, decked up in all its finery, ready to leave for the editor’s mailbox. These words have a knack of turning an ordinary being into an accomplished artist. Just how one may thank these enchanted entities, is anyone’s guess. Then writing is not a thankless job; rather the reverse of it. The generous and erudite readers keep the scribbler forever motivated, with their heartening observations. Now my writing has got endorsement from my granddaughters as well. Even they will not let me get off the writing track. A few days ago, my seven-year-old granddaughter Suhavi came back from the market, with her parents and excitedly told me, “Dadi ma, look I brought such a beautiful diary for you, next time you must write in it.” Hargun too brought a special pen for me, “Nani, please use this pen for writing the next story for children.” Of course, all this prompts me to keep going. parambirkaur@gmail.com The writer is a Ludhiana-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/having-a-way-with-words-puts-one-on-the-write-track-101631787548380.html
16-09-2021||Lucknow||Allahabad high court seeks update on Mainpuri girl death case||The Allahabad high court on Thursday directed the Uttar Pradesh government and police to update the court with the progress in the probe into the 2019 mysterious death of a 16-year old Mainpuri girl-- found hanging in a school—alleged to be a case of sexual assault and murder by her family.The court also asked the government to direct officers to complete the investigation of rape cases within two month or within the time limit as per amended provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedures or CrPC.The court also directed the police to ensure that the family members of the girl are not pressured during the investigation and their safety is ensured.The bench comprising acting chief justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and justice AK Ojha passed the order on a public interest litigation filed by one Mahendra Pratap Singh alleging police were not investigating the case fairly and protecting the actual accused. The petitioner had said that the special investigation team (SIT) formed for the investigation was not acting independently.The state government told the court that the concerned investigation officer (IO), assistant superintendent of police (ASP) and the deputy superintendent of police (DSP), who were initially investigating the case, were suspended by the state government and a new SIT has been formed for fresh investigation. The director general of police (DGP), present in the court on Thursday, confirmed the development.Senior advocate Amrendra Nath Singh, also the president of the Bar Association, is helping the court in the case. He suggested that the probe of the case be monitored by the bench. The court then directed concerned authorities to update it with the progress in the investigation on the expiry of one month, when the case will be heard next.Senior advocate Amrendra Nath Singh told the court that the mother of the girl had alleged that her daughter had claimed she was being tortured by the principal as she knew some of the schools’ secrets. Singh added that the girl had called her mother just a day prior to her death to report receiving threats to her life, but when family members spoke to the principal, she paid no heed.The court suggested that the investigating officer must collect the call details of the concerned phone numbers which can be material evidence in the case.During the course of the hearing, the court said shoddy investigations were often the reason behind the poor rate of conviction in India. “We are aware of the fact that the conviction rate in India is just above 6%, the reason is poor or manipulated investigation by the police. Most of the time material evidence is not collected in a scientific manner and hence, experts fail to reach any conclusion resulting in acquittal of accused persons in most of the cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-high-court-seeks-update-on-mainpuri-girl-death-case-101631785387473.html

According to data by the India Meteorological Department, Delhi's September rainfall breached the 400mm-mark. At 403mm till Thursday afternoon, it is the highest precipitation in the month since 417.3mm in September 1944.

In 2020, the city recorded 648.9mm of precipitation. In 2019, Delhi received 404mm rainfall in the entire 2019 monsoon period.The monsoon will withdraw from Delhi by September 25.According to the IMD, the Safdarjung Observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, has received 1159.4mm of rainfall this season till Thursday afternoon.

16-09-2021||Patna||Husband follows wife’s footsteps as women change Panchayat politics in Bihar||A former commissioner of Central Vigilance Commission is set to contest election to Raj Singhwahini panchayat in Sonbarsa block of Sitamarhi district in Bihar, following the completion of his wife’s successful stint as the Mukhiya of the same panchayat.As celebrity mukhiya Ritu Jaiswal—winner Champions of Change and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Panchayat Sashaktikaran Puraskar (DDUPSP) 2019-- aims higher with her ambition to enter state-level politics, her husband Arun Kumar will look to cash-in political currency she earned as a Mukhiya. It is a rare case of a husband following into wife’s footsteps in politics and thereby, also shatters the stereotype of power-wielding men fielding women as proxies in politics.Bihar was the first state to provide 50% reservation to women in 2006 in grassroots politics and Ritu could well be cited as an example of what the empowerment initiative aimed to achieve as she earned plaudits and recognition for her work in an area primarily considered a male bastion.Apart from winning multiple national-level awards, she was also selected by the Central ministry of panchayati raj among five mukhiyas from Bihar for capacity building programme for sarpanch and panchayat secretaries in New Delhi. Her sharp rise led to her being fielded in the last Assembly election on a Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) ticket. While she narrowly lost the polls, she still managed to break through into state-level politics.“She wants to move on to do state-level politics but people of the panchayat do not want her to leave. I have been working with her and that brings me into picture. I think panchayat can be an effective way to bring about lasting change in the society,” said Kumar, who took voluntary retirement and mentors civil services aspirants with his online Magnus IAS programme. He had cleared civil services in 1995.While Ritu and Arun Kumar’s story may be considered an isolated case, it points to a change in mindset. Ritu had won her panchayat election from a non-reserved seat by beating men. The statistics this year also indicate that more women are interested in jumping into the election fray even on non-reserved seats, showing a readiness to go beyond the comfort of the 50% quota to carve political space for themselves.While the demand for 33% reservation for women in Parliament remains stuck, one of India’s economically most backward states is heralding a change through women empowerment at the grassroots.Woman candidates have outnumbered men in the forthcoming panchayat elections by a good margin in the first two phases and the trend is likely to continue, considering the growing awareness among women in the rural areas, which was reflected during the last panchayat elections as well as in Assembly and Lok Sabha voting patterns.In the first phase, 15,328 candidates filed their nomination for different posts, out of which 9,093 were women- about 52.79% of all nominations. Out of the 76,279 nominations filed for the second phase, 40,168 were filed by women, which is 52.65% of all nominations.Bihar has 71,046 women among the 136,573 panchayat representatives after the 2016 panchayat polls. This comes to over 52% representation of women in panchayati institutions.“It shows that the gender imbalance in Bihar’s rural governance has ended and gender stereotypes are breaking. It would gradually end whatever apprehensions regarding women being proxies for their husbands. Women’s empowerment has started making a difference, as it will gradually help change the male-dominated climate, not only in grassroots politics, but also in improving their much-needed participation in the workforce,” said Bihar information and public relations minister Sanjay Kumar Jha.Jha also gives Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar credit for empowering women in every field, including police, teaching and other government jobs.Female literacy in Bihar has gone up from a mere 37% in 2005-06 to 60% in 2015-16. Though still the lowest in the country, it is expected to go further up in the new census, as girls have been outnumbering boys at the secondary level also. As per the National Statistical Organisation report released in 2020, the female literacy rate in rural Bihar stood at 58.7% while it was 75.9% in urban areas.Despite constituting less than 9% of the total number of candidates in the fray, women voters in Bihar showed far greater enthusiasm than their male counterparts during the Lok Sabha elections as 60% of the 57.46% votes were cast by them, even though Bihar has an adverse sex ratio.In the 2020 assembly election too, 60%, women voters exercised their franchise compared to 54.6% for men.“The reservation to women at the panchayat level has certainly contributed to their empowerment, as their voting behaviour has changed since 2006. Women have outnumbered men in voting consistently since 2010. It has strengthened the democratic process through gender participation and equality and now their participation in grassroots politics will created upward pressure and make more room for them with or without reservation,” said former DM Diwakar, former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.Diwakar said though proxy woman candidates were a reality in the initial stages, things were changing, and now women were coming into panchayat politics with plenty of exposure as teachers or Jeevika volunteers.“If their representation was over 52% last time, don’t be surprised if it touches 55% this time. Some woman mukhiyas have also made a mark for themselves in an otherwise male-dominated field. They are now enthusiastically participating in the political process at the grassroots and will certainly make their way up,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/husband-follows-wife-s-footsteps-as-women-change-panchayat-politics-in-bihar-101631782087254.html
16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal landslides: Manali-Leh highway closed at Nehru Kund||The strategic Manali-Leh highway is blocked for over 24 hours after a massive landslide at Nehru Kund, 5km from Manali town towards Keylong. The landslide occurred late on Wednesday night and the route is blocked since then. The traffic was diverted via Burua-Shanag link road, Manali station house officer (SHO) Sandeep Pathania said. However, a massive traffic jam has been reported on the alternative route. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO), which maintains the highway, has pressed men and machinery into service to clear the blockade due to big boulders. Shimla-Kinnaur highway (NH05) is also blocked for traffic since Wednesday after a massive landslide at Chaura. There has been long queues of vehicles on both sides. Meanwhile, the Chandigarh-Manali highway that was blocked due to a landslide at Aut near Pandoh has been reopened. The Aut-Banjar-Sainj highway was also blocked due to a landslide at Chhait on Wednesday night. It took two hours to restore traffic. No loss of life or damage to private property was reported in the incidents. Kullu deputy commissioner Ashutosh Garg said link roads were also blocked due to multiple landslides and the public works department was working to restore traffic on priority. Solan wettest place in state Since Wednesday afternoon, parts of Himachal Pradesh received light to moderate rainfall. Sujanpur was the wettest place in the state, recording 51mm of rainfall, followed by Solan 34mm, Nahan with 31.2mm and Mandi 28mm and Jogindernagar 24mm. Palampur town got 23mm of rainfall, Kangra 18.2mm, Paonta Sahib 11.4mm, Bhunter 9mm, Chamba 7mm and Dharamshala 6.2mm. The MeT department has forecast rains for next one week. A yellow weather warning for heavy rains, thunderstorm and lightening has been issued on September 19 and 20 in ten district except Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti. People have been warned to avoid unnecessary traveling due to the threat of landslides. Ban on adventure sports lifted The two-month ban on adventure sports, including river rafting and paragliding, was eased on Thursday. Paragliding activities resumed at Bir-Billing in Kangra, providing relief to people who make a living out of adventure tourism. Paragliding and river rafting were banned from July 15 to September 15 due to the monsoon. Paragliding supervisor at Bir-Billing Ran Vijay Singh said that Covid-19 hit adventure tourism in the region. “With the ban on adventure activities lifted, there is hope of revival. Though the footfall of foreign tourists is negligible since last year, the influx of domestic tourists may increase,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-landslides-manali-leh-highway-closed-at-nehru-kund-101631776147278.html
16-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra students union seeks nod for ITI students' travel by train||The Maharashtra Students’ Union (MASU) has asked the state government to allow students under 18 years of age to travel on the local trains since they can’t fulfil the mandatory condition of getting vaccinated against Covid-19, and their exclusion from the local train network was resulting in many missing in-person classes at Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), where a large number of class 10 pass outs study. Currently, only vaccinated commuters are allowed on Mumbai locals.“Since the start of the new academic year, most ITIs have started calling their students for physical classes but repeated demands by students to allow them to travel by train have gone unheard. This has resulted in many students being unable to attend regular lectures due to lack of basic transport facilities,” said Arun Chavan, secretary, MASU. At present, there are 976 ITIs across the state, both government-aided and private, offering 146,000 seats for vocational training in plumbing, welding, motor vehicle repair, electrical repairs etc. Thousands of students opt for these courses every year after passing class 10 examinations.In November last year, ITI students were asked to attend in-person classes at their respective institutes to appear for practical exams. Since a large part of the vocational curriculum at the ITIs depends on practical sessions, in-person attendance is considered important, but many students are finding it difficult to travel to institutes.“I stay in Palghar and my institute is in Parel. I change three buses and then walk 20 minutes to my institute, so I only manage to attend college once in two-three days. I’m missing important lectures but it is physically impossible to travel the distance every day, plus financially it is draining as well,” said an ITI Parel student.“Most students studying in ITIs are below 18 years of age, and are therefore yet to receive their vaccination. This is one of the reasons they aren’t allowed to travel by train. It’s time the government either starts vaccinations for them or makes other arrangements to help these students who already come from very financially strained families,” said the principal of a Vashi based ITI.An official from the Directorate of Vocational Education and Training (DVET) told HT that they have sought help from Railways and the state government in this matter even in the past, but haven’t received a positive response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-students-union-seeks-nod-for-iti-students-to-travel-by-train-101631775787257.html
16-09-2021||Bhopal||Atrocities against tribals increased by 25% in Madhya Pradesh||Madhya Pradesh recorded 2,401 cases of atrocities against tribals in 2020, which was 25% more than 2019. The state was ahead of Rajasthan’s 1,878 cases by some margin, as per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2020 report. The state also recorded the most rapes of tribal women in the same period. In 2019, 1,922 cases of crime against tribals were registered in the state under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. MP has the highest tribal population in India and it has been registering most cases of atrocities against the tribal population for the past five years. Tribal and human rights activists feel that a sudden spurt in cases of outrage and harassment of tribals was reported in 2020 since many tribals, who worked as migrant labourers, returned to MP during the Covid-induced nation-wide lockdown. “The condition of scheduled caste and tribes remains the same in rural MP since Independence. Several of these people live as migrant labourers in different states and they were harassed on their return to MP during the lockdown, when many were forced to work as farm labourers without wages,” said Madhuri, a human rights activist, working in MP for the past two decades. Jai Adiwasi Yuva Sangathan alleged the state government had been suppressing the voice of tribals and the NCRB data revealed the reality of their situation. “The state government is not ready to accept the fact that the tribal people are in danger but the data revealed the reality. Tribals are feeling unsafe in MP due to the rise in crime against them. They are being thrashed for land and also being harassed by false cases lodged against them. The recent incident in Khargone, where police thrashed a tribal to force him to confess to a robbery, is a routine way of torturing tribals,” said Dr Anand Rai, spokesperson JAYS.The opposition also attacked the BJP-led state government over an increase in the number of cases of atrocities against tribals. MP Congress committee president Kamal Nath said, “This data is nothing but a report card of 16 years of development plan of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. During the BJP-led state government’s tenure, the cases of atrocities against tribals, Dalits and women have increased by many folds. The morale of anti-social elements and criminals is high and they do not fear the law.” However, home minister Narottam Mishra said, “The data only shows that police records every case in MP and every person gets justice in the state. Now, we are coming with the Gangster Act to curb crime against tribals, scheduled caste, women and poor people.” Recently, cases of atrocities against tribals in MP made headlines. A 40-year-old tribal man named Kanhaiyalal Bheel was beaten and dragged after he was tied to a vehicle in Neemuch by eight men on the suspicion of theft last month. The man died at a hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/atrocities-against-tribals-increased-by-25-in-madhya-pradesh-101631773326952.html
16-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court dismisses Param Bir Singh’s petition for quashing of inquiries||The Bombay high court today dismissed the petition filed by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh for quashing of the two preliminary inquiries against him by the Maharashtra government.The court held that the petition was ‘not maintainable’ and directed Singh to approach the appropriate forum, which is the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT).On July 28, the division bench of justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar had reserved its order in Singh’s petitions seeking quashing of the preliminary inquiry initiated against him by the home department pertaining to violation of service rules in light of the Ambani bomb scare case and on allegations of corruption levelled against him by inspector Anup Dange. Also Read | Petition in SC seeks order that HCs don’t dispense with virtual court hearingsIn his petition, Singh claimed that the two inquiries were initiated against him as he had accused former home minister Anil Deshmukh of ordering arrested police officer Sachin Vaze to collect money from bars and restaurants to the tune of ₹100 crore. Singh claimed that the home department resorted to a witch hunt after he refused to withdraw his letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wherein he had made the corruption allegations. He further alleged that there was an attempt by the state government to hinder the HC-ordered CBI probe into his allegations against Deshmukh. Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, who had appeared for Singh, had said, “It is obvious from the circumstances that it was issued out of confusion and vendetta. Singh complained against Anil Deshmukh and instead of inquiring into that, the state punished the whistleblower... They are trying to shoot the messenger.” However, senior advocate Darius Khambata for the state had questioned the maintainability of the petition as the inquiries came under the purview of the All India Service Rules and as CAT dealt with such issues, Singh’s petition could not be entertained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-dismisses-param-bir-singh-s-petition-for-quashing-of-inquiries-101631773086856.html

16-09-2021||Jaipur||BJP’s Alwar MP says law and order in Rajasthan reminds of Taliban rule||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) parliamentarian from Alwar, Baba Balaknath said on Wednesday that the law and order situation in Rajasthan reminded him of Taliban’s rule in Afghanistan. He cited a recent incident of firing in Bhiwadi to back his claim. However, the Congress shot back saying Rajasthan’s law and order was better than any BJP-ruled states.Referring to the firing at a bakery in Bhiwadi, Balaknath alleged that the law-and-order situation was deteriorating in the state but Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government seemed not to see it. “Some miscreants opened fire outside residences and shops…looted a bakery and the government was sleeping,” he said. On Monday, six armed men opened fire at a local bakery in Bhiwadi and threatened the owner and the employees. Police claimed that at least 30 rounds of bullets were fired, and the attackers also vandalised the property before fleeing. However, no injuries were reported from the incident.Balaknath alleged that since the formation of the Congress government in the state, crime had increased, innocents were getting killed, and land was getting encroached. He also claimed that industries were shifting base to safer places from Alwar, Bhiwadi and Neemrana to escape extortions.“The kind of tandav (unruly scene) seen in Rajasthan reminds [me] of Taliban. The way the Taliban is doing tandav in Afghanistan, Rajasthan seems to be moving in the same direction,” he alleged. The BJP MP further alleged that politicians from the ruling party were getting people jailed on false charges and were registering fake cases. He claimed that this was the worst law and order situation in Rajasthan since independence. The MP’s allegations coincided with the release of latest data from National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report 2020, which showed that Rajasthan had overtaken Madhya Pradesh as the state where most cases of rapes were registered in 2020. However, the desert state has witnessed a decline of around 16% in crime against women.Commenting on the allegations, senior Congress leader and transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said Baba Balaknath has proved that he is not a “sanyasi” (ascetic) with the use of such language. The people will now get to know that he is [a] BJP worker and leader [in reality]. The law and order situation in Rajasthan is far better than any BJP-ruled state,” he said. The minister added that the BJP was frustrated with the defeat faced in the recent Panchayat polls. “Now, the BJP leaders are even shying away from taking Modi’s name. They are giving such statements driven by insecurity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/bjps-alwar-mp-says-law-and-order-in-rajasthan-reminds-of-taliban-rule-101631767445920.html
16-09-2021||Kolkata||Calcutta HC sets aside rustication of 3 Visva-Bharati University students||Educational institutions are being misused as breeding grounds of political parties as a result of which classes are not being held, exams are not held on time and results do not come out in time, compelling students to move to private institutions where they are treated as customers, the Calcutta high court said on Wednesday even as it set aside the rustication order against three Visva-Bharati University (VBU) postgraduate students. This comes a week after the court asked the university to keep the rustication order “in abeyance”. The students – Somnath Sow and Falguni Pan of economics and Rupa Chakrabortty of Hindustani classical vocal – were expelled for three years on August 23 by the VBU authorities for taking part in a campus protest in January this year. Also Read | SC to hear govt plea against Calcutta HC order on Bengal poll violence“The three student respondents appear to have been used as a front by some vested interests to bring the university to a standstill. The entire lot of students of the university have suffered as a a consequence,” added the single judge bench of Justice Rajasekhar Mantha. Set up in 1921 by Rabindranath Tagore, VBU is Bengal’s only central university, and the Prime Minister is its chancellor. Students’ agitation began on August 28 when the three students were expelled on disciplinary grounds. VBU vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty was confined to his campus residence as the students blocked the gates. The impasse ended following the court’s intervention. “Outsiders and political parties have absolutely no role to play in internal matters of an educational institution,” the order said on Wednesday. Last week, the same bench of the Calcutta high court had observed that a level of education and maturity is required for a student to take an informed decision before accepting or following any ideology. In the absence of such education, the exposure to ideology of any political outfit would amount to indoctrination, which was undesirable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-hc-sets-aside-rustication-of-3-visva-bharati-university-students-101631766906262.html

16-09-2021||Patna||Bihar Speaker seeks to host 82nd presiding officers conference||Bihar Legislative Assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha on Wednesday expressed his desire to host the 82nd All India Presiding Officers Conference (AIPOC) in the state, as it would coincide with the Bihar Legislative Assembly building centenary function as well as the completion of 100 years of the conference and the 75th year of India’s independence.“I urge you all to give this responsibility to Bihar and accept our invitation,” he said, while speaking virtually at the 81st AIPOC, which was presided over by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. The day also coincided with the International Day of Democracy. The theme of the conference was “Role of Legislature in fostering BG effective and meaningful democracy”.Sinha had earlier met President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapati Bhawan and invited him for the centenary function. The President gave his consent for it in October after Durga Puja. He had also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the latter’s residence with an invitation.Speaking at the conference, Sinha said the three pillars of democracy, including the legislature, judiciary and the executive, were working within their boundaries for the nation’s development and this was an opportunity to improve the credibility of the legislature.“If the legislature works as per the powers vested in it by the Constitution, it will only increase its dignity and reduce the chances of any intervention from any quarter,” he added.He said the legislature was accountable to the public and with technology’s aid, it was making itself available to the masses through live streaming of the sittings. “The legislature has to act as the bridge between the public and the executives. For it, people’s concerns are supreme and it is our moral duty to maintain its sanctity,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-speaker-seeks-to-host-82nd-presiding-officers-conference-101631760845294.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The show is going on||Tuesday afternoon. The balcony lobby is quiet. An attentive ear may hear the muffled sounds of film dialogues coming from inside the theatre’s thick doors. The day’s first show of Thalaivi is in progress, here in Delite cinema. And Mukti Ram Parajuli, manning the snack counter, is gearing up for the 10-minute interval that will begin shortly.Mr Parajuli, 49, joined this landmark theatre as an attendant in 1992. Since then many film halls in the city have become history, or given way to teeny-weeny multiplexes. But the sprawling world of his Delite with its wood-panelled walls, stately staircases, and heavy chandeliers appears unaltered. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic, however, explains the current attendance of only about two dozen people in the 358-seater balcony. It also explains the white ribbons tied to alternate chairs in the cinema’s canteen (to ensure physical distancing). It also explains Mr Parajuli’s masked face, and the pink plastic badge clipped to his shirt button that says, “Fully vaccinated.”In the pre-pandemic era, the snack counter teemed with people—it serves Delhi’s biggest samosa (called Maha Samosa). Last year, when the theatres were obliged to suspend screenings just before the first coronavirus-triggered lockdown in March, Mr Parajuli immediately left for his village in Nepal “because it’s better to be with your own family in a crisis like this.” That was the first time in many decades that he got the opportunity to stay for six continuous months with wife, two daughters, one son, two buffaloes and three goats. “I spent the period farming my small agricultural land,” even as his conscientious employers in Delhi wired him his salary every month without fail. Mr Parajuli returned to the city in October, but rushed back again following the lockdown during the second wave in April this year. These trips to home have never been simple. “I first have to board the express train, which takes 13 hours to reach Gorakhpur. Then I have to board the roadways bus to Sonauli, which takes three hours. Then I have to cross the international border by foot into Nepal, where I have to board the bus to the hills, which takes six hours to reach Bagnaskali Darpuk, my village.” Mr Parajuli returned in July; the cinema reopened a month later.Meanwhile, the “interval” clocks in. No customary rush of footsteps into the lobby follows. “Things should become better with newer releases,” he mutters optimistically. “In fact, the attendance was good last Sunday.”Mr Parajuli’s shift will end at midnight, he says, explaining the layout of his typical day. He will be back at the counter the next morning at 11. With the times continuing to be abnormal, the snack counter attendant expresses relief that “at least my routine is returning to normalcy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-show-is-going-on-101631756360516.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||Plan for 1,300 beds at LHMC’s kalawati saran child hospital||The proposed second phase redevelopment of the Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) will see the number of beds at one of its associated children’s hospitals, Kalawati Saran, triple from its current 380 to nearly 1,300, which will make it the largest children’s hospital in Asia -- a title currently held by the 837-bed Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children in Chennai.Senior officials from the hospital said the plan, which has been submitted to the Union health ministry , will see more beds coming up in a new building in the hospital. “Although redevelopment of the paediatric services was not a part of the initial second phase of the comprehensive redevelopment plan, there has been a lot of support from the government and the number of beds in Kalawati Saran will be increased. A plan for creating a 1,300-bed centre of national importance is in the pipeline,” said a senior official, on the condition of anonymity.The official said that a timeline for the second phase of the redevelopment of the hospital, which is in the heart of the city, is yet to be decided. “Another 100 beds for children and newborns will be added soon to Kalawati Saran Children’s hospital [for now] as the third wave is thought to likely affect children more,” said the official, adding that “the old blocks will be replaced by new blocks under the second phase of redevelopment.”A redevelopment plan for LHMC was created nearly 14 years ago, and the phase-I construction of a new outpatient clinic, in-patient ward, trauma centre for the associated Sucheta Kriplani hospital began in 2012. The construction was, however, halted for years when the private contractor abandoned the project citing lack of funds around 2014.In 2018, the Central Public Works Department declared the old building unsafe for patients and recommended that the services be shifted. The report said that the iron girders supporting the roof were not capable of supporting any weight.The services, however, continued in the dilapidated building despite the doctors going on a strike demanding that the work on the new building be completed.Last year, the then union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan announced that some of the work has already begun and that it will be completed soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plan-for-1-300-beds-at-lhmc-s-kalawati-saran-child-hospital-101631754915433.html

16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Covid surge: 88 areas declared containment zones in Srinagar||Srinagar has witnessed a spike in Covid cases in the past one week, prompting the administration to declare 88 areas in the city as containment zones. Out of over 1,300 active Covid cases in the UT, more than half come from Srinagar district. The officials have started taking steps to prevent the surge in cases as they fear unchecked infections could trigger the third wave. Other than Srinagar, cases reported from 19 other districts are either in single digit or no case at all.Medical experts and officials are worried over the spike in the cases in the city and say that by not following the Covid-appropriate behaviour, this surge could lead J&K towards the third wave.Srinagar DC Ajaz Asad said their district has 60% share in the active caseload in J&K.“Currently, we have 88 containment zones in Srinagar, 22 of which were added in the past one week. Due to special congregations, there has been a spike in the cases from certain areas or pockets of the city,” he added. “If we don’t follow safety protocols, then Srinagar could be the reason behind the start of third wave in J&K,” Asad said, adding that the people who haven’t taken vaccine should do it immediately. The administration has, meanwhile, formed special teams in the city to ensure compliance with Covid guidelines. On Tuesday, 15 people were detained by police from different areas for not wearing masks. “Srinagar can again become a hot spot if people show laxity. The lowering of guard in last couple of weeks led to spike in cases. People shouldn’t forget that this is a deadly disease,” said Dr Ahad, a senior consultant at a city hospital.On Wednesday, Jammu and Kashmir recorded 156 fresh coronavirus infections and one death. There were 123 cases in Kashmir while the Jammu division saw 32 infections. The summer capital Srinagar saw the highest count of 77 cases. The number of patients who were cured in the UT was 131 with active cases reaching 1,349.The overall number of people who have recovered reached 3,21,532, prompting the recovery rate to climb up to 98.23%.

The court directed the respondents to submit their reply within a period of two weeks.A division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua passed these orders on a petition taken up suo motu by the court as a PIL on a news item published in an English daily under title “De-addiction centres battle fund crunch”.It was reported that notwithstanding the claims of the state government to make Himachal a drug-free state, the condition of IRCA tells a different story. While the centres established in Kullu (women), Dharamshala, Chamba, Mandi, Sirmaur, Bilaspur and Solan are yet to become operational despite receipt of first grants, the 15-bed centre started in Shimla in 2019 is facing closure as it has not received grants (over ₹54 lakh) from the Centre in the past two years. The said centre is not in a position to add new patients and it has an occupancy of only three. The staffers have been forced to leave due to the non-payment of salaries for one year. The OPD and IPD facilities have also been discontinued.It was also reported that the centre has shared its concerns with the higher authorities, but no concrete step has been taken. It was further reported that the instances of drug addiction are on the rise and a total of 2,126 cases have been registered from January 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021.It was reported that there are four functional IRCAs in the HP in Shimla, Kullu, Una and Hamirpur with a total capacity of 60 beds. The other three are running at full capacity, but these are also facing financial constraints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/poor-state-of-himachal-rehab-centres-hc-puts-acs-on-notice-101631744222849.html
16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Jai Ram quells speculations of change in leadership||Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who returned to Shimla after his two-day visit to Delhi to meet the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) top leaders, spiked the speculation of any leadership change in the state ahead of the byelections. “It is not what was being speculated,” said Thakur on his return. “My visit to Delhi was pre-scheduled. It was not a sudden plan,” the CM said outside the Himachal secretariat. While ruling out the possibility of any leadership change in Himachal, he said, “The meeting primarily focused on preparations for the elections, both bypolls as well as general polls. The Delhi tour was a good one. It was scheduled nearly 25 days ago. There I met the party’s national president along with several key leaders from HP such as incharge, co-incharge, state chief and general secretary.” There were discussions on the core-group meetings in Dharamshala and road map to take forward the policies and programmes of the BJP government was explored, he added. “This will be implemented in letter and spirit,” the CM said, adding that he also discussed in detail the report card of his cabinet colleagues. It has been reliably learnt that the party high command expressed satisfaction over the performance of the cabinet ministers barring three, who were “underperforming”. “There was no scope to discuss the cabinet rejig in the meeting that was totally related to organisational affairs,” Thakur said, setting aside probability of cabinet reshuffle as well. Thakur on Wednesday, meanwhile, presided over a meeting of officers to take stock of President Ram Nath Kovind’s scheduled visit. Kovind will address a special session of the HP Vidhan Sabha on September 17. All-party meeting heldAn all-party meeting was held here on Wednesday to review the arrangements ahead of the Kovind’s visit on Thursday. Presiding over the meeting, CM Thakur said that the HP government had planned to organise year-long celebrations to mark the golden jubilee of the statehood, but due to the pandemic it was not possible to celebrate it on such a large scale. Thakur also sought all possible cooperation from the leaders of all political parties. Speaker of Vidhan Sabha Vipin Singh Parmar said all former MPs and MLAs have been invited to be a part of this “mega event”. He said at least 73 former MPs and MLAs have accepted the invitation. Leader of Opposition in HP assembly Mukesh Agnihotri said this event was above party politics and assured full cooperation from the Congress to the state government.MLA Rakesh Singha said it was an event of the people of the state, who have made immense contributions towards the development of Himachal.Chief whip Bikram Jaryal, MLAs Asha Kumari and Ram Lal Thakur also gave their suggestions in the meeting.Chief secretary Ram Subhag Singh, DGP Sanjay Kundu and Vidhan Sabha secretary Yashpal Sharma were among those who attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jai-ram-quells-speculations-of-change-in-leadership-101631744043662.html

Construction and Design Services (C&DS), a unit of UP Jal Nigam, will be undertaking the construction of the project and a proposal for the same has been forwarded to the state administration for final approval. The proposed parking facility is in vicinity of the New Bus Adda Metro station and adjacent to the proposed Ghaziabad station, which is being constructed as part of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS). “We have sent the proposal for the parking facility to the state administration for final approval. The parking facility will be developed at a strategic location so that passengers using the Metro and RRTS trains, which will get operational in future, can easily park their vehicles,” said Rohit Tomar, junior engineer from C&DS. The project will be undertaken at an estimated cost of ₹42 crore over 5,762 sqm. The C&DS has proposed spaces for parking 198 cars and 542 two-wheelers. “We have also decided to allocate space for 12 shops that will offer different goods and services for the convenience of those who will be using the parking facility. Both the Metro station and the upcoming RRTS station will be about 100m away from the proposed parking facility. We have proposed to develop the facility in 24 months,” said Tomar. Municipal commissioner MS Tanwar said the corporation has proposed the site for the parking facility. Municipal councillor Rajendra Tyagi from Raj Nagar said the proposed facility is located next to a densely populated area. “There should be proper security arrangements with boundary walls. Moreover, steps should be taken to ensure locals don’t use the facility for parking their own vehicles. Further, a separate lane/road should also be developed from the main GT Road near Metro station and the proposed RRTS station up to the parking facility,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/newly-proposed-site-for-multilevel-car-park-in-ghaziabad-will-cater-to-metro-rrts-passengers-101631741822364.html

As a result, around 20 lakh vehicles were plying on roads without HSRPs.He shared that the transport principal secretary, in July 2020, had notified a penalty/challan amount of ₹2,000 for first offence and ₹3,000 for subsequent offence. Besides, expressing concern over compliance, the office of the state transport commissioner had sent a communication to the authorities concerned in August this year.Soi said he will also take up the matter with departments concerned and move court if required.“It is easy to catch violators with HSRPs, as these are registered with the national vehicle registry – Vahan. People involved in organised crime mostly install fake number plates or simply remove the plates. If enforcement agencies make sure that HSRP is installed on every vehicle, the crime graph will automatically come down,” he said.Soi also sought action against dealers who sold cars without HSRPs. “As per rules, a car owner cannot take the car out of the showroom until HSRP is installed on it,” he added.RTA secretary Narinder Singh said the authorities, including the RTA office and traffic police, were continuously creating awareness about HSRP and also issuing challans to violators. “Ludhiana has a large number of vehicles, so it takes time to replace their number plates,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hsrps-can-help-bring-down-crime-national-road-safety-council-member-101631741704037.html

While the reason could not be established immediately, jail guards and paramilitary personnel deployed in the jail rushed to the spot to separate the fighting groups.A high alert was sounded and police personnel from Zone 4 of the Ludhiana police commissionerate were also pressed into service to control the situation.After separating the fighting inmates, they were taken to different barracks and the injured were treated at the hospital on the jail premises.While jail superintendent Balkar Singh Bhullar was not available for a comment, deputy superintendent Satnam Singh claimed it was a minor fight between two groups.He said DSP (Security) Ashwani Sharma will conduct an inquiry into the incident and submit a report.While nodal officer Rupinder Kaur Bhatti could not be reached, additional deputy commissioner of police-4 Rupinder Kaur Sra said no formal complaint was received from the jail.This is not the first time that violence erupted in the jail. On June 27, 2019, an inmate was killed and over a dozen people, including five police personnel, were injured after two gangs clashed inside the prison following rioting, forcing the police to open fire. Four prisoners tried to escape amid the commotion, but were apprehended.Rivalry had spilled out on streets in JuneWednesday’s incident comes three months after aides of Shubham went around firing shots and attacking people related to Puneet on June 3. Puneet’s cousin was attacked with sharp-edged weapons and his car was vandalised. They further hurled stones at the house of the gangster, while threatening his mother, before going to the house of his aide Nanna Don, also pelting it with stones. Later, five shots were fired at a woman related to Puneet, but she escaped unhurt.Subsequently, members of Puneet’s gang assaulted an aide of Shubham, Rajvir Singh. Multiple FIRs were lodged into the attacks.The rivalry between the two gangs goes back to February 2020 when Shubham and his aides assaulted Puneet. They both were eventually arrested and lodged in Ludhiana central jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-inmates-injured-in-gang-war-at-ludhiana-central-jail-101631741702501.html

On Wednesday, Punjab medical education and research minister Om Prakash Soni held a meeting with officials of the health department, district administration and the municipal cooperation (MC) to take stock of the situation. Expressing concern over the rising numbers, Soni directed the officials to take all necessary steps to prevent the outbreak and ensure the safety of residents. Fogging should be ensured in at least 20 wards of the city daily, he said. The health department has asked the civic body to conduct regular fogging in all 85 wards of the city besides initiating an extensive inspection in residential areas to detect dengue larvae.“Those infected must increase their fluid intake and take proper rest to avoid complications. We have already issued 546 challans over detecting larvae this year,” said district epidemiologist Dr Madan Mohan. He said dengue-causing mosquitoes usually bite during the day and proper precautions such as mosquito coils, sprays, mosquito repellent creams should be used. Mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu said he was personally monitoring the situation in the city. “Wey have also ordered some new machines to intensify fogging,” he said.Soni said the government will take strict action against officials for negligence in duty while handling the dengue situation. Last year, Amritsar had reported nearly 350 dengue cases. Officials said this year’s the count will surpass the previous year’s figure. The cases are likely to increase in the coming days, they added. Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh said it is the responsibility of the MC to not let rainy water accumulate in any area until the situation gets normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/161-dengue-cases-in-punjab-s-amritsar-in-15-days-health-department-on-toes-101631740142045.html

The matter was raised during a meeting of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh with the association office-bearers who claimed to have raised the farmers’ apprehensions about the land records integration process. “We conveyed to everyone present in the meeting that it was not possible as the Centre has mandated all procurement states, including Punjab, to integrate land records (farads) with the procurement portal and the entire process is at an advance stage,” said secretary (food and civil supplies) Rahul Tiwari. A state food and civil supplies department official said of 8.75 farmers registered on the procurement portal, land records of over 4 lakh have been integrated and further verifications are going on. In a meeting between the Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders and political parties on September 10, the farmer unions expressed apprehension that the demand for land records (fards) for details of land ownership before procurement as ordered by the Centre is unjust as a large number of cultivators have taken land on lease and in many cases division is still to be done. On September 12, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu sent a communiqué to the CM, asking him to “fight against the injustice” saying “it was an attack on resilient minimum procurement price (MSP) regime and to push farmers away from the APMC mandis towards private markets, where no such records are maintained. “The CM has already taken the matter with the Centre seeking relaxation. But as of now, the Centre’s directions are clear that there will be no procurement if integration is not implemented. Even if we carry on with the upcoming paddy procurement without integration of land records, the Food Corporation India (FCI) will not accept rice from the state later,” said Tiwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cant-stop-farmers-land-records-integration-with-procurement-punjab-government-to-arhtiyas-101631740022078.html

According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, 6,909 cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act were registered in Punjab against 11,536 in 2019, followed by Uttar Pradesh that recorded 10,852 such cases. In 2020, a total of 82,875 cases were registered in Punjab under various sections of the Indian Penal Code besides special and local laws against 72,855 in 2019. But the figures obtained from the police department reveal that despite less cases, the recovery of heroin remained record high at 759 kg in Punjab last year as compared 460 kg in 2019. “The less number of cases was because there was a complete lockdown for nearly three months in the country followed by other restrictions later. The focus remained on implementing these guidelines and the war against drugs could have suffered,” said a senior special task force (STF) officer. In 2020, crimes against women dipped in the state eve as the number rose in 2019 as compared to the previous year. Rise in murders, suicides There was an increase of 10% in cases of murder in Punjab from 679 in 2019 to 757 in 2020.

16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Repeal amendments to APMC Act, Akali Dal dares Navjot Sidhu||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday asked Punjab Congress president Navjot Sidhu “not to try to befool people by raking up old issues” and dared him to muster courage to repeal the amendments made in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act by his government if he was serious about helping the cause of farmers. In a press statement, SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said Sidhu’s fresh utterances indicate that he is keen on playing a game of one-upmanship with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and has no intention of doing anything to ensure repeal of the three agriculture laws. The SAD leader said Amarinder woke up and realised the damage the three black laws were doing to Punjab two days back, nearly one year after they were passed by Parliament. “Now, Sidhu has also woken up from his slumber and wants to project himself as a sympathiser of the farmers even though he has done nothing to support their cause in the last one year,” he said. On the 2013 Act passed during the SAD-BJP tenure, Cheema said Sidhu seemed to have forgotten that his wife was a chief parliamentary secretary in the then government.“Sidhu had also failed to dig up files and details of the Congress’ response to the Act. He should tell if he had ever objected to the 2013 Act as minister in the Congress government in 2017 and even later? It is only now with elections months away that you are taking up this issue to cover up your failures,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/repeal-amendments-to-apmc-act-akali-dal-dares-navjot-sidhu-101631739723848.html

16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Alert sounded in Punjab’s cotton belt after pink bollworm attack in Haryana||The Punjab agriculture department on Wednesday directed all eight cotton-growing districts to immediately start a drive to check the spread of pink bollworm after an extensive infestation of the deadly disease was reported in adjoining districts of Haryana and parts of Rajasthan.Agriculture director Sukhdev Sidhu said the next three weeks are crucial to containing the further spread of the infestation. After Bathinda and Mansa, pink bollworm infestation has now been reported in Sunam and Lehragaga subdivisions of Sangrur, he added.“Official inputs say a few pockets of Sriganganagar have spotted the deadly moths in cotton fields and agriculture teams in the adjoining Fazilka district have been alerted. All cotton-sowing villages in southern Punjab will be surveyed twice in the next three weeks. Farmers need not worry and follow the guidelines issued by the department,” said Sidhu.Experts say in the infested fields, the cotton bolls look absolutely normal from outside. But each infected boll has a pink bollworm inside. The worm eats cotton seeds and prevents the development of cotton staple fibre around it well before the cotton boll opens.Infestation is found double in Bathinda and Mansa, the largest cotton-growing belt after last week’s estimation of 5% of nearly 1.61 lakh hectare area. It is for the first time that the disease has been found at this magnitude in Punjab and infestation is spotted even in villages where there are no cotton ginning units, considered among the two reasons behind it.The first picking of cotton bolls is expected to begin from next week.According to chief agriculture officer for Bathinda and Mansa Manjit Singh, nearly 10% of the crop in the twin districts was found hit with pink bollworm.“The situation is in control as fields are under surveillance. Our teams are sensitising the farmers about the use of spay and keeping a constant watch on crop,” he said.SK Verma, head of Sirsa-based Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR), a central organisation, said Bollgard 2, or BG-2, Monsanto’s second-generation insecticidal technology for cotton, is now found susceptible to pink bollworm. He said 12 districts of Haryana, including Jind, Sirsa, Hisar and Palwal, have been infected with the bollworm.“It is a deadly pest that appears in cotton at its later stage. It cannot be prevented but is easy to avoid and manage with active support of stakeholders. Farmers must ensure that cotton residue, which is commonly used as firewood, is not kept in fields. This moth can survive in any climatic condition and lives only on cotton plants or its residue,” said Verma.Haryana joint director, agriculture, RP Sihag said the pest larvae is reaching the north Indian states with cottonseed consignments brought from south-west states, including Maharashtra and Karnataka, for processing by millers.“The current situation is not alarming but a comprehensive plan is needed to implement to manage it before next sowing season,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/alert-sounded-in-punjab-s-cotton-belt-after-pink-bollworm-attack-in-haryana-101631737921735.html

16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn exploring land pooling options to develop villages||The UT administration is considering a number of land pooling models for the development of villages and periphery land pockets.One of the models being considered is giving land development rights instead of land rights. Under it, villagers opting for land pooling will form a consortium and then be allowed to develop the land as per the laid down building bylaws and other rules and regulations. Common facilities like roads and water supply will be provided.Such models were taken up in a meeting that was convened at the level of the UT adviser here on Wednesday. Different aspects of the Land Aggregation Policy for Chandigarh and proposed development of villages and peripheral areas as notified in the Chandigarh Master Plan 2031 were also discussed.“Mohali has a Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) and Panchkula has Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikarn (HSVP), but Chandigarh doesn’t have any such authority. The administration will be exploring the option of giving this role to Chandigarh Housing Board,” said a senior UT official who attended the meeting.On the controversial issue of the Lal Dora extension, the administration has decided that it will be marked on villages using LIDIR technology. The deputy commissioner’s office will provide the same to the urban planning department, said the official. “The urban planning department has been directed to prepare a comprehensive strategy for village development plan,” the official added.Earlier, the consultant of Indian Institute for Human Settlement (IIHS), Bangaluru, presented a draft policy for aggregation of land for villages and peri urban areas in Chandigarh, after studying best practices of this area in Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra.The UT adviser said that provisions of RERA and other Acts/guidelines prevalent for such development may also be incorporated. Other officials present in the meeting also made suggestions on the issue. The consultant has been given a month’s time to rework the initial draft and submit a report within a month.Kapil Setia, chief architect, thereafter made a presentation on study undertaken for development plan of villages in Chandigarh, highlighting existing physical situation and proposals and possible options for both sectoral and non-sectoral villages in conformity with the notified CMP 2031.Based on recommendations of the Chandigarh Master Plan 2031, focused development of villages shall be undertaken by the municipal corporation/CHB as per the above policy to be notified by the Chandigarh administration in consultation with the competent authority. These development plans shall be undertaken through a special village planning cell in close coordination between MC, CHB and the department of urban planning in a time-bound manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-exploring-land-pooling-options-to-develop-villages-101631737024278.html
16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh has achieved 100% first dose vaccination target: Centre||Chandigarh is now in the Union ministry of health and family welfare’s list of states and UTs which have inoculated 100% of its eligible population (18+age group) with the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, after the Centre revised the UT’s target population. Now, the Union ministry has finalised Chandigarh’s eligible population at 8,43,000. Earlier, the central government had fixed Chandigarh’s target at 15,75,709 people.However, the UT administration had said the city’s eligible population was 7,29,822, according to the 2011 Census and considering the decadal growth of 17.2%. Also, the administration had on August 14 claimed that it had jabbed 100% of its eligible population after administering the vaccine to 7,32,368 people.The ministry had on September 13 released a list of six states and UTs with 100% first dose coverage, but had not included Chandigarh. Those included in the list were Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Daman and Diu, Sikkim, Ladakh and Lakshadweep. The UT administration had then raised the issue of “mismatched population targets” with the Centre several times in the last few weeks. Dr MK Aggarwal, additional commissioner (UIP), of Union health ministry, on Wednesday wrote a letter to the UT administration which stated, “As per recommendations of the office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, the population target of Chandigarh has been revised in various age groups. The revised population target of 18 years and above category is 8,43,000, of which 5,84,000 people are in the 18-44 years group, 1,81,000 in 45-59 years and 78,000 people are 60 years and above.”So far, 8,61,359 people, including migrants, have taken their first shot in Chandigarh, while 3,74,787 (45%) were fully vaccinated. In the last seven days, around 8,015 people were vaccinated in Chandigarh daily on an average.UT adviser Dharam Pal said, “Even with the revised data of targeted population, UT Chandigarh is among the states or UTs which have administered at least one vaccine dose to 100% of the targeted population I want to congratulate all doctors, nurses and healthcare workers for their contribution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-has-achieved-100-first-dose-vaccination-target-centre-101631736904691.html
16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Pakistan-aided Khalistani groups banned by India gaining ground in US: Report||Pakistan-backed Khalistani separatist groups, banned by the Indian government, are quietly gaining ground in the US, a top American think tank has warned, ruing that Washington has so far remained indifferent to the appeals made by New Delhi to curb their destabilising anti-India activities.The US-based Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan group, was banned by the Indian government in 2019 for its alleged anti-national activities.The SFJ had pushed for “Sikh Referendum 2020” as part of its separatist agenda. It openly espouses the cause of Khalistan and in that process challenges the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India. The outlawed group’s primary objective is to establish an “independent and sovereign country” in Punjab.In its “Pakistan’s Destabilization Playbook: Khalistani Activism in the US” report published on Tuesday, the Hudson Institute examines the conduct of “Khalistan and Kashmir separatist groups within the United States” to investigate their support by Pakistan.The report looks at these groups’ ties to militant and terrorist outfits in India, and the possible detrimental effects of their activities on US foreign policy in South Asia.The report demonstrates that “like Pakistan-based Islamist terrorist groups, the Khalistan groups can emerge under new names.” “Unfortunately, the United States has shown no interest in violence committed by Khalistan activists, even though the Khalistan campaign’s most ardent supporters are located in western countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. Unless the US government prioritises oversight of Khalistan-related militancy and terrorism, it is unlikely to identify groups that are currently engaged in violence in Punjab in India or are preparing to do so. One seldom finds what one is not looking for,” it said.Anticipation constitutes a crucial part of national security planning and therefore investigating within the limits prescribed by law, the activities of Khalistani groups located in North America is important to preventing a reoccurrence of the violence orchestrated by the Khalistan movement in the 1980s, it said.Importantly, the recent spurt in Khalistan-related anti-India activism within America is occurring as the United States and India are collaborating to confront the rise of China, especially in the Indo-Pacific, it said.“The Khalistan movement’s history and recent mobilisation should serve as a reminder that unless the threat it poses is somehow pre-empted, it could expand to a level where action might be too late to prevent large-scale loss of life,” it said.The report calls upon the US government to take India’s concerns seriously and dedicate the requisite intelligence and law enforcement resources to help India address these concerns.The report said the US government should include all groups responsible for terrorist attacks in India in its list of designated global terrorist groups and designate as terrorists the various individuals that India and US intelligence and law enforcement have established as being connected to designated terrorist entities.Observing that Sikh radical groups are active in New York and in California, the report said that in addition to disseminating anti-India propaganda, the focus of these organisations is advocating the Khalistan cause and to secure support they target local politicians, US think tanks and human rights activists.“Khalistan activists also use Sikh places of worship, gurdwaras to attract followers, organising special events to commemorate the ‘martyrdom’ of terrorists in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pakistanaided-khalistani-groups-banned-by-india-gaining-ground-in-us-report-101631736902079.html

The applications in the prescribed format along with supporting documents should be submitted with the office of dean faculty affairs by 5pm on October 14.NIRF rankings discussedDuring the meeting, the recently announced NIRF-2021 rankings were discussed, in which PEC had achieved the 70th position among engineering institutes of the country. Last year, the institute had come 68th. The members made many suggestions to improve the college’s performance.PU panel to deliberate on recruitment normsFor the direct recruitment of teachers, Panjab University (PU) is in the process of framing templates and application forms as per University Grants Commission (UGC) regulations issued in July 2018.The varsity has constituted a 13-member panel to deliberate on the matter and frame the template and application forms for the direct recruitment of associate professors, professors and principals.

16-09-2021||Lucknow||Nirmala Sitharaman to chair GST Council meeting in Lucknow||Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will preside over the 45th meeting of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council in Lucknow on Friday. During the meeting in Lucknow, the GST Council is scheduled to discuss a number of important issues that may include a proposal to bring petrol and diesel under the GST regime.A meeting of senior officers of the Union government and the participating states will give a final shape to the preparations for the meeting here on Thursday.Union minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary and ministers from different states nominated to the council will also attend the meeting being held physically after a gap of 16 months. It last met physically in New Delhi on March 14, 2020.“We understand a number of issues are going to be there on GST Council’s agenda. Various issues that participating states may like to raise are likely to find a place on the GST Council’s agenda. This issue (petrol and diesel) may also come up. The Kerala high court in June 2021 directed the GST Council to take a call on the issue,” said two persons aware of the developments. Uttar Pradesh finance minister Suresh Khanna refused to comment on the issue.“We are the host state. We are making arrangements for comfortable stay of our guests. We are not aware of the GST Council’s agenda. We have got confirmation about participation from 24 states so far. Besides, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Union minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary, those reaching Lucknow to participate in the GST Council meeting include deputy chief ministers and finance ministers of many states,” Khanna said.“Value Added Tax (VAT) on petroleum products is a major source of revenue for states. No state will like to lose the main source of revenue though bringing the petroleum products under the GST regime will give a big relief to the public as this will reduce the tax incidence and consequently the prices of these products,” said professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of the department of economics, Lucknow University.Other participants include several deputy chief ministers —Chowna Mein (Arunachal Pradesh), Raj Kishore Prasad (Bihar), Manish Sisodia (Delhi), Dushyant Chautala (Haryana) and Yumnam Joykumar Singh (Manipur) and Jishnu Debbarma (Tripura).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nirmala-sitharaman-to-chair-gst-council-meeting-in-lucknow-101631735760908.html

16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Amid lockdown, crime graph went down in 2020||The pandemic brought down the overall crime in Chandigarh in 2020, while leading to a spike in the number of people disobeying government orders — apparently for lockdown in this case — according to the latest Crime in India report released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Wednesday. As many as 3,254 FIRs for various criminal offences were registered by Chandigarh Police in 2020, as compared to 4,518 in 2019, a drop of 28%. Of these 771 were registered under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. In comparison, the number stood at just 148 in 2019, pointing to rise of 420% in 2020. Also read: Minors account for 75% rape victims in ChandigarhSection 188 implies disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant. If convicted, the violator may be imprisoned up to six months. The country remained under complete lockdown from March 25 to May 31 last year. Even after that, various restrictions on movement and gatherings continued. The residents were expected to adhere to safety protocols while stepping out and any violation invited challan and even registration of a case under Section 188. Smuggling down, arms cases upMeanwhile, overall crime showed a dip due to increased police presence on roads, night curfew and closing down of various commercial establishments and public places. The restrictions on interstate movement also brought down the number of cases of liquor and drug smuggling. As many as 173 and 134 cases, respectively, were registered in 2020, as compared to 182 and 226, respectively, in 2019. However, police presence led to a rise in recovery of illegal arms. In 33 cases registered under the Arms Act, 29 illegal arms were recovered in 2020. In comparison, only 12 cases were registered in 2019. 46% drop in fatal road mishapsThe lockdown also led to a 46% drop in fatal road accidents. In 2020, 43 people were killed in 41 road accidents. The numbers stood at 78 and 77, respectively, in 2019. The accidents included 16 hit-and-run cases, which claimed 17 lives. In 2019, 21 such cases were reported. Senior citizens vulnerable to cheating Even though crime against senior citizens registered 14% dip, from 50 cases in 2019 to 43 in 2020, they became more vulnerable to getting duped. As Covid-19 restrictions confined senior citizens in their houses, they became dependent on others, and apparently fell victim to swindlers. In 2020, in 17 cases of cheating, the victim was aged above 60. The number stood at eight in 2019. Meanwhile, theft cases reported by the elderly came down from 20 in 2019 to just two in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-amid-lockdown-crime-graph-went-down-in-2020-101631734741053.html

16-09-2021||Noida||Noida residents welcome pet registration app||Residents have welcomed the pet registration app launched on Wednesday by the Noida authority, saying that the digital service is a good step towards raising awareness among owners.The Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA), an umbrella body of over 70 high-rise societies in the city, said that the mobile application will promote responsibility among the pet owners and could lead to better coordination between them and the administration. “Now, we will have some data on hand regarding the number of pets in the city. Apart from making a pet friendly environment, the app may also help deal with abandonment issues,” said Rajiva Singh, president, NOFAA.Col (retd) IP Singh, chairman of Arun Vihar RWA, said, “The idea is very good as at least there would be a record of pets in the city. However, there is a need to ensure that the pet owners understand their responsibilities. Many owners use public area as their dogs’ poop area, and such instances lead to conflicts.”Meanwhile, Noida authority officials have urged people to register their pets (dogs and cats), along with their photographs and rabies vaccination documents, through the ‘Noida pet registration’ app for a fee of ₹500 per annum. According to the officials, the registration of pets would help keep a record of the pets in the city and could lead to better resolution of common conflicts between pet owners and their neighbours. “A number of times we receive complaints from the residents against pet owners. With the registration data in hand, it would be easier to resolve such issues. We are planning to give a grace period of six months, after which we may impose penalty on the owners who fail to register their pets,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer, Noida authority.Animal activists said while this is a positive step, more needs to be done to deal with issues arising out of pets.“It is good that they are encouraging people to register their pets which is a responsible step. However, more is required to be done to make the programme effective, like installing microchips in the bodies of pets to reduce the abandonment issues. Also, there should be more benefits for the pet owners such as random check-ups, else it’s just a revenue generating exercise,” said Sampriti, a Noida-based animal activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-residents-welcome-pet-registration-app-101631734380797.html

It was found contaminated.” The other six samples that failed the test were from private submersible pumps.“We will add more chorine to water in tubewells on Thursday. A special drive will also be carried out to disconnect private submersible pumps,” said Verma. Additional deputy commissioner Himanshu Aggarwal, who visited the spot, said: “Medical camps have been set up at various localities and the situation is under control.

16-09-2021||Noida||Men create ruckus at transport office in Noida||A group of men created a ruckus at the assistant regional transport office (ARTO) in Noida and misbehaved with the officials on Tuesday. A video of the incident, circulated on social media, showed the men identifying themselves as members of Bajrang Dal. AK Pandey, ARTO (administration) Gautam Budh Nagar, said that three clerks were working at the office when six to eight suspects barged in and misbehaved with them. “The suspects also damaged official records and threatened the clerks with dire consequences. We have filed a complaint and demand the police take action in this case,” he said. The ARTO, in a complaint, alleged that the suspects frequently visit the transport office and misbehave with the officials and pressurise them for favours. Lalit Bharadwaj, Bajrang Dal Noida convenor, said a Bajrang Dal member had visited the ARTO office to get a registration certificate (RC) for his vehicle. “There were no senior officials at the office at the time. He had been going to the transport office for four days but the work was not getting done. He met some clerks in the transport office who talked to him rudely and asked him to get out of the room. This led to an argument and some more Bajrang Dal members reached the spot, which led to an unpleasant scene,” he said. Sudhir Kumar, the station house officer of Sector 24 police station, said Neeraj Kumar Shukla, a Bajrang Dal member, had filed a complaint in this regard in the morning. “Shukla said the clerks were angry at him because he had complained about the presence of touts at the transport office. The ARTO has also filed a complaint against Shukla and others in this regard. We are investigating the matter from all angles,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/men-create-ruckus-at-transport-office-in-noida-101631734080780.html

The court also observed that Maan is a noted singer and is not a personality who will abscond from investigation. He has been asked to join investigation in a week. A detailed order is awaited. The plea will now be taken up on September 30. Maan’s remark at Nakodar fair triggered row During a religious fair in Nakodar on August 24, Maan had described Ladi Shah of Dera Baba Murad Shah as a descendant of the third Sikh master, Guru Amar Das. When a social media campaign started against his statement, Maan put out a video online, offering an apology for his statement. However, a case was registered against him. Maan has argued that no offence under Section 295A of the IPC can be said to be made out against him. To be booked under the section, it has to be demonstrated that an act has been committed with deliberate and malicious intention to outrage the religious feelings of any class of citizens and such act insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class. In the present case, the first information report (FIR) prima facie fails to disclose that the essential ingredients of offence were made out, it has been argued. The plea says the trial court judge apparently got “influenced by the show of public outcry, generated by some sections through a sustained campaign”. “As a humble Sikh and a sensitive citizen, the petitioner made a widely circulated public apology. His words ought to be interpreted in the total background of his lifelong devotion to Sikh Gurus and to the principles of Sikhism,” the plea says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hurting-religious-sentiments-hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-gurdas-maan-101631733900765.html
16-09-2021||Noida||Noida cancels allotment of two realtors over commercial land dues of ₹1,384 crore||The Noida authority on Wednesday said it has started taking ‘stern action’ against those realtors and individual financial defaulters who failed to make payments despite repeated notices. The authority has issued recovery notices to several such defaulters and cancelled the allotment of commercial plots in the past one month, including that of a commercial plot in Sector 105 and another in Sector 124.According to the authority, the developer in Sector 124 has ₹796 crore dues, while the developer in Sector 105 has dues amounting to ₹588 crore.“We cancelled the allotment of these two developers because they defaulted on land cost payments and also ignored our repeated notices. We have issued recovery notices against four other realtors, who failed to pay land cost dues, but we did not cancel the commercial land allotment of these four, as these projects are operational and third party rights are in place. Now recovery proceedings will take place as per rules to collect our dues,” said Kumar Sanjay, officer on special duty, Noida authority.The authority has issued recovery notices against a realtor of a commercial project in Sector 98, which owed ₹350 crore to the authority. Notices have also been issued to a realtor in Sector 52 with ₹869 crore dues, developer in Sector 16 with ₹63 crore dues and another one in Sector 61 with dues of over ₹26 crore. “Only one project -- a commercial shopping mall in Sector 61 is operational; the rest are in the construction stage as the developers failed to finish the projects on time,” said Sanjay.Apart from these, the authority also issued seven recovery notices to small defaulters to recover ₹4.26 crore dues and also cancelled allotment of individual allottees of four commercial plots, owing ₹54 crore in dues.“We have taken action against these 17 allottees in the past two months, after following the due notice procedure,” said Sanjay.From January 2020 to March 2021, the Noida authority cancelled allotment of nine allottees that failed to pay a total dues of ₹4,905.68 crore and it also issued recovery notices against one individual plot owner for failing to pay ₹94.35 lakh.As the realty sector is witnessing a slump, with dip in sales of commercial space, industry analysts said most realtors are unable to pay land dues to the authority.“There are two key reasons why a few commercial projects in Noida could not become a success and repay dues. One is that banks always remain reluctant to finance a commercial project unlike residential ones. The second reason is that the Noida authority or the state government is yet to reduce the interest rate imposed on commercial plots. Without the government reducing the interest rates, a commercial project cannot become financially viable,” said Sunny Katyal, director, Investors Clinic, a consultancy firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-cancels-allotment-of-two-realtors-over-commercial-land-dues-of-1-384-crore-101631733840808.html
16-09-2021||Lucknow||BJP to hold parallel meeting of farmers in Lucknow on September 19||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will hold a parallel farmers’ meet in Lucknow on September 19 when the Yogi Adityanath government completes four-and-a-half years in Uttar Pradesh. The farmers’ wing of the party intends to felicitate chief minister Yogi Adityanath on the occasion. The meeting in Lucknow is part of the BJP plan to step up the initiative to connect with those whom the party has described as “real farmers”. The move comes amid indications that the ongoing Opposition-backed farmer agitation against the Centre’s three farm reform laws will intensify ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh (UP) assembly election. BJP farmer wing chief in UP Kameshwar Singh said an estimated 20,000 farmers are expected at the Lucknow meeting. “Fifty farmers would come from each of the 403 assembly constituencies of UP to thank the chief minister for various pro-farmer measures,” Singh said. The BJP’s farmer-connect campaign comes days after the September 5 Muzaffarnagar Mahapanchayat that was organised by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (joint farmers’ union) and ahead of the September 27 Bharat Bandh call given by all the farmers’ union backing the agitation. A day before the Bharat Bandh, yet another farmers’ mahapanchayat has been convened on September 26 at the same GIC ground in Muzaffarnagar where the one supported by Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) was held on September 5. BKU won’t be part of the proposed September 26 mahapanchayat which its leader Rakesh Tikait has described as one “sponsored by the government.” The ruling BJP has sought to distinguish between the “real farmers and ones agitating for political reasons.“Theirs is not a farmers’ agitation, it’s a political agitation,” said the state’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya while referring to the ongoing agitation demanding rollback of the Centre’s three farm reform laws. The BJP has already concluded farmers’ meeting at 298 places in 95 assembly constituencies.“We selected those assembly segments which had a substantial presence of sugarcane farmers. In these meetings, we interacted with nearly 60,000 farmers,” the UP BJP farmers’ wing chief said.The farmers’ wing intends to felicitate 71 farmers at each district centre on September 17, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 71st birthday. “We have so many achievements to talk about. As many as 2.50 crore farmers in UP are benefitting through the Kisan Samman Nidhi, soil health cards, crop insurance, kisan credit card, 50 per cent discount of farm equipment. These are some of the many achievements that we will talk about,” the farmers’ wing chief said.In a major pro-farmer outreach initiative in August, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced cases against farmers for burning crop residue would be withdrawn and a decision would be taken to reimburse monetary penalties levied on such farmers. Also, orders were issued to not disconnect the power connections of farmers due to pending bills. However, these announcements failed to impress BKU leader Rakesh Tikait who cited his list of demands, primary of them being the withdrawal of farm laws. “Scams have been conducted in the name of MSP (minimum support price) and there are districts where procurement has been done in the name of fake farmers. The BJP government had promised that farmers’ income would be doubled. Well, the government should ideally have declared sugarcane MSP at ₹650 per quintal, paddy at ₹3700 per quintal and wheat at ₹4100 per quintal,” Rakesh Tikait said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-to-hold-parallel-meeting-of-farmers-in-lucknow-on-september-19-101631733780752.html
16-09-2021||Chandigarh||Badals laid foundation of farm laws, alleges Sidhu||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday hit out at the Badals, accusing the previous led Shiromani Akali Dad-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD) of laying the foundation of the three farm laws. Calling former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal the “niti nirmata” (policymaker) for the agriculture laws, he claimed that the central laws were a “photostat copy” of the Punjab Contract Farming Act enacted during the previous government in 2013. He said that Badal had tabled the Contract Farming Bill in the Punjab assembly in 2013 and it was later enacted as the Act. “I say with conviction and clarity that the Badals laid the foundation of the central laws,” Sidhu said at his first press conference after becoming the state unit head of the Congress, describing them as the real culprits behind the anti-farmer legislation. The Punjab Congress chief was flanked by four working presidents Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Kuljit Singh Nagra and Pawan Goel, state general secretary (organisation) Pargat Singh and principal strategic adviser Mohammad Mustafa. Sidhu said the Badals had initially supported the central laws and then recanted after the farmers started protesting. “The SAD and the BJP are two sides of the same coin. The alliance break-up was a ruse. They will be back together after the elections,” he claimed. A video showing former CM Parkash Singh Badal, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal praising the central laws was also played. Sidhu agreed to field questions on the subject, but ducked most queries. He also refused to answer questions related to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s statement asking the farmers to move their agitation out of Punjab. On farmer unions’ appeal to political parties not to hold election rallies till the poll schedule is announced, he said: “The matter is under consideration of party leadership.” Giving clause-by-clause details of the Punjab Contract Farming Act, Sidhu said that there was no mention of minimum support price in the state law which also allowed corporates to purchase produce below the MSPs. In case of a dispute, the power to settle it under the 2013 law was vested with the bureaucracy and farmers were barred from approaching the court, he added. Sidhu also compared provisions of the Punjab Contract Farming Act with the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Private Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, enacted by the Centre last year, calling the latter a facsimile of the state law. Claiming that these laws were enacted to benefit the corporates, the PPCC president said that both laws have no MSP guarantee, allowed direct procurement, provided for dispute resolution by bureaucracy and the farmers could not file suit. “The Punjab law also had a provision that if a farmers defaults, he could be sent to jail for a month and made to pay a fine ranging from ₹5,000 to ₹5 lakh,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/badals-laid-foundation-of-farm-laws-alleges-sidhu-101631733720837.html

At 61.1%, even crime rate against children in the city is much higher than the national average of 17.4%. These are the findings of the Crime in India 2020 report released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Wednesday.Amid lockdown, the overall crime graph came down last year. As compared to 515 cases of crime against women registered in 2019, 301 cases surfaced in 2020. The number of rapes also dropped from 112 to 60.However, there was a rise in the proportion of rape cases involving minor victims. From 60% (65 of 112), it went up to 75% (46 of 60). Majority of the victims were in the age group of 16-18 years (24) followed by 12-16 years (16).Accused known to victim in 93% casesAccording to the NCRB data, in 93% of rape cases, the accused was known to the victims. While 32 rapes were committed on the pretext of marriage, the accused was a family member in eight cases and a family friend, employer or neighbour in 16 cases. Only four of the 60 cases reported in 2020 involved a stranger.Also read: Amid lockdown, crime graph went down in 2020“The accused is mostly a known person as they are the ones who can easily approach the victims. Many a times parents don’t doubt their intentions and leave children in their custody,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. Sangeeta Jund, project director, Childline, said the drop in the overall number of crimes against minors could be because of the lockdown and underreporting. “Earlier, cases of sexual assault surfaced when children confided in counsellors or their friends, but the pandemic forced children to remain restrained in their houses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/minors-account-for-75-rape-victims-in-chandigarh-101631733661533.html

16-09-2021||Delhi||Excise transition: Private liquor vends to stay shut next month||All private liquor vends in Delhi will shut next month and only government stores will function until the Capital transitions to a new excise policy on November 17, the administration said on Wednesday, adding that it earned R8,900 crore from auctioning retail licences in the Capital’s newly created 32 zones.Delhi has 849 liquor stores, of which 276 are privately-run and the rest are operated by the Delhi government through its agencies. On November 17, the government will fully withdraw from the alcohol business in an attempt to usher in greater transparency, revenue and service quality.“All private vends having L-7 and L-10 licenses, both of which deal with retail sale of Indian and foreign liquor, will operate only till September 30. This is to ensure a smooth transition for the new licensees to take over. Government vends will continue till November 16. Government vends selling country liquor will be allowed to operate till March 2022. Restaurants, bars and clubs will face no problem in keeping up their stocks as wholesale sale of liquor is not being stopped,” said a senior excise official.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s excise minister, said that the government expects to earn another ₹3,500 crore revenue in the first year once the new liquor stores begin operations.“The bidding took place in a very fair manner. We received roughly 250 bids for the 32 zones. The highest bid in each zone won in a very transparent manner. Soon, the customer experience of buying liquor in Delhi will change drastically,” Sisodia said, adding that the experience of buying alcohol in the capital was very restrictive earlier as people had to go to shady shops with “jail-like grilles”.The Delhi Excise Policy, 2021 mandates the government’s exit from the liquor business in an attempt to shore up liquor availability, customer experience, service and eradicate brand suppression.Of the 32 zones, the draw for 20 zones was done on August 5 and 6; the remaining 12 were allotted this week. The excise department had kept a total reserve price for all the 32 zones at around ₹7,041 crore, but it managed to earn ₹8,917.59 crore through bidding, documents show.Excise department reports showed that Zone 28 covering areas such as Dwarka-A, Deoli, Bhajanpura, Kardampuri and Quraish Nagar, had the highest bid at Rs357 crore. But when analysed in terms of the highest profit earned by the government against the base price, Zone 32, which is the airport zone, topped the list as it went for ₹235 crore against the reserve price of Rs105 crore — about 124% higher than the reserve price.In addition to the bid value for the 32 zones, the excise department will also earn about ₹650 crore from excise duty, import fees, value-added tax and other licence fees, an excise official said on condition of anonymity. Another ₹900-1,000 crore is expected to come from licensing of new brands, distributor licenses, etc.The government is optimistic that this will mark a new record for the capital, and push annual earnings growth rate from the current 5-7% to over 30%. Data showed that the average annual revenue of the city from liquor sales over the past three years stood at around ₹6,300 crore.The new excise policy was implemented on June 11. Under it, retailers are free to decide the selling prices in a competitive environment and not be limited by a maximum retail price fixed by the government. Each zone will have at least 27 liquor vends — all of which will go to one successful bidder.The new policy aims to reform the city’s liquor business by improving user experience, cleaning up the liquor mafia and eradicating pilferage.The licensees will have to build bigger and modern liquor vends where customers could just walk in and choose their preferred brands. Business hours will be from 10am to 10pm while those at the airport may stay open round-the-clock.The policy, among other things, envisages five new super-premium liquor shops for high-value products. It includes a rule that any liquor shop in the city should be at least 500 square feet in size and not have iron grilles at the front, giving customers the freedom to pick their own brands.For that, the shops have to be spacious, well-lit and air-conditioned and must be under camera surveillance. Shop owners will have to ensure that liquor sale and pick-up takes place properly inside the shop premises. Home delivery of liquor is also allowed through websites and apps.But those in the liquor business felt the government should have set the reserve price higher.Naresh Goyal, president of Delhi Liquor Traders’ Association,said the ₹8,917.59 crore for the 32 zones is a “commitment” made by the new licensees which they will have to pay in instalments for a year. “Ideally, the government should have kept the reserve price higher, factoring in 10% annual hike which did not happen since 2019 due to the pandemic. So, the amount it has managed through the bidding process is not exceptionally high. We can say that the government just managed to recover the excise revenue losses it faced due to the pandemic,” Goyal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/excise-transition-private-liquor-vends-to-stay-shut-next-month-101631732880545.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||Sisodia: Covid dealt a body blow to Delhi’s economy, revenue down 23%||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said the Delhi government has received about 23% less than the estimated revenue in the current financial year due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which also reduced the state’s collection by nearly 41% in 2020-21.Addressing a press conference, Sisodia, who is also the national Capital’s minister of trade and taxes, said the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection of the Delhi government in the current financial year decreased by 23%. “Not just that, Delhi’s VAT (value added tax) collection came down by 25%, excise collection by 30%, stamp collection by 16%, and motor vehicle tax collection by 19%. Fiscal years 2020-21 and 2021-22 have been highly affected by Covid-19 from the perspective of revenue,” he said.The Delhi government, however, did not share absolute numbers for the collected tax.The minister said that despite Delhi contributing ₹1,40,000 crore as Central taxes, it gets only ₹325 crore in return from the Central government. “While we get peanuts, other states get 42% of their share. In fact, Delhi government’s revenue will be further reduced by ₹8,000 crore as the Central government will stop GST compensation from next year,” he said. Economic activity in the entire country came to a standstill when the Central government imposed the first nationwide lockdown in March last year. In April-May this year, as Delhi became one of the worst-hit states during the second Covid-19 wave in the country, the Aam Aadmi Party government imposed another round of strict lockdown to curb contact between people and bring the daily case count down.“In 2020-21, we received revenue that was 41% less than our budget estimate, and because of this, except for salaries and Covid-related expenses, we put most other expenses on hold. If we look at this fiscal year (2021-22), we are currently 23% below the budget estimate. We had estimated a very moderate budget this year. The budget estimate was much less than last year, yet the tax collection is less than what it should have been by now. It is a very concerning situation,” he said.Sisodia said the government is still withholding most expenses except salaries and Covid-related expenses. “The government is trying to cut down on expenses wherever possible. The only relief we expect is now from the new excise policy which is likely to give the government about ₹3,500 crore more annually. As part of the new excise regime, we merged excise duty and VAT that people usually evaded, into licence fees. Till now the license fee was very nominal-- ₹8 lakh--and then there were 250%-300% excise fees and VAT, which were evaded by many,” he said.“In Delhi, after 2016, under the Kejriwal government, no new liquor shops have been opened. In some municipal wards, there were 10-15 liquor shops, while in some wards, there were none. The pattern was such that in the wards where there were no shops, illegal liquor shops would function. There were approximately 850 legal shops and 2,000 illegal shops operating out of people’s houses and godowns. We tried to stop this through the excise department. We caught approximately 700,000 bottles of liquor in one year. About 1,864 FIRs were lodged and 1,000 vehicles were confiscated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-received-23-less-revenue-than-estimated-this-year-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia-101631732700384.html

16-09-2021||Delhi||Process plea for green nod to hospital: HC||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday pulled up the city government for not processing the forest clearance required for finishing the construction of a 100-bed hospital in Najafgarh despite repeated reminders by the Centre, noting that the “lethargic approach” of the Delhi government is the misfortune of the public .A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said that the city government should do something and “not sit tight” over processing the Centre’s request seeking permission for the transplantation of the trees.“It is the misfortune of the public at large that a 100-bed hospital could not be completed because of the lethargic approach on part of the Delhi government. Union of India is writing letter after letter and no reply is given by the Delhi government. No counter has been filed (by Delhi government),” said the bench.“Do something so that the construction is over. You can say no also but don’t sit tight. You decide as per law,” the bench said.The bench granted time to the Delhi government and asked them to point out the “least possible time” within which the permission/sanction can be granted.The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) by Rajesh Kaushik, a lawyer, seeking a direction to the two governments to complete the establishment of the hospital at the site of Rural Health Training Centre in Najafgarh in south west Delhi.The petition, filed through lawyer Sameer Chandra, said that the structure of the building was already completed, and that it was “utmost essential for the public at large” that the hospital starts running before the onset of the third wave of Covid-19.The plea had said there are no good hospitals in the area and that the establishment of the 100-bed facility will help “15 lakh people spread over 73 villages in the radius of 10 km”.On Wednesday, the central government standing counsel advocate Anurag Ahluwalia, appearing for the union government, informed the court that the project was 80% complete and is awaiting clearance from the forest department of the Delhi government in December 2018 as the site required a sanction for “transplantation of trees”.In an affidavit, the Union government said only the peripheral part of the facility remains to be finished, adding that the hospital can be completed by the year end subject to permission from the Delhi government.The Delhi government counsel sought time from the court to file its reply, following which the court posted the matter for hearing on November 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-government-pulled-up-for-holding-forest-clearance-for-100-bed-hospital-in-najafgarh-101631732460279.html

UP Police said in a press statement that the three were stocking up explosives for terror strikes in the country and were also in touch with foreign agencies.In a press statement, the UP Police identified the three as Mohammad Jameel of Unchahar, Rae Bareli; Mohammad Imtiaz of Maheshganj, Pratapgarh; and Mohammad Tahir alias Madni of Kareli, Prayagraj. Without giving details, they also claimed to have seized a large number of explosives and weapons from their possession.Meanwhile, officers in the know of the interrogation of the six suspects arrested on Tuesday said the RDX (rapid detonating explosive) that Delhi Police seized from one of them may have been pushed into India using a drone.The six men were arrested from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and were identified as Jaan Mohammad Shaikh (47), Osama alias Sami (22), Moolchand Srivastav alias Saaju (47), Zeeshan Qamar (28), Mohamed Abu Bakr (23), and Mohammed Amir Javed (31). Police had seized 1.7k RDX from Zeeshan’s house in Kareli, Allahabad, and a live improvised explosive device (IED) was found in Prayagraj and defused.HT spoke with at least three officers privy to the investigation, who confirmed that Zeeshan claimed he was given the RDX by a man named Baidur. Police are on the lookout for Baidur, also a resident of Uttar Pradesh, who is currently absconding.“Zeeshan was told by his handlers that Baidur would collect the RDX, which was dropped into India from Pakistan. It is unclear whether the border in Punjab or the line of control in Kashmir was used for it. It is also possible that they may have dropped more explosives in the past. We have just started interrogating Zeeshan and the other suspects,” said an officer, requesting anonymity.He added that Zeeshan, who had recently started a date business in his hometown, was also trained by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence or ISI along with Delhi resident Osama, who lives with his family in Jamia Nagar’s Abul Fazal Enclave and also runs a business of importing dates. They met in Muscat in April from where they took the sea route and changed boats several times to reach Joini, a town near the Gwadar port in Pakistan. There they were trained for 15 days by three men, two of whom wore military uniforms.On Tuesday, Delhi Police had said that the plot was to carry out terror strikes in Delhi, UP and Maharashtra during the festival season for which ISI had instructed Zeeshan and Osama to survey locations to plant IEDs.Police had also said that Anees Ibrahim, brother of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, was connected to this module and was tasked to smuggle arms and ammunition into India.“The operations of this module is similar to that of the Mumbai underworld in the 1993 Bombay serial blasts. In that case, Dawood was involved in getting RDX inside the country by sea through the coastal areas of Maharashtra. In this case, his brother Anees used contacts in ISI and may have smuggled explosives using drones,” added a second official, who asked not to be named.A third officer, also requesting anonymity, echoed the second. “This module involves people associated with the Mumbai underworld. It looks like they were directly in touch with the ISI and planning the attacks here. So far, we have not come across any other terror group or militant organisation behind them. This is an entirely ISI-backed module for which they used the underworld,” he said, adding that Sameer alias Jaan Mohammed was part of Anees Ibrahim’s gang earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/day-after-pak-linked-terror-module-bust-three-more-held-from-up-101631732340266.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||After long Covid break, DU campus reopens for final year, postgrad students||New Delhi: Twenty-year-old Nitika Dabas, a final year student of BSc Zoology at Ramjas College, walked into a socially distanced college campus for the first time since educational institutes were first closed last year amid the covid pandemic. The science student whose course includes a crucial practical component said that she had been waiting for the campus to reopen for the past many months. “The class today was incredible. It was amazing to be back in the lab and on the field. I didn’t ever think that working on experiments and conducting practicals would become such a luxury when colleges were closed last year. So, doing every activity in person in college was exhilarating,” said Dabas, who was a first-year student when the college was shut last year. Delhi University colleges were closed last year in March amid the pandemic. While colleges had started practical sessions earlier this year in February, sessions were called off in March amid the onset of the fourth covid wave in Delhi. Earlier this month, Delhi University issued the notification allowing final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students back to campus for practical and laboratory work as part of a phased reopening plan. On the first day of reopening, colleges saw small groups of students. Dabas was among the four students who came for the practical session on Wednesday at Ramjas College. “All the preventive measures and SOPs did make the experience a little different but as long as we get to study in a safe environment, there is nothing to complain about. We can’t live in the virtual world forever without having any practical experience or training. The theory is not enough for the practical world especially in the course that I am pursuing.,” said Dabas, who plans to visit college regularly for the practical sessions. She shared that the feeling of meeting her friends and teachers after over a year was explicable even though many of her classmates are yet to join in-person sessions since they were not in the city.Ojit Kumar Singh, Dabas’s professor, took the class on fieldwork on Thursday. He said that practical sessions and fieldwork were crucial for the completion of the learning experience. “Since we need to comply with SOPs, I called students in a batch of 10 and around 6 of them came today. I took them for fieldwork and most of them were happy to be back,” said Kumar. He said that in-person sessions were more conducive for learning since online classes were often fraught with challenges pertaining to network connectivity and access to devices. Interactions with students were also marred by such issues, he said. “During online classes, it almost feels like we are talking to the wall. Despite all our efforts to keep students engaged, there are challenges of digital divide and connectivity. Today was the first day of reopening and I am hoping that the number of students will increase in the coming days,” said Singh. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said that the attendance of students was low on Wednesday since it was the first day. He shared that around 40 students came to the college. “Around 30-40 students came today. The response was a little feeble but there is an expectation that the number of students will increase in the coming days as students see their friends turning up for sessions,” said Khanna. Many principals and teachers also attributed the lukewarm response to the absence of outstation students who make up for a significant section in courses. Owing to uncertainty around the third wave of covid that has been predicted by experts, many students are yet to return back to the city. Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College and general secretary of DU Principals’ Association said that two small groups of students came to the college for practical sessions on Wednesday. The college has two science courses and three lab-based courses. “We have started calling students in small batches. In computer science, we called around four students and all of them came. In psychology, we called a batch of around ten students. All students were excited to be back. We familiarized them with training and teachers. These are students who came back after the first year and hence the need for re-familiarisation,” said Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-long-covid-break-du-campus-reopens-for-final-year-postgrad-students-101631732100337.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi to treat 155MGD wastewater reaching Yamuna from neighbouring states||The Delhi government will treat 155 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater reaching the Yamuna from neighbouring states, Delhi water minister Satyendar Jain said on Wednesday. In a meeting with senior officials of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) and the irrigation and flood control department, to discuss the interstate pollution of the Yamuna, Jain said cleaning the Yamuna was the “topmost priority” of the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government. According to a Delhi government statement, currently, the Yamuna receives 105MGD and 50MGD wastewater from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, respectively. “The Yamuna does not belong to one particular state but the whole country. And to achieve the target of cleaning it, we will do whatever is needed. On the instructions of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the DJB and the irrigation department have undertaken the task of cleaning the Yamuna on priority,” Jain said. He further said, “The drainage from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh will be treated either by diverting it to STPs (sewage treatment plants) or in situ. This treated water will be used for rejuvenating lakes and water bodies, groundwater recharge and the rest will be discharged into river Yamuna.” He said the Delhi government had taken upon itself to clean “all sources that pollute the river”. “The Delhi government has started working on war footing to clean all of these drains. Innovative techniques are being used for this purpose. In situ techniques as well existing STPs will be used to treat these drains that carry wastewater from other states and join the drains in Delhi,” Jain said. In June this year, the Delhi government had banned fishing in the Yamuna waters on account of pollution and the appearance of toxic foam on the river stretch near Kalinidi Kunj.High phosphate content in the wastewater, from detergents used in dyeing industries, dhobi ghats and households, was cited as the main reason for the formation of toxic foam in the Yamuna, an official of the Central Pollution Control Board had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-treat-155mgd-wastewater-reaching-yamuna-from-neighbouring-states-101631732041432.html

16-09-2021||Delhi||Connect Karo-2021: ‘India to have improved urban infra in next 30 years’||In the next 30 years, Indian cities will have improved urban infrastructure and will be better equipped to accommodate the population migrating from rural pockets, said Durga Shankar Mishra, secretary of Union ministry of housing and urban affairs at the India-Latin America urbanisation dialogue on Wednesday, which was part of the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) annual flagship event ‘Connect Karo’. Discussing the growth and challenges of urban development that both India and Latin America are facing, Shankar said that in the coming years, the size of cities in India will grow, and so will opportunities for development and challenges attached to it. “The Covid-19 pandemic has slowed down the speed of economic development globally, and it has also hit India. We are channelling all our resources to meet the targets we have set for our developmental projects,” said Shankar. He added India has been working on several developmental programmes to tackle various aspects of urban growth, such as sanitation, infrastructure development and management. These programmes have already started yielding results, said Shankar. A report by the WRI (India) shows 66% urban growth in the country is outside municipal limits, which indicates the need for better metropolitan planning, said experts. “Urbanization in India is at about 35% currently, though studies suggest that if a Latin American definition for urban population (such as Mexico’s) was applied, it would be around 65%. Rapid urbanisation in India is pushing the need for supply of land and infrastructure, affordable housing and the requirement of finance across metropolitan areas,” said Madhav Pai, executive director, WRI India Ross Centre. While exchanging ideas, Adriana Lobo, executive director of WRI (Mexico and Columbia), said one of the greatest challenges that the region is facing is the inequity in the distribution of population based on their economic background. “In the last 30 years, Mexico’s population, for instance, has doubled, but there is no equity in the way this population is distributed. One of the ways to tackle urban inequity that we have seen is the increase in mass transportation networks,” said Lobo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/connect-karo-2021-india-to-have-improved-urban-infra-in-next-30-years-101631731681246.html

16-09-2021||Mumbai||Funeral procession forced to wade through knee-deep water in Badlapur||A photo of several residents wading through knee-deep water during a funeral procession at Belavali village railway underpass has been going viral for the past two days. The photo reflects the pathetic condition of the underpass that connects Badlapur East and West, leading to traffic congestion in the city.Moreover, the underpass is the only way to the crematorium and mourners have to wade through the water to pay their last respects to the departed.Social workers from this area have used a pumping machine to direct the water to a nearby nullah but neither the railway nor the Badlapur municipal council have come forward to help them.Kishor Patil, a 48-year-old resident of Belavali, lost his uncle Ramchandra Patil, 68, on September 13. Patil said, “The crematorium is just 500m away from my house. We have to only cross this railway underpass. Since it was flooded, we contemplated going by road but there was heavy traffic and it turned out to be 6km from my house. My relative, who lives in Badlapur (East), took an hour to cross the bridge. When we first entered the underpass, the water was up to our chest, so we called for a pumping machine and pulled out minimum water and marched ahead.”“We have been facing this issue every year. If there is no rain, the underground pass gets filled with drainage water. To complete a five-minute trip, we have to cover more than 5km and spend half-an-hour for the same. The authorities should solve this problem.”School children, too, had to take the underpass to reach their schools. There is no alternative route for them.Kulgaon Badlapur Municipal Council CEO Yogesh Godse said, “We have sent a letter to the railway to solve this issue and are awaiting a reply.”A railway engineer from Badlapur region said, “We are talking to our senior officials about the issue. We will find some solution soon.”Water levels rise at 3 dams in Thane districtWith good rainfall in the catchment areas over the past few days, water stock in Barvi, Andra and Bhatsa dams have increased to 97%, 77% and 98%, respectively. The district authority has issued a warning to the villages surrounding these dams, as a normal discharge of dam water has begun and if the rains continue, the dams will cross the overflow level. The irrigation department said that there would be no immediate water cuts in the district. At this time last year, the water level at Barvi dam was at 96%, Andra at 71% while it was 99% in Bhatsa.An officer from the irrigation department said, “While both Bhatsa and Barvi dams have started discharge at 21.957 cusec and 34.790 cusec water, respectively, Andra lake situated in Pune is yet to receive enough rainfall to overflow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/funeral-procession-forced-to-wade-through-knee-deep-water-in-badlapur-101631731620221.html

The state government did not prepare the data for OBCs.”Tilekar said, “The Maharashtra government is putting hurdles in the reservation of the Maratha and OBC community. Before the civic elections at least, the state government should restore reservation for OBCs.”Not only Pune, the BJP staged agitations all over the state.The state election commission announced the zilla parishad elections in Dhule, Nandurbar, Washim, Akola and Nagpur which will be held without OBC reservation.Recently, the Supreme Court asked the government and the state election commission to continue local self-elections for five zilla parishads and 33 panchayat samitis without waiting for OBC reservation. As the Supreme Court scrapped OBC reservation in Maharashtra, all parties unanimously decided to postpone zilla parishad elections. But after the court’s instructions, the process for elections started and the BJP became aggressive on the OBC quota and targeting the MVA government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-stages-agitations-over-losing-obc-quota-for-zp-panchayat-polls-101631731560248.html

16-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra clears Rs3,200-crore disaster management programme for Konkan||As the coastal districts in Maharashtra were battered with natural calamities over the past two years, the Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to set up a ₹3,200-crore Konkan disaster management programme. The special programme — Konkan disaster mitigation project — will take up several measures in the region to safeguard the people in case of any calamity such as cyclone, floods, landslides, etc.Over the past two years, the Konkan strip has faced two cyclones — Nisarga in 2020 and Tauktae this year. Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg district have also seen severe flooding after extremely heavy rainfall, landslide and other disasters. Under the project, a comprehensive four-year plan for capacity building, pre-planning measures to safeguard people, as well as proper utilisation of mitigation funds will be prepared.“Cyclone and floods have continuously damaged the coastal districts. After the natural calamity, locals face issues of power outage for days, availability of potable water, etc. The people, who are in danger areas, have to be moved to safer locations. Through the project, we will take mitigation steps such as laying underground power cables, construct permanent and resilient shelters in these districts where people can be moved, fortify coastline which is eroded due to waves, etc,” state relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said.As part of the project, a system will be set up for early warning to ensure better preparedness to deal with natural disasters, senior officials said. They added, the impact on locals will be less and response time will also be improved. It would not only save lives, but also reduce damage to critical infrastructure. The state has earmarked ₹3,200 crore for the project, of which ₹2,000 crore will be provided by the state disaster management department and the remaining ₹1,200 crore will be provided by the state government over the next four years, the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-clears-rs3-200-crore-disaster-management-programme-for-konkan-101631731443644.html
16-09-2021||Noida||Farmers lie in pits in UP’s Ghaziabad to press for farm law amendments||Dozens of farmers launched an indefinite hunger strike on Wednesday, and lay in 3-4-foot deep pits that they dug up at Mandola in Ghaziabad’s Loni to press for amendments to the three new farm laws introduced by the Centre and also to get more compensation for their lands acquired under the UP Housing and Development Board’s (UPHDB) Mandola housing scheme. Some 250 farmers gathered in Mandola for the protest. Terming their way of protest as ‘Zameen Samadhi’, the farmers, led by their leader Manveer Teotia, dug up 17 pits and lay there to press for their demands. “We want amendments in the three new farm laws and provisions related to mandis and contract farming. Protests are underway at various borders of Delhi, we demand that the government hold talks and make amendments. We also demand that the 23 crops, for which the government has fixed the minimum support price, should be purchased throughout the year and not only for a particular season,” said Teotia, who was seen leading the protest through the Kisan Satyagrah Andolan at Mandola. Other farmers, led by the Samyukta Kisan Mocha, have been going on with the protests at various borders of Delhi since November last year and demanding a new law on the minimum support price and the rollback of the three new farm laws. “We are not part of the protests going on at the borders of Delhi. We want changes in the provisions of contract farming, including considering the landowner under the category of farmer. Today’s protest will go on... We are resorting to peaceful means to press our demands; our protest is also to support farmers of Mandola, who have given their land for the housing scheme,” said Teotia. Farmers also said they have been demanding hiked compensation for their land which was given for the housing scheme. “We have been carrying out an indefinite protest at Mandola to press our demand for hiked compensation under the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation & Resettlement Act, 2013. The administration gave us ₹1,100 per square metres in 2010. We demand rates as per the new Land Acquisition Act. We do not want farmers to stay on roads to protest...we want the government to hold talks,” said Neeraj Tyagi, convener of the farmers’ association. Six farmers stayed put in the pits and continued with their hunger strike till the time of going to print. Tyagi said they will continue with the protest till the time their demands regarding the amendments to the three farm laws and the housing scheme are not met. DB Singh, superintending engineer from UPHDB, said the administration is looking into the issues of the farmers. “Our administration officials are addressing the issues of the farmers,” said Singh. Ritu Suhas, additional district magistrate (administration), said two days ago, the farmers gave a memorandum of demands, which did not include their new demand in connection with the three new farm laws. “The written memorandum they gave to us concerned issues related to the Mandola housing scheme. There are some new people who have joined the protest today (Wednesday), who are not even residents of Ghaziabad. With regard to the farmers in Mandola, their issues are being looked into and they have been asked to come for a meeting on Thursday,” said Suhas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-lie-in-pits-in-up-s-ghaziabad-to-press-for-farm-law-amendments-101631731441444.html
16-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai ranks second among 19 metros in crimes against women||The National Crime Record Bureau’s (NCRB) Crime in India report 2020 indicates that even in the pandemic, the city was witness to a high number of instances of crimes against women with Mumbai ranking only second to Delhi among 19 metropolitan cities. Two Covid waves and long periods of lockdown notwithstanding, the city reported 4,583 crimes against women as against the National Capital which recorded 9,782 instances. The NCRB report referred to a metropolitan city as one which had a population of 2 million or more. Crimes against women incorporates multiple sections under state level laws as well as the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including Section 354 (assault on woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 370 (human trafficking), 326A (acid attack), 498A (cruelty by husband and relatives) and 376 (rape), among others. While Delhi topped in several categories of crimes registered, including assault on women, rape and even sexual harassment (with Mumbai coming second), the state capital recorded the highest instances of stalking and human trafficking among all cities. However, while Mumbai recorded the most incidences of stalking, Hyderabad had the highest crime rate in this category. Crime rate is calculated per lakh of population. In cases of cybercrime related to women, Mumbai with 58 cases ranked third, coming after Bengaluru which recorded 63 cases last year and Chennai, which recorded 40 such instances. In 2018 Delhi had recorded 11,724 crimes against women compared to 6,058 cases in Mumbai. In 2019 the number of cases in Delhi increased to 12,902, whereas the cases in Mumbai had dropped to almost half of it - 6,519. Last year Mumbai reported 332 rape cases (sexual assault on women above the age of 18 years), as compared to 967 in Delhi. Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said the drop in crimes in 2020 in comparison with 2019 could be majorly attributed to the lockdown imposed due to Covid-19 outbreak. He said, “Due to lockdown, 2020 saw a decline in cases of crime.”Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police Chaitanya Siriprolu said, “Mumbai enjoys the reputation of being a safe city for women. The Mumbai Police has always been sensitive to crimes against women and children. All the recent developments in the law regarding crimes against women and children, especially in the past nine-10 years, are implemented seriously.”In order to improve women’s safety in Mumbai, the Mumbai Police is undertaking a new initiative in the form of Nirbhaya squads. “There will be one Nirbhaya squad for each police station, manned by a female officer of the rank of assistant police inspector or police sub inspector and assisted by two constables and a driver with dedicated vehicle. Nirbhaya squads will identify and patrol hotspots in their jurisdiction that may be prone to incidences of crime against women. Errant persons will be brought to book,” the IPS officer said.Nirbhaya squads will also undertake public awareness campaigns by visiting schools, colleges and other establishments.Nagrale said, “The Mumbai Police has taken a slew of measures to prevent crimes against women and children in the city and provide them a safer environment. Some of these measures are intensifying patrolling in crowded as well as deserted places, taking stern preventive actions against habitual criminals to keep effective check on them, covering maximum areas of the city with the help of CCTV cameras, creating awareness among school and college students, making citizens more vigilant and alert with the best use of social media, early detection of cases of crimes against women, and carrying out quality investigation to ensure convictions, etc.”The pendency of caseload sent to courts also indicated a heavy burden on the judiciary in all metropolitan cities. In Mumbai, 22,368 cases pertaining to crimes against women were pending trial from the previous year to which 2,895 were added in 2020. The total cases pending trial in Delhi was 61,648. Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Pune and Lucknow also had a high judicial pendency. The pendency percentage in the state capital was 97.8, in Delhi, it was 98. Lucknow, Surat, Patna and even Nagpur had higher pendency percentages. Last year, both Delhi and Mumbai recorded maximum number of offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012. In 2020, Mumbai reported 950 cases under the Pocso Act — essentially cases of sexual assault on children, boys and girls below 18 years of age. In 2019, the Mumbai Police had registered 1,319 cases. While the corresponding figure for the similar offence in Delhi was 1,662 cases that had involved minor victims in 2019 compared to 1,088 cases in 2020. Delhi and Mumbai are ranked in the top metro cities for reporting the maximum number of cases of crimes against children as well. The NCRB data supports the recent outcry following rape and murder of a Dalit woman in Sakinaka on September 10. The woman was sexually assaulted and brutalised by the arrested accused by inserted a rod in her body. Following this, the Mumbai police decided to form “Nirbhaya Squads” in police stations across the city, which would be tasked with patrolling duty. Each squad would have a lady sub-inspector, a woman constable, a male constable and a driver. Every police station in Mumbai has five patrolling mobile teams. The squad is tasked with preventing incidents of harassment and crimes against women and children. Activist lawyer Abha Singh, however, felt that the numbers did not reflect the correct picture. “Many women do not report crimes or abuse on them as they are scared to approach the police due to police corruption,” said advocate Singh. “The ones that do register the crime have to wait for a long time for justice. Moreover, conviction rate is low and the criminal knows that he would get away due to shoddy police work. And as there is no victim protection program in Maharashtra, identities of the victims are revealed, resulting in many of them turning hostile in the due course of the trial, leaving the accused to be in acquitted,” she added. Singh also said that policing in Maharashtra is poor. “The Sakinaka rape victim apparently kept screaming but the police reached the scene only after the crime was committed. The police should not just investigate, but should also be able to prevent a crime from happening. A comprehensive women’s protection program should be in place,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-ranks-second-among-19-metros-in-crimes-against-women-101631731380150.html
16-09-2021||Pune||Collector orders probe into ₹200 crore forest land scam in Hadapsar||PUNE Rajesh Deshmukh, district collector, has ordered a probe into the ₹200 crore forest land scam in Hadapsar, wherein 18 acres of prime urban forest land was deserved for sale on the open market. As per the directions of the District Collector, an SDO (sub-divisional officer) has been instructed to conduct the inquiry which will be completed in two weeks.The matter came to light after the forest department objected to the civil transfer of the land and informed the collector about the incident. Later a complaint was lodged by the revenue department officials against Hadapsar resident Popat Pandurang Shitkal, who has been named in the FIR lodged by the Vishrambaug police station. Shitkarlhas been accused of furnishing bogus documents to process his deed. According to the forest department, the accused Shitkal had allegedly got his name registered on the 7/12 extract by forging the signature of state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president and former revenue minister President Chandrakant Patil.Deshmukhsaid, “The state government has sought a detailed probe and submission of a written report regarding the case. The necessary directions have been issued to us and based on the directives, we have initiated action and a probe is being conducted in the case.” The forest department in its petition stated that the accused had shown an 18-acre plot on survey No. 62 in Hadapsar as his private land which is, in fact, forest land. He unsuccessfully tried to register the said plot in his name. Thereafter he went to High Court wherein the court directed the state government to take an appropriate decision. Meanwhile, his application before the revenue department of the government was rejected by the district collector and the divisional commissioner.Shitkal then approached revenue minister Patil in 2018 who also directed that his application be rejected. But he allegedly forged Patil’s signature and issued a fraudulent gazette notification of transferring the land parcel in his name. The officials at the land records department found it to be bonafide and correct, so they initiated the process of registering his name on the 7/12 extract, the FIR stated.Later, the case was transferred to the forest department where deputy forest officer Rahul Patil ordered a forest committee probe all the papers. The forest department protested that forest land cannot be transferred for civilian use.Trupti Kolte, tehsildar, Haveli, lodged the FIR. “Before 1980, the government had transferred some land in the name of those who had been tilling it for years or those who had been evicted for construction of dams and other projects. However, after 1980, the rules have become stringent and transfer of forest land is not easy,” Deshmukh said.According to the Forest Act, a reserve forest cannot be deserved for civilian/ commercial/ residential use||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/collector-orders-probe-into-200-crore-forest-land-scam-in-hadapsar-101631731323718.html

16-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to amend laws for OBC reservation for local body polls||The Maharashtra government has decided to promulgate an ordinance to make amendment to two legislations to provide reservation to the other backward classes (OBC) in local bodies without breaching the 50% reservation cap mandated by the Supreme Court. The decision was taken in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. State food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the decision was taken in view of the bypolls in six district councils (zilla parishads) declared by the state election commission on October 5. With the move, they will be able to secure 90% seats of the OBC community in the local bodies as in some districts, their seats are going to be reduced, said Bhujbal. He also added that their fight for the OBC reservation in Apex Court will continue. According to an estimation prepared by the state government, of the total 5,200 seats reserved for the OBC community in the state, around 4,500 seats can be saved by bringing the amendment. HT on August 28 reported that the state is likely to bring in an amendment to the legislations to restore OBC reservation in local bodies, without violating the 50% ceiling imposed by the Apex Court. As of now, the state rural development department will issue an ordinance to bring in an amendment to two legislations — Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for zilla parishads, panchayat samiti and gram panchayats. A similar ordinance was issued by the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis government on July 31, 2019. The functioning of local bodies in the state is covered with the help of five legislations. The other three are — The Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act and Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and. (iii). Industrial Townships Act. The amendment in the above three acts can be brought by the state urban development department. “The urban development department will bring in the amendments for the other local bodies in the next cabinet meeting and a decision will be taken accordingly,” said a senior minister. “Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and a few other states too have made such an amendment. We also admit that the reservation quota limit of 50% will not be violated while holding the elections of local bodies. The same was also discussed in all-party meetings called by the chief minister twice. However, even after this, seats of the OBC community will dip by 10% to 15% in local bodies,” Bhujbal said after the state cabinet meeting at Sahyadri guest house. The legislation for the local bodies in Maharashtra provides reservation to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities based on their population in those particular bodies. In case of the OBC community, they were getting direct 27% reservation as their population data is not available and their last census was conducted in 1931. Consequently, there are many districts where the combined reservation of all the communities — SC, ST and OBC — exceeds 50% cap. After the new amendment, the SC and ST communities will continue to get the reservation quota based on their population but the OBC community will get the remaining within the 50% ceiling. It means in tribal populated districts such as Palghar and Nandurbar, the OBC community will not get any reservation because their ST community has a sizable population. Tribals come under the Scheduled Tribe (ST) community. On March 4, the Supreme Court ruled that the reservation in favour of the OBC in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% cap in reservation quota mandated by it. It has directed the state government to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which, the reservation quota of the community be fixed and also allowed the state election commission to hold local bodies polls without having reservations for OBCs. Quota in ST districts The state cabinet on Wednesday revised the reservation in eight Scheduled Tribe-dominated districts for direct recruitment in Class 3 and Class 4 jobs in the districts. Earlier, since the tribal population was high in these areas the quota in jobs given to ST, Vimukta Jati (VJ), Nomadic Tribe (NT), etc was increased, while quota for OBC was reduced. The decision on Wednesday increased quota for OBC in jobs, without hurting the reservation for ST, VJ, NT, etc, state minister Vijay Wadettiwar said. The OBC will get more quota for Class 3 and Class 4 jobs in these districts, including Palghar, Nashik, Dhule, Nandurbar, Yavatmal, Chandrapur, Gadhchiroli, and Raigad, the minister said. The tribal population in the state gets 7% reservation in jobs in Maharashtra, but in these districts were given reservation between 15% and 24% in 2001, an official said. “After Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) or PESA came into force here in 2001, the ST reservation for Class 3 and Class 4 jobs was increased. In that, the quota was reduced only from the OBCs. The stand of the sub-committee was that if reservation is being reduced then it must be done equally for others as well,” said Wadettiwar. “Today, the OBC reservation in Gadhchiroli was increased to 17% from 6%, 19% in Chandrapur from 9%, 15% in Nashik, Nandurbar, Palghar and Dhule,” he said. “The state government took the decision only after BJP held statewide protests,” said Keshav Upadhye, spokesperson of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Earlier during the day the party held protests at Thane, Pune, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Solapur, Jalgaon, Kolhapur and Nashik across the state against the MVA government. It had declared to hold statewide protests at 1,000 places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-amend-laws-for-obc-reservation-for-local-body-polls-101631731320121.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||Hindu Rashtra call not causing enmity: Accused in Jantar Mantar hate slogan case||The Delhi high court on Wednesday reserved its order on the bail application of Preet Singh, an accused in the Jantar Mantar hate sloganeering case, even as his counsel argued that demanding a Hindu Rashtra (nation) would not amount to promoting enmity between religious groups in a democratic setup.Arguing for Singh, counsel Vishnu Shankar Jain told Justice Mukta Gupta that he would not press his bail if the court held a contrary opinion.“I say with the greatest sense of responsibility, if the court holds that the demand (of Hindu Rashtra) comes under Section 153 IPC , I will not press my bail application. In a democratic set up, if it (the demand) is promoting enmity, I will not press my bail,” Jain, said for Preet Singh, who was one of the organizers of a march against “colonial laws’ at Jantar Mantar on August 8. “Nothing is said by my client that attracts section 153A IPC. They are filing a case of Section 34 IPC (common intention) but the event ended at 11:45am and sloganeering happened at 3:45pm. My client was not present at the time,” he stated.The court was also informed that the main organiser, lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay, has already been granted bail.Counsel Tarang Srivastava, representing the prosecution, stated that all accused persons acted in concert and Singh’s absence at the time of chanting allegedly communal slogans would not absolve him from any liability.He added that even in his interview, Singh referred to a specific community, which was “part of a series of the same transaction.”“The main organiser and the accused gave a common interview and said statements (attracting) Section 153A IPC. Thereafter, a co-accused gave another interview. Another leads the chants and another uploads a Facebook live. All acted in furtherance of common intention,” said Srivastava. Singh is accused of creating enmity between different groups and inciting the youth to propagate against a particular religion at the rally held at Jantar Mantar on August 8.On August 27, additional sessions judge Anil Antil refused bail to Singh, who was by then arrested in the case by Delhi Police, saying that the right to assemble and freedom to air one’s thoughts are cherished under the Constitution; however, these are not absolute and have to be exercised with inherent reasonable restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hindu-rashtra-call-not-promoting-enemity-accused-in-jantar-mantar-hate-slogan-case-seeks-bail-101631731262030.html

This monthly allowance is a allowance for the elderly and we were forced to beg for it. I fear that the government has deducted my name from the pensioners’ list,” she added.Ratni Devi, a resident of Jasaur Kheri village in Jhajjar, whose son Pradeep Deswal fought the 2019 parliamentary election from Rohtak seat on the Jannayak Janata Party’s ticket, is making rounds of banks to get her monthly old-age allowance since the last three months.“The bank officials told us that the government has not deposited old-age allowance money in the account due to some technical issues. We are waiting for our monthly pension of ₹2,500 but neither the administration nor the bank officials paid heed to our demands. The government has promised us to provide a monthly pension in villages but its faulty policies have forced old-age pensioners to make rounds to banks,” she added.Two senior JJP leaders, who wished not to be named, said they will bring the issue into deputy chief minister Dushyant Singh Chautala’s knowledge.“Our party had promised to hike the old-age pension to ₹5,100 per month in our election manifesto. It is our duty to rectify any problem which relates to old-age pensioners,” they added.A senior official of the social justice and empowerment department, pleading anonymity, said more than one lakh elderly people are waiting for their monthly pension of ₹2,500 and they have received many complaints in this regard.Jhajjar social welfare officer Virender Singh said the matter had come into his notice and he has appraised the higher authorities.“The monthly allowance of elderly people is stuck after some banks were merged. These people will get their pending and this month’s pension by September 20,” he added.Rohtak deputy commissioner Captain Manoj Sheoran said he has deployed lead district manager to short out the pension issue of old-age pensioners.“We are hoping that the issue will be resolved soon and the elderly will be able to get their dues,” the DC added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oldage-pensioners-yet-to-get-monthly-allowance-after-merger-of-banks-101631731200187.html

However, airport authorities claim that the problem is short-term and will be sorted out soon after the airport’s new infrastructure is developed namely, the new terminal in September 2022 and the multilevel car parking in April 2022.Radhika Chadha,tweeted that the Pune airport needs to rethink its infrastructure and queue management systems. “Crowds, confusion, pushing, yelling - it was a fraught experience yesterday (September 12),” she said in her tweet.Another passenger, Abhijit L, tweeted, “The prepaid auto-rickshaw stand has been deactivated on flimsy grounds. I have used rickshaws to and from the airport for at least 15 years. My usual auto driver has requested me to send an email to the Airport Authority of India (AAI) on his behalf.”However, an airport official on condition of anonymity said, “If you look at the problem of overcrowding, it will be resolved once the new terminal is ready. Our staff is managing things neatly. It is only sometime that things become more chaotic otherwise they are very well managed at the airport.”“The prepaid autorickshaw stand was removed from August 15 as it is not in the guidelines. Flyers just have to walk a little more as it has been shifted to the other side of the road. One will not find an auto stand at international airports like Mumbai and Delhi. In Pune, it is still very nearby,” the official said.Meanwhile Vishal Tripathi, who flew in to Pune from Delhi on Tuesday, said, “It is not a problem shifting the auto-rickshaw stand because it is still nearby and one can walk and take the auto. At least we have to walk less at Pune airport than at airports such as Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. I don’t look at it as a big problem.”The autorickshaws are now parked along the new airport road, which runs parallel to the airport building. Airport authorities have not denied auto-rickshaws for dropping flyers.An autorickshaw driver, Sunil S, said, “We should be provided some space like the airport authority has for private company-run cabs.”As per data made available by airport authorities, Pune airport registered the highest traffic in August with 308,602 flyer footfalls recorded. “The number is the highest in 2021 till now. The traffic is expected to increase with the festive season approaching. The weekend rush is more than on weekdays.

16-09-2021||Chandigarh||NCRB data: At 39.7%, Haryana’s chargesheeting rate among worst in country||The chargesheet filing rate of the Haryana Police last year was third from the bottom in country after Meghalaya and Manipur, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report.Even though the combined all-India chargesheeting rate of 28 states pertaining to cases registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Special and Local Laws (SLL) stood at 82.5%, Haryana’s cumulative chargesheeting rate in this slot was 39.7%, the Crime in India-2020 data shows.The NCRB has introduced this chargesheeting rate feature in its latest report running over 500-page for the first time, saying it is a “better indicator of police performance”. The chargesheeting rate shows the percentage of total cases police have disposed of.Apart from Haryana, two other worst performing states in this category are Meghalaya (23.8%) and Manipur (23.5%).However, the chargesheeting rate of neighbouring Punjab and Himachal Pradesh in IPC and SLL cases together was 82% and 87.5%, respectively.The data shows that the chargesheeting rate in cases pertaining to crime against women of Haryana was 58%, 49% in crime against children cases and 72% in murder cases.Haryana director general of police (DGP) PK Agrawal was not available for comments.A former Haryana DGP, who wished not to be identified, expressed surprise over “such a low chargesheeting rate” in Haryana.“The case registration rate of Haryana is much better than that of Punjab, but chargesheeting rate going down is puzzling. The reasons must be plenty, apart from the Covid-19 pandemic,” the former DGP said.As per the data, Punjab had registered total 82,875 cases (49,870 cases under the IPC and 33,005 under the SLL in 2020), which was much less than that of Haryana’s total 1.92 lakh cases, indicating that crime in Haryana is on the rise.Dip in IPC casesHaryana saw a marginal dip in the number of cases registered under Sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in 2020 as compared to 2019, even though there has been a sharp rise in the cases registered under the Special and Local Laws (SLL).As many as 1,03,276 cases were registered in Haryana under various Sections of the IPC in the Covid pandemic year of 2020, which is 8,047 less than those reported (1,11,323) in 2019.However, the total cases lodged under the SLL in 2020 stood at 89,119 (34,106 more than 2019) against 55,013 reported in 2019 and 83,017 in 2018.Haryana’s chargesheeting rate in cases lodged under the IPC was 47.4% against all India’s 76%. And this rate in SLL cases of Haryana stood at 30% in comparison to 94% of the country.The NCRB says it only compiled and collated the data received from the states. “Increase in crime numbers in a state police data may in fact be on account of certain citizen-centric police initiatives such as launching of e-FIR facility or women helpdesks, etc,” says the report.The NCRB has said that certain states including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, have provided citizen-friendly service of online registration of FIR under certain categories of offences such as vehicle theft and other thefts.“As this may have increased the crime reporting under such heads in these states, they become statistically non‐comparable with other states not having such online registration facility,” the NCRB has pointed out.Crime against womenOf total 13,000 cases registered last year (14,683 in 2019) under the crime against women, 1,373 pertained to rape, 251 were dowry deaths and 204 abetment to suicide cases.There were 2,423 cases of kidnapping and abduction and 4,119 cases pertained to cruelty by husband or relatives.The data shows that 5,048 cases of crime against women turned out to be false in the state; in 6,184 cases of 2020 chargesheets were filed; and 7,662 cases were sent for trial.As many as 31,118 cases of crime against women are pending trial in the courts of Haryana where the conviction rate of the crime against women cases was 16% and the cases pendency percentage stood at 97%, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ncrb-data-at-39-7-haryana-s-chargesheeting-rate-among-worst-in-country-101631730900670.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated this airport on December 16, 2018, weeks ahead of Kumbh-2019 but the new terminal was opened for passengers only on January 1, 2019. Since then, till September 13 this year, the airport has catered to 10,05,955 passengers. During this period, more than 12,000 flights operated from the airport including flights of private chartered planes along with the major air service providers. “The first wave of Covid lockdown from March 25 to May 24, 2020, hit flight operations. Covid second wave also witnessed relatively fewer flights in the month of May and June. Had the pandemic not occurred, the airport could have achieved the feat of crossing the mark of 10 lakh passengers eventually reached on September 8 in January itself,” officials said. By August 31, the number of passengers travelling by air through the airport had touched 9.91 lakh and by September 7, the number reached 9,99,407 eventually crossing the 10 lakh mark on September 8. Till September 13, the total passenger movement at Prayagraj Airport had touched 10.05 lakh, a senior Prayagraj airport official said. Eleven flights are available from Prayagraj airport to 10 different cities. Flight to Delhi and Bilaspur is being operated by Air India’s Alliance Air. Private airline Indigo is operating direct flights for Bangalore, Pune, Raipur, Gorakhpur, Delhi, Mumbai, Dehradun, Bhopal and Bhubaneshwar. “It was the dream of our PM that every common man should be able to afford air travel and the state government is fulfilling his dream. Till 2017, only 25 flights were operating from four airports in the state. Now, 73 flights are being operated regularly from eight airports of UP including Prayagraj.

16-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt opposes plea by restaurants seeking nod to serve herbal hookah||The Delhi government on Wednesday opposed a plea by several restaurants and bars urging the Delhi high court to direct the city government and the police to not interfere with the sale of herbal flavoured hookahs or take coercive steps against them.Delhi government standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi said the use of hookah, be it with or without tobacco, in all public places, including hotels, restaurants, eateries, bars, pubs and discotheques, in the national capital is strictly prohibited as use or sharing of hookah may further increase spread of Covid-19.He submitted that on August 3, 2020, an order was passed by the health department which has observed that in public places, use and sharing of hookah with or without tobacco (herbal hookah) may further increase spread of coronavirus infection.Justice Rekha Palli listed the matter for further hearing to September 20 as the counsel for petitioner restaurants and bars said he would file an additional affidavit.“They (Delhi government) have a problem with shared hookah which could lead to spread of Covid-19. If 40 people are using 10 hookahs, it is a problem,” the court said, adding that this is an entirely different situation.Senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, representing the petitioner entities, said as long as restaurants undertake not to use nicotine in hookah, they cannot be prohibited from carrying out their businesses.Separate petitions were filed by Breath Fine Lounge and Bar, TOS, R High Speedbar and Lounge, Verandah Moonshine and Sixth Empirica Lounge in west Punjabi Bagh, challenging the order of joint commissioner of police (licensing unit) prohibiting and excluding the sale or service of herbal flavoured hookahs in restaurants/ bars.The pleas said the petitioners are serving herbal hookahs for which no licence is required as they are totally without tobacco but the police are still conducting searches and seizing equipment and fining establishments.It pointed out that the definition of “smoking” under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), does not cover herbal flavoured hookahs and asked the court to direct the authorities not to take any extreme step such as suspension or cancellation of registration certificate of petitioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-opposes-plea-by-restaurants-seeking-nod-to-serve-herbal-hookah-101631730725650.html

16-09-2021||Delhi||‘City of cars’ Delhi reports maximum vehicle thefts, 95 stolen everyday: NCRB||At least 95 vehicles were stolen every day last year in the national capital, the maximum across all states and Union Territories, according to the National Crime Records Bureau’s latest report.According to the report, Crime in India, which was released on Tuesday, last year Delhi reported 35,019 cases of vehicle thefts. The rate of the crime, case per million population, at 17.2 was also the highest in Delhi.Maharashtra was second on the list with 21,203 cases at a rate of 1.7. However, in terms of crime rate, Haryana was second on the list with 5.0, though it reported 14,636 cases. In absolute numbers, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan reported 19,019 and 19,063 cases.Delhi reported the highest cases in this crime category in 2019 too with 46,725 vehicles stolen that year.The crime rate that year was 23.1, also the highest among states and union territories. In 2019, Delhi was followed by Uttar Pradesh at 28,417 cases and Maharashtra with 25,780 thefts.Cars and two-wheelers are the most common items stolen across the city after mobile phones (at least 175 mobile phones were stolen every day in Delhi between January and February 2017, the Union government had told the Lok Sabha that year).Delhi Police data shows that, in the last 10 years (between 2011 and 2020), a total of 307,000 vehicles were stolen in the Capital.This number is more than the number of registered vehicles in all of Srinagar on March 31, 2017 (according to a report mentioned in the road transport year book 2016-17 of the ministry of road transport and highways).According to the Delhi Economic Survey report, there were 11.8 million motorised vehicles in Delhi as of March 31, 2020. Cars and jeeps make around 28% of the total registered vehicles, and two-wheelers about 67%.Delhi Police officers say that vehicle thefts constitute about 14% of all the crimes in the city. Even during the first hard lockdown, which restricted the movement of people, about 83 vehicles (more than three an hour) were stolen every day in Delhi between March 15 and 30, 2020.Retired Delhi Police’s deputy commissioner LN Rao, who worked in the force for over three decades, attributed the reasons for the high number of motor vehicle thefts to a number of factors such as – organised gangs spread across different states, high volume of cars in Delhi and lack of parking space and carelessness of several vehicle owners.Rao said, “There are too many cars and no proper space to park. People park their vehicles on roads and footpaths. The network of vehicles thieves is spread across different states, where the stolen vehicle are sold or dismantled. There is a lucrative market for stolen vehicles. Also, solving vehicle thefts is not a priority for most police officers on the ground because the owners also do not pursue the case since they get insurance. However, since the number of cases have been so high, it has remained a focus for the Delhi Police. The police have busted several inter-state rackets but the situation is different in other states.”Delhi Police have traced stolen vehicles and pursued gangs to as far as Nagaland and Sikkim. Two months ago, police busted a gang that stole vehicles in Delhi and sold it in Kashmir. Investigation showed that the gang had stolen at least 100 vehicles since 2015.Delhi police spokesperson, Chinmoy Biswal, said they have launched a persistent crackdown on gangs of vehicle thieves.“Our teams at the police stations level, the crime branch and other units have launched a crackdown on vehicle thieves. This is the reason why we have busted many gangs and recovered large number of stolen vehicles from different states. The number of cases is peculiarly high in Delhi also because the city has the maximum number of vehicles.”Biswal added, “Our police teams also work with RWAs to lock specific gates of a colony at night so the entry/ exits are restricted and monitored by the beat staff and security guards. While we are working round the clock to arrest vehicle thieves, we request citizens not park vehicles or two wheelers in safer places, check the lock and follow basic security practices. Also, citizens in Delhi have the facility of registering online FIRs for car thefts. Unlike other places, this is a free and fair registration system that may have also led to higher number of cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/city-of-cars-delhi-reports-maximum-vehicle-thefts-95-stolen-everyday-ncrb-report-101631730601005.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||Ramping up existing bus services crucial for affordable transportation: Experts||While the Metro rail network is gradually expanding in the country, transport experts say there is a need to ramp up existing bus services in Indian cities to provide an affordable mode of transportation. To do this, a Public Private Partnership (PPP) model can help make up for the deficit of 130,000 (approximately) buses in urban areas and provide efficient service.“Metros are not the only solution to India’s transportation demand. Buses are not seen as attractive. While India has a successful model to develop and deliver capital infrastructure for roads and Metros, a successful and scalable service delivery model, which forms the basis of the public bus service, is missing,” Shashi Verma, director of strategy and Chief Technology Officer, Transport for London, said at World Resources Institute-India’s (WRI India) Connect Karo-2021 event on Wednesday.The five-day conference seeks to highlight ways and the need for making cities inclusive and resilient, have access to water, sanitation, hygiene and healthy spaces. Hindustan Times is the media partner of the conference.Verma said that if cities developed a bus lane or BRTS, then they need to “flood these lanes” with buses and improve the quality of bus services. He cited the case of London where bus routes are planned in such a way that buses are available almost every minute.For this, running bus services on the PPP model is a step forward. OP Agarwal, CEO, WRI India, said, “We must change the narrative from delivering low quality services for those who have no other option but to use the bus. It should be an option for those using private modes of transport as well, and I think PPP is a critical instrument to get there.”In a bid to strengthen the bus service network in smaller cities, the ministry of housing and urban affairs is launching a scheme to support cities to procure buses. “The PPP model offers state transport undertakings (STUs) an opportunity to achieve improved efficiency at a lower initial cost….(Under the scheme) the funding will be offered over a longer period too, so cities can leverage the funding for the PPP model and bring down costs. The bus funding scheme will also help smaller cities adopt public bus services and improve bus operations,” said Surendra Bagde, additional secretary, ministry of housing and urban affairs.According to private bus service providers, delay in payments is a major issue. Prasanna Patwardhan, chairman and managing director of Prasanna Purple, a private bus service provider, said “There is a delay in payments from some STUs. As a result, it is difficult for us to manage monthly bank payments. Timely dispute resolution is very important.”Transport experts agree that dispute resolution is critical for a successful PPP bus system. “Setting up an arbitration panel or a regulatory authority that clears these payments will play a huge role in promoting PPP success,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ramping-up-existing-bus-services-crucial-to-provide-affordable-transportation-say-experts-101631730360134.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||3,770 minors kidnapped in Delhi, number of those traced higher: NCRB report||In August, police stations across the city received a notice from the police headquarters about a new scheme in the force that promised quick promotions to constables and head constables who find missing children. The initiative was aimed at reversing the trend of children going missing from the streets of the national capital every day.According to the National Crime Records Bureau’s latest data for 2020, Delhi reported 3,770 minors (aged below 18) being kidnapped or abducted -- the highest across 19 metropolitan cities with a population of more than two million.Bengaluru reported 654 such cases and Kolkata 266. The number of such cases in Mumbai and Chennai was 1,150 and 14 respectively, according to the NCRB report that was released on Tuesday.To be sure, the NCRB has said that the comparison of crime rate of kidnapping or missing children among cities was not possible because there was no data available on the population of minors in the 19 cities that were analysed.According to the age-wise break up of Delhi data, 69 cases involved children below the age of six. The number of cases registered in the age bracket of 6-12 and 12-16 stood at 368 and 1,929 respectively. Around 1,404 cases involved minors in the age group of 16-18 years. Gender-wise, most victims were girls. A total of 2,749 girls were kidnapped and 1,021 victims were boys, according to the data.According to Delhi Police data, between January 1 and December 31, 2019, 5412 children were reported missing, of which 3336 were traced --a recovery rate of 61.64 %.In 2020, at least 4297 children were reported missing, while 4052 were recovered – a recovery rate of 94.29 % and an improvement of 32.65 percentage points compared to 2019.These cases included those in which kidnapping/abduction cases were registered and those in cases were not registered, but children were reported missing.Delhi’s problem of children getting kidnapped and lured to other cities was best seen after a woman head constable Seema Dhaka, became the first cop to win an out of turn promotion for tracing 76 children. Dhaka had found “children missing in Delhi police records” to places in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. In one case, she had found a 15-year-old girl, who was kidnapped and forcibly married in Assam.Explaining the reasons for the high number of cases increased Sanjay Gupta, director of NGO Chetna (childhood enhancement through training and action), said that the attention of authorities was directed towards covid-related concerns and compliance of norms due to which the number of cases could have possibly increased.“Also, while it will be difficult to state the areas from where the children might have gone missing, in my estimation, a significant number of children often go missing from slum areas. In cities like Delhi, both parents are often working due to which they are unable to give significant time and attention to children,” Gupta said.He said that the lack of resources among the economically weaker section of the society was also a factor due to which many times, they could not get their complaints registered timely. “People who are well-off are able to divert time and resources and exert pressure on the police. Whereas, when a poor family’s child goes missing, no one knows if the child will be traced or not,” said Gupta.A senior crime branch officer, who asked not to be named, said, “Finding missing children is a priority with or without any incentive. We have what we call Operation Milaap, where we try to find missing children and connect them with their families. Our teams visit different shelter homes and find missing children. No one is neglected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/3770-minors-kidnapped-in-delhi-number-of-those-traced-higher-ncrb-report-101631730301240.html

In the notice, they have alleged that I did not follow the methods and Covid-19 rules of the Election Commission during the time of my nomination but this is a complete lie,” she told news agency ANI.She said that she only participated in a ‘kirtan’ that was organised not by her, but by the locals. “They (EC) said a number of cars were following me for nomination, but I cannot stop the general public vehicles as the chief minister does,” Tibrewal was quoted as saying.The vice president of West Bengal BJP’s youth wing further claimed that Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee has made the “complaint to harass” the former. Tibrewal said that the complaint was made as she had “challenged” Banerjee’s nomination. “It doesn’t matter as they won’t be able to prove anything because I didn’t do anything,” the BJP candidate told ANI.Earlier in the day, the returning officer of the Bhabanipur constituency sent a notice to Tibrewal, seeking her reply on why her future campaigns for the upcoming bypolls should not be stopped. The lawyer was given time till 5pm to respond to the notice.Tibrewal filed her nomination on September 13, three days after Banerjee. After filing the nomination, the BJP candidate said that her fight would be “against injustice” and for the “people of West Bengal.”The voting for Bhabanipur bypolls will take place on September 30, and the counting of the votes and declaration of results will be held on October 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/complete-lie-bjp-s-priyanka-tibrewal-replies-to-ec-notice-on-covid-violation-101631728906179.html
16-09-2021||Pune||Dabholkar murder case: Court frames charges against 5 accused||A special court in Pune, on Wednesday, framed charges against five accused in the murder case of Narendra Dabholkar, after all of them pleaded not guilty.While four will be tried for murder, criminal conspiracy, and terrorism, one will be tried for destruction of evidence.Additional Sessions Judge SR Navandar (special judge for UAPA cases) asked the five accused – Virendra Sinh Tawde, Sachin Andure, Sharad Kalaskar, Sanjeev Punalekar and Vikram Bhave – if they pleaded guilty, to which all replied in the negative.With charges framed against these accused, a criminal trial can now begin.Tawade appeared from Yerawada Central Jail via video conference. Andure appeared from Aurangabad jail and Kalaskar, appeared from Arthur Road jail in Mumbai, also via video conference. The two others - Vikram Bhave and advocate Sanjeev Punalekar, who are currently out on bail, were present in court.Narendra Dabholkar, a rationalist who was against superstition, was on a walk on the morning of August 20, 2013, near Omkareshwar bridge in Pune when two bike-borne men shot him. In the initial chargesheet filed by the Central bureau of investigation (CBI), who took over the investigation from the state police, Sarang Akolkar and Vinay Pawar were identified as the shooters. In a second chargesheet filed by the CBI, Andure and Kalaskar were identified as shooters.In both the chargesheets Tawade was found to be the main conspirator. Bhave was accused of helping the two shooters with the reconnaissance, vehicles, and escape route.Punalekar was found to have advised one of the shooters to dispose of the weapon, after which Kalaskar allegedly threw parts of the weapons in the Thane creek. This information was provided by Kalaskar to the Karnataka police special investigation team (SIT) investigating the 2017 Gauri Lankesh murder in Bengaluru, Karnataka.“As trial has begun, it would be appropriate that the accused are lodged in the nearest jail i.e., Yerawada Central Jail. The transfer should be done immediately. The SP of Yerawada Central Jail should facilitate the transfer. One week transit time will be allowed,” said Judge Navandar.“The charges have been framed and the further proceedings will take place starting September 30,” said special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi.“We request you to please have them be physically present as we are not able to take confidential orders from the client,” said advocate Prakash Shalsingikar, who was appearing for Andure. Kalaskar also expressed his desire to appear in court.“Five years have passed because of requests of CBI as they had first asked for intervention of Scotland Yard and then by FSL Gandhinagar, Gujarat. And now neither of those things have happened and five years have passed by,” said advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, representing Kalaskar and Tawade.The three accused lodged in different jails have all expressed anguish about being allegedly kept in the dark about the court proceedings. The court order on September 7, which gave time for the accused to contact family and lawyers, was only worked upon in the last 24 hours, according to two of the accused. Additionally, the discharge applications for Bhave and Punalekar are pending.Kalaskar and Andure have also been named in the 2017 murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh. Kalaskar was also found to have been involved in the August 2018 Nalasopara arms haul by the Maharashtra Anti-terrorism squad. Bhave has been convicted in a bomb blast case for possession of explosives.The CBI has also alleged a larger conspiracy by the Sanatan Sanstha, to which all the present accused belong, to kill Dabholkar, Lankesh, and scholar MM Kalburgi in Dharwad, Karnataka in August 2015.Trial location restrictions due to Covid19- The court has kept options open for the mode of trial.- All the jailed accused will be brought to Yerawada Central jail.- The judge may go to the jail premises…. or- Accused will appear through video conferencing… or- Accused will be physically produced in court.Framing of charges delayed at hearings in past 2 months- On September 3, for demand of Gujarat FSL- On Setpember 7, accused asked for time to meet with family and lawyers- On September 15, accused said meeting was scheduled late so more time was required for discussion* The judge refused requests by all accused and their lawyer for an extension||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dabholkar-murder-case-court-frames-charges-against-5-accused-101631729340378.html

16-09-2021||Pune||State govt asks Pune, other districts to bridge gender gap in Covid vaccination||The state health department has asked district health officials to take measures to reduce the gender gap in the Covid-19 vaccination drive as multiple districts, including Pune and Mumbai have reported a much higher gap than the state average of eight per cent as of September 8.The districts with higher vaccination gender gap are Raigad (15%), Mumbai (14%), Aurangabad (12%), Pune (11%), Ahmednagar (10%), Nashik (10%), Thane (10%), Palghar (10%) and Solapur (9%).As of September 8, 35.53 million men (54%) have got the vaccine as compared to 30.03 million women (46%) in the state. The gap is even more among the third gender as only 12,047 people or 0.2% in the third gender category have got the vaccine in the last nine months since the vaccination drive began in Maharashtra.Lack of access to the vaccine and hesitancy are some of the problems leading to the vaccine gender gap between men and women, say experts.Dr Archana Salve, a gynaecologist with Pune based Apollo Hospital, said, “Many women patients come to me when they are pregnant, lactating or even those who are trying to get pregnant. There is a certain misconception among these women that the vaccine may have a negative impact on their fertility or milk production. The government has repeatedly said that the vaccine is completely safe for everyone to take.”“Some women are sceptical of taking the vaccine during their menstrual cycle and so they delay taking the vaccine,” she said.“Also, while most men take it because it has been made mandatory for work purposes, women who are housewives do not have it mandatory as such to take the vaccine,” she said.Another primary reason for fever women beneficiaries is the fact that women give second priority to their own health over their families health.Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health officer, PMC, said, “Women always wait until the last moment when their family members get their vaccines. They keep delaying it.”“The perception that vaccines could lead to side effects like fever and body pain which would delay their household chores for a day or two and so we sometimes have to force them to take another vaccine if one is causing more side effects. Until all the men in the house get vaccinated and the women are assured that the family would not suffer due to after effect following immunisation (AEFI), women would continue to remain out of the vaccination drive,” she said.Only two districts in the state - Bhandara and Gondia - have seen more women being inoculated than men with a negative difference of -1% and -2% respectively.The two districts have a higher tribal population compared to the rest of the districts in the state while metropolitan districts like Mumbai and Pune have seen a wider gap among women and men beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-govt-asks-pune-other-districts-to-bridge-gender-gap-in-covid-vaccination-101631719918282.html

16-09-2021||Lucknow||‘Could be anyone’s daughter’: Allahabad high court’s grim message to UP cops||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Wednesday expressed its displeasure at the Uttar Pradesh police’s handling of the 2019 death of a 16-year-old girl in Mainpuri, telling the police brass present in the court that the girl came from a poor family but the “administration must not forget it could be anyone’s daughter”.The teenager was found hanging in her school on September 16, 2019. Her family alleged that she was sexually assaulted and killed. The case, initially handled by the Mainpuri police, was later handed over to a special investigation team (SIT). Public interest litigation filed in the high court, however, accused the police of trying to protect the accused.At a hearing on Tuesday, the bench comprising acting chief justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and justice AK Ojha ordered Uttar Pradesh police chief Mukul Goel to be present in the court. The judges, who took up the case on Wednesday, scheduled another hearing on Thursday morning and ordered the UP director general of police (DGP) to go through the records of the case and apprise the bench of the matter.“We take such matters very seriously. Don’t think that she was a poor man’s daughter, she was the nation’s daughter. The investigation was transferred from the police to SIT but SIT also did nothing to ensure fair investigation that’s why the petitioner had to approach this court,” the bench said.The judges pointed out that the police did not interrogate the accused for almost three months after lodging the First Information Report (FIR). Turning to the UP DGP, the court asked, “In the normal course, how do police investigate such cases?”“We hope that good sense prevails and appropriate action is taken against the erring officers who neither interrogated the matter properly nor collected the medical evidence and sent it to the forensic lab within time,” the bench added.“Despite the seriousness shown by the court to the case and the manner of the investigation coupled with direction against the defaulting police officer, no follow-up action has been taken rather the matter is not being briefed to the Director-General of Police, Uttar Pradesh to know the sensitivity of the case,” the bench said.“In view of the above, we are left with no option but to keep this matter tomorrow, i.e. 16.09.2021 at 10am as the first case when Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh and members of SIT would remain present in the court to clarify about the action of the police authorities in conducting the investigation and further as to why the disciplinary action against the then superintendent of police, Mainpuri could not be completed before his retirement almost six months back, as stated,” the bench added while fixing the next date.On Tuesday, the bench, after going through the case record, underlined that the police interrogated the accused almost after three months of registration of the FIR.“The investigating officer present in court could not explain the delay in interrogating the accused in a case where a girl, aged about 16 years, was found hanging in her school and the mother had made allegations of harassment, beating and assault of the girl child,” the bench added. The court said it seemed the SIT team investigating the case was not acting independently and sought the presence of the police chief in the court.Police officers suspendedFollowing the high court’s reprimand, an additional superintendent of police (ASP) and a circle officer (CO), who is now posted as Dy SP, were suspended with immediate effect and a departmental inquiry ordered against them by the Uttar Pradesh home department on Wednesday in connection with the death of a girl student of Navodya Vidyalaya in Mainpuri in 2019.According to home department officials, the then ASP (Mainpuri) Om Prakash Singh and the then CO Prayank Jain were suspended with immediate effect over their work and conduct under the UP Government Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules 1999. Departmental proceedings have also been instituted against them.Prayank Jain is currently posted as deputy superintendent of police (DySP) in Bhadohi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/could-be-anyone-s-daughter-allahabad-high-court-s-grim-message-to-up-cops-101631713138340.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||Connect Karo-2021: Cities that work for children can work for all, say experts||New Delhi: It is increasingly becoming difficult to find safe, open, accessible spaces for children, specially in residential neighbourhoods due to rampant commercialisation, experts said while stressing on the need to plan city infrastructure from perspective of children, as “cities that work for the very young are likely to work for all”.They said though this aspect was missing from urban planning process for a very long time, it was gaining importance with several cities such as Udaipur, Pune, Bhubaneswar and Rajkot planning projects to make neighbourhoods child-friendly.Rushda Majeed, India representative, Bernard Van Leer Foundation, said as part of their Urban 95 project the foundation is working with governments to make cities child-friendly.“It is not just children, but their caregivers, especially mothers, who find it difficult to access neighbourhood facilities,” said Majeed. She said slight modification in existing policies and urban development plans keeping children in mind can make all the difference.Speaking at WRI India’s Connect Karo-2021 on Wednesday, Majeed said, “Cities that work for the very young are likely to work for all.”Hindustan Times is the media partner of the event. This has become even more important due to the coronavirus pandemic, said Tim Gill, independent scholar, consultant, and author of ‘Urban Playground: How Child-Friendly Planning and Design Can Save Cities’.Gill said, “We have become aware of the importance of local spaces, of being able to travel locally and spend time outdoors (during this pandemic). While children were barely affected by the disease itself, they probably are the worst impacted. They have suffered the worst due to the measures (staying indoors) we had to take to control the disease. We owe them or have to compensate them for the sacrifice they have made in the last year.”He said providing accessible, green, joyful spaces in the neighbourhood is a way forward. “If you see children of different age groups, with or without their parents, being active and visible in a city, then that’s the sign of the health of that human habitat,” Gill said. Last year, the ministry of housing and urban affairs launched the nurturing neighbourhood challenge in collaboration with Bernard Van Leer Foundation and WRI India. The ministry has shortlisted 25 out of 65 cities to implement pilot projects to make them child-friendly.To make neighbourhood child-friendly, there is a need to create a sense of ownership in the community, said Swati Janu, architect and founder of Social design Collaborative. “Community engagement is crucial while developing child-friendly neighbourhoods, as it is they who will have to be involved in its maintenance. Communities have to be involved in the projects right from the beginning so that there is a sense of ownership,” said Janu.It is not just accessibility to neighbourhood facilities or parks which has to be improved, making streets children-friendly is equally important, said Sarika Panda, associate director and co-founder of Nagarro and Raahgiri Foundation.Panda, who has been actively working with government agencies to make streets more accessible to all, said, “Streets are a public space, and most inclusive spaces. Therefore, it should be safe for all. The streets should be for everyone and not just for cars. There is a need to rethink our streets. As part of Raahgiri day, we cordon off a portion of the streets and allow people to reclaim it.”An important aspect of making cities child-friendly is to ensure road safety. Dedicated cycle lanes, pedestrian pathways etc are needed to make streets safer and minimise road accidents. Also, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) can help in minimising road accidents, said Anand Mishra, professor of computer science and engineering at IIT Jodhpur.“AI has several interesting solutions. There is need for more research, engineering efforts and India specific datasets, as the challenges on Indian roads are different (from western countries),” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/connect-karo-2021-cities-that-work-for-the-very-young-are-likely-to-work-for-all-say-experts-101631712958042.html

It is a powerful medium with a tremendous reach,” said Bhupal Patwardhan, chairman of the executive board of the institute.“We have already conducted popular introductory online courses on topics such as Vedas and Mahabharata. During such interactions, we recognised the great curiosity people have about Upanishads,” he said.“Upanishads is one of the origins of the Indian Astika philosophy. Upanishads are significant in their resonance. They encourage one to be inquisitive and creative. So we have designed the series in such a way, that it gives a basic introduction to each of the ten Upanishads and their key concepts,” said Dr Gauri Moghe, series coordinator.“The series is based on the original texts. Our goal is to encourage a deeper study of Upanishads,” she said.To date five videos have been uploaded, two introductory and three on Upanishads, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/online-lecture-series-on-upanishads-by-bhandarkar-institute-receives-good-response-101631712537422.html
16-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi bans sale, use, storage of firecrackers this Diwali||Delhi government on Wednesday announced a “complete ban” on the sale, use and storage of firecrackers in the Capital this Diwali. This pre-emptive ban was imposed in view of the city’s deteriorating air quality over the past three years, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a series of tweets.“Taking into consideration the deteriorating pollution levels in Delhi over the last three years around Diwali time, like last year it has been decided that the storage, sale and use of firecrackers has been completely banned. This has been done to save people’s lives,” he tweeted on Wednesday. In another tweet, the Delhi CM added that the decision has been taken early this year to help traders avoid losses. “Last year, the complete ban was imposed late, after looking at the rising pollution levels in the city. Because of this traders had already bought stock and they had to face losses. This time, traders are requested not to stock up on crackers,” he added. Also Read | Delhi govt completes liquor licence allotment in all zones; earns ₹8,900 croreIt was unclear if the ban would be in place only during Diwali or would stretch for the entire winter season, when pollution levels peak. Last year, the Delhi government faced heavy criticism from cracker traders in the city for imposing the ban just days ahead of Diwali, when licences had been procured and crackers had already been stocked up for sale, resulting in losses for traders. The government had imposed a complete ban on the sale and use of crackers, including the green varient in November last year. Later this ban was also reiterated by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which said that sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in Delhi and adjoining areas will be prohibited starting midnight of November 9 to midnight of November 30, 2020. Looking at the deterioration air quality of the national capital in December last year, the NGT extended the ban to Christmas and New Year’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-bans-sale-use-storage-of-firecrackers-this-diwali-101631694356261.html

Women can work in the health sector and other sectors where they are needed. There will be no discrimination against women," said Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid.After coming to power last month, the group backtracked from its assurances to respect women's rights in Afghanistan and announced a ban on coeducation.Taliban early this month announced a new government sans any women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-ban-female-employees-from-entering-ministry-of-women-101631813122505.html

In August 2020, World Bank paused the publication of Doing Business reports following a number of irregularities were reported regarding changes to the data.The international financial institution later confirmed that the changes were inconsistent with the Doing Business methodology. The World Bank has now said in a statement that a new approach will be worked out to assess countries' business and investment climates after the irregularities raised ethical matters involving former bank staff and board officials, according to Reuters.The irregularities had affected four countries: China; Saudi Arabia; United Arab Emirates; and Azerbaijan. According to the initial Doing Business 2018 report, China had a score of 65.3 with a global ranking of 78, similar to the previous year’s. After the corrections in data for indicators like Starting a Business, Getting Credit, and Paying Taxes indicators, China’s score fell to 64.5 and global ranking to 85.“Taking as given the published data for all other countries, China's global ranking in Doing Business 2018 would have been 85, a decline of 7 places relative to the previous year," World Bank had said in a review report.Also Read | 'Deeply concerned': World Bank freezes aid to Afghanistan after Taliban takeoverEconomies like India, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Togo, Bahrain, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kuwait, China, and Nigeria made notable improvements in the Doing Business 2020 report after they, according to the World Bank, implemented one-fifth of all the reforms in 2018-19 recorded worldwide.In 2014, India was at 142nd position on the Ease of Doing Business Index and made significant improvements after the government launched an ambitious program of regulatory reforms.

He will shore up support for the anti-Taliban force, which is firm on their decision of not surrendering and declaring a parallel government. While the international community is silent on whatever is happening in the Panjshir valley and countries are far from the discourse of recognising the NRF, the lobbyist will do his work.

In particular, they should shake off their cold war mentality and ideological prejudice”.The Global Times said Australia had now “turned itself into an adversary of China”, in an editorial published on Thursday.The editorial asked: “The US and its allies are messing up the world. They are even touching the bottom line of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Here comes an interesting question: Who is more capable of withstanding the global chaos?

16-09-2021||World||'Why do we risk...': Pakistan wants countries to recognise Taliban, miffed with wait-and-watch policy||Pakistan is miffed with the international community’s wait-and-watch policy on recognising the Taliban’s interim government in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s national security adviser Moeed Yusuf said that the current approach would push the war-torn country towards an economic slump, reported Dawn newspaper."If the world is interested in this conversation, it needs to happen directly with the new government. For influencing and moulding governance in the way the world wants, it should have a conversation with them. Without engagement that would not be possible," Dawn quoted Yusuf as saying.While the international community has stepped up humanitarian aid efforts in Afghanistan, it has shown no immediate interest in recognising the Taliban, given the Sunni Pashtun group’s history of gross human rights violation in name of imposing their harsh version of Sharia law. Several countries have said that they will wait and watch the actions of the Taliban, which claim to be different from the last time they ruled Afghanistan.Warning about the consequences of abandoning Afghanistan, Pakistan’s NSA said that a security vacuum could again make the region safe haven for terrorists. “You already know ISIS (the militant Islamic State group) is already present there, Pakistani Taliban are there, Al Qaeda is there. Why do we risk a security vacuum?" he added.Yusuf has been repeatedly calling on countries to engage with the Taliban while warning about either the refugee crisis or terrorism or both. Earlier this month, the security official said that the world needs to constructively engage the Afghan Taliban in order to prevent governance collapse and avert another refugee crisis, reported news agency PTI."The world must think about the cost of abandonment of Afghanistan," he said at a webinar organised by the Centre for Aerospace & Security Studies (CASS).Meanwhile, Pakistan, accused of supporting the Taliban during years of insurgency, was proactive in the government formation in Afghanistan. Pakistan's powerful intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed recently met the group’s de-factor leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who was later named the deputy prime minister of the provisional government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-wants-countries-to-recognise-taliban-miffed-with-wait-and-watch-policy-101631788055515.html
16-09-2021||World||Where is Taliban's Mullah Baradar? What this interview clarifies||To refute rumours about his probable injury or death, Afghanistan's deputy prime minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar had to apparently sit in front of a camera and issue a statement. It was an interview by Radio Television Afghanistan. Though it was a radio interview, it was video-recorded and was released by Taliban leaders on Twitter to show that their leader is alive. Earlier, the Taliban released an audio message but the speculation could not be put to rest.Mullah Baradar is in KandaharThe interview was taken in Kandahar, reports said which establishes the fact that Mullah Baradar is in Kandahar. Reports said that Mullah Baradar had fled to Kandahar following an argument between him and a Cabinet member. The fight reportedly broke out at the presidential palace in Kabul. The Taliban and the Haqqani have been engaged in a power tussle to mediate which Pak ISI chief Faiz Hameed reportedly came to Kabul. But reports said this fight between Baradar and Khalil ur -Rahman Haqqani and their followers was a massive one and Baradar left the city the next day. Latest interview of Deputy Minister of the Islamic Emirate Mullah Baradar Akhund (HA). https://t.co/QYwz9JYQXYNo internal rift, says BaradarApart from refuting the rumours of his injury or death, Baradar also denied any feud among the new Cabinet. "Praise be to God, we have a lot of kindness and mercy amongst us, such that does not even exist in a family. In addition, for many years, we have suffered and given sacrifices, in order to end the occupation. That is neither for power nor for the position," Baradar said in the interview.'Didn't know Qatar foreign minister was coming'As Baradar was out of Kabul, he could not meet Qatar foreign minister when he visited Kabul. "We were not aware that the Foreign Minister was coming from Qatar. Had we known, we would have postponed our trip. And we were on a trip, therefore, the meeting didn't happen," Baradar said when he was asked why he did not meet the Qatar minister. It may be noted that Baradar remained the head of the Taliban's Qatar office and shares a close relationship with Qatar.Reading from a scriptBoth Baradar and the person who interviewed him read from a paper held out in front of them. Taliban leaders have been promoting the interview and Ahmadullah Muttaqi has shared the available clip of the interview where Mullah Baradar can be seen several times on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-is-taliban-s-mullah-baradar-what-this-interview-clarifies-101631786745216.html
16-09-2021||World||UN official raises concern over children's security in Afghanistan||Virginia Gamba, United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, has raised concerns over the security of children in Afghanistan saying that high levels of violence endured by children in Afghanistan are rising, a report said."Afghanistan continues to be one of the most dangerous places for a child to live and grow. I am appalled by the continuing and rising high levels of violence endured by children in Afghanistan, including those caught up in combat," the International Forum For Rights And Security (IFFRAS) said in its report.The midyear report of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) is of also very high concern. It showed a significant increase in child casualties between January 1 to June 30 this year.Child casualties comprised about 32 per cent of all civilian casualties, of which 20 per cent were boys and 12 per cent were girls. In numbers, these were recorded as 1,682 child casualties, a 55 per cent increase as compared to the first six months of 2020. Girl casualties nearly doubled, marking the highest level ever recorded by UNAMA, and boy casualties too increased by 36 per cent, according to IFFRAS.In July, the Fifth Report of the UN Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict in Afghanistan, highlighted 6,473 grave violations against 6,131 children during the two-year reporting period from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020, with nearly half attributed to the Taliban. The most prevalent violation remained killing and maiming.Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, had also rightly issued a warned the Taliban that the vast majority of grave violations against children were "committed by the Taliban". "I condemn the armed group's practices and call upon the Taliban to swiftly take all measures to halt the increased recruitment and use of children and abide by national directives prohibiting the recruitment and use of children."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-official-raises-concern-over-children-s-security-in-afghanistan-101631784887883.html
16-09-2021||World||'Stab in the back': France feels ‘betrayed’ after Australia turns to US for nuclear-powered submarines||France expressed fury on Thursday over Australia's surprise decision to scrap a huge submarines deal in favour of nuclear-powered subs from the US, slamming the move as a breach of trust."It's really a stab in the back. We had established a relationship of trust with Australia, this trust has been betrayed," Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio."I'm very angry today, and bitter... this is not something allies do to each other," he said."This unilateral, sudden and unforeseeable decision very much recalls what Mr Trump would do," Le Drian added, referring to the previous US president Donald Trump who exasperated Europe with unpredictable decision-making.France's Naval Group, partly owned by the state, had been chosen to build 12 conventionally powered submarines to Australia, based on France's Barracuda nuclear-powered subs in development.The contract was worth around Aus$50 billion (31 billion euros, $36.5 billion) when announced in 2016.But US President Joe Biden and the prime ministers of Australia and Britain announced Wednesday a new defence pact that would see Canberra get a nuclear-powered submarine fleet, a privilege reserved for few American allies.The move underscores increasing concerns about China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, where France is also looking to protect its interests that include the overseas territories of New Caledonia and French Polynesia.Asked if Paris had been "duped" by Washington over what Le Drian once called a "contract of the century" for France's naval yards, the minister replied: "Your analysis of the situation is more or less correct."He said France and its allies had been working on a "coherent and structured Indo-Pacific policy" in the face of Beijing's growing regional might."We had been discussing that with the United States just recently, and here comes this break," Le Drian said, calling it "a huge breach of trust"."We'll need clarifications. We have contracts -- the Australians need to tell us how they intend to get out of them," he added.- 'Clear-eyed' - Defence Minister Florence Parly called Australia's about-face "very bad news with regards to keeping one's word", while adding that France is "clear-eyed as to how the United States treats its allies"."In terms of geopolitics and international relations, it's serious," she told RFI radio on Thursday.Parly and Le Drian had already denounced a "regrettable" move by Canberra in a statement overnight, saying it underscored the need to bolster "a European strategic autonomy"."There is no other credible way to defend our interests and our values in the world, including in the Indo-Pacific," they said.President Emmanuel Macron -- who is due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel for already scheduled talks later Thursday -- has repeatedly said that Europe needs to develop its own strategic and defence capabilities to be less reliant on the US.Parly and Le Drian said that France retains its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region as the "only European nation" with a presence there, due to its overseas territories with nearly two million French citizens and over 7,000 troops."France is a reliable partner and will continue to stick to its engagements, as it has always done," they said.vl-js-cf/sjw/jvNAVAL GROUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stab-in-the-back-france-feels-betrayed-after-australia-turns-to-us-for-nuclear-powered-submarines-101631780437893.html

Families with one or two children can receive smaller subsidies, and the local authority has promised subsidies for schooling fees and home purchases.  Panzhihua city in the southwestern province of Sichuan became the nation’s first city in July to offer cash handouts to encourage childbirth. Authorities are taking more active steps to slow the declining birthrate, making a surprise decision in May to allow all couples to have a third child and promising supportive measures to help parents raise kids. Read More: Why China Is Struggling to Boost Its BirthrateLinze’s policy was introduced because the number of permanent residents in the area has shrunk significantly, falling 22,000 in the latest census from the previous one 10 years earlier, local health official Jia Yongming said in a report by Beijing Youth Daily.

16-09-2021||World||At least 50 rebels and pro-government troops killed in clashes in central Yemen||At least 50 rebels and pro-government troops, including a high-ranking officer, have been killed in clashes in Yemen's central province of Al-Bayda, military sources told AFP on Thursday. "A colonel and 19 other loyalists were killed in the past 24 hours in fighting with the Huthi insurgents in Al-Bayda ditrict," a government military official said. "Thirty rebels also met their fate in battlefield clashes and air strikes."The Huthis rarely report casualty numbers but the figures were confirmed by other military sources. The Iran-backed rebels have made advances in Al-Bayda province in recent weeks as they also fight for control of the strategic city of Marib in the north. In February, the Huthis escalated their efforts to seize Marib, the government's last toehold in the north, and the fighting has killed hundreds on both sides.Control of the oil-rich province would strengthen the Huthis' bargaining position in peace talks.The battle for Marib has also raised fears of a humanitarian catastrophe, as many Yemenis have fled to the area to escape fighting in other parts of the country.The conflict in Yemen flared in 2014 when the Huthis seized the capital Sanaa, prompting Saudi-led intervention to prop up the internationally recognised government the following year.Since then, tens of thousands have been killed and millions pushed to the brink of famine in what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Swedish diplomat Hans Grundberg, the UN's new envoy for Yemen, arrived in Riyadh on Wednesday to meet with Yemeni and Saudi officials, marking his first trip to the kingdom since taking office earlier this month.While the UN and Washington are pushing for an end to the war, the Huthis have demanded the re-opening of Sanaa airport, closed under a Saudi blockade since 2016, before any ceasefire or negotiations. faw-dm-sy/th/kir||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-50-rebels-and-pro-government-troops-killed-in-clashes-in-central-yemen-101631777535303.html
16-09-2021||World||Australia to get nuclear-powered submarines as first initiative of AUKUS||Australia, the UK and the US have announced a new trilateral security partnership against the backdrop of China’s assertive actions across the Indo-Pacific, with the grouping’s first initiative aimed at equipping Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among key world leaders that Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called on Wednesday to inform them of the new partnership before it was formally unveiled at a virtual conference of the leaders of the three countries. Morrison also spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and was due to call leaders of several regional countries on Thursday. Modi said in a tweet he and Morrison had “exchanged perspectives on regional developments” and the upcoming Quad Summit. The two leaders also reviewed progress in the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership and the recent 2+2 ministerial dialogue. Australian foreign minister Marise Payne too made a phone call to her Indian counterpart S Jaishankar before the announcement.The creation of the new alliance called AUKUS will build on the existing and strong security cooperation between the three members of the grouping, though it could be seen as a provocation by China. Relations between the three members of AUKUS and China are already strained over a range of issues, including trade disputes, Beijing’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea and human rights violations in Hong Kong. Also Read | PM Modi to hold bilaterals with US, Australia, Japan before Quad summitThe most significant aspect of the new security partnership was its first initiative – a move to develop nuclear-powered submarines for Australia, which has never operated such vessels. “As the first initiative under AUKUS, recognising our common tradition as maritime democracies, we commit to a shared ambition to support Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines for the Royal Australian Navy,” said a joint statement issued by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden. The leaders said they would “embark on a trilateral effort of 18 months to seek an optimal pathway to deliver this capability”. The partnership will leverage expertise from the US and the UK, building on submarine programmes of these two countries, to “bring an Australian capability into service at the earliest achievable date”. The development of Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines will be a joint endeavour between the three countries, with the “focus on interoperability, commonality, and mutual benefit”. The UK said in a statement that the design and build process for the submarine initiative will create hundreds of scientific and engineering roles across Britain, and drive investment in high-tech sectors. Australia committed itself to the “highest standards for safeguards, transparency, verification, and accountancy measures to ensure the non-proliferation, safety, and security of nuclear material and technology”, and said it would fulfil all its obligations as a non-nuclear weapons state, including with the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, the nuclear-powered submarine initiative led to the scrapping of Australia’s $90-billion programme to build up to 12 French-designed submarines and triggered an angry response from the French government. The Australian government had concluded the country’s largest defence deal for the submarines with French company Naval Group in 2016. France’s foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and defence minister Florence Parly said in a joint statement that the decision was contrary to the letter and the spirit of cooperation between France and Australia, based on a relationship of political trust. Australia’s decision to go with the American choice leads to the removal of an ally and a European partner from a relationship at a time of “unprecedented challenges in the Indo-Pacific region”, and “marks an absence of coherence that France can only...regret”, the two ministers said in the statement. Also Read | PM Modi to attend Quad summit in Washington on Sept 24: MEANew Zealand Prime Minister Jessica Ardern said shortly after the announcement regarding the AUKUS alliance that Australian nuclear-powered submarines would be banned from her country’s waters in line with a long-standing policy on such vessels. The cooperation between the US and Australia through AUKUS is also expected to build on the initiatives the two countries are engaged in under the framework of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, which includes India and Japan. The first in-person summit of Quad leaders is scheduled to be held in Washington on September 24. AUKUS also dovetails with the Boris Johnson government’s tilt towards the Indo-Pacific under a comprehensive revamp of foreign and security policies in order to unlock new opportunities across the region. The UK’s integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy was unveiled in March and was followed by the first operational deployment of the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth to the Indo-Pacific. Australia is now set to join an elite group of only six countries – India, the US, the UK, France, Russia and China – that operate nuclear-powered submarines. It will also be the only country to have such submarines without having a civilian nuclear power industry. “The United States has only ever shared [nuclear-powered submarine] technology with the United Kingdom, so the fact that Australia is now joining this club indicates that the United States is prepared to take significant new steps and break with old norms to meet the China challenge,” Sam Roggeveen, director of the Lowy Institute’s international security programme and a former senior strategic analyst in Australia’s key intelligence agency, the Office of National Assessments, wrote in a piece on Thursday. “Australia cannot have this capability while assuming that it does not come with heightened expectations that Australia will take America’s side in any dispute with China,” Roggeveen added. AUKUS will also work to support a rules-based international order and to defend the shared interests of the three countries in the Indo-Pacific. The three sides will also enhance technology sharing and foster deeper integration of security and defence-related science, technology, industrial bases and supply chains. The alliance will also enhance trilateral collaboration focused on joint capabilities and interoperability, including cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies and additional undersea capabilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-get-nucleaur-powered-submarines-as-first-initiative-of-aukus-101631777590260.html

That’s Justin Trudeau - the man who lectures you about the rules he isn’t willing to follow himself,” Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole said while campaigning in Saguenay in the province of Quebec.The outlet CBC News reported, “Photos of Liberal supporters packed closely together at venue in a city that was once Canada’s Covid-19 hotspot raised some alarm on social media.”It added, “Attendees were crammed at the front of the room with little space separating them, while the back of the vast banquet hall sat largely empty.”Canada is in the midst of a fourth wave of the pandemic and Justin Trudeau has made issues like mandatory vaccinations and his government’s record in countering the health crisis central to his pitch to voters.The Liberal Party, however, countered the criticism, stating that the capacity of the venue was 1,000 and the number of persons there was 400 thereby well within the norms set by the province of Ontario. At an event in Halifax, Trudeau also defended the rally, saying all public health guidelines were “followed”.While Trudeau has accused Erin O’Toole of being in the thrall of anti-vaccination groups, he faced renewed criticism over calling the election, scheduled for September 20, in the first place. Erin O’Toole said, “This pattern of behaviour on Covid will only get worse if Trudeau is rewarded for plunging the country into a $600 million election in the middle of a pandemic.”Those views were echoed by New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, as he told reporters, while at a stop in Windsor, Ontario, that the election call was a “selfish decision by Mr Trudeau”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-opposition-slams-justin-trudeau-for-violating-covid-norms-101631774046891.html

This time, the US president appeared to forget Australian prime minister Scott Morrison's name during a press conference about a key military alliance, and in the next moment, referred to him as “that fellow down under”.The apparent slip-up came during the announcement of the new AUKUS military alliance among the United States, Australia, and Britain to share advanced military technology. Biden was flanked by television screens which beamed in the two other premiers – UK prime minister Boris Johnson and Australia's Scott Morrison.Also Read | Australia to get US nuclear submarine technology as China looms largeIt was all fine till the moment Biden, after announcing the pact, turned to the leaders to thank them for partaking in the alliance. “Thank you, Boris,” the US president said, showing his appreciation for the British premier. Then, turning to Morrison, he said, "And I want to thank that fellow down under. Thank you very much, pal. Appreciate it, Mr. prime minister.”Although Americans are used to the 78-year-old president's gaffes, many of which also appeared during the run-up to the presidential elections (The Time Magazine even has a list of Top 10 Joe Biden Gaffes), the Australian media and the country's netizens were quick to latch on to the embarrassing slip-up.US President Joe Biden appeared to forget Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s name during this morning’s historic announcement of a new defence pact.Biden said “I wanna thank that fella down under” after thanking UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.https://t.co/a9AwdxnrYj#9News pic.twitter.com/0aULXfJJS2Surely “That fella Down Under” is the equivalent of running into someone in the pub whose name you can’t remember and can only come up with “Maate”.“That fella down under” ouch.

It also paves the way for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines from the United States to counter China's growing maritime influence in the region.The United States and its allies are looking for ways to push back against China's growing power and influence, particularly its military buildup, pressure on Taiwan, and deployments in the contested South China Sea.Under the partnership, announced by US president Joe Biden, British prime minister Boris Johnson and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, the United States and Britain will provide Australia with the technology and capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines.Also Read | PM Modi to hold bilaterals with US, Australia, Japan before Quad summit“We need to be able to address both the current strategic environment in the region and how it may evolve because the future of each of our nations and indeed the world depends on a free and open Indo-Pacific enduring and flourishing in the decades ahead,” Biden said.Scott Morrison, too, said that Australia will continue to meet all our nuclear non-proliferation obligations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-mocked-after-calling-australian-pm-that-fellow-down-under-101631770023193.html
16-09-2021||World||A month later, Akhundzada, Haqqani and Yaqoob remain in shadows||A month after Sunni Pashtun Islamists militarily took over Kabul, there is uncertainty and confusion within the Taliban government with US designated global terrorist and Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani remaining in the shadows and visiting Quetta earlier this week. Haqqani belongs to Miramshah or Peshwar Shura of Taliban with Defence minister Mullah Yaqoob Omari is part of the Quetta Shura. Haqqani is said to have returned to Kabul on Wednesday night.Also Read | 10 changes in Afghanistan in 30 days of Taliban ruleKabul watchers say that the main players of Taliban, particularly self-declared Emir-ul-Momin Haibatullah Akhundzada’s whereabouts are not clear as he has not been seen in public either in Kandahar or in Kabul. While deputy prime minister Mullah Baradar is in Kandahar nursing his angst at being politically humiliated by both Haqqani and Yaqoob, the latter two are also lurking in the shadows. “Haqqani’s visit to Quetta over the weekend shows that the crown prince of terror is still worried about his physical safety in Kabul due to over the horizon capabilities of US Central Command as well as the resistance still led by Amrullah Saleh,” said a senior official. Haqqani has a bounty of $10 million on his head as declared by the FBI.According to intelligence officials, the Taliban government is still to start governing as there is political jostling within the Cabinet with Haqqani group controlling Kabul through the domination of its Zadran tribe military cadre touching nearly 6000. Even the intelligence chief of Taliban government is special assistant to Sirajuddin Haqqani. As there is no regular Afghan Army as such, the role of defence minister Yaqoob is largely ceremonial as Taliban cadre are with Haqqani. The key portfolios of border and tribal affairs and, information and broadcasting are held by hardcore Taliban terrorists who were released from Guantanamo Bay prison by the Obama administration.To add to political instability in Afghanistan is the regrouping of al Qaeda forces as publicly declared by a top CIA official. Al Qaeda has filial ties and symbiotic relationship with Taliban even though they belong to opposing schools of Islam with former a Wahhabi-Salafi group and the latter a Deobandi group. The regrouping of al Qaeda means that there is no change in the present Taliban from the past and will give sleepless nights to counter-terrorism organizations in the neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-month-later-akhundzada-haqqani-and-yaqoob-remain-in-shadows-101631768563062.html
16-09-2021||World||AUKUS: UK, US and Australia launch pact to counter China||In a development termed historic and a game-changer, the US, the UK and Australia on Wednesday announced a trilateral security partnership called AUKUS that will enable Canberra to deploy nuclear-powered submarines in the Indo-Pacific in a major challenge to China and its claims in the region.US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison launched the alliance in a joint virtual appearance.The AUKUS pact will strive over the next 18 months to equip Australia with nuclear propulsion technology, which the United States has shared only with the United Kingdom under a decades-old arrangement put together in the face of the threat from the then Soviet Union.Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines, when they deploy, will be armed with conventional weapons only and not nuclear weapons, the leaders said.The leaders also made it clear that the new alliance does not and will not supersede or outrank existing arrangements in the Indo-Pacific region such as the Quad, which the US and Australia form with India and Japan, and Asean, and that it will compliment these groups and others.“This is about investing in our greatest source of strength, our alliances and updating them to better meet the threats of today and tomorrow,” Joe Biden said. “It’s about connecting America’s existing allies and partners in new ways.”He added: “The United States will also continue to work with Asean and the Quad … our five treaty allies and other close partners in the Indo-Pacific.”TRILATERAL SECURITY PARTNERSHIPPrime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, a member of the Quad and other multilateral groups in the region, also sought to convey continued salience of these formations for Australia. “The AUKUS will also enhance our contribution to our growing network of partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region: ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand and the US); our Asean friends; our bilateral strategic partners, the Quad; Five Eyes (US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand) countries; and, of course, our dear Pacific family.”None of the three leaders mentioned China and senior Biden administration officials who briefed reporters ahead of the announcement insisted “this partnership is not aimed (at) or about any one country; it’s about advancing our strategic interests, upholding the international rules-based order, and promoting peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific”.CHINA THREATBut the threat emanating from China’s increasingly aggressive territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific and its worldwide ambitions are the reason for this new partnership - to equip, empower and embolden Australia, a fellow traveller and an ally that has been loathe challenging China.“I think pulling Australia into the shared technology for subs and undersea warfare is a fantastic development! It further multilateralises what were previously different kinds of bilateral or plurilateral arrangements - absolutely essential for the successful balancing of China,” said Ashely Tellis, Tata chair for strategic affairs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Pease and the dean of Indo-Pacific experts.Asked if this new partnership created a super security group in the Indo-Pacific, relegating others such as the Quad, to a lesser league, Tellis said that this new arrangement “does not negate the role of the Quad since it is not in any case a military alliance”.THE QUAD GROUPThe Quad - which is a shortened version of its formal name Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - has been focused thus far on non-security issues in its escalating interactions.There is a military component to it though, as reflected in the Malabar exercises hosted annually by India. All four countries participated in 2020, with Australia returning to the exercises 14 years after the last time in 2007. Australia had backed out of the Quad around then, putting it in suspended animation.The Quad was resurrected in 2017 with the return of Australia and it has grown rapidly since, from meetings of officials on the sidelines of Asean to ministers to leaders in a virtual summit in March and now to an in-person summit later this month.Calling the new partnership a “game-changer” because it brings fresh momentum to two of America’s closest alliances, Michael Kugelman of Wilson Center, a leading American think tank, said, “I don’t think it’s fair to compare this new pact to the Quad. The US alliances with the UK and Australia are much stronger and longstanding than the relationships between Quad members. And let’s be clear: the Quad isn’t an alliance. It’s a grouping of friendly, like-minded states.”He added: “I see the Quad as a useful complement to the AUKUS. The Quad is focused on counterbalancing China through joint initiatives that revolve around dialogue and non-traditional security cooperation. The AUKUS by contrast provides muscle and military technology firepower. Given that both initiatives are meant, in different ways, to counter China, there are notable strategic benefits for New Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-and-australia-launch-indo-pacific-pact-101631768286344.html
16-09-2021||World||Frozen economy, confined rights: 10 changes in Afghanistan in 30 days of Taliban rule||It has been a month since the Afghan capital of Kabul fell to the Taliban, following the lightning-fast offensive which won the group control of the state machinery in the war-torn land. Afghanistan watchers and political commentators across the world were stunned by the Taliban blitzkrieg, which coincided with the withdrawal of the United States and allied troops from the country at the end of a nearly 20-year war. The militants made rapid territorial gains in a little over three months' time, as they captured one provincial capital after another; eventually, Kabul fell to the offensive on August 15, 2021.The sheer tempo of the Taliban takeover surprised many in the international community, and the aftermath reflected widespread domestic and global ramifications regarding human rights and concerns regarding the proliferation of terrorism. The Taliban are now shifting to their roles as the new rulers of Afghanistan, with the insurgents announcing a hardline interim government that betrayed several of their earlier promises to put up a ‘moderate’ face.Here are 15 of the most important changes that have taken place in Afghanistan in the past 30 days:1. Curbs on women: Days after winning back power in Afghanistan, the Taliban announced a series of measures reflecting their views on women's rights. There have been reports of women being barred from going to work, and some being beaten in recent weeks for protesting the Taliban rule. A spokesperson from the group also told an Australian broadcaster earlier this month he did not think women would be allowed to play cricket since it was “not necessary” and would be against Islam.2. Music goes silent: Taliban authorities in Kandahar, the birthplace of the movement, issued a formal order against radio stations playing music. Radio stations have replaced their normal menu of Hindi and Persian pop and call-in shows with sombre patriotic music.3. ‘Redefining’ culture: Cultural activities are allowed, the Taliban say, so long as they do not go against Sharia law and Afghanistan's Islamic culture. Already, colourful signs outside beauty parlours have been painted over and jeans have been replaced by traditional dress.4. Resistance rallies in Panjshir: The National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, which groups opposition forces loyal to local leader Ahmad Massoud in the last stronghold of the Panjshir valley, has pledged to continue opposing the Taliban. However, the Taliban offensive against the rebels continues, and the militants have presently taken control of Bazarak, the provincial capital of Panjshir.5. Taliban lead a hardline government: The Taliban appointed hardline figures to their all-male cabinet in Afghanistan, including multiple senior leaders with millions of dollars worth of US bounties on their heads. The move was widely seen as a signal that they were not looking to present a more ‘tolerant’ face to the world, contrary to former promises.6. No participation of women in politics, curbs on employment likely: The cabinet appointments announced by the Taliban on September 7 did not include a single woman; nor was there a ministry dedicated to women's welfare and interests. Waheedullah Hashimi, a senior figure in the Taliban close to the leadership, even said that Afghan women should not be allowed to work alongside men. This could effectively bar women from employment in government offices, banks, media companies, and beyond.7: No protest without permission: Protests against the newfound Taliban regime have grown stronger in Afghanistan, but the rulers keep pushing back, saying they won't tolerate any resistance to their authority. The Taliban have ordered demonstrators to seek permission from the ministry of justice before holding protests. They said that purpose, slogans, place, time and all 'other' details of the protest need to be shared with the government authorities and security agencies.8. Journalists tortured, slaughtered across Afghanistan: The Taliban continue to violate the basic human rights of media personnel, harassing, torturing, and killing them across Afghanistan. Journalists are scared; feeling hopeless as the spirit of journalism they built in the past two decades is ceasing to exist now.9. Europe in a fix over migrant crisis: Triggering memories of the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis has forced Greece to seek a potential block on Afghan asylum-seekers as it says Europe must take collective responsibility to resolve the crisis. Greece has said it does not want to turn into Europe's gateway again. Turkish authorities have also stepped up efforts to block any refugee influx into the country.10. Economic crisis approaching: A month after seizing Kabul, the Taliban face daunting problems as they seek to convert their lightning military victory into a durable peacetime government. Drought and famine are driving thousands from the country to the cities, and the World Food Programme fears food could run out by the end of the month, pushing up to 14 million people to the brink of starvation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frozen-economy-confined-rights-10-changes-in-afghanistan-in-30-days-of-taliban-rule-101631759360831.html

US President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that the United States is forming a new Indo-Pacific security alliance with Britain and Australia that will allow for greater sharing of defense capabilities. It's a move that could deepen a growing chasm in US-China relations.As a result, Australia notified France that it would end its contract with state majority-owned DCNS to build 12 of the world’s largest conventional submarines. Australia has spent 2.4 billion Australian dollars ($1.8 billion) on the project since the French won the contract in 2016.Morrison said US nuclear submarine technology wasn’t an option open to Australia when the AU$56 billion ($43 billion) deal was struck in 2016. The United States had until now only shared the technology with Britain.Morrison said he told French President Emanuel Macron in June that there were “very real issues about whether a conventional submarine capability” would address Australia’s strategic security needs in the Indo-Pacific.“Of course they’re disappointed,” Morrison said. "They've been good partners. This is about our strategic interest, our strategic capability requirements, and a changed strategic environment and we’ve had to take that decision.”Australia had not yet decided what class of submarine it would select and did not know how much the nuclear fleet would cost, Morrison said.But Morrison said Australia’s defense budget would grow above the current 2.2% of gross domestic product.The first of the 97-meter (318-foot) Shortfin Barracuda submarines, an adapted French nuclear sub design, was to be delivered in 2027.Morrison said he expected the first of the nuclear subs, which are to be built in the Australian city of Adelaide, would be built within a decade.Top French officials made clear they were unhappy with the deal.“The American choice to exclude a European ally and partner such as France from a structuring partnership with Australia, at a time when we are facing unprecedented challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, whether in terms of our values or in terms of respect for multilateralism based on the rule of law, shows a lack of coherence that France can only note and regret,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Defense Minister Florence Parly said in a joint statement.Left out of the new alliance was Australia's South Pacific neighbor New Zealand, which in the 1980s enacted policies and laws to ensure it remains nuclear-free. That includes a ban on nuclear-powered ships entering New Zealand ports, a stance which has seen it clash, at times, with the USPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Thursday that New Zealand wasn’t asked to be part of the alliance and wouldn’t have expected an invitation.“The centerpiece, the anchor of this arrangement are nuclear-powered submarines,” Ardern said. “And it will be very clear to all New Zealanders, and to Australia, why New Zealand would not wish to be a part of that project.”Ardern said the new alliance didn’t diminish its close ties to the US, Britain, Australia, and also Canada, which had been solidified through the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-turns-to-us-for-nuclear-powered-submarines-aim-to-thwart-china-101631763472617.html
16-09-2021||World||Al Qaeda regrouping in Afghanistan, says CIA||United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on Wednesday (local time) said that they are noticing early signs that Al Qaeda may be regrouping in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.According to the Deputy Director of the United States Central Intelligence Agency David Cohen said that current intelligence reports indicate "some potential motion of Al Qaeda [returning] to Afghanistan," reported Intelnews.org.However, the CIA, in particular, is already working to develop "methods to work within the horizon", he said.Cohen said that American intelligence agencies are closely monitoring the situation. Speaking at the Intelligence and National Security Summit in Washington, DC, Cohen acknowledged that the shuttering of the United States embassy in Kabul, as well as the closure of a network of CIA stations across Afghanistan, had "diminished" the ability of American intelligence agencies to assess conditions on the ground, reported Intelnews.org.Cohen added that much of the intelligence that has been collected in recent weeks comes from "over-the-horizon platforms", meaning that the collection is taking place from countries that border Afghanistan.At the moment, the United States intelligence community estimates that it could take Al Qaeda between one and two years to amass its former strike capability, so as to directly threaten American interests, reported Intelnews.org.The presence of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan was the primary reason behind the invasion of the country by the United States in 2001.However, with the Taliban back in power in Afghanistan, there are concerns that Al Qaeda may make a comeback in the war-torn country.Under the leadership of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda worked closely with the upper echelons of the Taliban in the 1990s and early 2000s. Contacts between the two groups continue to exist, and could potentially deepen following the exit of the United States and its Western allies from Afghanistan, reported Intelnews.org.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/al-qaeda-regrouping-in-afghanistan-says-cia-101631760135777.html

This was later denied by Baradar.A look at what appears to have transpiredWhat was the brawl about?The argument, according to the BBC report on the matter, appeared to centre around two primary causes of contention: Which faction did the most to secure victory over the United State and how power is to be divided up in the new Afghan cabinet.The two sides involvedThe brawl was between supporters of two rival and powerful factions within the Afghan administration:Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar: Deputy PM and the leader who signed the Doha agreement on behalf of the Taliban. He is believed to have fought the Soviets in the 80s side-by-side with the one-eyed cleric Mullah Omar, and was known to be one of his most trusted commanders. The two founded the Taliban in the early 1990s. He is believed to be unhappy about the structure of the interim government.Khalil ur-Rahman Haqqani: Minister for refugees and a prominent figure within the militant Haqqani network. He is the brother of Jalaluddin Haqqani, the founder of the Haqqani network, which yields great power and influence within the Taliban. He is also the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the new acting interior minister.Baradar is said to be of the opinion that post-Taliban victory, the emphasis should be placed on diplomacy carried out by people like him, while members of the Haqqani group say it was achieved through fighting. The two leaders reportedly exchanged strong words during the argument, following which their followers fought with each other nearby, the BBC reported.Rumours of Baradar's deathThe rumours around the fallout between the two sides gained traction late last week with the disappearance of Baradar from public view. This led to speculation that he may have died in the brawl. However, the BBC, citing unnamed Taliban sources, said Baradar had left Kabul and travelled to the city of Kandahar following the row.Baradar's faction released an audio recording of him on Monday, where the deputy PM said "he had been away on trips". "Wherever I am at the moment, we are all fine," he said.The official Taliban lineTaliban insisted there were no arguments or clashes. However, the statements released around the reason for Baradar's absence from public view appear to be contradicting.A Taliban spokesman first said Baradar had gone to Kandahar to meet the Taliban's elusive supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, but then when quizzed about by the BBC, the spokesperson said Baradar was "tired and wanted some rest".The timing of the face-offThe timing of the alleged spat appears significance because it follows delays in announcement of the final government, which will replace the current caretaker government. There is also speculation that one of the key reasons for the spat was the role of each faction under the new government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-bust-up-at-presidential-palace-in-afghanistan-what-really-happened-101631756383593.html

There is nothing between us, it is not true."The brief clip showed him seated on a sofa next to an interviewer with an RTA state television microphone, apparently reading from a sheet of paper."There is nothing to worry about," he said.Earlier, an official from the Taliban's cultural commission said on Twitter that the interview would be shown on RTA TV to disprove "enemy propaganda". Taliban officials have issued repeated denials in recent days that Baradar had been hurt.The denials follow days of rumours that supporters of Baradar had clashed with members of the Haqqani network, a group affiliated with the Taliban based near the border with Pakistan and blamed for some of the worst suicide attacks of the war.Baradar, one of the founding members of the Taliban and once seen as the likely head of a Taliban government, had not been seen in public for some time. He was not part of the ministerial delegation which met Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani in Kabul on Sunday.In the clip, he said he had been on a trip when the visit took place and had not been able to get back in time.On Wednesday, Anas Haqqani, younger brother of the Taliban's newly appointed Acting Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, also issued a statement on Twitter denying reports of internal rifts in the movement.The rumours follow speculation over rivalries between military commanders like Haqqani and leaders from the political office in Doha like Baradar, who led diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement with the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibans-baradar-says-reports-he-was-hurt-in-internal-clash-are-false-101631754398464.html

Airlines and other travel companies have pushed the administration to ease the restrictions, particularly on UK visitors.Separately, Anthony Fauci, the government's top expert on infectious disease, has said he would support a proposal to require vaccination for people on domestic flights.The airline industry is adamantly opposed to such a requirement, saying it would be difficult to enforce and could lead to long lines at airports. Industry officials say it would be unfair to single out air travelers with a mandate that would not affect people who travel by train, bus or car.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-working-on-new-covid-19-rules-for-international-visitors-101631750451863.html

16-09-2021||World||Tested railway-borne missile system to strike threatening forces: North Korea||The missiles fired by North Korea on Wednesday were a test of a new "railway-borne missile system" designed as a potential counter-strike to any forces that threaten the country, state news agency KCNA reported on Thursday.The missiles flew 800 km (497 miles) before striking a target in the sea off North Korea's east coast, KCNA said.On Wednesday, South Korean and Japanese authorities said they had detected the launch of two ballistic missiles from North Korea, just days after it tested a cruise missile that analysts said could have nuclear capabilities. The North Korean launches came the same day that South Korea tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) The two Koreas have been in an increasingly heated arms race, with both sides unveiling more capable missiles and other weapons.The tests by nuclear-armed North Korea drew international condemnation and concern, however, with the United States saying they violated UN Security Council resolutions and posed a threat to Pyongyang's neighbours.North Korea has been steadily developing its weapons systems, raising the stakes for stalled talks aimed at dismantling its nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals in return for US sanctions relief.The North Korean test was conducted by a railway-borne missile regiment that had been organised earlier this year, the KCNA report said."The railway-borne missile system serves as an efficient counter-strike means capable of dealing a harsh multi-concurrent blow to the threat-posing forces," said Pak Jong Chon, a North Korean marshal and member of the Presidium of the Politburo of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, who oversaw the test, according to KCNA.'CHEAP AND RELIABLE'Photos released by state media showed an olive-green missile rising on a column of smoke and flame from the roof of a train parked on tracks in a mountainous area.South Korea had reported the missiles were fired from the central inland area of Yangdok."Rail mobile missiles are a relatively cheap and reliable option for countries seeking to improve the survivability of their nuclear forces," Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, said on Twitter. "Russia did it. The US considered it. It makes a ton of sense for North Korea."Mount and other analysts said the system is likely constrained by North Korea's relatively limited and sometimes unreliable rail network, but that it could add another layer of complexity for a foreign military seeking to track and destroy the missiles before they are fired.According to KCNA, Pak said there are plans to expand the railway-borne missile regiment to a brigade-size force in the near future, and to conduct training to gain "operational experience for actual war."The army should prepare tactical plans for deploying the system in different parts of the country, Pak said.It is unusual to see the sheer variety in missile delivery systems and launch platforms that North Korea develops, said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace."It’s not very cost effective (especially for a sharply resource-constrained state) and far more operationally complex than a leaner, vertically integrated force," he said on Twitter.The railway system displayed on Wednesday could possibly set the stage for developing one capable of launching a larger, nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), Panda added.He also noted that some of the missile systems displayed by North Korea may be about “technology demonstration,” which may not be fully deployed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tested-railway-borne-missile-system-to-strike-threatening-forces-north-korea-101631747011941.html
16-09-2021||World||AUKUS: Biden announces Indo-Pacific alliance with UK, Australia to thwart China||President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that the United States is forming a new Indo-Pacific security alliance with Britain and Australia that will allow for greater sharing of defense capabilities — including helping equip Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. It's a move that could deepen a growing chasm in US-China relations.Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison appeared together virtually to detail the new alliance, which will be called AUKUS (pronounced AWK-us). The three announced they would quickly turn their attention to developing nuclear-powered submarines for Australia."We all recognize the imperative of ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term," said Biden, who said the new alliance reflects a broader trend of key European partners playing a role in the Indo-Pacific. “We need to be able to address both the current strategic environment in the region and how it may evolve.”The new security alliance is likely to be seen as a provocative move by China, which has repeatedly lashed out at Biden as he’s sought to refocus US foreign policy on the Pacific in the early going of his presidency.Before the announcement, a senior administration official sought to play down the idea that the alliance was meant to serve as a deterrent against China in the region. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the announcement, said the alliance’s creation was not aimed at any one country, and is about a larger effort to sustain engagement and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific by the three nations.Johnson said the alliance would allow the three English-speaking maritime democracies to strengthen their bonds and sharpen their focus on an increasingly complicated part of the world.“We will have a new opportunity to reinforce Britain’s place at the leading edge of science and technology, strengthening our national expertise, and perhaps most significant, the U.K., Australia and the US will be joined even more closely together, " Johnson said.The three countries have agreed to share information in areas including artificial intelligence, cyber and underwater defense capabilities.But plans to support Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines are certain to catch Beijing's attention. To date, the only country that the United States has shared nuclear propulsion technology with is Britain. Morrison said Australia is not seeking to develop a nuclear weapons program and information sharing would be limited to helping it develop a submarine fleet.The Australian prime minister said plans for the nuclear-powered submarines would be developed over the next 18 months and the vessels would be built in Adelaide, Australia.Australia had announced in 2016 that French company DCNS had beat out bidders from Japan and Germany to build the next generation of submarines in Australia’s largest-ever defense contract. It was not immediately clear what the new alliance would mean for the deal with the French defense contractor.Morrison said the three countries had “always seen through a similar lens,” but, as the world becomes more complex, “to meet these new challenges, to help deliver the security and stability our region needs, we must now take our partnership to a new level.”Matt Pottinger, who served as deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration, said that equipping Australia with nuclear-powered submarines was a significant step that would help the US and its allies on the military and diplomatic fronts.Underwater warfare capabilities have been Beijing’s "Achilles' heel,” Pottinger said. A nuclear-powered submarine fleet would allow Australia to conduct longer patrols, giving the new alliance a stronger presence in the region.“When you have a strong military, it provides a backdrop of deterrence that gives countries the confidence to resist bullying,” said Pottinger, who is now a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. “Part of the problem right now is that Beijing has gotten rather arrogant and it’s been less willing to engage productively in diplomacy.”The announcement of the new security alliance comes as the US-China relationship has deteriorated. Beijing has taken exception to Biden administration officials repeatedly calling out China over human rights abuses in Xianjing province, the crackdown on democracy activists in Hong Kong, and cybersecurity breaches originating from China, as well as Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and what the White House has labeled as “coercive and unfair” trade practices.Even as White House officials have repeatedly spoken out about China, administration officials say they want to work with Beijing on areas of common interest, including curbing the pandemic and climate change.Biden spoke by phone with China’s President Xi Jinping last week amid growing frustration on the American side that high-level engagement between the two leaders’ top advisers has been largely unfruitful.After the 90-minute phone call, official Xinhua News Agency reported that Xi expressed concerns that US government policy toward China has caused “serious difficulties” in relations.Asked on Tuesday about media reports that Xi had declined to commit to meet with him in person, the US president said it was “untrue.” Biden did not speak in “specific terms” about the new AUKUS alliance during last week's call with the Chinese leader, according to the senior administration official.The US and Australia, along with India and Japan, are members of a strategic dialogue known as “the Quad.” Biden is set to host fellow Quad leaders at the White House next week.Biden has sought to rally allies to speak with a more unified voice on China and has tried to send the message that he would take a radically different approach to China than former President Donald Trump, who placed trade and economic issues above all else in the US-China relationship.In June, at Biden's urging, Group of Seven nations called on China to respect human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang province and to permit a full probe into the origins of COVID-19. While the allies broadly agreed to work toward competing against China, there was less unity on how adversarial a public position the group should take.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aukus-biden-announces-indo-pacific-alliance-with-uk-australia-to-thwart-china-101631746611253.html

Asked about this issue, Bagchi replied, “I am given to understand that he is an Indian citizen but we are also checking that part.”He declined to go into details, citing the sensitivity of the matter and security concerns. Bagchi said a majority of Indian nationals in Afghanistan had been evacuated since the Taliban takeover of Kabul, though some were still in the country. The Indian side is still in touch with these people who were unable to return after operations at Kabul airport were suspended, he said. India has also raised the safe return of all those who wish to leave Afghanistan with the international community, and UN Security Council resolution 2593 emphasises the issue of safe travel by Afghan nationals and minorities, he said. “This is an important issue,” Bagchi said. There were reports that Arendeh’s family lives in Faridabad and that he was running a business in Kabul for the past two decades.Bagchi said in response to another question that it would be difficult to say anything definitive about the evacuation of the remaining Indians in Afghanistan and Afghan nationals till commercial flights resume from Kabul airport.“Our focus is that operations at Kabul airport resume. Then, it will be easier for us to bring back the people,” he said.It is believed that several dozen Indian citizens are still in Afghanistan. More than 140 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were also barred by the Taliban from accessing Kabul airport to take the last evacuation flight last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-touch-with-afghan-officials-over-reports-of-abduction-of-indian-mea-101631816351322.html
16-09-2021||India||Virat Kohli to step down as T20 captain after World Cup||Mumbai Virat Kohli on Thursday announced that the upcoming Twenty20 World Cup in UAE will be his last as India’s captain in the format, capping weeks of speculation over the possibility of splitting the leadership of the national team.The announcement, made by Kohli on social media, came exactly a month before the tournament begins, and three days before the restart of the Indian Premier League (IPL), where Kohli captains the Royal Challengers Bangalore. “Understanding workload is a very important thing and considering my immense workload over the last 8-9 years playing all 3 formats and captaining regularly for last 5-6 years, I feel I need to give myself space to be fully ready to lead the Indian team in Test and ODI Cricket,” Kohli said in his statement. “I have given everything to the Team during my time as T20 Captain and I will continue to do so for the T20 Team as a batsman moving forward... Of course, arriving at this decision took a lot of time... I’ve decided to step down as the T20 Captain after this T20 World Cup in Dubai in October,” Kohli said in the statement. Kohli mentioned Rohit Sharma as “an essential part of the leadership group” and as one of the people he consulted before taking the call amid speculation that the latter will take over as captain. People aware of the matter said that Kohli called the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah to inform them of his decision. “I have been in discussions with Virat and the leadership team for the last six months and the decision has been thought through,” Shah said in a statement. Yet, only a few days back, BCCI officials denied reports that Kohli would step down after the World Cup. Kohli making the announcement on social media before the BCCI put out an official statement added to the intrigue. Also, while Kohli said in his statement that he took the decision feeling the need to give himself “space to be fully ready to lead Indian team in Test and ODI cricket”, Shah in his BCCI statement an hour later pointedly did not mention Kohli as Test or ODI captain: “Virat will continue to contribute as a player and as a senior member of the side in shaping the future course of Indian cricket,” Shah said. Board officials say leadership roles in other formats will now be decided by the selectors. “That’s the way it always is. The selectors will decide after the World Cup,” Sourav Ganguly said. Ganguly said he got a call from Kohli minutes before he made the announcement. “He told me this evening. I told him if that’s what he wanted, fair enough,” Ganguly said. Sharma, who has already led India in 19 T20s with great success, and has won an unmatched five IPL titles in eight seasons with Mumbai Indians, is the clear favourite to lead in the shortest format. Kohli saying that he discussed his decision with Sharma was in sharp contrast with the scenario two years ago, when there were reports of a rift between the two players. In 2020, senior BCCI officials had talks with the two players to ensure that there would be no division within the team, according an official who did not wish to be named. “Kohli was told that so long as he delivered as captain, he would remain in charge,” the official said. “Sharma was told that the captainship will happen when it has to happen.” When cricket resumed after the pandemic-induced lockdowns late last year, Sharma and Kohli seemed to have put their differences behind them. While Sharma has found new and unprecedented success as a Test opener, Kohli’s form as a batsman has been wobbly over the past several months. Kohli’s decision also comes a few weeks after reports that Ravi Shastri will step down as India’s head coach after the T20 World Cup, and just days after the BCCI decided that former captain MS Dhoni will be part of the coaching staff as a “mentor” at the World Cup. Will this flux affect team morale heading into a major ICC event? “I don’t think it will,” said Ganguly. “They are mature enough to handle these things.” Kohli’s record as India’s T20 captain is impressive. He took charge in 2017 after Dhoni stepped down, and has won 27 of the 45 T20s in which he has led India. His form with the bat too has been great — as captain, he has 1,502 runs at an average of 48.45 and a strike rate of 143.18. This makes him not just the highest run getter in T20s for India in this period, but also the third highest in the world. However, at ICC events across formats, Kohli’s lack of a title has seen the pressure on his captaincy build: India lost the inaugural World Test Championship to New Zealand in June, the final of the 2017 Champions Trophy to Pakistan, and lost in the semi-final at the 2019 ODI World Cup.The 2021 edition will be the first T20 World Cup in which Kohli will lead India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virat-kohli-to-step-down-as-t20-captain-after-world-cup-101631816349378.html
16-09-2021||India||Ahead of PM’s visit, India concerned about activities of Khalistani groups in US||India on Thursday expressed concern over a reported increase in activities by Pakistan-backed Khalistani separatist groups from US soil ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington for several crucial meetings next week. Ensuring security for the prime minister and his delegation is an important issue, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly news briefing, in response to questions on reports that a banned Khalistani group had planned to organise protests in Washington and New York during Modi’s visit. “I do not know about the specific call given by the banned outfit. I am not going to comment on that. But we certainly take a lot of interest in ensuring the security of the prime minister and his delegation,” he said. Pointing to a new report by the think tank Hudson Institute about the spike in activities of Khalistani groups with apparent backing from Islamabad, Bagchi said this reflects Pakistan’s efforts to undertake activities against India from US soil. “We convey and share (this) with the host country – in this case, the US. If the organisation is banned, it should not be undertaking these kinds of activities,” he added. The issue was less about protests and more about security, Bagchi said. The organisations behind the protests had “problems in the past in terms of terrorist activities”, he said, without going into details. The Hudson Institute’s report makes it clear that Pakistan was continuing with its efforts to carry out anti-India activities, including terrorism. “I do hope authorities in the US will see that and understand the risks that this kind of activity poses for countries that have a shared vision against terrorism and violence,” Bagchi said. The think tank’s report said Pakistan-backed Khalistani groups, which are proscribed by India, are quietly gaining ground in the US and the American administration has been indifferent to appeals made by New Delhi to curb their operations. US-based Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) was banned by India in 2019 for its alleged anti-national activities. Modi will be in the US next week to participate in the maiden in-person summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad in Washington on September 24 and to address the UN General Assembly the following day. He is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with the leaders of Quad states – Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and US President Joe Biden. The Quad Summit is expected to focus on the situation in Afghanistan, measures to boost the grouping’s ambitious vaccine partnership that seeks to distribute one billion doses of anti-Covid-19 shots across the Indo-Pacific and China’s assertive actions across the region. The Biden administration is hosting the Quad Summit to send a signal that it remains a key player on the global stage, especially after widespread criticism of its handling of the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-pm-s-visit-india-concerned-about-activities-of-khalistani-groups-in-us-101631815749919.html

Amrinder Singh's government supported the bill, the state government just asked the Centre to rethink the state revenue issue."He also said, "Shiromani Akali Dal was the only party who voted against the laws in parliament when congress and other parties walked out. This is on record."Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday attacked the Badals, accusing them of laying the foundation of the Centre's farm laws over which farmers are protesting for the past several months.The Congress leader alleged that one of the Centre's laws is a "photostat copy" of the Punjab Contract Farming Act, 2013 enacted during the previous SAD-BJP government led by Parkash Singh Badal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sad-to-hold-protest-march-to-parliament-demanding-repeal-of-farm-laws-on-sept-17-101631810730416.html
16-09-2021||India||PM Modi’s 71st birthday: Record Covid-19 vaccination, 20-day outreach programme among BJP’s agenda||The Bharatiya Janata Party is planning to achieve record Covid-19 vaccinations on September 17, the occasion of the 71st birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a day which the party has been celebrating as ‘Seva Diwas’ (Day of service) since 2014. The celebrations usually last a week. However, this year, in view of Modi’s 20 years in public life, his days as the chief minister of Gujarat included, the party’s outreach programme has been extended to a 20-day celebration.As part of its celebrations, the BJP has pitched record Covid-19 vaccinations on the day as its major agenda. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday called on the people to get themselves vaccinated and also help others who are yet to receive their shots. “This would be a birthday gift for the prime minister,” Mandaviya said.‘सबको वैक्सीन, मुफ़्त वैक्सीन’ की PM @NarendraModi जी ने देश को सौग़ात दी है!कल हम सबके प्रिय प्रधानमंत्री जी का जन्मदिन है, चलो #VaccineSeva कर जिन्होंने वैक्सीन नहीं ली है, ऐसे अपनों को, परिजनों को और समाज के सभी तबकों को टीका लगवाकर, उनको जन्मदिन का उपहार देते हैं।The number of vaccinations that the BJP is aiming for is 1.5 crore doses on the day, news agency ANI reported quoting a senior BJP leader. While the country has managed to administer over 10 million doses in a single day at least two times earlier, the party’s national president JP Nadda had previously said that booth workers and health volunteers would assist in the vaccination drive on the day.Other celebrationsApart from the vaccinations, the BJP has also planned to distribute 14 crore ration bags with the picture of Modi printed on them to the people. Also, on October 2, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, BJP workers will lead a large-scale cleanliness drive and also a campaign to encourage the use of Khadi and local products. The celebrations beginning on September 17 will continue till October 7.Further, BJP booth workers will send five crore postcards to the PM highlighting their commitment to public service.State BJP units chip inMadhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra are among some states where the BJP units have planned Covid-19 vaccination drives. MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan has planned the third ‘Maha Vaccination Abhiyan’ in his state on September 17 while the Karnataka government has planned a blood-donation campaign along with the vaccination drive.Similar celebrations have also been planned by the Maharashtra BJP, which would be inaugurated by former CM and the current leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. An awareness campaign on plastic would also be conducted by the Maharashtra unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-71st-birthday-record-covid-19-vaccination-20-day-outreach-programme-among-bjp-s-agenda-101631810199732.html

16-09-2021||India||NIA begins probing blast outside Bengal BJP MP Arjun Singh’s house||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday started probing the recent bomb blasts outside the residence of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Arjun Singh at Bhatpara in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district. Singh, who represents the local Barrackpore Lok Sabha constituency, said he gave his statement to NIA officers. The Union home ministry on Monday asked the NIA to probe the September 8 bomb attack outside Singh’s residence. Another crude bomb went off near his house around 9 am on Tuesday. The Centre has asked the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to provide security for Singh in view of these incidents although all central armed police personnel deployed to protect BJP leaders in Bengal were recently withdrawn and the state government was asked to take over the responsibility. Led by a deputy inspector general of police, a 10-member team of the NIA reached Singh’s residence on Thursday afternoon and carried out forensic tests at the locations where the bombs had gone off. The officers also recorded the statements of Singh and his son Pawan, the local BJP legislator. “Two NIA officers talked to me. I told them how my home has been targeted,” said Singh. The MP and his son have alleged in their police complaints that these were attempts to kill them. The NIA team also went to the office of the Barrackpore police commissioner. Officers from Bhatpara police station earlier said that the bomb that went off on Tuesday was lying on the ground near a wall. Arjun Singh left the Trinamool Congress (TMC) prior to the 2019 polls that witnessed several political clashes in the Barrackpore region. Singh, who was then the legislator from Bhatpara, bagged the Barrackpore seat by defeating the TMC’s sitting MP Dinesh Trivedi. The violence, however, did not end. On September 8, at least three crude bombs were hurled by miscreants outside Singh’s residence. Eyewitnesses told police that two bombs hit the main gate of the house while a third landed inside the premises. The MP was not at home and no one was injured. Police arrested two people in this connection. Singh is also the BJP’s observer for the Bhawanipore assembly bypoll in Kolkata where chief minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-begins-probing-blast-outside-bengal-bjp-mp-arjun-singh-s-house-101631805668977.html

16-09-2021||India||‘Difficult to say how people will be evacuated until Kabul airport resumes’: MEA||The Union ministry of external affairs on Thursday said that it would be difficult to say how people would be evacuated from Afghanistan until the Kabul international airport resumes operations. Mentioning that the evacuations would be easier once the airport starts running again, the ministry said that it is watching the situation in Afghanistan to bring back the Indians and Afghan nationals willing to come.“Until and unless ops resume at Kabul airport, it will be difficult to say how people will be evacuated. It will be easier once the operations resume. We are watching this, so that the remaining Indians and Afghans willing to come can be brought here,” news agency ANI quoted the ministry’s spokesperson Arindam Bagchi as saying.In its last update on August 27, the ministry had said that over 550 people, including more than 260 Indians, were evacuated from Afghanistan by India under the operation Devi Shakti. The airlift was carried out in six separate flights either from Kabul or Dushanbe. Bagchi had said that the number was excluding the Indian embassy personnel who were also being evacuated simultaneously. Further, Indian nationals were also evacuated through other “countries and partners,” he said. The ministry had also said that its focus was on evacuating Indian nationals from Afghanistan.The US took control of the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul following the Taliban’s rapid takeover of Afghanistan and the capital city. Earlier this month, the first international commercial flight, following the pull-out of US troops, left Kabul with 113 passengers comprising US and UK citizens among several other nationals, news agency Reuters reported.So far more than 120,000 people were taken out of Afghanistan by the US and allied nations since the Taliban began their takeover. On August 31, US President Joe Biden said that his administration had estimated between 100 and 200 citizens left in Afghanistan and had assured them they would be evacuated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/difficult-to-say-how-people-will-be-evacuated-until-kabul-airport-resumes-mea-101631802362233.html
16-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: 1959 — Crowds throng to see first TV show||Television came to India on Tuesday when the President, Dr Rajendra Prasad, formally inaugurated from the auditorium of the Vigyan Bhavan the first TV station set up by All India Radio in New Delhi. Thousands of men, women and children in Delhi and the adjoining villages witnessed the inauguration through nearly two dozen sets installed by the Government and a commercial concern. At places the crowds were so thick that those in charge of the installations had a hard time maintaining order. At the Social Education Centre in Paharganj the crowd became unwieldy and all doors had to be closed. Later the police had to be called in to prevent the crowd from crashing in. Nearly a thousand people witnessed the programme through a set installed at the Community Hall on Panchkuin Road. They sat in pin-drop silence, but when the sound mechanism temporarily stopped functioning, once or twice, they shouted and booed.Judging from the reactions of the audience, what seemed to have attracted them was the novelty of the show rather than any particular interest in the programme. Some at least expressed great disappointment and said they felt bored. Some wanted more songs and dances than dialogue.” There is too much of talk and little action,” said a middle-aged officegoer who was witnessing the programme along with his wife and two children. But for two scooter-rickshaw-drivers it was more attractive than business. They refused hirers to listen to the programme. In his inaugural speech, the President said that the launching of television marked “ a significant stage in the progress of broadcasting and tele-communications in India.” He said, “I remember what an excitement it caused when broadcasting was introduced in this country. One can well imagine how much more intriguing this new medium of mass contact would be to the common people in India.” He expressed the hope that television, apart from its cultural value “will go a long way in broadening the popular outlook, and bringing people in line with scientific thinking.”Welcoming the President, Dr B. V. Keskar, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, said the opening of a television station in the country was “a fitting climax to the all-round and continuous development” of Indian broadcasting.” Television as a means of mass communication, said Dr Keskar, was decidedly superior and more effectively than radio, because it was audio-visual. But the Minister cautioned against the medium becoming undesirable at a later stage. “It would be disastrous to allow it to distort the study habits of children,” he said. Dr Keskar said that because of foreign exchange difficulties, it was possible only to begin television service in the country on a small scale and warned that it might continue to be so for some more time. He, however, held out the hope that it would be possible to expand the service further during the third Five-Year Plan. Mr J. C. Mathur, Director-General of All India Radio, regretted that the people of Old Delhi were deprived of the facility of viewing television programmes in public as no sets could be installed partly due to technical and partly administrative difficulties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crowds-throng-to-see-first-tv-show-101631802549339.html
16-09-2021||India||PM Modi opens new defence offices, takes a dig at Central Vista revamp critics||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday took a dig at critics of the ambitious Central Vista revamp plan, saying that they are likely to ignore the good coming out of the project because their agenda is only to spread lies about what the government is doing. Modi’s comments came during the inauguration of defence office complexes at Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue that will together accommodate more than 7,000 defence officials. These officials are moving into the new offices from their decades-old workplaces in a clutch of pre-Independence era hutments in the vicinity of the North and South Blocks to make way for the Central Vista revamp. Some of these hutments served as barracks and as stables for British Army horses more than 75 years ago. “Those people who are forcefully opposing the Central Vista project will very cleverly stay quite on this aspect of project that offices have been created for 7,000 defence officials, because they know that their agenda of spreading lies will be exposed. But today the country is seeing what we are doing under the project,” the PM said. The total cost of the Central Vista revamp is estimated to be around ₹20,000 crore. The redevelopment has been criticised by the Opposition as wasteful expenditure at a time when the country is battling the Covid-19 pandemic. Addressing a gathering of defence officials at the Africa Avenue complex, the PM said that with the inauguration of the two complexes, India has taken another step in developing the nation’s capital according to the needs and aspirations of a new India in the country’s 75th year of India’s independence. He said that for decades, defence-related work was being carried out from hutments constructed during the Second World War to serve as stables and barracks. “This new defence office complex will strengthen the efforts of making the working of our defence forces convenient and effective,” he said. He said work on the two complexes has been completed way ahead of time --- it was to be completed in 24 months but took only 12 months. “When policies and intentions are clear, willpower is strong and efforts honest, everything is possible,” the PM said, adding that modern infrastructure played an important role in ease of living and ease of doing business. “The ongoing construction work of Central Vista is going on with this thought only,” he said. Optimal use of available land with various departments of the government was a priority, he said. The complex at Africa Avenue is spread across four blocks and offers a space of 5.08 lakh square feet while the KG Marg facility has three blocks and an office area of 4.52 lakh square feet. The new office complexes have been constructed at a cost of ₹775 crore provided by the defence ministry, with the work carried out by the ministry of housing and urban affairs as part of the Central Vista project. The two complexes together have parking space for 1,500 cars. According to the Central Vista plan approved by the Centre, the North and South Block office complexes will be turned into national museums, the Indira Gandhi National Centre will be relocated, and the National Archives will be remodelled.

16-09-2021||India||‘No trick of trade in healthcare; it’s reading, updating’: Dr Dang at HTNxt||The Indian diagnostic industry has been rapidly evolving over the years and has emerged to be the key component of the healthcare segment. Dr Dangs Lab has been a pioneering testing centre catering to patients for over three decades.Set up in Delhi in 1985, by Dr Navin Dang, at a time when the national capital had only a handful of private hospitals and the concept of an interactive diagnostic laboratory was unheard of, Dang Lab has had many firsts.It is among the first three labs to have started testing for H1N1 (swine flu) in 2009 and one of the first few private laboratories in Delhi to get permission to test samples for coronavirus.Dr Navin Dang, the director of Dangs Lab, and his CEO son, Dr Arjun Dang, offered insight into the diagnostics sector in HTNxt, a first-of-its-kind platform that is bringing together the Next-Gen leaders & newsmakers to discuss pertinent issues and offer innovative solutions for a better tomorrow.The father-son duo brought to fore two different perspectives from separate generations in the field of healthcare diagnostics.Mint’s Neetu Chandra Sharma asked the senior Dr Dang what motivated him, an alumnus of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, to become an entrepreneur than continuing in the conventional healthcare sector.“I was working with the AIIMS at that time. Those were the days when a lab was considered to be a place where samples would come, be processed and the reports sent back to the hospitals. The samples were collected from the hospital wards of the patients. There was no interaction with the patients,” Dr Navin Dang said, adding, “At that time in Delhi there were only four private hospitals and only a handful of labs. The demand for diagnostic tests was increasing, but it would take a long time for the reports to be ready. That’s not what I liked.”ALSO READ | How to create a successful startup? Learn from these women entrepreneursThe senior doctor said that he saw a vacuum in the diagnostics sector and found the role it played to be inadequate. “With the perception that I will be able to prove better services, better turnaround times for the tests; and that I will be able to interact with the patients and doctors, and empower them to take timely medical decisions, I started the Dangs Lab,” he said.However, the path was fraught with challenges. The senior Dr Dang said when the H1N1 virus struck in 2009, the then chief minister had called a handful of private labs and asked how many of them can start testing the samples for the infection.“To be very honest, I had no clue. But I knew that I could do it by investing and by studying and learning. I told the chief minister that I can do it in 15 days. The same evening, I was called to the national television where I repeated the same statement,” Dr Navin Dang said.“From ordering the equipment and with the help of my team, I took this endeavour with the help of my teachers and the NCDC and all others I could seek help from. Within 15 days I set up one of the best molecular biology labs in the city and started the tests from 16th day onwards,” he added.The doctor who authored many research papers in international journals and has been part of various government-appointed committees said there’s nothing called the trick of the trade in the field of healthcare. “It is knowing the trade, and you can only know by reading and studying, and keeping yourself abreast with the latest technology,” he said.“Doctors are doctors as long as they are students. Doctors should know how to say I don’t know,” the senior doctor said.The senior doctor’s son, Dr Arjun Dang, carried on the legacy by becoming the CEO of the Dr Dangs Lab upon his return from London in 2016. He is also accredited for setting up India’s first drive-through centre for sample collection of Covid-19 patientsHe said when he was in London pursuing his fellowship in pathology two distinct paths lay in front of him. “One was to continue in the UK and the other was coming back to carry forward this legacy, which is a lab known for its unparalleled quality and patient care, the bases of which were based on protocols and processes laid down by my own parent. I chose to take the latter path knowing I will have big shoes to fill in, but with a crystal-clear aim to make a difference,” Dr Arjun said.The young doctor said echoed his father’s views that there is no dearth of learning in the field of diagnostic healthcare.“Ever since last year in March when we started testing and the pandemic came to India, we’ve had a learning that has been a constant. With the science behind the virus itself evolving, on a weekly or a daily basis, it required a lot of learning, re-learning and recalibration processes, thinking and then putting forward our best,” Dr Arjun explained.ALSO READ | 'Be wild, have audacious plans': Naveen Tewari's mantra for entrepreneursLaboratory medicine today is an established field. There are several players thriving across India. But what was the scenario when Dr Dang Lab was started?“Those days diagnostic was considered to be a hole in the wall kind of speciality. I tried my best to change the whole thing, by bringing quality tests, increasing the variety of tests which were there and bringing in automation,” Dr Navin Dang said.The senior doctor said the patients have now become extremely conscious of the quality adherence. “Unfortunately, in the past one-and-a-half years we have seen a paradigm shift in the way there is so much teleconsultation going on. If the patients are not meeting the doctors how do reach a decision that is dependent upon what the doctors find," he said.However, the junior Dr Dang differs from his father as far as the technological shift is concerned. He stressed that the labs must aim to build a huge online presence and provide the patients with increased accessibility and good user experience — from the time of booking till the time they get their reports and assistance to understand the reports.The laboratories today have brought diagnostics to the doorstep of the consumers, which is keeping pace with teleconsultations with doctors. The Indian laboratory diagnostic industry is estimated at $6 billion is growing at a very healthy rate of 13-14% per annum. Dr Arjun Dang said his focus is on 3Ps — patience, passion and perseverance — to stay ahead of the curve in the cut-throat market of competitors. “It is a constant process that would require us to stay updated and abreast with latest technologies, new practices all over the world and what is happening in the diagnostic segment, and read on a constant basis so we can adapt to these new technologies and train our teams,” Dr Arjun Dang explained.“We need to focus on the granular details that provide value to a particular patient. Value over volume is something that has been going on for many years, and I am here to take it forward to the best of my abilities," he added.HTNxT, a thought leadership programme, is being held virtually for the first time. The theme for the inaugural year is 'Leading the change'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-trick-of-trade-in-healthcare-it-s-reading-updating-dr-dang-on-htnxt-101631798824046.html
16-09-2021||India||Ex-AIADMK minister Veermani raided; FIR says his assets 650% more than income||CHENNAI: Officials of Tamil Nadu’s Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) carried out searches at 28 locations linked to former AIADMK minister KC Veeramani on charges of assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.Veeramani is the third leader of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) to face a corruption probe after MK Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government came to power in May this year. Veeramani hasn’t spoken on the corruption charges levelled against him but his supporters promptly gathered outside his house to protest the raids. His party also issued a statement, complaining that the raids were prompted by “political vendetta”.The First Information Report (FIR) registered by DVAC on Wednesday said Veeramani was “involved in corrupt activities” and acquired assets disproportionate to his income by 654 per cent between 2016 and 2021 when he was a minister of commercial taxes in the AIADMK government.“Searches are ongoing in 28 places across the state and including four in Chennai,” a senior DVAC official said on conditions of anonymity, as he is not authorised to speak to the media.The two-time legislator won the 2011 and 20116 assembly elections from the Jolarpet seat in Tirupathur district 200 km north of Chennai. KC Veermani, however, lost the seat to his DMK rival in this year’s assembly elections by a little less than 1,100 votes.Arappor Iyakkam, a non-profit which first filed a complaint against Veeramani, alleged that the AIADMK leader started indulging in corruption in 2011 when he first became a minister in the J Jayalalithaa government and oversaw departments of school education and Tamil culture apart from holding additional charge as health minister.It estimated that he holds disproportionate assets worth ₹76 crore between 2011 and 2021.In the FIR, the DVAC said investigators decided to focus on his second term since he held a charge of the sensitive commercial taxes department. During this period, his assets increased from ₹25.9 crore to ₹56.6 crore with his income estimated to be ₹4.3 crore and expenses at ₹2.56 crore, the FIR said.The FIR said Veermani acquired properties and pecuniary resources in his name and in the name of his mother, C Maniyamal.The FIR, which accuses him of criminal misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act, said he was estimated to have acquired assets worth ₹28.7 crore, “which works out to be 654% more than his total income.The AIADMK has already formed an internal legal committee to help party leaders fight cases registered against him by the DMK government. Former transport minister MR Vijayabhaskar was the first prominent AIADMK leader to be raided by the DVAC team in July this year. DVAC officials had then claimed to have seized ₹25.5 lakh in cash, sale deeds, and other documents.In August, DVAC went after AIADMK heavyweight and former municipal administration minister SP Velumani, who is known to be close to former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami.Last year, the DMK, while still in the opposition, submitted a list of corruption charges to outgoing Governor Banwrilal Purohit against half a dozen AIADMK ministers, and later in the runup to the assembly elections, promised to establish a special court to try such graft cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exaiadmk-minister-veermani-raided-fir-says-his-assets-650-more-than-income-101631797508714.html

She noted that the banking reforms have turned losses into profits.“In 2018, just two out of 21 public sector banks were profitable. But in 2021, only two banks reported losses,” she said.NARCL has been set up by banks to aggregate and consolidate stressed assets for their subsequent resolution. While there are existing asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), the government suggests that they have been helpful in the resolution of stressed assets particularly for smaller value loans.According to the finance ministry, additional alternatives are required due to the large stock of legacy NPAs. The Central government's guarantee of up to ₹30,600 crore will back Security Receipts (SRs) issued by NARCL and the guarantee will be valid for five years."I had announced in Budget 2021-22 with an intention to set up an asset reconstruction company and an asset management company to take over the existing stressed assets like loans," Sitharaman said.The government also announced the setting up of India Debt Resolution Company Limited in which the public sector banks and public financial institutions will have a maximum of 49% stake while the rest will be for private players. PSBs will also have 51% ownership in NARCL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-approves-govt-guarantee-up-to-30-600-cr-for-bad-bank-101631794740796.html
16-09-2021||India||Timely surgery along with antifungal medicines lifesaving for mucormycosis patients||Timely surgery along with administration of antifungal medicines significantly reduced mortality in patients with Covid-19 Associated Mucormycosis (CAM), found a pre-print study of 155 patients by doctors from Max Hospital-Saket. The hospital recorded 11.9% mortality among those who received surgical intervention along with drugs as compared to 50% in those who did not receive surgery. The age of the patient also significantly co-related to whether they survived, with the hospital recording 9.8% mortality in those below the age of 45 years and 40% mortality in those above the age of 75 years. The data from the hospital shows that diabetes and use of steroid for the treatment of the underlying coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were significant risk factors for getting the fungal infection – 91.6% of the patients had a history of use of steroid and 78.7% had diabetes. The severity of Covid-19 was also a risk factor – 73.6% of the patients who came back with mucormycosis needed hospitalisation for their initial Covid-19. “We need to understand that mucormycosis is not a new disease; diabetes and use of steroids that can suppress the immune system are known risk factors. In addition, Covid-19 also increases the risk of the infection. Ferritin level are high in Covid-19 patients; ferritin contains iron which also predisposes people to mucormycosis,” said Dr Budhiraja. However, the mortality did not depend on the diabetes status or steroid use, as per the study that was recently uploaded on the pre-print server Medrxiv. “The two things that save a CAM patient are early diagnosis and aggressive treatment. Surgeries saved lives. What we realised was that medical management – by only administering antifungal medicines – resulted in higher mortality. If you see the data, over 70% of the patients who developed mucormycosis were diabetics and we had to determine whether they should undergo surgery. 135 of the 155 patients included in our study underwent surgery,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, first author of the paper and the clinical director of Max healthcare. Higher deaths were reported in patients who were in intensive care units as opposed to wards; and in those who were on mechanical ventilators as opposed to non-invasive ventilators. “This is a natural co-relation; ICU admission and need for mechanical ventilation are indicative of the severity of the disease. Most patients recovered from Covid-19 and reached the hospital with mucormycosis on an average three weeks later,” said Dr Budhiraja. Only 18 of the 155 patients had simultaneous Covid-19 and mucormycosis infections. Mortality was also high – 50% -- in disseminated mucormycosis, where the patient had the infection in their sinus as well as lungs. Nearly 9.9% mortality was reported in patients who had the infection only in their nose, 23.9% in those with the infection in their nose and eye, and 18.2% in those with infection in their nose, eye, and brain. Mucormycosis is a rare and deadly fungal infection that usually happens in immunocompromised patients such as those who have cancer or have had transplant surgery. It usually happens in the nose and eye and results in death of tissue resulting in a black discolouration. Surgery for mucormycosis removed this necrotised or dead tissue. If left untreated, the infection can kill nearly half of those it infects. The Max study, however, put the average mortality in patients with CAM at 16.8%. Dr Budhiraja also said none of the 155 patients were from their hospital but had been referred from other hospitals and states. “It is clear that those who had extensive disease had poorer outcome. Around 40 of the patients came to us with extensive spread of the disease – there was a delay not only in reporting to hospitals but also in starting treatment with antifungals due to shortage of Amphotericin B at the time,” said Dr Budhiraja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timely-surgery-along-with-antifungal-medicines-lifesaving-for-mucormycosis-patients-101631796668436.html

And after our conversation, I want to condemn these ongoing speculations. He is the youngest member of our national executive and as asset for the party,” Raja told HT.But a section of the party is sceptical as Kumar, arguably the most poplar CPI leader among the young people, has remained silent about the rumours on public platforms. He has met Rahul Gandhi recently—a step widely seen as a precursor to his joining of the Congress party.Raja, however, defended Kumar and said, “He is a member of our national executive (equivalent to CPIM politburo). He is free to meet any political leader. Would you speculate if he meets Sitaram Yechury? Earlier, he has met other political leaders too.”Raja and Kumar met at the Ajoy Bhawan, the CPI headquarters in New Delhi.Also Read | Kanhaiya trashes talks of joining CongressIn the last election, Kumar was the CPI candidate in Begusarai but lost the election. His popularity soared during his tenure as the president of the JNU students union even as he courted major controversies.CPI leaders claimed that Kumar has refuted the speculations in his personal meetings with CPI leaders. He has been appointed in the central executive of the party and is currently its youngest member of the top executive body. But some Congress leaders are hopeful that Kumar will join the party at some point. The Congress also requires a young, dynamic leader in Bihar where its political fortunes have plummeted over the years.Meanwhile, CPI MP Binoy Viswam claimed that the news on Kumar is nothing but fake. “He called me just now, from Ajoy Bhawan. He is the NEC member of the party who is deeply committed to the communist cause,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draja-meets-kanhaiya-kumar-rubbishes-reports-of-latter-joining-congress-101631796008263.html
16-09-2021||India||Hard to justify not having physical courts when schools, malls are open: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday said that the absence of having physical courts is hard to justify at a time when schools, malls and metro rail have opened.Not finding senior lawyers coming to the Supreme Court despite standard operating procedure (SOP) put in place to permit hybrid hearing (physical and virtual hearing) of cases on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursday, two separate benches of the Supreme Court expressed their angst with one saying in a lighter vein that “mandamus (order) needs to be issued to enforce physical presence of lawyers” while another bench giving priority for listing of case for those lawyers who agreed to appear physically.The bench of justices Vineet Saran and Aniruddha Bose said, “Schools are open, malls are open, and the Metro rail is open. How do you justify that only the Supreme Court is not open. How do you justify that you will go to the market but not come to the Court. We (judges) are coming every day to court.”The bench went on to post two matters on September 23 and 30 asking lawyers appearing in the case to appear physically. “Most of the regular matters listed before us are lengthy matters that require physical arguments. We are also missing seeing lawyers face to face. We will be there to welcome you openly. Even the lighter moments during arguments are missing during virtual hearing,” the bench remarked.Earlier in the day, another bench of the Supreme Court felt that lawyers should begin to come to court. A bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari said, “It seems we have to issue a writ of mandamus to ensure lawyers appear in court.”The remark evoked frank responses from three senior lawyers – Dushyant Dave, Ranjit Kumar and C Aryama Sundaram, who had their own reasons to avoid coming to court. Dave, a former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association was candid in stating that the SOP issued by Supreme Court for beginning hybrid hearing from September 1 was passed without consulting lawyers.Also Read | Will give report in a month, says panel probing Jayalalithaa’s death to SC“The registry of the Supreme Court has issued the SOP ex-parte (without hearing the other side). They should have consulted the Bar. We too are anxious to attend the court,” Dave said.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar was forthright to expose the lacunae in the SOP that required lawyers to obtain a Special Entry pass for each case, wait in the library and enter courtroom just before the case hearing after following the safety processes required due to Covid-19. Physical hearing was restricted to only 20 persons at a given time.“We are missing the courts as sitting on the chair all day long is not a good feeling. But if I have three matters in the Supreme Court, I cannot go without taking three separate passes and the accompanying permissions,” Kumar said. He added that not all courts are open to physical hearing. “Some courts have specifically mentioned that they don’t want physical hearing,” Kumar told the court.Echoing the concerns of the Bar, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President and senior advocate Vikas Singh said, “I had predicted that this would happen as the SOP creates many restrictions on movement of lawyers within the high security zone of the Supreme Court.”The SCBA – having 13,000 lawyers as its members –wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana on August 30 stating, “The SOP is a non-starter as our members would not like to take the option for physical hearing with so many conditions attached.” The SCBA has been in favour of a wider opening up in the court citing that the situation is conducive with Covid positivity rate dropping to as low as 0.04%.SCBA president said they are yet to hear from the CJI on its letter. “It is absurd how the Supreme Court has gone about hybrid hearing without discussing with us. Had this SOP been shown to us before, we would have outrightly rejected it. They have not even responded to our letter,” Singh said.There are lawyers who have preferred to appear through virtual court proceedings for safety concerns and in the interest of aged and sick parents at home.Senior advocate C Aryama Sundaram appearing before the bench headed by justice Nazeer said, “We all are anxious to see you physically, but it is not the courts but the corridors, the entry/exit gates that we fear.” The lawyer was referring to the fact that while courtrooms are to be sanitised under the SOP, there is no corresponding provision for other areas used by lawyers. Senior lawyer Meenakshi Arora informed the court that she preferred virtual hearing as she had aged parents at home.The SCBA had begun vaccination drive for its members in March and by now, most lawyers have received both doses of the vaccine. The judges and staff of the Supreme Court have also been vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hard-to-justify-not-having-physical-courts-when-schools-malls-are-open-sc-101631793788133.html

16-09-2021||India||Covid vulnerability may increase in October-November, Centre indicates||Without mentioning the third wave, the threats of which are looming large in India, the Centre on Thursday said that the country's Covid vulnerability may increase in October, November. Several projections earlier stated that the third wave of the pandemic may hit the country during that time. However, with over 62% of the population partially vaccinated, the situation will be different from the first and the second wave. The coming two, three months are crucial as whenever any surge is seen anywhere in the country, it has to be curbed immediately, Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said during the press meet of the Union health ministry. On the question of increased vulnerability later this year, Dr Paul said projections say October and November are the most crucial months. "There are enough data regarding this in the public domain. These are also the months of festivities and flu. We have to exercise special caution regarding these two months," Dr Paul said. "Even if there is any small surge, it should not be allowed to grow," Dr Paul said adding that festivities have to be kept at a low key.While the focus will be on preventing the infection through social distancing and vaccination, administration on the other hand must be increasing their capacity to handle any future rise. “Now we know better how to provide care and treatment in home isolation,” Dr Paul said. The Covid situation in the country is stabilising with the weekly positivity rate for the last 11 weeks is below 3%. The situation of Kerala has also improved, though 68% daily cases are still being reported from Kerala, the health ministry said. "We have been seeing some decreasing infections in Kerala. Other states are also on the path of averting future surge. However, festivals are approaching and sudden increase in population density creates a conducive environment for virus spread," Dr Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research said.The word of caution from the Centre comes amid reports of antibodies dropping massively within four months of the Covid shot. A recent study of 614 fully vaccinated health workers in India revealed that within four months of the first shot, there is a huge drop in antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vulnerability-may-increase-in-october-november-centre-indicates-101631789940596.html

The commission is in a position to submit its report within a month.”The state government was represented by senior advocate Dushyant Dave who requested the court to have the matter at the earliest as the state government required to make short submissions on its application to vacate the stay and allow the commission to complete its proceedings.An application filed by the state last month for early hearing of the case said, “The applicant (state government) is incurring an expenditure of over ₹4.26 lakh per month towards the salary for the staff of the Commission of Inquiry and therefore, it would be in the interest of justice if the commission is permitted to conclude its reference and submit a final report to the government of Tamil Nadu.”The application also stated that till April 2019, the commission had completed examination of 154 witnesses which included 56 doctors attached to Apollo hospital, five doctors from AIIMS, 12 government doctors including the medical board of five doctors constituted by Tamil Nadu government, 22 paramedical and other staff of Apollo hospital, and 59 other witnesses.VK Sasikala, the close aide of former chief minister Jayalalithaa, was also represented in court by advocate Vivek Singh who said the commission is not correct in saying that only four witnesses remain to be examined. “The commission has allowed our application to recall 13 witnesses. In this connection, we are yet to examine and cross-examine these witnesses,” he said.Senior advocate C Aryama Sundaram appearing for Apollo Hospital told the court that he was yet to argue his objections against the commission. In the petition, Apollo claimed that the commission was biased having preconceived views about the petitioner hospital, its doctors and staff. The commission denied this allegation it in its submissions given to court.The commission said, “The Commission of Inquiry under the 1952 Act has remained and remains non-partisan and refrains from taking any adversarial position either against or in favour of the petitioner (Apollo hospital) or the government of Tamil Nadu.”Prior to coming to the Supreme Court, Apollo hospital had approached the Madras high court to stall the commission proceedings that was denied. The HC, after going through the terms of reference had held, “The commission can very well decide the appropriateness, adequacy or inadequacy and efficacy of the treatment given to the chief minister of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-give-report-in-a-month-says-panel-probing-jayalalithaa-s-death-to-sc-101631789948898.html

The retired judge was offered ₹10 lakh by the West Bengal government. The sum was fixed by the high court. “We have received a communication from Justice Manjula Chellur graciously stating that she is not inclined to receive the honorarium fixed by the court. We accept the request. The state may not pay any honorarium to her. However, all other directions in the order dated September 3, 2021, may be adhered to,” the bench of Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj said on Thursday. In a September 3 order, the court asked the chief secretary to provide Justice Chellur with an accommodation befitting a chief justice and all arrangements for travelling. She was the first woman chief justice of the Calcutta high court and the first woman judge of the Karnataka high court. She retired in 2017. Calcutta high court’s five-judge bench headed by justice Bindal on August 19 ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into all allegations of post-poll murder and rape and a parallel probe by an SIT into the other allegations.

The court has appointed three IPS officers Suman Bala Sahoo, Ranveer Kumar and Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra for the SIT. On September 2, the state government appointed 10 more IPS officers to assist the SIT in probing the allegations of arson and loot. On June 18, the Calcutta high court asked the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to probe all allegations raised from across the state after the March-April polls. The BJP has alleged that more than 30 workers have been killed since May 2 when the election results were declared. The high court ordered the CBI probe after studying the final report the NHRC submitted on July 13. The Bengal government has moved the Supreme Court challenging the CBI probe. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal appeared for the state on September 13 and questioned the neutrality of the NHRC team that visited parts of Bengal and Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retired-justice-refuses-honorarium-for-overseeing-probe-in-bengal-violence-101631788387679.html
16-09-2021||India||NCBS paper retraction: TIFR ethics panel finds evidence of image manipulation||The Academic Ethics Committee of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) looking into allegations of data manipulation by researchers has found ‘compelling evidence’ of image manipulation and result falsification in a scientific paper. This is in connection to a paper published by scientists from National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru, which had to be retracted following allegations of manipulation of raw data.On October 5, 2020, a team of researchers from a laboratory in NCBS, which is a part of TIFR, published a scientific paper in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Chemical Biology. Soon after, the paper, titled “Discovery of iron-sensing bacterial riboswitches”, drew the attention of many readers on review website PubPeer. Many reviewers pointed out suspicious features in certain images in the paper.After Arati Ramesh, a senior author of the paper and principal investigator, brought these concerns to the attention of NCBS, the institution initiated an inquiry. The committee completed its investigation on November 23, 2020 and concluded that image manipulation had indeed occurred, and were carried out by a single individual. “This individual is no longer affiliated with NCBS. In accordance with the committee’s recommendations, Ramesh initiated the process of retracting the paper on February 1, 2021. The final retraction occurred on June 30, 2021,” said NCBS in a statement.Also Read | Maharashtra students union seeks nod for ITI students’ travel by trainTIFR, the parent institute, set up an investigation by its ethics committee. In a statement issued on Thursday, the ethics committee said, “There is compelling evidence which indicate that the image manipulation and result falsification in the NCB paper (now retracted) were carried out entirely by the first two authors. The first author has admitted to his role in the offence. The third co-author, as well as the fourth and corresponding author (Principal Investigator, PI), were unaware of this malpractice, and did not encourage it in any way.”The committee considered two papers for its investigation: the paper that appeared in the journal Nature Chemical Biology and was later retracted by the journal and another that appeared in the Journal of Molecular Biology (JMB), that contained an error traceable to inadvertent mislabelling of two samples. The committee found that in the second paper, no malpractice of data or image manipulation was found in this paper. “Once this mistake is corrected, the findings reported are genuine. The journal has accepted the explanation of the authors, and will publish a suitable corrigendum.” However, for the first paper, the committee said that the corresponding author and PI of the laboratory must bear the overall responsibility for not subjecting ‘results’ to proper scientific scrutiny before the paper was communicated for publication. The committee also found substance in allegations of authoritarian conduct by Ramesh in her laboratory environment. “The committee is of the view that no lapses in the behaviour of the PI ─ in any way ─ justify dishonest practices by any of her lab members,” it said.TIFR director S Ramakrishnan said he had received the conclusions and recommendations of the ethics committee. “We will implement its recommendations,” he said.“The TIFR Management accepts the findings of the TAEC, and will be considering its recommendations with utmost seriousness. TIFR as an institution remains committed to maintaining the highest standards in matters of ethics, scientific output and an amicable work atmosphere. The Management will take all efforts to see that systems are put in place to ensure that incidents like the current one cannot be repeated in the future,” the institute said in a statement.The committee recommended that Ramesh be immediately counselled to be more professional in her scientific practices and her conduct in the laboratory; this should be monitored by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncbs-paper-retraction-tifr-ethics-panel-finds-evidence-of-image-manipulation-101631787367852.html

This is the first time a political party is seeking caste-based census in the state. Talking to media in Kozhikode, party leader KPA Majeed said there is no point in deferring the social reality and the party will first raise this in the next UDF meeting. He said the present reservation system is based on an old census and there are complaints that only a section of the backward classes is benefiting from it. Recently, the Bihar assembly had passed a unanimous resolution on caste-based census and later an all-party team met Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention.

He said the state government should talk to all the parties and social organisations to evolve a consensus. In Kerala, Muslims enjoy 10% reservation in government jobs and 12% in educational institutions. SC/ST communities get 10% and others backward section, including Muslims and a section of Christians, gets 40%.

Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi resigned from the Assembly to join the Cabinet and took oath on Thursday.Chief minister Bhupendra Patel will hold the first Cabinet meeting at 4pm.The removal of Nitin Patel the former deputy chief minister from the Cabinet comes as surprising as he was widely speculated to be the chief minister after Rupani resigned.Though replacing the chief minister ahead of assembly elections is not a new strategy of the party as it has already done the same in Uttarakhand and Karnataka this year, in Gujarat, it is an entirely new Cabinet with the responsibility of taking care of the Prime Minister and home minister's home state in the election year. While the major reshuffle has created resentment, this will not create a rift in the party as the reshuffle has been handled by the top leadership reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-ministers-of-new-gujarat-cabinet-take-oath-amid-resentment-101631781913510.html

16-09-2021||India||Petition in SC seeks order that HCs don’t dispense with virtual court hearings||A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court by a body of litigants and two eminent citizens seeking access to justice through virtual courts as a matter of fundamental right for the litigants. The plea has also sought a directive for the high courts not to discontinue with the option of videoconferencing and virtual courts without the permission of the Supreme Court’s e-committee.The petition has been filed by National Federation of Societies for Fast Justice along with former Central Information Commissioner (CIC) and RTI activist Shailesh Gandhi along with former Mumbai Police Commissioner Julio Ribeiro.The petition filed on Wednesday has specifically challenged the decision taken by two High Courts to withdraw virtual court hearing and resume physical hearing. The Uttarakhand High Court had issued a notification in this regard on August 10 followed by a similar circular issued by Gujarat High Court on August 16.The petition, drafted by advocate Siddharth R Gupta, said: “The decisions of Gujarat and Uttarakhand High Court dispensing with the hearing through the virtual mode of court proceedings is challenged fundamentally on the ground of denial of Fundamental Right of access to justice, which has now come to be acclaimed as a Fundamental Right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution of India.”The petition further stated that the order passed by the two High Courts need to be set aside as “all the other High Courts of the country shall follow suit with the issuance of similar such orders and for this reason therefore the impugned decisions of Uttarakhand and Gujarat High Courts are a death knell for the very idea of Virtual Courts which is still in the embryonic stage.”Filed through advocate Mrigank Prabhakar, it added that virtual courts have also been propagated by the e-committee of the Supreme Court as the most accessible, affordable, transparent, and cheap mode of justice available to the litigant of the country, especially those coming from the marginalized sections.Besides demanding setting aside the orders of Gujarat and Uttarakhand High Courts, one of the prayers in the petition seeks an order “restraining any other High Court or any other Constitutional Court of the country from discontinuing or dispensing with the option of video conferencing and Virtual Courts of any class/category of cases/proceedings being heard by it without the express leave of this Court.”Pointing to the advantages of virtual court hearings, the petition said, “A lawyer from a native district of the litigant can be ably engaged for appearing through video conferencing mode before the Constitutional Courts by the concerned litigant, without being compelled to travel all the way to the seat of respective High Court/ Supreme Court and then following the legal processes there. Thus, justice has become extremely localized from the viewpoint of a litigant.”The National Federation of Societies for Fast Justice claimed to be an umbrella body of more than 115 registered societies campaigning for judicial reforms and working at the grass root level to provide access to Justice for the poor, marginalized and the economically weaker sections of the country.On September 6, apex court had sought the responses of the Bar Council of India, the Supreme Court Bar Association and High Courts of Uttarakhand and Gujarat on a petition filed by All India Association of Jurists, claiming to be a body of 5000 lawyers to continue with virtual court hearings in hybrid form.The bench, while issuing notice, had observed that the petition seemed to be in the interest of lawyers and not litigants. The bench even observed that a physical court hearing experience not only benefits litigants but also helps young lawyers to learn.The present petition is the first of its kind by litigants seeking a declaration of the right of access to justice through virtual courts (hybrid model) as a guaranteed Fundamental Right of each and every litigant of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-in-sc-seeks-order-that-hcs-don-t-dispense-with-virtual-court-hearings-101631772486954.html
16-09-2021||India||PM inaugurates defence office complexes at Delhi's KG Marg, Africa Avenue||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday inaugurated defence office complexes at New Delhi's Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue, in the presence of Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Hardeep Singh Puri and Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat.The three service chiefs — Army Chief General MM Manoj Mukund Naravane, IAF Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria and Indian Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh were also present at the ceremony.The new defence office complexes will accommodate around 7,000 officials from the ministry of defence and the Armed Forces, including the Army, Navy and Air Force. Following the inauguration of the complexes, Modi said the new office complexes would help the defence personnel work in better conditions. “Today Delhi is progressing in line with 'New India' vision. These new defence office complexes will now make it feasible for our armies to operate in better working conditions with all modern amenities,” Modi said.The buildings will provide modern, secure and functional working spaces. “An Integrated Command and Control Centre has been established for managing building operations, while also catering to the end-to-end safety and surveillance of both the buildings,” the government said in a statement.Until now, the defence ministry officers and staff were from decades-old, pre-Independence era hutments in the vicinity of the North and South Blocks. The relocation of the existing 27 defence offices to the swanky complexes at Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue would also pave the way for the revamp of the Central Vista.Officials familiar with the developments said the shifting of the defence establishments would happen in phases over the next two months.The new defence office complexes are state-of-the-art and energy-efficient, with comprehensive security management measures. One of the defining features of these buildings is the use of new and sustainable construction technology called LGSF (light gauge steel frame), which reduced construction time from 24 to 30 months in the case of conventional reinforced cement concrete (RCC) construction. The buildings utilise resource-efficient green technology and promote environment-friendly practices, the government said.Constructed by the Union ministry of housing and urban development for ₹775 crore, the new defence office complexes — an eight-storey building at Kasturba Gandhi Marg and a seven-storey complex at Africa Avenue — spread across 9.6 lakh square feet area were completed within a record 12 months. The two complexes together can accommodate 1,500 cars at multi-level parking lots. Earlier this week, Hindustan Times reported quoting defence officials that the shifting of old offices will free 50 acres of land for the ₹20,000-crore Central Vista development project. "The defence ministry will vacate 9.2 lakh square feet of space in these hutments and take up 9.6 lakh square feet in two new multi-storeyed complexes that are spread over a total area of 13 acres,” an official said.The vacated near the South Block will be used to develop the ‘Executive Enclave’ of the Central Vista Project, which, besides housing the Prime Minister and the PMO, will also have the office of the Cabinet Secretariat, officials of the housing and urban development said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-inaugurates-defence-office-complexes-at-delhi-s-kg-marg-africa-avenue-101631771640882.html

Everything is under control,” Patil said when asked about differences within the party over induction. He also refused to speculate on who would be deputy chief minister or whether the post would even exist.

The ceremony is scheduled for 1pm today and more than 20 ministers are reported to be inducted into the new cabinet at Raj Bhavan in Gandhinagar.News reports said that majority of ministers in the cabinet headed by previous chief minister Vijay Rupani are likely to be dropped and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may replace them with fresh faces. So far, the party is mum about possible cabinet members' names.Patel took oath as the 17th chief minister of Gujarat on Monday. He replaced Rupani, who unexpectedly stepped down from the top post in the state, ahead of the assembly elections in 2022.The 59-year-old leader is a first-time member of the legislative assembly (MLA) from Ahmedabad.Senior leaders in the party are reaching out to those not likely to be retained as ministers, news agency ANI reported. "There is a massive exercise going on to see that leaders who won't be accommodated in the cabinet do not feel left out," it reported, quoting a source.The BJP, which has been in power in Gujarat for more than two decades, is counting on Patel to shore up the party's fortunes ahead of the assembly elections towards the end of next year. In the 2017 state election, the BJP won 99 of the state's 182 Assembly seats and Congress got 77 seats.Earlier the swearing-in ceremony was scheduled for Wednesday and preparations for the same had started at the governor's house in the state capital. However, the plan was later dropped all of a sudden and banners of the swearing-in ceremony were also taken down. Neither the BJP nor the state government gave any reason for the postponement.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupendra-patel-govt-s-new-ministers-to-take-oath-today-in-gujarat-101631771268249.html

The development comes amid speculation of ULFA-I joining peace talks with Centre. The charge sheet was filed on Tuesday at the NIA special court in Guwahati against Baruah, Pappu Koch Bokoliyal, Amrit Ballav Goswami, Arunodoy Dahotiya and Munna Baruah, an NIA release issued on Wednesday said.Also Read | Assam teen missing since Sunday found dead; family says she was gang-raped by 6“The case relates to incident of two ULFA (I) cadres lobbing a grenade at a police party near Central Mall, RGB Road, Guwahati which led to injuries to 12 persons. Later, Paresh Baruah, self-styled commander-in-chief of ULFA (I) took responsibility for the terrorist attack,” the NIA release said. Twelve persons were injured in the blast outside a mall on May 19, 2019. The NIA took charge of the case on June 26 and filed a charge sheet against eight persons in November the same year. Now a supplementary charge sheet has been filed based on additional evidence gathered against the five accused during the course of investigation. The five accused “have been charged for their roles in the conspiracy of the grenade attack and for waging war against the union of India on the strength of additional evidence (that) surfaced during investigation.” There have been speculations that ULFA-I could join peace talks with the Centre since May this year, when the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government assumed office in Assam for a second term. The outfit, has, however maintained that the issue of Assam’s sovereignty should be part of talks--a pre-condition, which has been ruled out by Centre as well the state government. Citing the Covid-19 pandemic, the outfit declared a unilateral ceasefire in May for three months, extending it by another three months in August. This year, for the first time since its inception in 1979, ULFA-I didn’t boycott the Independence Day celebrations or call for a ‘bandh’ on the occasion. “Our organisation is not against talks or belligerent. But it is not possible to deny historical facts or waver from our ideological goals in the name of talks. Indian authorities have maintained that talks with ULFA-I can’t include the question of (Assam’s) sovereignty,” ULFA-I said in a statement released in August. Earlier this month, the outfit carried out a “structural change” in the organisation by creating three new councils with Baruah heading the supreme council. No changes were made in the military wing of the outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guwahati-grenade-blast-nia-charge-sheet-against-ulfa-i-leader-paresh-baruah-101631763125669.html

We fear that there will be a rise in trafficking of women in Afghanistan now that the Taliban are back,” Rizai said in an interaction with women journalists organised by the Indian Women’s Press Corps on Wednesday.The Taliban rule in the 1990s set the country back by 100 years, she added.Afghan MP Shinkai Karokhail recalled the turmoil women have been going through since the Taliban took over the country. “It is a terrible situation there,” she said.Also Read | Taliban bust-up at presidential palace in Afghanistan: What really happenedThe Taliban went to the homes of women activists and politicians who could not leave Afghanistan as many countries had stopped giving visas, to intimidate them. “This is the way they wanted to scare women who had to run away or keep silent and not raise their voice,” Karokhail, also a women’s rights activist, said.“Women have the right to be included,” she said, adding that the Taliban’s interpretation of Islam is wrong and they are using it to violate women.The MP lashed out at the international community for letting such a crisis take place in Afghanistan and condemned the countries which have supported the growth of the Taliban. “Taliban and supporters of Taliban like Pakistan, China, Iran and Russia must be made accountable because they are behind the situation there. The US must accept the mistakes they made in Afghanistan,” she said.“I left my country with a heavy and broken heart, it wasn’t easy and I struggled a lot,” said Karokhail who left Afghanistan for Canada on August 20, five days after Kabul fell.Afghan journalist Fatima Faramarz, who was also a panellist, said women are considered “animals and the Taliban decides to treat them as they please”.An investigative journalist at Etilaat Roz, Faramarz recalled how her colleagues were brutally beaten up recently when they went to cover a protest. “They were covering a protest. They were taken by the Taliban to a police station and were beaten with batons and electrical cables,” she narrated.According to Human Rights Watch, the Taliban’s rights record in the 1990s, when it first took over Afghanistan, was characterised by systematic violations against women and girls; cruel corporal punishments, including executions; and extreme suppression of freedom of religion, expression, and education.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-don-t-consider-us-as-humans-say-afghan-women-101631761925514.html
16-09-2021||India||PM Modi to address plenary session of SCO summit in Dushanbe||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lead the Indian delegation at the 21st meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Friday and virtually join the summit of heads of state via video link. Minister of external affairs S Jaishankar will on Friday represent India at the SCO summit, which will be held in a hybrid format at the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe. This is the fourth such summit where India will be participating as a full-fledged member of the SCO, and it assumes a special significance in light of the rapidly evolving situation in the war-torn land of Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover.Also Read | Modi to lead India at SCO meeting in Dushanbe, to focus on AfghanistanThe SCO summit will be attended by the leaders of the organisation's member states, observer states, secretary-general of the SCO, executive-director of the SCO regional anti-terrorist structure (RATS), president of Turkmenistan, and other invited guests. Jaishankar is also set to represent India in a meeting on Afghanistan of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) on the same day.The joint meetings are expected to provide India with the opportunity to examine closely the situation in Afghanistan, especially in light of concerns about the military establishment in Pakistan and its ties with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.The ANI news agency, citing people familiar with the focus areas of discussion at the SCO summit, reported that India will discuss the current politico-security situation in the region, especially Afghanistan; the fallout of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic; the expansion of membership of the organisation, including discussions on full membership, dialogue partner, and observer status; and multilateral economic cooperation.India will also discuss counter-terrorism, economic cooperation, people-to-people exchanges, and other topical issues of regional and international importance, the agency added.Jaishankar said last week that India has always stood with the Afghan people and called for an unfettered flow of humanitarian aid to the war-torn land. India has called for the global community to jointly bring forth a positive and enabling environment in Afghanistan; however, this requires cooperation from foreign nations and there is always the possibility of vested interests.Also Read | 'India's concern inappropriate': Taliban say nothing wrong in China helping AfghanistanChina's foreign minister Wang Yi, Russia's Sergey Lavrov, Iran's Hossein Amir Abdollahian, and Pakistan's Shah Mahmood Qureshi are expected to attend the SCO meetings in Dushanbe.Abdollahian, who assumed office in August, was set to travel to India last week but later deferred his visit. However, the newly-appointed Iranian foreign minister might still travel to Delhi soon enough, people familiar with the development said, although fresh dates for his visit are yet to be fixed.India is in no rush to recognise the new rulers of Afghanistan; it instead attaches supreme importance to the argument that Afghan territory must not be used for terrorism or anti-India activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-margins-of-sco-summit-jaishankar-to-hold-key-meet-in-dushanbe-on-afghanistan-affairs-101631756214402.html

Both the boys live in Pastiya village in Bagaura panchayat in Katihar district.The boys visited the local Centralised Precessing Centre (CPC) of State Bank of India (SBI) to find out about the amount deposited by the state government for school uniforms, but received the shock of their lives after learning about the huge sum of money, the Livehindustan report said.The boys hold the account in Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank. While Vishwas' account has ₹60 crore, Kumar's account suddenly had ₹900 crore, reported Livehindustan.Branch manager Manoj Gupta was surprised to know about the issue and stopped the withdrawal of money. Livehindustan further reported that a probe has been ordered and senior officials of the bank have been informed.This comes a days after a similar matter was reported from Khagaria district. A private tutor named Ranjit Das received ₹5.5 lakh in his account due to a bank error but refused to return the amount despite notices served to him. The man felt it could be a ploy to extort money from him sent by the government.“I felt that due to Covid-19 and the lockdown, the government had sent the amount into my account. These days, a lot of banking frauds take place and so I did not return. As I had some needs, I spent ₹1,60, 970. I was happy that the government had sent some money when I needed it. How else could money reach my empty account,” Das told the police.The police arrested Das on Tuesday and he was sent to judicial custody by a local court on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-rs-900-crore-deposited-in-bank-accounts-of-2-boys-in-bihar-report-101631752094861.html

16-09-2021||India||44 students get 100 percentile in JEE(Main), 18 secure rank 1||New Delhi: A record 44 students scored 100 percentile, including 18 who secured the first rank, in the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) or JEE (Main) exams-2021, results of which were announced by the National Testing Agency (NTA) late on Tuesday night, reporting an increase of 83% from last year when 24 students secured 100 percentile.Officials cited an increase in the number of sessions for the exams as the reason for the record NTA scores. “Of the 939,008 candidates who appeared in the exams, 252,954 appeared in all four sessions. It increases the probability of more students scoring a 100 percentile,” an NTA official said. The NTA, which is the nodal agency to conduct various entrance exams in the county, said it has debarred 20 students from taking the exam for three years on account of using “unfair means”. The decision comes amid an ongoing Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) investigation into the alleged cases of “impersonification” and “misconduct” at some exam centres during the fourth session of the JEE (Mains), conducted from August 26 to September 2.“On account of using ‘unfair means’, a total of 20 candidates have been debarred from appearing in future examinations for a period of three years. Their results have also been withheld,” NTA said in a statement. A senior NTA official, who wished not to be named, said the nodal agency was also looking into the cases wherein the percentile has jumped “unrealistically” from one session to another. “The results of around 400 students are under observation. These are the cases where the percentile has increased unrealistically from one session to another,” said the official.This year, for the first time, the JEE (Mains) was conducted four times in a year in order to offer more opportunities to students and to give them more chances to improve. While the first phase was conducted in February, the second phase was held in March. The third phase, which was scheduled in April and May, got postponed due to the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. It was later held between July and August.The fourth phase, for which the results were announced late on Tuesday night, was conducted on August 26, 27, 31 and September 1 and 2. Until last year, the exams were conducted twice a year.On Wednesday, after all four sessions were concluded a final merit list of best of four was issued by the NTA. For candidates who appeared in more than one session, the best NTA score has been accounted for, the agency said.According to the NTA, out of the 44 candidates who scored 100 percentile, seven each are from Telangana and Delhi, six each from Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, five from Maharashtra, two each from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, and Punjab and one candidate each are from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, West Bengal and Chandigarh. The rank has been allotted on the basis of the tie-breaking policy of the NTA. “According to the policy, candidates with higher marks in Mathematics are given preference while allotting ranks. It is followed by an NTA score in Physics and then in Chemistry. If still the tie remains, the candidate with a lesser ratio of negative to positive response will be preferred. It means the candidates who have attempted lesser wrong questions will be given preference. Therefore, only 18 out of 44 candidates with 100 percentile scorers scored rank 1,” said another NTA official.Despite the introduction of four sessions, the JEE (Mains) this year witnessed a decrease in overall registration. Last year, 1,174,000 students had registered for the exams, of which 1,023,000 had appeared. This year, the number of registration came down to 1,048,012 and of these 939,008 candidates appeared in the exams.A total of 658,000 male and 280,000 female candidates appeared in the exams this year. Last year, 715,000 male and 308,000 female candidates had appeared in the exams. Officials attributed the decrease to Covid-19 pandemic. “The pandemic has badly affected the education system. We will also analyse other possible reasons behind the decrease,” said an official. The JEE (Mains) is conducted for admissions to various engineering courses including the National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology and other centrally funded technical colleges. Besides, it is also an eligibility criterion for the JEE (Advanced) exams for admissions to the Indian Institutes of Technologies (IITs). Registration process for the JEE (Advanced), which will be conducted on October 3, started on Wednesday. Candidates, who will meet the NTA’s cut-off for JEE (Advanced), can only appear in the exam.The JEE (Main) exam was conducted at 915 examination centres in 334 cities, including 12 outside India in Bahrain, Colombo, Doha, Dubai, Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, Muscat, Riyadh, Sharjah, Singapore and Kuwait.The test was held in 13 languages, including English, Hindi, Gujarati, Assamese, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/44-students-get-100-percentile-in-jee-main-18-secure-rank-1-101631744045064.html
16-09-2021||India||Only Dalai Lama can decide on his reincarnation: CTA head Penpa Tsering||The Dalai Lama alone can decide the matter of his reincarnation and the Chinese government has no say in the matter, the head of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), Penpa Tsering, has said against the backdrop of Beijing’s assertions that it will choose the next Tibetan spiritual leader. Tsering said in an interview that China’s efforts to play a decisive role in the selection of the next Dalai Lama amounted to “politicisation of the whole reincarnation issue”. The Dalai Lama’s reincarnation is a spiritual issue whereas China’s communist regime doesn’t even believe in religion, he said. The current impasse in the Tibetan parliament-in-exile – where 22 of the 45 members have not taken oath in line with the official charter – provides an opportunity for “the Chinese government to create trouble” within the Tibetan community and affect the image of the Tibetan movement, Tsering said. Tsering, who was elected the Sikyong or head of the executive branch of the CTA in May, said if the Chinese government is serious about the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation, it “should be giving more attention to the living 14th Dalai Lama than the future 15th Dalai Lama”. He said, “And as a communist regime which does not believe in religion or life after death, this is purely a spiritual matter.” He added, “When you talk about reincarnation, it’s the person who’s going to be reincarnated who decides where or how he or she should be born...We are talking about [the Dalai Lama’s] reincarnation, so it’s completely up to his holiness to decide where he will be born, not the Chinese government.” Amid growing concerns about the health of the current Dalai Lama – he turned 86 in July – Tsering said he personally believed the CTA shouldn’t have any role in the issue of reincarnation. “This is a purely spiritual and a religious process. So it’s up to the religious leader, particularly his holiness the Dalai Lama, to decide, not the administration, but once his reincarnation is recognised, then the role of the CTA comes into being,” he said. With 22 of the 45 lawmakers of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile not having taken oath in line with the Tibetan Charter because of political differences, Tsering said the impasse had created “a lot of space for the Chinese government to create trouble within the [Tibetan] community, and it also affects the image of the Tibetan movement”. He added, “But whenever you have a problem, there are also opportunities. This creates more awareness within the public about the laws and the system and all that. So I believe now people are more aware of what is happening within the community and I think the elected leaders should be about of where it’s heading to.” Tsering said the elected members would have to play a key role in ending the impasse as there was no clarity on how to resolve the matter, “other than the role of the election commission”, since the Tibetan Charter doesn’t specify “as to what happens if some members do not take oath of office as per the laws”. He also said the devotees of the Karmapa Rinponce, Ugyen Trinley Dorje, are very concerned about the issue of his return to India. “But at the same time, there has to be mutual understanding between the government of India and Karmapa Rinpoche himself. We are talking about how to smoothen things out and look at ways where there could be a mutual consensus on how he should return and how he will be treated in India,” he added. The Karmapa Rinpoche, who fled from Tibet to India in January 2000, left the country in May 2017 and travelled to Europe and then the US using his Identity Certificate, a document issued by the Indian government to stateless citizens from the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China. Since then, Dorje has cited various reasons for not returning to India. Tsering also spoke about the CTA’s plans for restructuring in the years to come in response to social and demographic changes in the Tibetan community in India. This will focus on “the integration of settlements and integration of schools, because we are scattered in more than 45 different communities” across India. “So in the long run, when more people move out of the settlements, then it becomes expedient on us to integrate the settlements into more compact, larger communities so that it becomes administratively more manageable for us,” he said, adding this will also enable the Tibetan community to preserve its language, culture, religion and way of life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-dalai-lama-can-decide-on-his-reincarnation-cta-head-penpa-tsering-101631743807051.html
16-09-2021||India||Amid farm protest, Tomar holds talk with Lieutenant Governors over agri schemes||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Wednesday held a virtual conference with all Lieutenant Governors (LGs) of Union Territories to discuss a raft of federal farm schemes, especially the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, a long-term-debt financing scheme aimed at boosting private infrastructure investment in the food and farm economy. Similar exercises would likely be held with state governments, an official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.The move to collaborate closely with provincial authorities on policies in the farm sector, which supports half the Indian population, comes amid the ongoing farm protests in states, especially in states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Major farm unions have opposed the three agricultural laws enacted in September last year to liberalise farm trade. “The objective of the meeting was to understand the views of the L-Gs on the ground situation regarding schemes like the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund and its uptake,” a second official said. Uptake refers to the utilisation of funds. The participants included J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Island Admiral DK Joshi. These two top administrators also gave presentations on the implementation of various schemes. An official statement said “modifications and (the) current status of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund were explained”. A presentation by the agriculture ministry stated “investment opportunities of around ₹1,700 crore and employment generation opportunities of more than 20,000 in 7 UTs under activities like dry storage, pack house, cold storage, ripening chamber, reefer vehicles, smart and precision farming etc.” were being done under the fund. The fund, which figured in the ₹20-lakh crore first stimulus package to deal with the Covid crisis, aims to offer medium-to-long term debt financing for investment in farm projects. It will provide loans on easy terms totalling ₹1 lakh crore over four years, starting with a sanction of ₹10,000 crore for 2020-21 and ₹30,000 crore each for the next three financial years. Borrowers get an interest subvention, where part of the interest is paid by the government, of 3% per annum up to a loan limit of ₹2 crore for a period of seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-farm-protest-tomar-holds-talk-with-lieutenant-governors-over-agri-schemes-101631742482551.html
16-09-2021||India||FCRA: Govt restricts funding by 10 foreign agencies to Indian NGOs||New Delhi: The Union government has put 10 foreign donor agencies based in the US, Europe and Australia under the “Prior Reference Category”, restricting any funding by them to Indian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or individuals without the approval of ministry of home affairs (MHA), people familiar with the development said. The action was taken under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).These include US entities Omidyar Network, supported by e-Bay founder Pierre Omidyar and involved in social impact funding across sectors in India, Stardust, and Humanity United; the European Climate Foundation; the UK-based Freedom Fund, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, Laudes Foundation and Legatum Fund; and Australia-based organisations Walk Free Foundation (WFF), and Minderoo. A circular to this regard was sent by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to all the banks on July 1. “RBI has instructed that any fund flow from these donor agencies to any NGO/voluntary organizations/associations/person(s) in India should be brought to the notice of ministry of home affairs so that the funds are allowed to be credited to the accounts of the recipient only after clearance/prior reference from FCRA Wing,” the circular stated. A senior ministry of home affairs (MHA) official confirmed the development on Wednesday evening. “A lot of audits which were pending due to Covid-19 were done, and foundations which are indulging in work other than what they have mentioned in their FCRA documents have been put under the prior reference category. This is a routine exercise,” he said. HT reached out to Omidyar Network, Laudes, Minderoo, Walk Free, Legatum, European Climate Foundation, and Children’s Investment Fund Foundation for comments, which were awaited at the time of going to print. Over the last few years, the government has taken action against several international organisations including Greenpeace, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Compassion International, and Open Society Foundation. Amnesty and Greenpeace have shut their India operations. According to the amended FCRA rules, which were tightened in September 2020, any association with specific religious, educational, economic, cultural and social activities require FCRA registration or prior reference from the MHA before they can receive or utilise foreign contribution. Moreover, foreign contribution to such entities should be credited to a designated FCRA account, and no other transaction should be allowed in such designated accounts. On tightening FCRA rules, the government said last year that “the annual inflow of foreign contribution has almost doubled between the years 2010 and 2019, but many recipients of foreign contribution have not utilised the same for the purpose for which they were registered or granted prior reference under the said Act”. It added that many of these recipients were found wanting in ensuring basic statutory compliances such as submission of annual returns and maintenance of proper accounts, which has led to a situation where the central government had to cancel certificates of registration of more than 19,000 recipient organisations, including NGOs, during the period between 2011 and 2019. Criminal investigations were also initiated against dozens of such non-governmental organisations which indulged in outright misappropriation or misutilisation of foreign contribution. According to a reply by the MHA in Parliament on August 10, 22,691 NGOs are registered or granted prior reference by central government for receipt and utilisation of foreign contribution including relief supplies from foreign sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fcra-govt-restricts-funding-by-10-foreign-agencies-to-indian-ngos-101631742062458.html

16-09-2021||India||Centre set to take charge of irrigation projects in Telugu states||The stage is set for the takeover by the Centre of all the completed and ongoing major and medium irrigation projects on Krishna and Godavari rivers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh with effect from October 14, when the gazette notifications issued by the Union ministry of Jal Shakti on July 15, come into force.As per the gazette notification, the operation and maintenance of as many as 36 irrigation projects on Krishna river, including Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala, along with their canals and irrigation systems, would come under the purview of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB).Similarly, another 70-odd projects on Godavari river including Kaleshwaram and Polavaram would be brought under the Godavari River Management Board (GRMB). Both the boards would be directly under the control of the Union ministry of Jal Shakti.On Sunday, Union Jal Shakti secretary A K Das issued orders appointing two chief engineers each to KRMB and GRMB to oversee the functioning of these boards. M K Sinha and G K Agarwal, both chief engineers in the Central Water Commission, would look after the GRMB, while T K Sivarajan from Coimbatore and Anupam Prasad from Lucknow were appointed for KRMB.The four CEs will look after the works of Boards for three months or till further orders, Das said.The Jal Shakti ministry also held a meeting with J Chandrashekhar Iyer, chairman of GRMB and M P Singh of KRMB on Monday in New Delhi to discuss the modalities of the implementation of the gazette notifications on the operation and maintenance of the projects located on the two rivers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Why should there be Central control over irrigation projects?In a bid to avoid river water disputes between the two Telugu states post bifurcation of the combined state, provisions were incorporated in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act 2014 for the effective management of river waters by constituting river management boards for Godavari and Krishna rivers. An apex council headed by Union Jal Shakti Minister was constituted for the supervision of the functioning of these boards.Though the boards were constituted in 2014 itself, their jurisdiction over the projects and functioning had not been finalised for a long time, as a result which both the Telugu states had been at loggerheads over drawing of river water every monsoon, especially in Krishna basin.As per the Krishna tribunal award, out of 811 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) allotted to erstwhile combined state, Telangana was allocated 299 tmc ft of water and Andhra Pradesh 512 tmc ft. But both the states accused each other of drawing excess water than what was allocated, especially in Krishna river.At last in October 2020, it was decided at the apex council meeting to notify the jurisdiction of the two boards and entrust the administration, regulation, maintenance and operation of the projects under the two rivers to these boards.Accordingly, the Union ministry of Jal Shakti issued two separate gazette notifications on July 15, notifying the jurisdiction of KRMB and GRMB and entrusting them to take over the irrigation projects.States oppose total control by CentreHowever, both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have their own reservations over the implementation of gazette notification. A senior official of the Andhra Pradesh irrigation department said on condition of anonymity that the state government was opposing bringing all the irrigation projects under the purview of the boards.“We requested that only major projects on Krishna river like Nagarjunasagar and Srisailam be brought under the purview of KRMB since there is a dispute with Telangana over water releases every year. The other projects can remain under the control of the state government,” he said.Telangana, too, has been opposing major projects like Kaleshwaram under the GRMB, because it was conceived much before the bifurcation of the combined state. Moreover, it would be difficult for the boards to run so many irrigation projects, since water releases should be done according to the requirement of the farmers in the command area.“We have been asking the Centre to defer the implementation of the gazette notification but there is no positive response from it,” a Telangana irrigation official said.As per the gazette notification, both the Telugu states would have to bear the expenditure on salaries and allowances of the personnel belonging to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who would man the irrigation projects. Besides, the two states would also have to deposit ₹200 crore each for the operation of the two boards within the next two months.It is learnt the two states have expressed their inability to deposit this money with the boards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-set-to-take-charge-of-irrigation-projects-in-telugu-states-101631735521707.html
16-09-2021||India||Crimes against women lowest in Coimbatore, Chennai, reveals NCRB report||Cities in Tamil Nadu -- Coimbatore and Chennai--- are the safest for women to live in as they have the lowest rate for crimes against women compared to 19 other metro cities in India, including Bengaluru and Mumbai, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2020.The rate of crimes against women last year in these metropolitan cities were Coimbatore (9.0), Chennai (13.4), Bengaluru (67.3), Mumbai (53.8), Kochi (37.5) while the crime rate was highest in Lucknow (190.7), Jaipur (162.9), Delhi (129.1).In Chennai, crimes against women have been declining between 2018 and 2020 at 761, 729 and 576. The city has a charge sheeting rate of 96.8%. In Coimbatore, however, the number of crimes against women was 107 in 2018 which dipped to 85 in 2019 and went up again to 97 in 2020 with a charge sheeting rate 97.9%.However, in terms of absolute numbers, last year metro cities in Kerala had fewer crimes compared to Chennai. Kochi and Kozhikode saw 403 and 294 whereas Chennai had 576. But Coimbatore in absolute numbers too is the lowest in the country with 97 crimes last year. The difference being that the crime rate is calculated as per one lakh of population and Chennai is the largest metro among these four cities. The populations of Chennai, Coimbatore, Kochi and Kozhikode are 43.1 lakh, 10.7 lakh, 10.8 lakh, 10.6 lakh respectively. Experts say that the lowest crime rate against women in Tamil Nadu cities can be attributed to two factors- lack of reporting and prevention mechanisms. “When there is a declining trend, we have to see through the data from various intersections. Are they complaining? If so, is their report being considered and registered or dismissed? Even in urban areas in gender based crimes there is stigma against reporting and some women get used to this and fail to report like in instance in sexual harassment in public places like buses,” says Sandhiyan Thiyagaran, founder of AWARE (Awareness for Women to Advocate their Rights and Empowerment) India. “However, compared to other metros in the country, in Tamil Nadu the law enforcement agencies help prevent crimes against women such as by patrolling and installing CCTVs. We have a few deterrents that other metros may not have in equal measure.”Amongst these 19 Metropolitan Cities, cities reporting highest charge-sheeting rate under IPC Crimes are Surat (96.7%), Coimbatore (96.6%) and Ahmedabad (96.3%). Among the states it is Gujarat (97.1%), Kerala (94.9%) and Tamil Nadu (91.7%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crimes-against-women-lowest-in-coimbatore-chennai-reveals-ncrb-report-101631734140684.html

Based on his analysis, he keeps saying things,” Bommai said during a debate on price rise in the Karnataka assembly.Bommai said Swamy spoke against the leadership of the Janata Party and then Janata Dal as well.“While being in the government, he spoke against the then Prime Minister Chandrashekhar. It is the character and forte of Subramanian Swamy,” he said.The chief minister’s statement came as the Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah quoted Swamy’s February 2, 2021 tweet, which read, ‘Petrol ₹93 in Ram’s India, ₹53 in Sita’s Nepal and ₹51 in Ravan’s Lanka.” Siddaramaiah quoted the sitting BJP Rajya Sabha member to point out the rising fuel prices in India and its cascading effect on other commodities.“It’s not me who has said this but Subramanian Swamy, who is a sitting Rajya Sabha member of the BJP. He was your father’s (former CM Late S R Bommai) friend,” Siddaramaiah quipped.He even challenged the BJP leadership to sack Swamy if he was not right.“I have no objection if the BJP leadership tolerates his statement. Don’t forget that he is an economist and you have made him your Rajya Sabha member,” Siddaramaiah said.To this, Bommai agreed saying Swamy is genius in economics and the party gave him due credit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-bommai-calls-subramanian-swamy-a-freelance-politician-101631733608020.html
16-09-2021||India||Haritha leaders criticise League for ignoring harassment complaint||Thiruvananthapuram: Former leaders of Haritha, the women students’ wing of the Indian Union Muslim League lashed out at the party on Wednesday for ignoring their complaints against some of their male colleagues who allegedly defamed and verbally attacked them. Addressing a press conference in Kozhikode in north Kerala, they alleged that they were subjected to severe “cyber attack and verbal rape” over the issue and they were victimised for airing their “genuine grievances”. They said instead of taking action against the alleged perpetrators they were expelled from the party. They said they approached the state women commission after all their pleas fell on deaf ears. “Our approach to the Kerala State Women’s Commission was seen as a major crime by the League leadership. But we were forced. We are being subjected to constant cyber attacks and character assassination over the issue,” Najma Thabsheera, a former office-bearer of Haritha, said. Another leader, Mufeeda Tasni, said they will provide enough evidence to police and women commission to support their complaint. She said some of the senior leaders’ attitude towards women members was really shocking and male hegemony was quite evident in the party. The League had recently dissolved the state committee of the Haritha after it rejected the party’s diktat to withdraw its complaint against male leaders of the Muslim Students Federation (MSF) who allegedly used derogatory terms and insulted them. Police arrested MSF leader PK Navas and later released him on bail. Earlier the party had tried to enforce a truce but failed and took action against Haritha leaders. At least 10 members of the Haritha had approached the women commission with a complaint against MSF state president PK Navas and a few others, alleging derogatory remarks and use of abusive language during a state committee meeting of their union on June 24. Police later registered a case against him as directed by the women commission and later arrested him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haritha-leaders-criticise-league-for-ignoring-harassment-complaint-101631733539897.html

16-09-2021||India||Crime rate against women lowest in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore, Chennai: NCRB data||Chennai: Coimbatore and Chennai in Tamil Nadu have registered the lowest crime rate against women among 19 big cities in the country, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2020.The rate of crime, which is incidence per 100,000 population, against women last year is 9 in Coimbatore, 13.4 in Chennai, 37.5 in Kochi, 67.3 in Bengaluru, and 53.8 in Mumbai. The crime rate is highest in Lucknow (190.7); it’s 162.9 in Jaipur and 129.1 in Delhi, according to the NCRB data.In Chennai, the crimes against women have been declining -- 761 in 2018; 729 in 2019; and 576 in 2020. The city has a charge sheeting rate of 96.8%. In Coimbatore, the number of crimes against women was 107 in 2018 which dipped to 85 in 2019 and went up to 97 in 2020 with a charge-sheeting rate of 97.9%, the data shows.In terms of absolute numbers, big cities in Kerala had fewer crimes last year compared to Chennai. Kochi recorded 403 crimes and Kozhikode 294 whereas Chennai had 576. Coimbatore with 97 crimes last year stands at the lowest in the country. The difference also reflects the calculation of the crime rate as per 100,000 population and Chennai is the largest among these four cities. The populations of Chennai, Coimbatore, Kochi and Kozhikode are 4.31 million, 1.07 million, 1.08 million, 1.06 million, respectively. Experts say the lowest crime rate against women in Tamil Nadu cities can be attributed to two factors -- lack of reporting and prevention mechanisms. “When there is a declining trend, we have to see through the data from various intersections. Are they complaining? If so, are their reports being considered and registered or dismissed? Even in urban areas, there is stigma against reporting gender-based crimes. Some women get used to this and fail to report instances of sexual harassment in public places like buses,” said Sandhiyan Thiyagaran, founder of AWARE (Awareness for Women to Advocate their Rights and Empowerment) India. “However, compared to other metros in the country, in Tamil Nadu the law enforcement agencies help prevent crimes against women, such as by patrolling and installing CCTVs. We have a few deterrents that other metros may not have in equal measure.”Amongst the 19 big cities, those reporting highest charge-sheeting rate under IPC crimes are Surat (96.7%), Coimbatore (96.6%) and Ahmedabad (96.3%). Among the states, Gujarat reported 97.1% charge-sheeting rate, Kerala 94.9% and Tamil Nadu 91.7%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crime-rate-against-women-lowest-in-tamil-nadu-s-coimbatore-chennai-ncrb-data-101631733300584.html
16-09-2021||India||CBI court dismisses plea seeking cancellation of Jagan’s bail||Hyderabad A special court for Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) cases, dismissed a petition seeking cancellation of bail of Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in connection with the alleged quid pro quo case pending against him, in Hyderabad on Wednesday.The petition was filed by Kanumuru Raghurama Krishnam Raju, a rebel Lok Sabha member of YSRCP from Narasapuram in West Godavari district in April this year. Raju requested the CBI court to cancel the bail granted to Jagan on the grounds that the latter had violated the bail conditions and was trying to influence the witnesses in the CBI case against him.The CBI court also dismissed a separate petition filed by Raju seeking cancellation of bail of Jagan’s close aide and YSRCP parliamentary party leader V Vijay Sai Reddy, who is the second accused in the alleged case.The court, which completed the hearing of arguments from both the sides on July 31, reserved its judgement for August 25, but later postponed it to September 15.In 2012, the CBI filed a case against Jagan alleging that he had, in a criminal conspiracy with others, received bribes from various companies and individuals who had invested in his group companies as a ‘quid pro quo’ deal for securing undue favours from the then combined Andhra Pradesh government headed by his father late Dr YS Rajasekhar Reddy during 2004-2009.Simultaneously, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) also filed cases of money laundering against Jagan.The CBI arrested Jagan in May 2012 and he was in jail for 16 months, before being let off on bail in September 2013. He became the chief minister of residuary Andhra Pradesh in May 2019.Raju contended in his petition that Jagan had tried to influence several officials, who were co-accused in his case, by posting them in key positions such as chief secretary, special chief secretary, principal secretary and advisor to the government.He also pointed out that after becoming the chief minister, Jagan had been avoiding attending the trial in the CBI court on the pretext that he was preoccupied with his Constitutional responsibilities. “As a result, several witnesses mentioned by the CBI in the charge-sheets have not been able to come forward to depose against him in the trial court,” he argued.The CBI court disagreed with the arguments of the rebel YSRCP MP that Jagan had violated the bail conditions.The court observed that there was no complaint from any of the witnesses stating that Jagan tried to intimidate them or influence them after coming to power. It also felt that Raju’s apprehensions were purely hypothetical and not substantiated by any material evidence.Reacting to the CBI court’s judgement, the rebel MP said he would challenge it in the high court. “If I don’t get justice in the high court, too, I will move the Supreme Court,” he said.Earlier in the day, the Telangana high court dismissed a petition of Raju requesting for transfer of his petition seeking cancellation of Jagan’s bail from the CBI special court to another criminal court, on the suspicion that the judgement could have been leaked to Sakshi, the media house owned by the chief minister.The high court found fault with the MP for not trusting the CBI court. It observed that the reasons cited by Raju for seeking the transfer of case to another court lacked any merit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-cancellation-of-jagan-s-bail-101631733180570.html
16-09-2021||India||PMK to contest rural body polls alone, to remain in NDA||Chennai: In what appears to be the first crack in the AIADMK-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Tamil Nadu, the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) president GK Mani has announced to contest next month’s rural local body polls in nine districts alone.Mani, however, clarified that there were no problems in the alliance and “we are still in the NDA”.Mani explained that the PMK’s senior leadership and office bearers of the nine districts had a meeting via Zoom on Tuesday to discuss the polls where they decided that they should contest alone. “The poll dates were announced only a day ago and there are only a few days left to file nomination. So, everyone felt that if we go back to discussing with the AIADMK it will get delayed further and there will be confusion over who should contest so it was a singular demand that we contest alone,” said Mani. On late Tuesday night, Mani released a statement announcing that they will go alone in the polls to be held on October 6 and October 9. He added that this was being made with approval of PMK founder Dr S Ramadoss and youth wing secretary Anbumani Ramadoss.The districts that will go to the polls include Kanchipuram, Chengalpattu, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Tiruppattur, Vellore, and Ranipet.News quickly spread that the PMK had walked out of the alliance and that Ramadoss spoke ill of the AIADMK. “People are scheming and spreading rumours. I want to clarify that ‘doctor ayiah’ (the way the party addresses its founder) hasn’t spoken bad about Edappadi Palaniswami or anyone in the AIADMK.” It appears that the AIADMK was caught unawares. “We know under what pressure the PMK has taken this stand,” AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar told reporters. “The PMK will be the loser going on their own.”PMK, an influential Vanniyar-caste based party, has a stronghold in seven of the 9 districts where polls are to be held. A PMK leader, on condition of anonymity, said contesting alone will work in their favour. “Local body polls aren’t like the assembly or parliament elections,” the leader said. “The individual matters here and people will vote based on a local person who will get things done for them.”Elections in these nine districts were not held in 2019 along with the rest of the state due to the bifurcation of old districts and creation of new ones.The NDA-led by AIADMK in the state with the BJP and the PMK as constituents has been in place since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The PMK confirmed its alliance with AIADMK for the assembly elections only at the last minute after the state government rushed through a legislation to provide 10.5% reservation to Vanniyars within the 20% MBC quota in jobs and educational institutions to appease its core vote bank. The PMK won only 5 of the 23 seats it contested in the April 6 assembly election.After the DMK came to power, the PMK has supported it on a few issues inside the assembly. The PMK voted in favour of resolutions to repeal the CAA and farm laws, while the AIADMK and the BJP had walked out. Meanwhile, the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) led by actor-turned-political Vijayakanth also announced that his party will contest the rural polls alone despite being in an alliance with the TTV Dhinakaran led Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmk-to-contest-rural-body-polls-alone-to-remain-in-nda-101631733062042.html
16-09-2021||India||Low conviction rate continues to haunt Karnataka police: NCRB data||Bengaluru: Despite its recent strides in introducing technology in police investigations, a low conviction rate continues to haunt Karnataka police. According to the data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Karnataka police recorded a conviction rate of 51.2% in cases registered under the Indian Penal Code, while their counterparts have registered a far higher number. While Delhi police registered a conviction rate of 85.6%, neighboring Chennai recorded 66.0% convictions in cases investigated by their police. Telangana and Maharashtra police too scored more than Karnataka police, with conviction rates of 64.5% and 58.0%. Bengaluru city police too recorded a low conviction rate compared to the police departments in other major metro cities. Chennai, New Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai recorded conviction rates of 69.9%, 85.5%, 55%, and 65.9%, respectively. While Karnataka police chief, DG & IGP Praveen Sood said that the state police will be working towards increasing these numbers, another senior officer said the state suffers from bad investigation practices. “We have a good detection record, especially in major cases. But we also have a system where the police inspectors get transferred as early as one year, from the city. This is not the case in other states. This clearly affects the trial,” said the officer on the condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, according to the report, Karnataka saw a reduction in cases of crime against women registered in the state. While 13,514 and 13,828 cases of crime against women were registered in the state during 2018 and 2019, the cases in 2020 reduced to 12,680. A case of assault on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty was recorded the most in the state. 4,751 cases was registered under the section which amount to sexual harassment. “Compared to many states, the numbers in Karnataka are low. It will be unfair to say women in Karnataka are unsafe because so many cases are registered. Police have started several initiatives to ensure women’s safety in the state and they will continue. At the same, we are encouraging women to come forward and lodge complaints; if you look at our track record, you can see that we have arrested the accused in all major cases of crime against women,” said Sood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/low-conviction-rate-continues-to-haunt-karnataka-police-ncrb-data-101631733060915.html

16-09-2021||India||Bengaluru reported most cases filed against civic agencies for causing death: NCRB data||: Bengaluru led the country in registering cases against civic authorities for causing death due to negligence in 2020, according to the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) latest report. Its 18 cases account for 85% of all such cases reported in the country. Mumbai and New Delhi accounted for the three other cases reported in this category, while all other major cities didn’t book any civic authorities for death due to negligence.Even though the number of cases is less compared to 49 in 2019, the numbers remain promising as in 2018, the city had booked civic authorities for their negligence only thrice. However, no data was available on how many of them were charge-sheeted and how many convictions were reported.A senior traffic police official said that in the past few years, there has been demand among people to hold the civic agencies responsible for the death due to bad infrastructure. Taking the example of a recent case where a 64-year-old was killed in an accident because of the bad condition of the road, he said a case was registered against the civic agencies. But police face criticism from city-based activists for not taking these cases to their logical conclusion. The city was also a fifth in the country in the number of cases reported under the Indian Penal Code. The rate of crime in the city, that is, number of crimes per 100,000 population, was 234.9. In comparison, Chennai reported a crime rate of 1,016.4, while Kochi and Hyderabad reported 282.2 and 206.2, according to the NCRB data.Bengaluru also topped the country for the number of cases registered under the Information Technology Act. While it reported 8,892 cases under this section, the second-highest number under this Act was reported in Lucknow, which accounted for 1,451 cases.“We have been booking cases meticulously for the past few years and this could be seen in the number of cases registered in the city,” said Karnataka police chief Praveen Sood. “Yes, we are registering the highest number of cases, but since many of the cybercrimes originate outside the country, detection is difficult. So we have started a process, where people can recover the money they lost due to Phishing or other cybercrimes by calling a dedicated number -- 112,” he said.We have created a network with the banks and whenever someone calls us, we are freezing the account used for stealing money. The money from the frozen transaction is later returned to the victim through a court process,” he said. In major crimes, Bengaluru reported the second-highest number of murders in the country, after Delhi. As many as 179 murders were reported, and 191 persons lost their lives in the city. In comparison, 204 murders were reported in Bengaluru in 2019 and 210 people had lost their lives.Bengaluru also reported the highest number of cases of abetment to suicide. With 99 cases and 101 victims, the city surpassed New Delhi in this section, which reported 88.Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said this is an area where a revision is required. “We have come across many instances where abetment to suicide is reported without solid evidence to back the claim. But, we are not denying anyone their right to register a complaint,” he added. The city also reported the highest number of cases under the Dowry Prohibition Act. Bengaluru reported 580 cases, followed by Delhi at 14 cases. “Number of cases being high is a good sign and concern as well. The higher numbers show police are taking more complaints, but there are allegations of this rule being misused,” said a senior police officer. The last two categories where Bengaluru recorded high number of cases were drug cases under (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985) and action taken against foreigners. In 2020, Bengaluru booked 2,766 cases under NDPS, second only to Mumbai which recorded 3,509 cases. “This is the result of the campaign Bengaluru police started in early 2020. We have been cracking down on drug suppliers in the city,” said Sood. He added that the increase in cases registered under the foreigner’s Act is directly related to those filed under NDPS and IT Act. “We have seen involvement of overstaying foreign citizens in drug cases and cybercrimes,” the police chief said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-reported-most-cases-filed-against-civic-agencies-for-causing-death-ncrb-data-101631732826819.html
16-09-2021||India||Despite ban, workers continue to demand gawking charges in Kerala||Thiruvananthapuram: A consultant with a Mumbai-based private logistics company, Rajeswari S Pillai, who was transporting heavy equipment cargo to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Research Centre (VSSC), took 10 days to cover 70 kms from Kollam to Thumba on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram. Almost every day she walked six to 10 kms with the consignment-laden truck with 80 wheels that moved at a snail’s pace, and rested in the accompanying car for several days. She was happy to notice that people waited for the giant truck along the national highway and clicked enough, and that police and district authorities were at their best to ensure smooth passage to the heavy vehicle. But a dramatic twist was awaiting her at the finishing point -- a group of people lied on the road asking for ‘nokku koolie’, gawking charges, for unloading the cargo. Nokku koolie is the money charged by trade union workers for the work either done by machine or others from the customer as their right. Pillai told the people that only heavy cranes can unload the equipment. They said they have no problem with it, but they should get gawking charges. Initially the demand was ₹I0 lakh, later it came down to ₹5 lakh. But she stood her ground. Stranded on the road for three hours, the blockade was finally lifted after the CM’s office intervened and some of the protestors were arrested. Later 50 people were booked. “I am against paying people who are not doing any work. I don’t want to explain the incident anymore. But I wish it is the last such ‘nokku kooli’ incident in my beautiful state,” Pillai said. Last week the Kerala high court cited the incident while hearing another case related to ‘nokku kooli’ and asked the government to explain new measures taken to end the menace once and for all. “This practice was banned years ago, but it is still continuing. It is inviting bad name to the state. We are getting regular complaints. The government should take strict action against those who demand it,” the HC said, seeking a detailed report from the state police chief in two weeks. ‘Nokku koolie’ was banned in 2018 by the Left Front government, but it is still prevalent in many parts of the state. In 2002 a law was framed -- Kerala Loading and Unloading (Regulation of wages and restriction of unlawful practices) Act -- to restrict the practice, but it continued. In 2017 the high court had pulled up the state government, forcing it to ban the practice in 2018, but the menace is far from over. There were many judgments against the organised crime of fleecing, but often police and the government authorities turn a blind eye to it, fearing retaliation by militant trade union workers. Investors say the practice debilitates industrial growth of Kerala.Facing criticism, the government is planning to give more teeth to the law banning “nokku kooli’. “The government is considering stringent provisions, including non-bailable provisions, to deal with the menace,” said a senior official who did not want to be named. Though almost all trade unions admit that such worn-out practices invite bad name to the state, they discreetly support such elements. Last week K N Nair, who was building a house on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram, brought marbles and other household material from north India, and headload workers sought ₹25,000 to unload them. When he refused, he was threatened and he finally called the police. Though police settled the issue, he met some of the headload workers on the advice of local leaders and paid them ₹8000 even as the work was done by others. “I was scared that they will destroy unloaded material in the night,” he Nair. Around 300,000 headload workers are registered under the workers’ welfare board representing various trade unions and their resting places on roadsides are a common sight in the state. Besides these registered workers, many others also play their role to fleece money. They survey industrial areas and residential colonies frequently to spot vehicles carrying goods and reach there immediately. They demand payment though they only watch while goods are unloaded by cranes or in-house workers. Statistics with the labour department shows that only 11 major cases were filed since the ban came into force in 2018, but industrialists and others say it was only tip of the iceberg and many complaints are getting withdrawn forcefully. They say the practice is continuing because militant workers enjoy political patronage. Though there are units the of Kerala headload workers’ welfare board and labour offices in every district to deal with such issues, many do not approach them fearing retaliation, say builders and industrialists. “Gawking charge is an unhealthy practice and it invites enough bad publicity. If workers are facing any problem, it should be addressed. There should be a proper mechanism to enforce labour rules at the grassroots,” said a spokesman of the Confederation of Indian Industry Kerala chapter on condition of anonymity. “Leaders’ words and deeds never match in the state. They support such elements and disown them in public. These leaders are responsible for making the state a graveyard of industries,” said Kitex group MD Sabu Verghese. His group had recently shifted its bases to Telangana alleging witch-hunt. Many trade union leaders said they are against the practice but a concerted campaign is on to portray workers in bad light and dent the state’s image citing isolated incidents. “We are against it. We have taken strong action against erring ones. But some vested interests portray isolated incidents to paint a grim picture,” said CITU (Centre of Indian Trade Unions) state president Anathalavattom Anandan. He said the equipment-laden truck at Thumba was blocked by local people led by a parish priest demanding jobs to locals, but the blame was put on workers of the area. The priest was not available for comments. But many said headload workers provoked local people to join the blockade and when it turned a big issue, they backtracked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-ban-workers-continue-to-demand-gawking-charges-in-kerala-101631732821041.html
16-09-2021||India||BJP’s proximity to Chirag Paswan irks JD(U) in Bihar||BJP’s proximity with the LJP (Chirag) group and its leaders openly saying that he is a part of the NDA has not gone down well with its alliance partner, the JD (U), which has made it clear that its return to NDA should be a collective decision. The way LJP leader Chirag Paswan played a role in the Bihar assembly elections, it became clear that his entry into the NDA would be difficult. Along with JD (U), BJP leaders also kept their distance from him. But after the death anniversary of his father Ram Vilas Paswan, suddenly, a section of the BJP in Bihar seems to be reaching out to him. After Bihar minister and BJP leader Neeraj Kumar Bablu raised the political heat by maintaining that Paswan is part of the NDA, BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal also toed the same line but diplomatically. “Things are absolutely clear. Those who are part of NDA are in front. Today LJP is a part of NDA and Pashupati Paras is our minister. It’s not about the individual here, it’s about the party. Today LJP is a part of NDA and parties do not belong to individuals. A party is a party and there is no compromise with the individual, there is a compromise with the party,” he said on Tuesday. This was followed by a statement of Muzaffarpur BJP MP Ajay Nishad that he was welcome in the NDA. “He has a good support base and his return will definitely strengthen the NDA,” said Nishad on Wednesday. The growing closeness of BJP leaders, who turned up in large numbers to attend Ram Vilas’s death anniversary event on Sunday has not gone well with the JD (U). “An accepted norm of the coalition should be followed. When we are part of the alliance, we will sail and sink together,” said JD (U) national principal general secretary, K C Tyagi. “How can we forget the damage done to our party by the LJP in assembly polls? Why is our alliance partner maintaining a soft corner?” asked Tyagi. He, however, said that all is well within the NDA and maintained that is why the party (JD-U) is demanding a co-ordination committee to look into such issues. “Despite ideological differences, such statements should be avoided,” he said. A top JD (U) functionary said that the senior BJP and NDA leaders had made it clear that anyone who does not accept Nitish Kumar’s face as the leader of Bihar NDA cannot be a part of NDA, hence Chirag Paswan’s LJP is not part of the NDA. Political experts believe that the BJP does not want to totally alienate Chirag Paswan as his faction can take control of the party any time. “The response that Chirag got during his Aashirwad Yatra is an eye opener for the BJP. The BJP knows that Ram Vilas Paswan’s vote bank will remain with him. And in case of any future break-up, he can be an asset for the BJP,” feels Gyandendra Yadav, associate professor of sociology, College of Commerce, Patna. A senior NDA leader said that the BJP has started teasing the JD (U) after the party embarrassed the government on the Pegasus and caste census issue. The BJP countered this when PM Modi talked to Chirag and his family and sent a two page obituary letter also. “The letter was a clear message to BJP leaders in the state that we cannot afford to ignore Chirag Paswan,” said a senior BJP leader. The developments come after a split in the LJP in June and after a quick turn of events when Pashupati Paras was made a Union minister. The Lok Sabha Speaker was quick to give recognition to the Pashupati faction.The Paswans are the most aggressive section of Dalits. Out of the 16 per cent Dalit population in the state, 5-6 per cent are Paswans, according to the 1931 Census data. Since 1999, the late Ram Vilas Paswan was able to swing the results in favour of whichever alliance he was a part of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-proximity-to-chirag-paswan-irks-jd-u-in-bihar-101631732760496.html
16-09-2021||India||EC powers not ornaments, should act against parties that breach norms: HC||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday observed that the Election Commission’s (EC) powers are not “ornaments” and the panel should take action against political parties who violate its guidelines on “corrupt practices”.“You are doubtful about your powers. There is a judgment by the Supreme Court. That means some wrong is committed by the party. You are ECI. If some party is committing a wrong, what power you are vested with, take action…,” the bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh observed.The high court was hearing a petition filed by two lawyers, Parashar Narayan Sharma and Capt Gurvinder Singh, which asked the high court to declare election promises by political parties to give money to people without doing any work as a corrupt electoral practice.The petition cited the Nyuntam Aay Scheme, or NYAY, announced by the Congress in 2019 ahead of the general elections as one example. It said the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) also offered cash to certain sections of the society ahead of the general elections the same year. The proposed minimum income guarantee scheme, which sought to guarantee ₹72,000 a year to the country’s poorest 20% of households, was a major poll plank for the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections.When the Election Commission’s lawyer Anjana Gosain said during Wednesday’s hearing that the poll panel has already issued guidelines in relation to “corrupt practices” and sent the same to the political parties, the high court shot back.“Why are you shying away from taking action? Start taking action. Don’t just issue notices and letters. Let us see what action you are taking. Proposed actions also, you can state…. Powers are not ornaments. Use your powers for the welfare of the public at large, this is what the petitioner is saying. Take action, not (just) issue notices and orders,” the bench said.To be sure, the high court did not get into the details of the arguments presented by the petitioner during Wednesday’s hearing. Apart from the EC, the high court also issued notices to the Congress and the TDP, the two parties who promised cash transfers in their election manifestoes in the past.Senior counsel Soumya Chakraborty, appearing for the petitioners, said that “when cash is offered, not against any labour, it is not supported by any policy.”“In Covid-19, funds were put in accounts of people. (But) it was an extraordinary situation. If political parties start the trend of giving money not against any work, our industries, agriculture will finish,” he submitted.The plea contended that “note for vote” promises violate Section 123 of the Representation of Peoples Act which deals with corrupt practices and bribery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-powers-not-ornaments-should-act-against-parties-that-breach-norms-hc-101631732640301.html
16-09-2021||India||Power to L-G disenfranchises the people of Delhi: AAP to SC||The Delhi government has told the Supreme Court that an amendment act enacted by the Centre in March gives overriding powers to the Lieutenant Governor (LG) over the Delhi legislature and executive, and is unconstitutional because it has “disenfranchised” the people of Delhi by taking away power from their elected representatives and violating the lawmaking authority of the Delhi assembly.The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021 and the Transaction of Business of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Rules, 1993 came into effect from March 28, 2021, by which some crucial provisions of the earlier act stood amended.The term “government” as referred to in any law passed by Delhi assembly was amended to mean “Lieutenant Governor” (by adding a new clause (3) to Section 21 of the GNCTD Act), and the opinion of the LG was made mandatory for executing any decision of a minister or council of ministers on certain matters under any law in force (by adding a proviso to Section 44(2) of the Act).The Delhi government has submitted in a petition to the Supreme Court that saying “government” means LG extends the Union’s executive power beyond the three excepted subjects – land, law and order and police -- over which the Centre has authority. “The amendment to Section 44 turns this entire scheme on its head and gives the LG executive power through the back door. Hence, this amendment also ought to be struck down,” the petition argued.The petition, filed on August 9, through advocate Shadan Farasat, was mentioned by the Delhi government represented by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Monday before the Chief Justice of India (CJI) for an urgent listing. The CJI agreed to list the matter without specifying a date. The copy of the petition was made available only on Wednesday.“The impugned provisions as amended by the Amendment Act have in effect disenfranchised the people of Delhi, and violated their political rights under the Constitution in as much as the Amendment Act takes away the power from their elected representatives and gives it to an unelected official, being the LG,” the petition said.It further stated: “The Amendment Act, by giving the LG overriding powers over the Delhi legislature and the executive, strikes at the root of representative democracy….. giving the LG the power to veto the will of the people of Delhi…from expressing their sovereign will through their elected representatives.”The petition also contended that the GNCTD Act “diminishes the constitutionally guaranteed powers and functions of the elected legislative assembly and council of ministers of the NCT of Delhi” and overturns the constitutionally stipulated balance between the Delhi and Union governments.The provisions of the 2021 Act, the petition said, “are an attempt to treat the LG as the default administering authority over the NCT of Delhi” by authorising him to withhold consent from bills that, in his judgment, may be “incidentally” outside the scope of legislative assembly’s legislative powers and by empowering him interfere in the day-to-day administration of the NCT.The provisions “impermissibly encroach” on the scope of the Delhi legislative assembly’s “core legislative functions” by interfering with the assembly’s power to frame its own rules of business or to hold the executive to account, the petition added.The new law prohibits the assembly from making any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider matters of day-to-day administration of the Capital and conduct any inquiry in relation to administrative decisionsThe accompanying amendments to the 1993 Transaction of Business Rules have dented the independence and working of the assembly, according to the petition. Article 239AA of the Constitution recognises Delhi as the National Capital Territory having an LG and an assembly allowed to legislate on all other matters other than three excluded subjects – land, law and order and police, where Centre alone can legislate.“Introduction of a deeming provision in Rule 49 of 1993 Rules now allows for any and every matter to be referred by the LG to the central government,” the petition said, adding that the amendments have vested direct executive authority in the secretaries of the Delhi government, allowing them to perform without reference to and even in derogation of the orders of the concerned ministers or council of ministers.The petition held the current amendments violate a 2018 decision of the Supreme Court in Government of NCT of Delhi v Union of India which interpreted Article 239AA and said: “The exercise of establishing a democratic and representative form of Government for NCT of Delhi… would turn futile if the Government of Delhi that enjoys the confidence of the people of Delhi is not able to usher in policies and laws over which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has power to legislate for NCT of Delhi.”The petition said that the basis of this judgment still remains as Article 239AA has not been amended.The Union Ministry of Home Affairs had on April 29, 2021, said that the “objective of the Amendment Act is to make it more relevant to the needs of the Capital” and “further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the Lt. Governor (LG)”. “The Amendment would ensure better governance in the NCT of Delhi and lead to improved implementation of schemes and programmes meant for the common people of Delhi... The amendments to the GNCTD Act, 1991, in no way alter the constitutional and legal responsibilities of the elected government to take necessary action, in respect of the subjects transferred to them in the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution of India, including subjects such as health, education, etc,” the statement said.“…In 2016, disputes and differences arose between the L-G and the Delhi government in respect of powers, duties and governance... The constitutional bench of Supreme Court had held that the council of ministers shall inform all its decisions to the L-G but that does not mean that the concurrence of the L-G is required,” said AAP in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/power-to-l-g-disenfranchises-the-people-of-delhi-aap-to-sc-101631732583504.html
16-09-2021||India||Centre to take over irrigation projects in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana||Hyderabad The Central government is set to take over all the completed and ongoing major and medium irrigation projects on Krishna and Godavari rivers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh with effect from October 14, according to the gazette notifications issued by the Union ministry of Jal Shakti on July 15.As per the notification, the operation and maintenance of as many as 36 irrigation projects on Krishna river, including Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala, along with their canals and irrigation systems, would come under the purview of Krishna River Management Board (KRMB).Similarly, another 70 projects on Godavari river, including Kaleshwaram and Polavaram would be brought under Godavari River Management Board (GRMB). Both the boards would be directly under the control of the Union ministry of Jal Shakti.On Sunday, Union Jal Shakti secretary AK Das issued orders appointing two chief engineers each to KRMB and GRMB to oversee the functioning of these boards. MK Sinha and G K Agarwal, both chief engineers in Central Water Commission, would look after the GRMB, while TK Sivarajan from Coimbatore and Anupam Prasad from Lucknow were appointed for KRMB.The four CEs will look after the works of Boards for three months or till further orders, Das said.The Jal Shakti ministry also held a meeting J Chandrashekhar Iyer, chairman of GRMB and M P Singh of KRMB on Monday in New Delhi to discuss the modalities of the implementation of the gazette notifications on the operation and maintenance of the projects.WHY CENTRA CONTROL OVER IRRIGATION PROJECTS?In a bid to avoid river water disputes between the two Telugu states post bifurcation, provisions were incorporated in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act 2014 for the effective management of river waters by constituting river management boards for Godavari and Krishna. An apex council headed by Union Jal Shakti Minister was constituted for the supervision of the functioning of these boards.Though the boards were constituted in 2014 itself, their jurisdiction over the projects and functioning had not been finalised for a long time, as a result of which both the Telugu states had been at loggerheads over drawing of river water every monsoon, especially in Krishna basin.As per the Krishna tribunal award, out of 811 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) allotted to erstwhile combined state, Telangana was allocated 299 tmc ft of water and Andhra Pradesh 512 tmc ft. But both the states accused each other of drawing excess water than what was allocated, especially in Krishna.At last in October 2020, it was decided at the apex council meeting to notify the jurisdiction of the two boards and entrust the administration, regulation, maintenance and operation of the projects under the two rivers to these boards.Accordingly, the Union ministry of Jal Shakti issued two separate gazette notifications on July 15, notifying the jurisdiction of KRMB and GRMB and entrusting them to take over the irrigation projects.STATES OPPOSE TOTAL CONTROL BY CENTREHowever, both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have their own reservations over the implementation of gazette notification. A senior official of the Andhra Pradesh irrigation department said on condition of anonymity that the state government was opposing bringing all the irrigation projects under the purview of the boards.“We requested that only major projects on Krishna river like Nagarjunasagar and Srisailam be brought under the purview of KRMB since there is a dispute with Telangana over water releases every year. The other projects can remain under the control of the state government,” he said.Telangana, too, has been opposing major projects like Kaleshwaram under the GRMB, because it was conceived much before the bifurcation of the combined state. Moreover, it would be difficult for the boards to run so many irrigation projects, since water releases should be done according to the requirement of the farmers in the command area.“We have been asking the Centre to defer the implementation of the gazette notification but there is no positive response from it,” a Telangana irrigation official said.As per the gazette notification, both the Telugu states would have to bear the expenditure on salaries and allowances of the personnel belonging to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who would man the irrigation projects. Besides, the two states would also have to deposit ₹200 crore each for the operation of the two boards within the next two months.It is learnt the two states have expressed their inability to deposit this money with the boards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-take-over-irrigation-projects-in-andhra-pradesh-telangana-101631732581872.html
16-09-2021||India||Karntaka MLAs allege corruption in Covid tests at Bengaluru airport, govt denies charge||Bengaluru: Authorities at Bengaluru International Airport are trying to profiteer from Covid-19 tests for inbound and outbound passengers, legislators alleged in the state assembly on Wednesday. The state government, however, denied the charge.Vinsha Nero, the sole nominated member in the 225-member lower house of the legislature, said officials in charge of Covid-19 testing at the airport were openly taking bribes for providing results in quick time.Narrating her own experience, Nero said: “There is a lot of corruption at the airport.”“I had tested myself in Bowring hospital and went there (airport), they did not scan it and said they won’t accept it. They said that if you pay ₹800, it will take 6 hours. If you give ₹3,200, it will take 2 hours and you won’t miss your flight,” Nero told in the ongoing monsoon session of the assembly.“There are four to five people (and) they said that if I pay ₹1,200, he (official) will only get me the result. Not even 3 minutes and I paid ₹9,000 in the airport despite of them knowing I am an MLA,” she said.The statements come at a time when the state government has been trying to closely monitor people entering the state and minimise chances of spreading the virus.Nero said an official at the airport told her that the staff work only if they are paid.“Like this in one flight there were more than 100 people who paid ₹3,200 plus ₹1,200 bribe to airport officials. Not even 3 minutes, by the time I walked from corner to entrance, they printed the RTPCR and gave it to me,” she alleged.The matter came up after NA Harris, the Congress legislator from Shanthinagar, alleged that the airport was forcing passengers to take RAT tests which cost ₹3,200 as against RTPCR which costs ₹800.He said RAT costs just ₹150-200 outside and officials were forcing people to take tests at the airport at these high prices.The legislator also referred to Abbott Testing, an express cartridge-based test, in which results are given in 30-40 minutes as against RTPCR which takes at least four to five hours.Harris said the RAT test itself was being conducted as Abbott tests and fleecing people.Dr K Sudhakar, minister for health, family welfare and medical education, said there was no rule to take RAT tests and the government has only specified RTPCR. “RTPCR test costs ₹800 and this is given in 4-5 hours,” he said. The minister said only a few Abbott testing was done since it was cartridge-based.Assembly speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri asked the government to take notice and take action in the matter.A spokesperson of Auriga Research Pvt Ltd Lab, the company that conducts test at the airport, said: “The prices charged by us are approved by the state government at ₹3,200 for the Rapid RTPCR (reports within 30 minutes to 1 hour) and ₹800 for the RTPCR (reports within 4 to 5 hours).” “As per the corruption charges, our systems are totally transparent and we have been operating on 24/7 basis since December 2020. We have been giving reports in the stipulated time. Since the Rapid RTPCR are given within 20 to 30 minutes, some passengers feel whether the tests are done or not. But since there are a lot of VIP customers who travel on a regular basis we would have considered some passengers at priority and given their reports at the earliest possible time,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday.It added that decision of accepting the RTPCR reports was at the discretion of airline operators. “We have seen that RTPCR reports of any lab are accepted by them and passengers only choose our services based on the convenience we offer at the airport.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karntaka-mlas-allege-corruption-in-covid-tests-at-bengaluru-airport-govt-denies-charge-101631732524740.html

An official said apart from them, a child died at home “due to aspiration of milk and had nothing to do with illness”. Palwal’s Chief Medical Officer Dr Brahm Deep, who visited the village on Wednesday said the six children who died were aged under 10. They died in hospital, he said, adding that “all patients tested negative for Covid”. All of them did not test positive for dengue, he told PTI over the phone. The authorities at Nuh’s Nalhar Medical College said one of the six children had congestive heart failure with severe anemia. Among other children who died were having symptoms of fever with pneumonitis, loose motion and fever with stiffness of body. Some local residents reportedly complained about poor sanitation in the village. “We have done a survey of all 300 houses in the village. We did 400 tests for malaria, 12 Elisa test for dengue and 400 tests for Covid. All of them were negative,” the chief medical officer said. As for fever, he said, “We are conducting a house-to-house survey. On Sunday, when the survey was started, we had 64 fever cases that day. Today, there are only 12 cases of fever in the total population,” he said, adding that the situation is “under control”. No death has taken place in the past two days, the doctor said. He said no death occurred due to lack of care. All facilities were available, he said. “The situation has been handled very firmly. On Saturday, we came to know about the situation, the same day I stationed my team there,” he said. The Health Department has set up a temporary hospital in the village with the facility of oxygen and medicines, he said, adding that an ambulance has also been stationed. “In every home, we have distributed a mosquito net and we have also disturbed face masks,” he said. The Palwal CMO further said earlier there was resistance related to Covid vaccination in the village. “We are hopeful of covering this village with 100 per cent vaccination this week,” he said.

16-09-2021||India||Not informed by Mysuru administration about temple demolition plans: Karnataka Minister||BengaluruThe Karnataka government on Wednesday said that it was not informed by the Mysuru district administration of its temple demolition plans and termed the action as “wrong”, assuring to discontinue the drive.KS Eshwarappa, minister for rural development and panchayat raj, said all deputy commissioners will be told not to take hasty action. “The government will sit, decide and then direct what needs to be done,” he said.“There is a fear among people about action to demolish temples. I would like to tell all the state’s people that when there is a BJP government in place, the decision to demolish the temple in Mysuru is wrong.” The statements come days after a video showed the Mysuru district administration demolishing a temple.The Karnataka high court had pulled up authorities for failing to take action against illegal structures built on government land, prompting the Mysuru district administration to act. On August 12, the HC said the Supreme Court has stated that all illegal religious structures that were built after September 29, 2009 shall not be tolerated.Eshwarappa said, “This was not just about temples but also that the alleged illegal structures include churches and mosques as well. The BJP government will protect all of them.”Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has assured to discuss the issue in the cabinet meeting on Thursday.Prathap Simha, BJP MP from Mysuru-Kodagu, had used the incident to mobilise support from the Hindu community against the drive. He had even termed churches and mosques as “just prayer halls”, justifying the focus to protect temples.The incident had also seen a rare bonhomie between the BJP and the opposition parties which came together to condemn the incident.Eshwarappa said the action of the administration has given people who protect Indian culture the right to question why only temples were targeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-informed-by-mysuru-administration-about-temple-demolition-plans-karnataka-minister-101631731980057.html
16-09-2021||India||Punjab CM orders high alert as four more arrested in tiffin bomb blast case||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesdayordered an high alert in the state a day after four more members of an Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI-backed) terrorist module, involved in an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) tiffin bomb last month, were arrested on Tuesday. With the recent arrests, the state police busted the fourth terror module with links to Pakistan over the past 40 days.“Taking note of the increased attempts by terror groups to disturb the state’s peace, the CM has directed the police to be on high alert, particularly in view of schools and educational institutions reopening, the festive season and the assembly polls to be held next year”, reads a press release issued by the state information and public relations department on Wednesday.Police said the four men arrested were identified as Rubal Singh, Vicky Bhutti, Malkeet Singh and Gurpreet Singh, alias Gopi. Rubal, also wanted in a murder case of September 1 . While Gurpreet was picked up from Ambala, the other three were nabbed from their villages in Ajnala, Amritsar, the police said. Their fifth accomplice, Gurmukh Brar, was arrested on August 20, the police added.Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said two terrorists from Pakistan named in the case registered in August are International Sikh Youth Federation chief Lakhbir Singh Rode and Qasim, an intelligence officer.On August 8, 2021, these terrorist operatives carried out a recce of Sharma Filling Station during the day and placed the IED at about 11pm, with the timer set to eight minutes. The blast took place at 11.30pm.All five arrested operatives, along with Rode and Qasim, have been booked under Sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Unlawful Activities (prevention) Act and the Explosive Substance Act.The DGP added that Qasim and Rode had promised to transfer over ₹2 lakh to five arrested accused for carrying out the blast. “Rubal and Vicky Bhutti were in touch with Qasim, who had reportedly tasked the four members to blast an oil tanker for causing maximum damage to people and property,” the top cop said, adding that the blast was made on August 8 when, at about 11.30 pm, the Ajnala police received information that an Oil Tanker (PB-02 CR 5926) parked at Sharma Filling Station Ajnala, located on the Amritsar-Ajnala Road near village Bhakha Tara Singh, had caught fire. Ultimately, the fire brigade doused the flames.Preliminary investigations revealed that Gurmukh had placed the tiffin IED at Hambowal on Jalandhar-Amritsar highway, from where, on August 6, 2021, Vicky, Malkeet and Gurpreet Singh picked it up on the directions of Rode and Qasim. The trio hid the bomb near a canal in the Rajasansi area.A pen-drive was attached with the tiffin box, which contained intructions to operate the Tiffin Bomb IED.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-orders-high-alert-as-four-more-arrested-in-tiffin-bomb-blast-case-101631731682783.html
16-09-2021||India||Crimes against Dalits, tribals increased in Covid pandemic year: NCRB||A scheduled caste (SC) person faced crime every 10 minutes in India in the past year, cumulating to a total of 50,291 cases registered in 2020, an increase of 9.4% from the previous year, data from the National Crime Records Bureau said. Crimes against scheduled tribe (ST) communities also increased by 9.3% to a total of 8,272 cases in the year. The rise in crimes against SCs and STs bucked the broader trend of a drop in crime under some major heads – except Covid violations -- last year, due to the pandemic and the 68-day-long lockdown that began on March 25, 2020. Overall crimes rose 28% due to criminal cases related to Covid-19 violations, but crimes against women slowed 8.3%, rape cases dropped 12.4%, and abduction decreased by 19.3%. “Our experience says that when it comes to atrocities on Dalits, efforts are made to dilute the seriousness of the violence and shield accused people. It is a serious matter that despite a pandemic and the presence of constitutional and legislative safeguards, crimes against them are increasing,” said Rahul Singh of the National Dalit Movement for Justice.The data on crimes offered four broad takeaways. One, the largest chunk of crimes against SCs and STs in the past year was that of simple hurt – bruises, injuries resulting out of skirmishes or fights as opposed to more serious broken limbs or maiming. A third of the crimes against SCs was registered as simple hurt, while the figure stood at a fourth for STs. This confirmed anecdotal evidence of rising social tensions in the countryside as migrant labourers – many of whom came from marginalised castes and tribes – were forced to return from the city to their home villages, where very few of them owned land or commanded social capital. To be sure, simple hurt always form a big proportion of crimes against SCs, but the 2020 figures represented a four percentage point rise from 2019. Two, crimes against SCs continued to be concentrated in a handful of states. Uttar Pradesh constituted 25% of all crimes recorded against SCs and reported 12,714 cases in all. To be sure, this can be attributed to the state’s high population (it also has the highest population of SCs) and better reporting mechanisms owing to a dense network of ground-level activists. It was followed by Bihar (7,368), Rajasthan (7,017) and Madhya Pradesh (6,899). Together, these four states account for two-thirds of all crimes against SCs in India despite accounting for only around 40% of the country’s 197 million scheduled caste people. The rate of crimes – which is a measure of crime cases relative to the population of SC -- was highest in Rajasthan, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. This was identical to last year. A similar analysis for STs doesn’t hold because they’re concentrated in a few states, unlike SCs who are more evenly spread. Three, the nature and quantum of crimes against Dalits is very different in big cities and the countryside and smaller hamlets. This underlines the logic behind migration of lower-caste communities from villages to cities since Independence, and the exhortation of BR Ambedkar to leave the “sink of localism” in India’s villages. In 2020, a total of 1,485 crimes against SCs were registered in India’s 19 metropolitan cities with a population of two million or more – indicating that 97% of the crimes against Dalits occurred in small towns and villages. The figure in big cities represented a drop of 10.9% from the previous year – a sharp contrast to overall numbers that went up. To be sure, it could also mean that lockdown strictures were more rigidly enforced in big cities, leading to lower crimes. The nature of crimes against SCs in big cities was also different. In the 20 big towns, criminal intimidation and rape were the most common crimes against Dalits. Overall, simple hurt and atrocities cases were the most common. Four, the court pendency rate of cases, especially in cases filed under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of) Atrocities Act, continues to be low. This also confirms standalone reports of cases of major caste crimes taking years to reach final stage in courts and difficulty faced by Dalits in proving crimes against upper-castes. The court pendency rate of cases under the SC/ST Act stood at 96.5% in 2020, up from the 94% last year. At the end of the year, 177,379 cases were pending trial under the special legislation meant to protect the marginal castes and tribes. The overall pendency rate in the country for all cases was 91.3% for special and local laws (SLL) crimes and 93.8% for Indian Penal Code crimes. Only 216 cases from the 50,291 crimes against SCs in 2020 resulted in convictions. 3,192 cases resulted in acquittals. “These pendency numbers bring the adequacy of existing  court infrastructure to adjudicate these cases in question,” said Raja Bagga, a senior programme officer of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative. He pointed out that in a state like Bihar, with 49008 atrocity cases for trial , only 55 were disposed by the courts during the year, leaving 48, 953 ( 99.9% of the cases) pending. Out of these 55 cases, 43 led to acquittal.In West Bengal, only 723 atrocity cases were in court on trial ( one of the lowest among big states), but only two of them were disposed off during the year, both ending up in acquittal.  “Connected to the slow pace of the trials is the low conviction rate of 42.4 % in atrocity cases. The average conviction rate in the country is 59.2 % for IPC cases and 87.5 % in SLL cases.,” Bagga added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crimes-against-dalits-tribals-increased-in-covid-pandemic-year-ncrb-101631731260293.html
16-09-2021||India||Assam teen missing since Sunday found dead; family says she was gang-raped by 6||SILCHAR: A 16-year-old missing since Sunday morning from southern Assam’s Silchar town was found dead on Wednesday; her body floating in the Barak river that flows through the district. Her death touched off massive outrage in the town; scores of people blocked a prominent road and set some vehicles - one of them was a motorcycle owned by one of the accused - afire.The teenager’s family told the police that his daughter was abducted, gang-raped and murder by six men and filed a formal complaint against them at Silchar Sadar police station. Two of the six suspects were immediately arrested; the other four are missing.Her family blamed the police as well, complaining that the local police did not take their complaint seriously when they first reported on Sunday that their young daughter had gone missing.“My daughter has been gang-raped and murdered after being kidnapped. Just after she went missing, we informed the police but today they called us for identifying our daughter’s body. I have appealed to senior officials of the police to catch all the culprits and hang them,” he said.After news of his daughter’s death spread in the town earlier in the day, people came out on the streets in the town’s Ashram Road area and blocked a bypass road. At one point, the mob also pelted stones on security personnel and set two shops owned by relatives of the suspects ablaze. Police fired blank shots to control the mob. At one point, the mob pelted stones on police personnel and burnt down two shops owned by the relatives of an accused.Superintendent of police of Cachar district Ramandeep Kaur Dhillon said, “Family members of the girl have claimed that their daughter was raped. They have lodged a complaint also.”Dhillon said investigators were looking at all angles. The body has been sent for postmortem.On the protests, she said, “People were angry and we can understand their emotions. Our officials tried to convince them by saying that we have arrested few of the accused. But some people were continuously provoking the others, so we had to take a step. Non-lethal weapons were used just to control the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-teen-missing-since-sunday-found-dead-family-says-she-was-gang-raped-by-6-101631731080115.html
16-09-2021||India||Cyber crimes registered 11.8% increase last year: NCRB||Cases of cyber crime recorded an 11.8% increase in 2020, a year when most rates of serious crimes fell, the Crime in India 2020 report shows.Released late on Tuesday by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the report quantifies for the first time the unusual trends in crime and law and order in a year when much of the country was in a lockdown for over two months.HT reported on Wednesday that overall, the number of cognizable cases rose by 28% but if Covid-related violations were removed, the number of new cases dropped compared to 2019. Some of the stark reductions were in cases of kidnapping and abduction, which fell by 19.3%, crime against women (down by 8.3%), crime against children (down by 13.2%) and crime against senior citizens (down by 10.8%). The murder cases increased by one percent.But in case of complaints filed under sections dealing with cyber crime, the number of cases registered last year rose to 50,035 from 44,735 a year before. This ties in with trends seen across the world as more people moved to working and studying from home, spending more time with digital tools.Most of the increase came from states such as Telangana, Assam, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and Maharashtra while cases from the top 20 major cities rose by only 0.8%, suggesting more people were being targeted in smaller cities.The total rate of cyber crime per 100,000 people increased from 3.3 to 3.7 in 2020.“The picture provided by NCRB on cyber crime is very limited,” said Pawan Duggal, an independent expert in cyber security, who has been watching this space for more than two decades. He added that cyber frauds have increased in several countries during pandemic.“The ground reality is overwhelming. Every second person would have been targeted by a cyber fraudster. The actual cyber fraud is much higher. The Covid pandemic has turned cyber fraud as a cottage industry, which was once known to be run from Jamtara in Jharkhand, to several other parts of the country,” he added.To be sure, cyber crime sections include several types of crimes that are either carried out using or primarily target computer systems or assets linked to the internet, such as internet banking and email accounts.Duggal’s allusion was to financial frauds that target citizens by fooling them into sharing sensitive credentials like one-time password (OTP). State police departments have identified several hotbeds of including Bharatpur in Rajasthan, Deoghar in Jharkhand, Gwalior-Chambal region in Madhya Pradesh, Palgar in Maharashtra and Noida in Uttar Pradesh.Officials in Rajasthan said police opened a dedicated cyber police post in Bharatpur on Rajasthan-Uttar Pradesh border, where police from at least 22 states have visited since January 2021. About 40% of cyber fraud cases reported from Hyderabad was traced to Bharatpur.Bharatpur superintendent of police, Devdendra Kumar Bishnoi admitted that many cyber frauds gangs are operating from Pahadi and Kaman areas of the district. “The area of operation of these people are southern states as they believe that police from those states would not come here tracking them. And that is true to some extent. They do not commit local crime,” he said.On average police, from two states come to Bharatpur every week looking for cyber criminals.Police officers said several cases of cyber fraud committed by people living in Bharatpur’s neighbouring districts of Agra and Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, Nuh in Haryana and Gwalior-Chambal belt in Madhya Pradesh have also been reported.Cyber fraud gangs have also been seen to be increasingly active in Maharashtra and are targeting people in several southern states, said Hyderabad Assistant Commissioner of Police (Cybercrime) KVM Prasad.In Jamtara district of Jharkhand, often considered as the epicentre for cyber fraud, close to 150 people were arrested and police of 20 states visited the district in 2020. Local officials now say efforts are being made to wean youth away from such crime, including by opening a library in each panchayat to help them prepare for various government job recruitment tests. “We tried our bit to take youth away from negative activities. But, can’t say it worked fully,” said then district deputy collector Faiz Ahmed Mumtaz.Jharkhand police officers said that cyber fraud has spread from Jamtara to neighbouring Deoghar, from where close to 100 cases have been reported in the last nine months. “We have also made several arrests from this primarily rural district but it appears that many educated young people have found cyber fraud as easy way to make money,” said a Deoghar police officer, who was willing to be not quoted.The spurt in such crimes is now prompting several states to setup dedicated units. Rajasthan has decided to have a cyber police station in every district, Kerala is forming a new cyber police battalion, Telangana has a dedicated cyber crime investigation department, Delhi Police has set up a separate wing for cyber crimes and have a cyber fraud detection unit in every district, and Karnataka has made cyber crime detection training mandatory police personnel in the state.The home ministry now has a dedicated portal for reporting cyber crime ---cybercrime.gov.in. Close to 200,000 complaints have been lodged since the portal was launched in January 2020. The department in November, 2020 asked all states to registers FIRs on complaints received through this portal. Cases were registered in 5,000 of close to 2,00,000 complaints received through the portal in 2020, MHA had said in January 2021.Duggal said the home ministry needs to look at revamping laws to check rising cyber fraud. “In most cases, the person would be out of jail in a few years, if not months. Penalty is not a deterrent. We need more stringent provisions in the Information Technology Act, which was last amended in 2008,” he said.(With inputs from Sachin Saini in Jaipur, Srinivasa Rao Apparasu in Hyderabad and Vishal Kant in Ranchi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyber-crimes-registered-11-8-increase-last-year-ncrb-101631731021285.html
16-09-2021||India||Indo-US cooperation will boost economic dynamism: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday highlighted the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic that have disrupted businesses globally and said that Indo-US cooperation would go a long way in boosting “economic dynamism.”“Covid-19 pandemic has brought newer challenges in terms of disruption of supply chains, downturn in industrial activities, negative growth in travel and tourism industry and there is no doubt Indo-US cooperation will go a long way to restore normalcy and further boost economic dynamism,” Singh said.He was speaking at the Indo-US Economic Summit organised by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce.Singh said various measures taken by the Union government had helped put economic activities back on track, and the first quarter of the year recorded a 20% growth compared to a 24% contraction last year.Singh added that the recovery was a sign of India’s “sound economic fundamentals.” The minister said the country was preparing for “dynamic growth” not just in the financial year 2022 but through the entire decade.“Over the last 100 months, the government has brought many major structural and procedural reforms, which have prepared India to make a quantum jump in terms of growth in this decade,” Singh said, enumerating the steps taken by the government to boost the Make in India initiative, enhance ease of doing business and to make the country an investor-friendly destination.Red tape has given way to red carpet, the minister said, inviting the US industry to participate in the government’s vision of “Make in India and make for the world.”On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India was shedding its image of being a major importer of military hardware and carving an identity for itself as a defence exporter. Modi said the world had taken note of the strides made by the country in defence manufacturing with locally produced equipment ranging from modern grenades, assault rifles and drones to fighter jets and warships.“We have formulated progressive and investor-friendly tax policies. We have said goodbye to retrospective taxation and corrected the mistake of previous governments,” the defence minister said.Talking about labour reforms, Singh said dozens of laws had been compressed into four sets of codes.The Union minister said the government’s decision to notify two lists of 209 defence items that cannot be imported (ban to be implemented progressively from 2021 to 2025) would boost business opportunities.“It may appear that this list will reduce business opportunities for the world. But I want to make it clear, that this list is actually an invitation to increase business collaboration,” the minister said.The items that cannot be imported include AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) systems, light combat aircraft, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, long-range land attack cruise missiles, basic trainer aircraft, different types of helicopters and artillery guns.Singh said foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can set up manufacturing facilities on their own or forge partnerships with Indian companies through joint ventures or technology agreements to capitalise on the Make in India opportunity.“There is a lot of scope for the American and Indian defence industries for co-production and co-development. Indian industry can also supply components to the American industry,” he said. The Indo-US bilateral relationship had made good progress during the last five to seven years, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indous-cooperation-will-boost-economic-dynamism-amid-covid-challenges-rajnath-singh-101631731020122.html
16-09-2021||India||Bhabanipur bypoll: BJP candidate gets EC notice for Covid norms violation||The Election Commission of India on Wednesday issued a show cause notice to Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Priyanka Tibrewal, who is contesting against West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the Bhabanipur bypolls, for allegedly violating Covid-19 safety norms issued by the poll panel. Tibrewal, however, rubbished the allegations.The TMC had lodged a complaint on Tuesdaywith the ECI that Tibrewal had violated the Covid-19 protocols as a large number of BJP workers and leaders had accompanied her when she went to file her nomination on Monday.In view of the pandemic situation, the ECI had banned public meetings and processions before and after filing of nomination, while only three vehicles were permitted within 100 metres of the returning officer’s office where the nomination is filed.The bypolls are due to be held on September 30 and the counting of votes will take place on October 3.“I will reply to the ECI. Only Suvendu Adhikari was with me in my car. Apart from me there were security personnel in another vehicle. Dinesh Trivedi and Arjun Singh didn’t come with me and had reached the Returning Officer ‘s (RO’s) office directly. I cannot control vehicles or two wheelers which were plying on the road. That is the jurisdiction of the police. Why did they allow?” said Tibrewal.Meanwhile, the BJP moved the EC on Wednesday in Delhi seeking more additional central forces in Bhabanipur apprehending violence and rigging. The poll panel has already deployed 15 companies of central forces.Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday offered prayers in a Gurudwara in Bhabanipur. With large political gatherings prohibited because of ongoing Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the state government, both the BJP and the ruling TMC are relying mostly on door-to-door campaigns and their public relations skills for the upcoming bypolls.“Every day Rujira (wife of Mamata’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee) comes to this Gurudwara and even goes to Kalighat temple to offer prayers. She also reads out the scriptures from the Guru Granth Sahib to her daughter. I have visited this Gurudwara many times as it soothes my mind. So we already have a relation with you (Sikh community). I would love to visit the Golden Temple once,” Banerjee said while extending her support once again to ongoing farmers’ protests against the three contentious farm bills.The constituency in the heart of south Kolkata has 206,389 electors out of which 95,143 are female voters, which comes to around 46%. It has a sizeable population of Sikhs and Gujaratis. However, the area is dominated by middle-class Bengalis.While the Congress has already decided not to field any candidate the BJP’s unit in West Bengal the Left Front has announced the name of Srijib Biswas, an advocate, from Bhabanipur.In the April-May 2021 polls, nine candidates contested from Bhabanipur out of which deposit of seven candidates were forfeited. The fight was primarily between the TMC and BJP. Banerjee has to win this bypoll to retain her chief minister’s post after having lost to BJP’s Suvendu Aadhikari in Nandigram in the assembly elections held earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhabanipur-bypoll-bjp-candidate-gets-ec-notice-for-covid-norms-violation-101631730960240.html
16-09-2021||India||RSS, BJP ‘fake Hindus’, says Rahul Gandhi; BJP hits back||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday dubbed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as “fake Hindus” who only “use religion for their benefits”. Addressing the All India Mahila Congress on its foundation day here, the former Congress president said the Congress’ ideology was in complete contrast to that of the RSS and the BJP and “only one of the two ideologies can rule the country.”In his strongly-worded speech at the event, he also accused the duo of indulging in “dalali”. Drawing a comparison with Mahatma Gandhi, the Wayanad MP said: “The BJP-RSS people say they are a Hindu party. In the last 100-200 years, if anyone has understood and practised Hinduism in the best possible way, it is Mahatma Gandhi. So, if Mahatma Gandhi understood the Hindu religion and spent his whole life understanding it, then why did the RSS ideology pump three bullets in his chest.” As a Congress worker, Gandhi said he can never compromise with the ideology of the BJP and RSS. Referring to demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Congress MP said the Narendra Modi government has attacked the “Shakti of Lakshmi” and “Shakti of Durga”. “They call themselves a Hindu party and in the whole country, they attack Lakshmi and Durga. Wherever they go, they kill Lakshmi or Durga and then say we are Hindus,” he alleged. Gandhi claimed that the RSS suppresses “women power” but the Congress party gives an equal platform to women power. The Congress leader alleged that “there are 10-15 people who have the power of Durga and Lakshmi, they are Modi ji ‘s friends.” Lashing out at the Congress leader, the BJP accused him of being “disconnected from the ground”. BJP national general secretary Arun Singh said no one takes the Congress leader seriously.“Rahul Gandhi should not make these statements. He is totally disconnected from the ground. He has no information. That is the main problem,” Singh told reporters.Reacting to Gandhi’s potshot at the RSS over respect for women, Singh said if the Congress leader has any confusion on this he should visit the ground.“No one takes him seriously. He is not a serious person. Look at the track record of Rahul Gandhi. Sometimes he speaks after reading papers, sometimes after copying two three lines, he doesn’t know what is happening on the ground,” Singh said.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said Gandhi’s statement has hurt Hindu sentiments. “In his address, Rahul Gandhi hurt Hindu religious sentiments. Laxmi, Durga, Saraswati are the centre of the sentiments of crores of people. To say that Durga ji has been attacked, using such words is not right in reference to any religion,” Patra told a television channel.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-bjp-fake-hindus-says-rahul-gandhi-bjp-hits-back-101631730840168.html
16-09-2021||India||8.3% dip in crimes against women in 2020: NCRB report||Cases of crime against women in cities were down by 8.3% in the year 2020 when compared to 2019, even though nearly 77 rape cases were reported across the country on an average every day that year, data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) showed.In its latest report on Tuesday, the NCRB, which functions under the Union home ministry, said that a total of 371,503 cases of crime against women were reported across the country last year in comparison to 405,326 in 2019 and 378,236 in 2018.Among states and Union territories, Uttar Pradesh topped the list with maximum number (49,385) of such cases followed by West Bengal (36,439), Rajasthan (34,535), Maharashtra (31,954) and Madhya Pradesh (25,640).Crimes against women includes cases of rape, outraging modesty, dowry deaths and harassment, acid attacks and kidnapping.“Majority of cases under crime against women were registered under ‘Cruelty by Husband or his Relatives’ (30.2%) followed by assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty’ (19.7%), kidnaping and abduction of women (19.0%) and rape (7.2%),” the report said. Of the total cases of crimes against women during the Covid pandemic-induced lockdown, there were 28,046 incidents of rape involving 28,153 victims. Out of the total victims, 25,498 were adults, while 2,655 were below the age of 18 years, the report stated. The number of rape cases, as defined in Indian Penal Code section 376, stood at 32,033 in 2019, 33,356 in 2018 and 32,559 in 2017. The figure for 2016 was 38,947, as per NCRB data from corresponding years.With 5,310 cases, Rajasthan reported the maximum number of rapes in 2020 while Uttar Pradesh reported 2,769 cases, Madhya Pradesh 2,339 cases, Maharashtra 2,061 cases and Assam 1,657 cases. However, Rajasthan saw a decline of 11.45% in rape cases last year when compared to 2019. Similarly, it also saw a dip in crimes against women by 16%. “It is our government’s mandate that none of the complainant, especially women, should return without lodging a complaint. Rape cases are increasing but around 42% are found false after probe or sometimes, the victim forms an agreement with the accused and don’t want to pursue the case,” Rajasthan’s additional director general of police, crime, Ravi Prakash Meharda, said. In case of rape of minors, Madhya Pradesh recorded the most number of incidents with 3,259 cases followed by Maharashtra (2,875) and Uttar Pradesh (2,630). The state saw a mere 1% dip in rape of minors unlike other states such as Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan were the decline ranged from 5% to 10%. Madhya Pradesh also reported the maximum number (17,008) of crimes against children. As the accused in majority of the rape cases known to the victim, a senior police officer on condition of anonymity said it was not a “problem of law and order but a social problem.”“The number is high because of 100% reporting of cases,” said Madhya Pradesh additional director general of police Pragya Richa Shrivastava. Women activists such as Sarika Sinha, convener of Action Aid (an organisation which helps destitute and victims of crime against women), said a poor conviction rate was a major reason behind the high crime rate against children. “Despite making strict laws, including capital punishment, for raping a minor of less than 12 years, the number of cases is not coming down significantly. One of the major reasons is delay in justice and a lower conviction rate,” she said.The NCRB data also showed the rate of crime against women in two Tamil Nadu cities -- Coimbatore and Chennai -- were the lowest when compared to 19 other metro cities.“When there is a declining trend, we have to see through the data from various intersections. Are they complaining? If so, is their report being considered and registered or dismissed? Even in urban areas for gender-based crimes, there isa stigma against reporting and some women get used to this and fail to report,” Sandhiyan Thiyagaran, founder of AWARE (Awareness for Women to Advocate their Rights and Empowerment) India, said, adding: “However, compared to other metros in the country, in Tamil Nadu, the law enforcement agencies help prevent crimes against women such as by patrolling and installing CCTVs. We have a few deterrents that other metros may not have in equal measure.”Among the 19, cities which reported the highest chargesheet rate under the IPC are Surat (96.7%), Coimbatore (96.6%) and Ahmedabad (96.3%). Among states, it is Gujarat (97.1%), Kerala (94.9%) and Tamil Nadu (91.7%). The crime rate is calculated for per one lakh of population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/83-dip-in-crimes-against-women-in-2020-ncrb-report-101631730781414.html
16-09-2021||India||Tension in Assam’s Silchar after missing girl’s body found in Barak River||Tension broke out in Silchar town of Assam on Wednesday afternoon after the body of a 16-year-old girl, who went missing on Sunday, was found floating in the Barak River.According to the police, at least two persons were arrested after the girl’s father lodged a complaint of abduction, gangrape and murder against six people at Silchar Sadar police station. Efforts are underway to nab the remaining accused, they said. “My daughter was gangraped and murdered after being kidnapped. Just after she went missing, we informed the police on Sunday but today, they called to identify our daughter’s body. I have appealed to the higher officials to catch all the culprits and hang them to death,” the minor’s father said. Outraged over the incident, several locals blocked a bypass road, which connects two national highways through Silchar town, and also set ablaze some vehicles in the Ashram Road area alleging police inaction in the case, people familiar with the matter said. The mob also reportedly pelted stones on security personnel and set on fire two shops owned by the relative of an accused, prompting police to blank fire to disperse the crowd, the people cited above added. A team of police, including DIG south Assam, Devjyoti Mukherjee, Cachar district DSP, Dr. Kalyan Kumar Das, officer incharge of Silchar Sadar police station, Chandan Borah, rushed to the spot along with CRPF personnel and a team of fire brigade personnel to take stock of the situation. “Family members of the girl have claimed that their daughter was raped, they have also lodged a complaint. We are investigating the matter from different aspects. After recovering the dead body, it was sent to Silchar Medical College and Hospitals for postmortem. We have so far apprehended two of the accused individuals and the other accused will be behind bars soon,” Cachar district superintendent of police Ramandeep Kaur Dhillon said. Some locals in Ashram Road claimed the prime accused was involved with supply of drugs to students in the area and that the alleged murder was connected to this case. Police, however, could not confirm the allegation and said a probe would be launched into the matter. On the blank fire, Dhillon said, “People were angry and we can understand their emotions. Our officials tried to convince them by saying that we have arrested a few of the accused. But some people were continuously provoking others, so we had to take a step. Non-lethal weapons were used to control the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tension-in-assam-s-silchar-after-missing-girl-s-body-found-in-barak-river-101631730780219.html
16-09-2021||India||Over 100 drafting changes proposed to JPC on data protection bill||The joint parliamentary committee on personal data protection, which met after a hiatus of nearly nine months, is looking at over 100 drafting changes introduced by the new chairperson and BJP MP PP Chaudhary. The committee has also agreed to circulate the draft report, penned under the chairpersonship of Meenakshi Lekhi, as a summary of proceedings, people familiar with the matter said.“Most of the changes appear to be of a legislative drafting nature and majority of them seem cosmetic in nature,” a person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named. “The panel will meet again on Thursday to discuss the bill clause by clause.”The bill will now be referred to as the data protection bill and not the personal data protection bill. Under section 91, it allows the government to access non-personalised and anonymised data for policy purposes. The data protection authority’s ambit under section 49 has also been proposed to be expanded to include covering data breaches and not just personal data breaches, the person mentioned above added.Chaudhary, a former Union minister of law and justice who took over barely two months ago, has offered his own suggestions in report with reference to a number of the clauses. On Wednesday, the panel touched upon the changes, while also seeking that the old draft report, which had been agreed upon by the panel, be circulated among the members. The BJP MP took over from Meenakshi Lekhi, who had to step down as panel chair after she was appointed as a Union minister. The members in December last year had already agreed upon the amendments required to the bill but the report was never presented to Parliament on its due date in the Budget session. The draft report was then deferred to the monsoon session. Hindustan Times on July 8 reported that the data privacy law faced new delays as several members of the parliamentary committee, including its head, were made ministers weeks before the crucial report was due during the Monsoon Session. Moreover, the four new members who have replaced the newly appointed union ministers —BJP MPs Rakesh Sinha, Vinay Sahashrabuddhe, Sudhanshu Trivedi and Aparajita Sarangi — will also be offered a chance to present their own views on the bill.Members are concerned that with the process facing new hurdles, the data protection framework may see another delay. “The committee may end up examining a whole new report, the new members will also make their suggestions,” a second person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named.The draft Personal Data Protection law was introduced in Parliament in December 2019 and is meant to provide the legal framework for the right to privacy of Indian citizens. But it was soon referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee to iron out several contentious issues. The committee has now sought until the winter session to submit its report.The committee has met various stakeholders as it debates far reaching reforms for data protection. It has also carefully analysed the bill that covers cross border transfer of data and the use personal data by government and private companies. Provisions of the bill related to localization of data within the country and curbs on data sharing across borders have come in for criticism from global technology companies. But like many other countries in the world, India wants to ensure the data of its citizens is safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-100-drafting-changes-proposed-to-jpc-on-data-protection-bill-101631730726756.html
16-09-2021||India||PM Modi at Sansad TV launch: ‘In India, democracy is our life stream’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday suggested that better debates and conduct can help parliamentarians connect with more people, as he launched Sansad TV jointly with Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.Sansad TV has been created by merging Lok Sabha TV and Rajya Sabha TV.During his speech, the Prime Minister said that while people usually say that content is king, in his experience, content is also “connect” as better content can reach out to more people.“As much as this applies to the media, it is equally applicable to our parliamentary system. There is not only politics in Parliament, there is also policymaking. When Parliament is in session, debates are held on diverse subjects, and there is so much for the youth to learn. Members of Parliament also get inspiration for better conduct, better debate inside Parliament when the country watches them,” Modi said.Vice President Naidu echoed similar sentiments and said that Parliament needs “voice, not noise”, an apparent reference to frequent disruptions that marred the last monsoon session in both Houses of Parliament. The Chairman of the Upper House, currently considering an allegation of disruption against several Opposition MPs, added: “We need to have meaningful debates echoing people’s aspirations. The loud disruptive noise should not drown the voice of people.”Addressing the event, the PM backed the new television channel as technology is rapidly changing. Lauding the channel as “a new chapter in the story of Indian democracy”, PM said: “The country is getting a medium of communication and dialogue which will become a new voice of the nation’s democracy and people’s representative.”Reiterating that India is the mother of democracy, Modi said: “India has more responsibility when it comes to democracy. It is not just a system, democracy is an idea, a spirit in India. It is our life stream.” Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that Sansad TV will help the country watch the entire democratic system from Parliament to panchayet. “This will show positive and inspiring works of our elected representatives and make young people aware of our parliamentary work.” Earlier in the day, Birla, in a conference of presiding officers, emphasised maintaining discipline and decorum in Parliament and other legislatures. “Collective and coordinated efforts are required by the Presiding Officers, Leaders of all parties to ensure the implementation of the earlier resolutions and decisions (to maintain decorum).”He suggested a separate meeting of presiding officers on decorum and discipline.Naidu sought parliamentary debates to “amplify concerns, clarify doubts and deepen shared understanding”. “Debates in the legislatures throw up solutions to the problems. But disruptions only dissipate our collective energies and delay the task of building a new India.”Sansad TV CEO Ravi Kapoor said that the new channel will reduce cost by 25% and run around 60 programmes such as Defenders (for India’s armed forces) and “Itihas”, to narrate the history of modern India. Women’s issues will be discussed in “Meri Kahani” and special programmes such as “India’s start up journey”, “Healthy India”, “Smart kheti” and “Art of science” will be telecast on related subjects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-at-sansad-tv-launch-in-india-democracy-is-our-life-stream-101631730723982.html
16-09-2021||India||Centre may tweak IT Act, bring in new penalties||The central government is considering amendments to the information technology act, 2000 to bring in new penalties, such as fines, for social media companies and individuals, in addition to retaining some of the criminal provisions that are part of the law, officials familiar with the matter have said.According to these people, the plans are part of an overhaul of the mainstay law to deal with information technology in an effort to update the legal framework to keep in step with developments in the area. “At present, most of the provisions only have penal consequences,” said an official familiar with the matter. “One of the major gaps in implementation of IT act is that it wades into criminal liability straightaway. The case is not always one of wilful illegality, wherein a crime may have been committed but may not be intentional. You have to penalise but not convict them.” The official added that the ministry is also working to figure what denominations should be fixed for the offences and, while the penal liabilities include fines, the civil ones will be continuous and free of criminal liability.According to this person, sections where such fines are under consideration are section 66, which allows the government to impose a fine of up to ₹2 lakhs and imprisonment for life for participating in cyber terrorism, cheating, and identity theft. Section 67 too is being studied – this part allows the government to impose a fine up to ₹10 lakh for publishing or transmitting explicit content, including those relating to child sexual abuse. A second official stressed that the discussions were at a preliminary stage. “It would be a little premature to say how the discussions will pan out,” this person said, asking not to be named. “These are internal conversations taking place at the ministry. At present, new IT rules have been introduced. They form the framework that intermediaries need to follow.” The official added that the amendments would take time to be understood and introduced. At present, sections 43-46 of the IT act allows for civil penalties for which compensation may also be paid to victims. These include provisions pertaining to personal data protection and hacking.Supreme Court lawyer and founder of Cybersaathi, NS Nappinai, said that the Act already provides for an adjudicating officer (AO) under section 46 who can impose civil fines up to ₹5 crore. The designated officer for the post is the secretary of the ministry of electronics and information technology, who has the powers of a civil court.Nappinai added that “there are substantial civil penalties under the extant IT act”. “Even these have remained dead letters as a separate office of AO has not been formed 21 years after passing of the IT Act in 2000 and the ad hoc delegation to the state secretaries, ministry of IT continues till date,” she said. “Further, the office of the Cyber Appellate Tribunal was closed and the jurisdiction for appeals from AOs was moved to TDSAT. Any proposed changes ought to focus and ensure effective enforcement,” she added.Nappinai cautioned that mere additions, therefore, of civil penalties would not suffice and that there has to be effective enforcement. “Whilst additions to civil penalties are welcome care should be taken to ensure that first principles are met as also the proportionality test emphasised by the Supreme Court in the case of Puttaswamy,” she said. As for revising fine denominations, Nappinai said that in 2019, a committee under the ministry of home affairs submitted its report raising the importance of amendments to IT Act. “This also included suggestions for clarity and specificity in the offences covered under section of the 43 IT Act, while also providing for heavier penalties for larger violations, as one size may not fit all,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-may-tweak-it-act-bring-in-new-penalties-101631730722211.html
16-09-2021||India||Air India receives bids from suitors||The Union finance ministry has received multiple bids for Air India and the process for the loss-making state-run airline’s disinvestment now “moves to the concluding stage”, a government official said on Wednesday.The announcement was made in a tweet by Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam), although he did not disclose who or how many bidders expressed interest.Tata Sons later announced it had submitted bids and other people aware of the matter separately identified SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh as one of the other bidders. Singh did not respond to requests for a comment.“Financial bids for Air India disinvestment received by Transaction Adviser,” said Pandey in a tweet.“Process now moves to concluding stage,” he said.The financial bids will be evaluated against an undisclosed reserve price and the bid offering the highest price above that benchmark will be accepted. The bid will be initially examined by the transaction advisor before the recommendation is sent to the Cabinet for approval.If Tatas emerge successful, this will mark the return of Air India to the Tata fold after 67 years. The Tata Group founded Air India as Tata Airlines in October 1932. The government nationalised the airline in 1953.The Union government has renewed a push to sell its entire interest in the loss-making airline, which has been kept aloft by a bailout since 2012.The government is seeking to sell 100% of its stake in the state-owned national airline, including Air India’s 100% shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50% in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.As per the Air India expression of interest floated by Dipam in January 2020, the airline has a total debt of ₹60,074 crore as of March 31. The bid has boosted prospects for the sale after the government sweetened the deal by allowing suitors to decide how much of the carrier’s debt they want to take on. The rest will be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle.Despite the mounting debt and losses, Air India has some lucrative assets, including valued slots at London’s Heathrow airport, a fleet of more than 100 planes and thousands of trained pilots and crew.Two previous attempts to offload the airline failed. In 2001, Singapore Airlines Ltd. dropped its bid for a stake in Air India, citing political opposition as one of the reasons.In 2018, IndiGo, India’s biggest airline, pulled out of the running, saying it didn’t have the means to buy the carrier in its entirety and make it profitable.The airline’s stake sale process began afresh in January 2020 but faced delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The government however asked potential bidders to put in financial bids in April this year before extending the deadline to Wednesday. The deadline was extended on multiple occasions prior to this but civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, who took over a little over two months ago, said last week that the September 15 deadline would not be extended.“We do not know for sure if it’s the Tata group that is taking us over. However we definitely intend to put our best foot forward and help the future owner bring Air India back to its former glory. We hope that the process will also enhance employees working conditions for a harmonious productive environment under the new owner,” said a committee member of the Indian Pilots’ Guild, airline’s Boeing pilots’ union.Tatas operate a premier full-service carrier, Vistara, in partnership with Singapore Airlines and own a majority stake in AirAsia India. It was not immediately known if the group put in the bid on its own or through budget carrier AirAsia India, agencies reported.Experts said the confirmation of bids was an important development. “Submission of financial bids is the most important step. This is the first time that the airline has got its financial bids. Moreover since there are two bidders, the process will be faster and we will have the new bidder taking up by December. According to me, the coin will swing in Tata Sons’ favour,” said CS Subbiah, former CEO of Alliance Air, regional arm of Air India.“Air India is potentially a strategic opportunity but with high structural complexity. Investment in Air India will bet on Indian aviation’s long term potential- which is significant- but keeping in mind the massive cost of restructuring and the continuous flow of funding required to turnaround. I don’t think government of India should expect anything significant from Air India’s privatisation and may require to make the offer viable given the very poor financial and operational condition of Air India,” said Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer of CAPA advisory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-receives-bids-from-suitors-101631729580649.html
16-09-2021||India||3rd NEET aspirant dies by suicide in 4 days across Tamil Nadu||A 17-year-old girl, a NEET aspirant and the daughter of daily wage labourers, is believed to have killed herself over the fear that she may not clear the crucial entrance exam to pursue medical courses in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore district, police said, in the third such case to be reported in the state this week.This is the third suspected suicide of a NEET aspirant in four days, and adds to the dozens of deaths since the common entrance exam for medical courses was first introduced in 2017. There is staunch opposition against the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for undergraduate admission to medical courses in Tamil Nadu. The state assembly on Monday passed a bill that supported scrapping of the NEET exam and admitting students into courses based on their performance in the Class 12 tests. The legislation requires the President’s assent to be enacted.  The bill, which said it was in favour of “social justice” was supported by all parties with the exception of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The argument in the state, now led by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), is that NEET puts at a disadvantage students from rural and poor backgrounds (who cannot afford coaching), and those studying in boards other than the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). On Wednesday, the teenager was found hanging at her home in a village around 9am after her parents left for work. The girl, a student of a government school in Vellore’s Thottapalayam, had appeared for the exam on Sunday. “For the past three days she had been very upset and had expressed to her family that she had not written the exam well,” said a police officer who did not wish to be named. The girl’s parents -- both labourers -- said they consoled her and told her she could pursue other professions if she didn’t clear the exam, he said, adding that she had scored 85% in Class 12 final exams. The girl was the youngest among four siblings and her three sisters are married. Her body has been sent to the Vellore Government Hospital and Medical College for post-mortem. NEET 2021 was conducted across 202 cities on Sunday, after the Supreme Court recently rejected a plea by a group of students to postpone the exam. The top court said it did not want to interfere with the process and it will be “very unfair” to reschedule the test.Hours before the exam was held, the 19-year-old son of a farm labourer was found dead in the state’s Salem district. On Monday evening, an 18-year-old female student from Ariyalur district is also believed to have killed herself over the fear of not clearing NEET. Chief minister MK Stalin on Wednesday condoled the deaths and urged candidates to seek help from mental health experts on the state helpline: 104. “Life is priceless and your future is the country’s future,” Stalin said in a statement. He also blamed the central government, saying: “NEET shuts down opportunities for students. The Union government is stone hearted.”The Opposition All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), however, pointed the blame towards the state government. “Students do not trust this government anymore,” former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3rd-neet-aspirant-dies-by-suicide-in-4-days-across-tamil-nadu-101631729579340.html
16-09-2021||India||Cabinet clears relief package for struggling telecom sector||India on Wednesday took several steps to offer relief to telecom companies burdened by large regulatory dues and attract foreign capital into the telecom sector.Relief on computing dues relating to AGR, adjusted gross revenue, a four-year moratorium on dues, and the option for the government to convert dues into equity after the moratorium period expires are key elements of the relief package approved by the Union Cabinet.The cabinet also liberalised foreign ownership rules by allowing 100% foreign direct investment through the automatic route with safeguards. Currently, 100% FDI is allowed in the telecom sector, but only 49% was on the automatic route, and any investment above that limit required government approval.The steps are expected to benefit Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, saddled with large AGR dues. The relief is likely to ease their financial burden, help save jobs in the sector and ensure much-needed competition in the industry, and comes at a time of concerns that the sector could become a duopoly and scuttle investment in customer service and new technology.Telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said AGR dues were a contentious and highly litigated issue. “It has been decided to rationalise the AGR definition. Non-telecom revenue will be removed from AGR. This resolves this contentious issue,” Vaishnaw said.Vodafone Idea had in August approached the Supreme Court for a review of its July 23 order rejecting a plea from companies to allow the government to correct errors in the computation of AGR dues.After the four-year moratorium, the government will have the option to convert the remaining dues into equity in the companies. “Whatever instalment is left after four years, if it is felt that dues are to be converted to equity, the government will have that option. It is not the company’s option,” Vaishnaw told reporters after the cabinet meeting.He said the cabinet approved nine structural changes and five reform measures that are expected to change the framework of the telecom sector and bring qualitative change.To protect government revenues, companies availing of the moratorium will have to pay interest. This would be at the rate of marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) plus 2%. This moratorium would resolve the cash flow problem faced by the industry, and the improved cash flow can be utilised to upgrade technology, the minister said.The other structural reform is about spectrum user charges, and license fees and other charges. The minister said that heavy interest, penalty and interest on penalty have been levied so far on these charges.“This regime was an undue burden on the industry participants. Today, it has been rationalised. Monthly compounding of interest has been changed to annual compounding. A very reasonable interest rate of MCLR plus 2% has been approved, and the penalty has been eliminated completely. These two decisions open up the way for big investments into the telecom sector,” Vaishnaw said, adding that fresh investments will also create more jobs.The cabinet also approved the removal of spectrum usage charges in future telecom auctions. In such auctions, spectrum allocation would be of 30 years instead of 20 years. Also, businesses could surrender spectrum after a 10-year lock-in period after paying a defined surrender charge.Asked whether the policy measures would facilitate new investors in the telecom industry, Vaishnaw said the government believes that there should be healthy competition in the sector. “For that, there will be further reforms when 5G spectrum is auctioned…so that more and more players can get into the sector. More players, healthy competition and more choices to customers is the stated commitment of the government,” the minister said.Industry leaders Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla and Vodafone Group chief executive officer Nick Read welcomed the move.Birla said the measures “will go a long way in unshackling the telecom sector” and “demonstrate the government’s commitment to ensuring healthy growth of the industry”. “The measures also reflect the decisiveness of the Prime Minister, the telecom minister, and the government to address long-standing issues. These reforms will bring alive the digital aspirations of 1.3 billion people and accelerate India’s journey to be a digitally powered economy as envisaged by the honourable Prime Minister,” a Vodafone Idea statement quoted him as saying.Mittal described the policy steps as seminal reforms to lift an industry that is at the core of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Digital India vision. “The latest reforms ensure that the industry is able to invest fearlessly and support India’s digital ambition. Bharti Airtel is fully committed to responding to the call by the Honourable Prime Minister to invest in and accelerate India’s growth,” Mittal said in a statement.Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, in a statement, described the policy as timely steps towards strengthening the telecom sector, which will accelerate India’s transformation to a digital society.“The telecom sector is one the prime movers of the economy and the key enabler for making India a digital society. I welcome the government of India’s announcement of reforms and relief measures that will enable the industry to achieve the goals of digital India,” said chairman Mukesh Ambani, according to a statement from RIL. Ambani termed the policy steps as a bold initiative.Nick Read commended the government’s resolve to find a comprehensive solution “that would support a competitive and sustainable telecom sector in India”.The cabinet also decided to simplify KYC norms by eliminating physical paperwork for customers and simplified the process of setting up telecom towers. Also, customs procedures have been changed to make it easier for telecom companies to import equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-clears-relief-package-for-struggling-telecom-sector-101631729579979.html
16-09-2021||India||CDS brushes aside IAF concern on asset division under theaterisation||Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Wednesday brushed aside concerns of the Indian Air Force (IAF) about the division of its assets under the theaterisation model under consideration to best utilise the military’s resources, arguing that the 36 Rafale fighter jets ordered from France were split into two squadrons to tackle likely threats emanating from the westerns and eastern sectors.One Rafale squadron is based at Ambala in Haryana while the other is coming up at Hasimara in West Bengal.Rawat also said that India was looking at the possibility of raising a rocket force with different types of missiles in its arsenal.CDS said the Rafale aircraft had been split ab intio between the air force’s western and eastern air commands but when the time comes the assets would be operated together along either front. “Assets are distributed ab initio before war starts, and they are allocated and reallocated depending on how the threat evolves. Grouping and regrouping of military assets before, during and after combat will always happen,” Rawat said while delivering a talk on defence reforms at the India International Centre.He said allocation and reallocation of assets took place during the 1971 India-Pakistan war, which was fought on the two fronts. The current theaterisation model, which has the full backing of the government, seeks to set up four new integrated commands for synergy in operations — two land-centric theatres, the Air Defence Command and the National Maritime Theatre Command.In July, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria flagged concerns about the theaterisation model, arguing that it was critical to first get the structure right, even as Rawat gave out details of the plan to achieve jointness and brushed aside the reservations. Asset split, leadership and dilution of the powers of the chiefs are key concerns for the IAF on the theaterisation move, as previously reported by HT.CDS said that the three chiefs will be responsible for raising, training and sustaining their respective services after the theatre command model is fully functional.“Theatre commanders will become operational commanders in the long run, and they will report to the chairman, chiefs of staff committee (COSC),” Rawat said. CDS wears three hats — he is the permanent chairman of COSC, heads the department of military affairs (DMA), and is the single-point military adviser to the defence minister.In response to a question on the IAF needing more combat squadrons, Rawat said fighter jets were only one of the elements of the air force’s power.“The S-400 air defence missile systems are coming (from Russia), the IAF last week inducted the medium range surface-to-air missile systems…Look at the modern aircraft and other systems you have. We are looking at creating a rocket force because the more aircraft you keep in the air, the more will also be on the ground. Look at the air defence systems that are coming up.”Rawat said aircraft like Rafales and Sukhoi-30s were capable of undertaking up to six sorties a day compared to three for the older MiGs. CDS said future wars would be different and integration among the three services was critical to tackle new threats.Last week, HT reported that the creation of theatre commands could take two to three years, with senior officers from the three services being assigned key responsibilities to finalise the joint structures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cds-cites-rafale-deployment-in-theaterisation-push-101631728080548.html
16-09-2021||India||Khairlanji episode: Caste divide cemented by brutality from 15 years ago||Khairlanji (Maharashtra): In September 2006, Khairlanji was just another village in Maharashtra’s Bhandara, its 700 strong populace fairly nondescript. 150km from Nagpur, there was nothing to separate the homes in its dingy lanes from each other. Most roads were kuccha. Most houses were kuccha too. Fifteen years later, there are signs of change. Some roads have gone from dirt to cement, some homes now have tap water. But what hasn’t changed is the distrust in the social fabric of the village, borne out of a heinous crime that sparked angry protests, brought ignominy to the village, and came to be known across the country as the “Kharlainji massacre”. On September 29, 2006, a group of villagers, mostly Kunbis -- who consider themselves equivalent to the Marathas in western Maharashtra but are classified as other backward classes (OBC), attacked four members of the family of Bhaiyyalal Bhotmange, all Dalits. They dragged out Bhaiyyalal’s wife Surekha, 44, her sons Roshan, 23, Sudhir, 21, and daughter Priyanka, 18, a Class 12 student, and subjected them to a brutal assault. The victims were paraded naked in the village, the women sexually violated, and all four of them hacked to death. The massacre rocked the country and sparked protests by Dalit groups across the country. It was a rude reminder that despite stepping into the 21st century, caste attitudes continue to stagnate in primitivity, and Dalit people, especially women, were as vulnerable to the power of upper-caste structure as they were half a century ago. It belied the promise of modernity for India’s most marginal groups. Today, the violence is gone but its memory lingers -- and Dalits complain that the caste divide is wider than ever. “If we get vocal, they (the upper caste) try to gag us. The reason why there has been no conflict between the Dalits and caste Hindus in Khairlanji for the last 15 years is because Dalits want peace,” said Siddhartha Gajbhiye, Surekha’s cousin. THE MASSACREAmong the first triggers was a petty dispute in the middle of September 2006. The village, dominated by Kunbis, beat up Gajbhiye, who lived in the village of Dushala nearby, and frequently visited the Bhotmange family. The villagers suspected Gajbhiye had a relationship with Surekha. Gajbhiye managed to reach Kamptee near Nagpur where he filed a police complaint, with the case later referred to the Andhalgaon police station. On September 28, 12 villagers were arrested, but got bail from a lower court in Mohadi the next day. Seething in anger, the villagers stormed Bhotmange’s house at 6.30pm the same evening and broke into his mud hut looking for Gajbhiye. Since he was not present, the villagers directed their ire at the Bhotmange family. The mob dragged out all the members of the Bhotmange family, beat them up with bicycle chains, sticks and other sharp weapons. The violated bodies of Surekha and her daughter were found in a nearby canal the next day. Bhaiyyalal managed to escape and hid behind a tree from where he helplessly watched his family members killed. Bhaiyyalal pursued the case with the support of several rights activists and subsequently a special court in Bhandara awarded the death sentence to six accused and two were given life imprisonment on September 24,2008. However, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court commuted the death sentence of six to life imprisonment on July 14, 2010. The high court ruled out caste discrimination as the reason for the killings, and said it was an act of revenge by the accused who felt that they were falsely implicated by Gajbhiye. While holding that it was not the rarest of rare case, the court also rejected the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) appeal for convicting the accused under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. Bhaiyyalal then moved the Supreme Court but the apex court upheld the HC judgment. THE STRUGGLERavi Shende, a Dalit activist who regularly accompanied Bhaiyyalal to court hearings, alleged that the charges framed under SC/ST Act could not stand scrutiny before courts because the district and police administration – right from the lower level to higher ups – diluted the police investigation in favour of higher castes. “Moreover, we also failed to follow it up properly before the high courts over the last few years and hence the rulings,” Shende said. At the time, a government report on the killings indicted top officers, doctors and even local politicians. The report, prepared by the social justice department and YASHADA – the state academy of developmental administration – described the killings as an “organised conspiracy.” Uttam Shewde, another Dalit activist and state spokesman of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), echoed similar views. He alleged that there was tremendous political pressure from Day One. “They (upper caste people) succeeded in their mission. However, everyone knew that the entire episode was an outcome of caste bias,” Shewde said. However, former village sarpanch of Khairlanji, Hasan Dhande, who was detained by the police after the killings, said that it was not a caste-based conflict at all as claimed by politicians – particularly Dalit leaders. He said the incident was entirely the result of a trivial dispute between the Binjewar and Bhotmange families. (Sakru Binjewar and Gopal Binjewar were accused in the case and awarded life imprisonment). “We have no grudge against Bhaiyyalal. He was here twice after the incident and everyone in the village treated him well. The incident was unfortunate and inhuman,” he said. 15 YEARS ONKharlainji has not seen any violence in the past decade-and-a-half, but many people from the Dalit community are still conscious of the walls erected around them, often unspoken. Amol Meshram, 29, a distant relative of Bhaiyyalal said, “The upper caste-Dalit divide has minimised in the sense that no such things happen right now. But Dalits are still not involved in the planning of development in the village.” “They (upper caste community) hardly talk to us and while the social fabric has not been broken since then, bonhomie is glaringly missing,” said Meshram, who received a Bachelor of Science degree from Nagpur university and is now unemployed. “I was 14 when the incident took place. I was so horrified that I remember I stayed indoors for two months and didn’t go to school or anywhere else,” he added. Durvash Khobragade, another Dalit from Khairlanji, said most Kunbis held the Dalits responsible for the massacre. “They blamed us after the accused were jailed, and that has widened a chasm between us. There is hardly any conversation between people of different castes, and they maintain a safe distance. There are no intercaste marriages in the village,” Khobragade said. But village sarpanch, Moreshwar Dhumankhele, a Kunbi, rejects these charges of differences, and insists that both communities live in “harmony.” “There has been no dispute or any untoward incident between the communities in the last 15 years. The village was also adjudged as “Tanta Mukti Gaon” (dispute-free village) by the government in 2009,” he said. Dhumankhele said Dalits form a small minority of the total population of the village, less than 40 residents. To him, the biggest evidence of harmony is the priest in the village temple. “Those trying to raise any unfounded casteist conflagration in the village, here’s a fact-check -- the priest of local Hanuman temple, Kashiram Nathuji Kawase, is a Dalit belonging to the cobbler community,” Dhumankhele said. MEMORIES LINGERIn January 2017, Bhaiyyalal died at a Nagpur hospital at the age of 62. With nobody from the Bhotmange family remaining in Kharlainji, his relatives, who live in other villages nearby, have now leased out the family’s 5 acre plot to a man named Bhagwan Dhenge, a Kunbi. Yet, as the one protagonist of the 2015 massacre that still remains in and around Kharlainji narrates, this 5 acre plot of land was integral to the attack on the Bhotmanges. Gajbhiye, now 62, was then a “police patil”, a state government employee whose job was to coordinate between villagers and the police. He alleged that the villagers were bent on grabbing a portion of the land to lay an approach road to their farms. This land was also used as a common passage to go to the agriculture fields of other farmers in the village whenever it was left uncultivated. In 1982, Bhaiyyalal married Surekha and after a few years the couple settled down at Khairlanji . He started developing the land for cultivation 1989 onwards. Gajbhiye said that Surekha was an assertive person, who often confronted villagers for illegal trespass. She was considered very argumentative and would often mince no words. This assertive trait of Surekha did not go down well with the higher castes, he said. “I was a police patil of the neighbouring village and I used to help them in resolving such matters through police and other administrative sources. As they could not grab the land and failed to convince Surekha and her family, they targeted me for my frequent visits to her family,” Gajbhiye said. Gajbhiye also alleged that the Bhandara police didn’t take prompt action against the accused because of political pressure. Since 2006, he has not returned to Khairlanj. Ramu Dhande, one of the convicts in the case out on parole from the Gadchiroli prison due to the pandemic, said all he wanted to do was forget. “It was a bad phase for us. We want to live together in peace,” Dhande added. For the Dalits, a sense of harmony is still a pipe dream. What they will settle for is for history not to repeat itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khairlanji-episode-caste-divide-cemented-by-brutality-from-15-years-ago-101631727662814.html
16-09-2021||India||Dr Reddy’s gets DCGI nod to conduct phase 3 Sputnik Light trials||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has allowed Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories to conduct phase 3 bridging trials of Sputnik Light, the single dose formulation of the Russia-made Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine. The approval was granted last month on the basis of a recommendation from the subject expert committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which assessed the updated safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data from phase 3 trials that happened in Russia.The SEC in June had directed Dr Reddy’s to submit data from Sputnik Light trials in Russia before seeking permission to conduct local trials. Sputnik Light comprises the first dose of the usual two-dose regimen.“In light of the recommendations of the SEC dated 30.06.21, the firm presented updated safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of phase III clinical trial of Sars-Cov-2 virus vaccine (Sputnik Light) — single dose vaccine conducted in Russia along with the proposal to conduct phase III clinical trial. The committee noted that the firm has now presented the safety and immunogenicity along with the longevity of the antibodies which gives a measure of persistence of antibodies in the participants,” minutes of the meeting that HT has accessed said. “After detailed deliberations, the committee recommended grant of permission for conduct of phase III immune-bridging clinical trials in the Indian population subject to the condition that the primary endpoint should be assessed at day 42, 90 and 180, and interim analysis can be conducted at day 42…,” it added.Sputnik V vaccine is developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute with assistance from Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), that is also marketing the vaccine globally. Sputnik V, in its two-dose regimen, is one of six Covid-19 vaccines that have been granted emergency use approval by the Indian drugs regulator. The vaccine has shown a 91.6% efficacy rate in preventing serious illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-reddy-s-gets-dcgi-nod-to-conduct-phase-3-sputnik-light-trials-101631727372513.html
16-09-2021||India||‘Very unhappy’: SC pulls up Centre over appointments to tribunals||Observing that it is “very, very unhappy”, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said that in a democratic country governed by the rule of law, the government cannot assert its authority to reject the names recommended by selection committees, headed by the judges of the top court, for appointments to various tribunals.“If the government has the last laugh, what is the sanctity of the selections made by us after conducting interviews?... We are very, very unhappy the way in which things are going on and how the government has been acting,” a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, told attorney general KK Venugopal.“You cannot deny access to justice. How can people be left in the lurch? This is the problem everywhere. We are waiting very patiently. You have to make appointments to the tribunals...tell your government,” the bench, which also comprised justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, told the AG.It gave the government two weeks to make appointments to the tribunals and file a comprehensive affidavit in this regard. “Please, file your affidavit with vacancy and appointment positions. And give reasons wherever appointments cannot be made,” directed the court.The bench further pointed out that some recent appointments to tribunals depict “cherry picking” and “lack of service jurisprudence” where the government decided to exclude the names from the main selection lists and chose members from the wait lists, which were prepared for future appointments.Hours before this hearing on a clutch of petitions that have highlighted massive vacancies across all 15 tribunals in the country, the Centre filed an affidavit stating that it has appointed 84 members to various tribunals since 2020 and there are no recommendations pending with it anymore. Of them, 39 members were appointed in the current month after the court on September 6 lashed out at the government for sitting over recommendations made by the search cum selection committees (SCSCs) more than a year ago. There are around 200 posts lying vacant across 15 tribunals.Commenting upon the recent appointments, the bench said: “The selection committee selected 11 judicial members and 10 technical members for the national company law tribunal (NCLT). But the members were cherry-picked. There were four names selected from the main list and six were selected from the wait list. What type of selection is this? What kind of appointment is this? What kind of service jurisprudence is this? The same thing happened with the ITAT (income tax appellate tribunal).”The AG, representing the Centre, replied that the government has the discretion under the 2021 Tribunal Reforms Act to select names from the list of names forwarded by the SCSCs and not all names have to be cleared. “Just like the government has the power not to accept any name recommended...” added Venugopal.“We think we are a democratic country governed by the rule of law. You cannot say the government will not accept anything. We don’t know how you can continue like this even after more than a year,” retorted the bench.The CJI told the A-G: “We interviewed 534 candidates for the post of judicial members and 400-odd candidates for technical members for NCLT. Your two secretaries were also with us. We travelled across the country during Covid on the request of your government. We wasted our time conducting interviews, meeting people. And then you delayed these appointments for almost two years. They were 62 when we selected them. They are now 64. If they have to retire at 65, why will a judge take up an assignment for one year? It is very unfortunate and the government has to realise this.”As justices Chandrachud and Rao mentioned the recommendations made by the committees headed by them for appointments in the national consumer commission and appellate tribunal for telecom disputes, the AG said that two members picked up by the selection committee for TDSAT were appointed elsewhere while the government was considering their appointments.“This is the problem. If there is a delay of more than a year, the very utility of these selections will go...they become useless,” said the bench, adding there have been judgments by the apex court favouring constitution of a national tribunals commission as an umbrella body to supervise working of tribunals and appointing members.“The government will have to make a separate body, then only something will happen. In several judgments, starting with the L Chandrakumar case in 1997, we talked about the national tribunals commission. We have given you the solution too. It is for you to now do something... Please make arrangements and make appointments without inviting us to pass orders, which we can also do very happily,” the bench told Venugopal.Justice Rao went on to point out an appeal by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) against the SAT order in the PNB Housing Finance case that relates to the housing finance company’s ₹4,000 crore equity capital raise plan. The judge said that two members in SAT gave split verdict and the case cannot go to a third technical member since there is none.“It is very difficult for tribunals to function... Whatever problems we have, appointment of members is the real solution,” the court added.On his part, Venugopal asked for some time to get instructions on all the aspects of the matter, including the challenge to the 2021 law, which the bench had on September 6 pointed out, brought back the exact same provisions that were struck down by the top court in July.Senior advocate Arvind Datar complained about the manner in which appointment letters were being issued to the tribunal members. He said that these letters included an additional clause - ‘until further orders’- for continuance of a member, which he said, was not under the law that mentioned that a member shall continue for a certain tenure till he attains a particular age.“Let some appointments come first...we will then examine this,” the bench told Datar.Advocate Siddharth R Gupta, representing the state bar council of Madhya Pradesh, rued that litigants in Jabalpur were compelled to travel to Lucknow since the charge of debt recovery tribunal at Jabalpur has been given to the Lucknow tribunal because there is no member at Jabalpur. “And DRT at Lucknow says it will take up only those cases where files have been received by it physically. Only urgent matters are being taken up.No cases of borrowers are being heard,” Gupta said.Justice Chandrachud concurred with Gupta. “A litigant from Jabalpur will have to travel to Lucknow, How will this work? In March, Kerala high court struck down such transfers of jurisdiction but you are still doing it. The high courts are not willing to entertain such petitions directly. There is no recourse to a debtor today. They will take your house, your factory and other assets and there is no remedy at all,” said the judge.Thirty-nine names were cleared by the government for different tribunals in September. Of these, 18 members were appointed to the national company law tribunal (NCLT); 1 member to telecom disputes and settlement appellate tribunal (TDSAT); 13 members to income tax appellate tribunal (ITAT); 1 member to appellate tribunal for electricity and 6 members to armed forces tribunal (AFT).The court was hearing a clutch of separate petitions on vacancies across the tribunals and a challenge to the Tribunal Reforms Bill, which was passed by both the houses in the Monsoon session of the parliament. Petitioners before it included State Bar Council of Madhya Pradesh, advocates Amit Sahni and Amarjit Singh Bedi, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh and Delhi Bar Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/very-unhappy-sc-pulls-up-centre-over-appointments-to-tribunals-101631727059762.html

Washington has been trying to wriggle out of Afghanistan for over a decade. President Joe Biden bit the bullet badly, but the US is now broadcasting on all channels that Central Asia is a strategic closed chapter.

But simultaneously, the same technologies have become a privacy nightmare for their users. The algorithms behind these technologies amass a huge amount of data from individuals, which is then used (or sold to other firms) to target, persuade, reward, or penalise users. While privacy issues have been extensively debated, a discussion on how data governance laws might impact women differently than men and affect their agency on the internet has been mostly missing.
16-09-2021||Today's||Supplement competitive politics with collaborative economics||Cooperative federalism acquired currency since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister (PM). But it is also a fact that an adversarial relationship that developed between the non-National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-ruled states and the Centre post-2014. While this was on the political plane, an inadvertent casualty of the heightened tension has been the spirit of healthy competition that used to exist between states in the economic sphere.Narendra Modi may be credited with setting the trend with his “Vibrant Gujarat” jamborees, though opinion is divided about the actual outcome of these investor meets. But much before that, states would vie with each other in wooing industries with a range of incentives ranging from investment subsidies to tax exemptions for the development of backward regions. Every state formed its own industrial development corporations as nodal agencies for administering schemes, or setting up special industrial and export processing zones. A few states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu had a natural lead due to legacy factors while others tried to play catch up. Thus, in a way, there was a “bottom-up” approach to industrialisation in which the Union Government largely confined its role to policy-setting.Also Read | Defection politics heats up in Uttarakhand with new entrants in BJPThere is a discernible shift in approach under the Modi regime. There is a visible increase in the engagement of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) with global investors. Contrary to what sceptics may suggest, not all of it is limited to photo opportunities. The Niti Aayog has been trying to play a role in attracting investments and increasing the competitiveness of Indian industry globally, but also making the economy future-ready for international trends and opportunities. It can claim credit for developing the start-up ecosystem, which has resulted in over 50 unicorns and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme taking off. But there are doubts about how far the states are in sync with the Centre’s thought process.While investor meets still happen in a ritualistic manner, there appears to be a loss in traction, barring in a few states. This could be, at least to some extent, due to the non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief ministers taking their eye off the ball in their preoccupation to combat the Modi government or insecurity about being dislodged by the Goliath breathing down their necks from Delhi. With states refusing to tango, many reforms conceived by the Centre are either frustrated (such as land acquisition) or remain on paper such as labour or farm laws.Meanwhile, economic paradigms have changed. The next phase of industrial growth cannot be propelled by sops alone. It is a common misconception that China’s economic development was driven top-down. It is true that not a leaf moves in that country without the nod of the Chinese Communist Party. But growth engines were decentralised with provinces competing with each other. This was built on the twin platform of creating infrastructure ahead of investment (sometimes keeping it idle) and skills training.Undeniably, there is a thrust on developing infrastructure and connectivity (road, rail, air and waterways) by the government, though the pace is often stymied by lack of cooperation by states – especially when it comes to land procurement. States must be agile in capitalising these assets to their advantage by developing local linkages aligned to national priorities.The real challenge, however, is going to be capacity-building in terms of skilled manpower and industrial ecosystems. This requires a change in mindset from frittering away doles to vote banks. Those states paying attention to this key differentiator will steal a lead over others and win in the long run.The issue is no longer as much of bureaucracy, red tape or corruption at the lower levels. These factors will get taken care of once there is real value creation. Some states seem to get it. They are putting the building blocks in place, ignoring the surround sound of national politics. Winning the next decade is more important than who wins 2024. Populism may have got us thus far. But neither investors nor India’s youth has the patience or luxury of time. Practise competitive politics, but embrace collaborative economics.Sandip Ghose is a former corporate professional and commentator on contemporary politics The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/supplement-competitive-politics-with-collaborative-economics-101631793368126.html
16-09-2021||Editorials||The role of civil society organisations||The Indian State has historically been uncomfortable with independent civil society organisations, especially those which have received foreign support and may be engaged in research and activism that does not always align with the State’s agenda or worldview. This was true during the Cold War, when accusations were hurled at organisations for being fronts of western intelligence outfits. Under the United Progressive Alliance government, contradictory impulses were at play. On the one hand, the high-powered National Advisory Council institutionalised engagement between the ruling party and civil society; on the other, the government used the draconian sedition law against activists, tightened rules of foreign funding, and expanded the home ministry’s control. This Indian State was often democratic, but also illiberal at times.
16-09-2021||Editorials||The BJP’s Gujarat experiment||A year before elections in Gujarat, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) got Vijay Rupani to resign as chief minister (CM), and then, in a surprise choice, appointed Bhupendra Patel as CM. On Thursday, after intense internal battles, it picked an entirely new council of ministers — and did not repeat any minister from the last state government.
