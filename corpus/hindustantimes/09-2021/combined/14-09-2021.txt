Then came pandemic, a State crackdown||Student activism in the capital has seen a marked change ever since the Covid-19 pandemic struck in March last year. While prolonged closure of college campuses has resulted in no student body elections being held after 2019, some believe many are also reluctant to participate in student politics after seeing the state crackdown on student activists during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests last year.

14-09-2021||Mumbai||How Mumbai’s Dharavi contained Covid outbreak||On a night in the early days of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when paranoia about the spread of the virus was high, misinformation rampant, and a strict nation-wide lockdown at its peak, a handful of labourers housed in a dim-lit shed in Kurla’s commercial area built 30 beds from scratch, pulling off a feat overnight that allowed Dharavi to assemble its first quarantine centre for patients – at Ruparel College in Dadar. This 30-bed quarantine centre was an example of the collective effort on part of the civic administration at G-North ward in Dharavi, and of the people, to tackle the spread of Covid-19 in their area. It soon expanded to a 100-bed quarantine centre, around the start of the concept of large-scale institutional quarantine as one of the means to tackle the spread of Covid-19 in Dharavi. It became part of the ‘Dharavi Model’ that has been adopted world-wide as an effective way of ‘breaking the chain’ to curb the spread of the infection. Dharavi – India’s largest slum, characterised by a very high population density, small homes, and inherent reliance on community toilets and street food – had become a Covid-19 hotspot during the first wave of the pandemic in April and May 2020. From there, timely administrative intervention and discipline of its residents has created the Dharavi model. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward, who has been at the helm of these efforts has now documented Dharavi’s battle against the infection, with other anecdotes such as this one. Dighavkar has written about his experience as the ward officer in-charge of the area, the challenges of quarantine and social distancing in a slum pocket that houses 653,000 people in less than 2sqkm, and about how he came up with the “Dharavi model”, in a book titled “The Dharavi Model: How Asia’s largest slum defeated Covid-19”. The book was launched on Tuesday at the hands of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Thackeray, in his foreword to the book, said, “In the middle of the studies and speculations about the impending waves, the success of the Dharavi model has been a beacon of hope, not only for the state of Maharashtra, but also for the world.” In a chapter titled ‘Needle in a hay stack’, Dighavkar sums up challenges encountered right from the start of the outbreak, Dighavkar quotes Sandeep, a resident of the slum, saying: “Dharavi is not just a slum. It is a well-knit joint family where everyone knows everyone by name, we know what happens in each other’s lives, we don’t keep our doors shut. There is always someone walking in and out. You can imagine if any kind of stoppage comes in the community, what will it lead to in the end?”“Using community toilets and consuming street food are an integral part of life for these residents,” said Dighavkar. “Contact tracing proves to be challenging.”The book also documents statistics that the G/North ward meticulously maintained to understand and curb the spread of the virus. Dharavi was mapped into 13 high-intensity zones. A daily dashboard of area-wise outbreak of cases in Dharavi was maintained. BMC provided door-to-door food packets to residents in these quarantine centres, so they would not be tempted to leave their homes for supplies, and conducted large-scale testing through door-to-door campaigns and fever clinics. Even before the first case was detected in Dharavi on April 1, 2020, the civic administration had begun to compile lists of all residents of the area with recent travel history outside the country, and call them daily to check for symptoms.The book has recorded accounts of front-line workers and law enforcement officers, and heart breaking stories from residents who lost family members to the infection. “During the pandemic, people complained of boredom sitting in their homes. While people were tired of resting and being at home, we were longing for some rest and to be at home,” Dighavkar said. While Dharavi and its people have been better equipped to handle the second wave with the Dharavi Model, they are now facing challenges around vaccination of its population. Dighavkar said, “The rate of vaccination was seen to be high in higher income groups, while slums and chawl dwellers were still hesitant. It was, and is of much importance to spread awareness and increase a demand for vaccination in this group. In spite of the efforts and measures, a large gap is yet to be bridged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/how-mumbai-s-dharavi-contained-covid-outbreak-101631644118097.html
14-09-2021||Delhi||Two men arrested for killing brother in Delhi’s Rohini||The police, on Tuesday, arrested two men for the murder of their brother, whose body was found stuffed in a gunny bag in an isolated area in Rohini the previous day.On Monday, police had registered a case and begun investigating the death of the man whose body bore visible injury marks and was discovered near Mange Ram Park in Rohini’s Sector 23.The arrested men, Vipin, 28, and Raju, 21, (identified by their first names only) told the police that they had assaulted their brother Rajesh,34, on the night of September 9 because they disapproved of his drinking habit and the derogatory remarks he directed at Raju and his wife, who left the house upset. Despite Rajesh’s injuries, his brothers did not admit him to a hospital and he succumbed to his injuries three days later on September 12, said deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal.“The two brothers panicked, and fearing arrest, they stuffed Rajesh’s body in a gunny bag and dumped it near Mange Ram Park, which is about three kilometers away from their home. We are interrogating the two to check if other family members were involved. The two brothers claim that they carried the body on their shoulders,” said DCP Tayal.Police said that Rajesh worked as a labourer while his brothers sell scraps to make a livelihood. Rajesh is survived by his wife and two children. His wife left him six months ago because of his drinking habit and abusive behaviour, his brothers said. “When we identified Rajesh’s body and went to his house, the family claimed that he was missing. But they had not filed a missing complaint. It’s because of that we suspected the family members’ role and interrogated them. The two brothers confessed to the crime and we arrested them,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-men-arrested-for-killing-brother-in-delhi-s-rohini-101631644116821.html

14-09-2021||Other||Experts: For sustainable development, Delhi-NCR needs a regional economic strategy before a master plan||New Delhi: For sustainable development of Delhi-NCR, many urban development experts feel that there is a need to prepare a regional economic development plan before finalising the master plan.While presenting an analysis of the economic geography study of Delhi-NCR at Connect Karo-2021, World Resources Institute-India (WRI-India) experts also called for identification of economic sectors that will continue to be competitive in the next 10-15 years in the Capital. As per WRI-India’s analysis, rapid growth has happened in NCR areas such as Faridabad, Hapur, Greater Noida, Manesar etc, in the last decade.Hindustan Times is the media partner of the event. Noting that Delhi-NCR generates about 8% of the country’s GDP, with automobile, metal, textile, footwear, rubber and plastic, electric equipment industries, wholesale trade, etc, being the significant industries or economic sectors, Madhav Pai, executive director of WRI India Ross Centre for Sustainable Cities, said, “There has been a negative growth in employment in Delhi between the 5th and 6th economic Census.”With the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) finalising the Master Plan of Delhi-2041 and the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) preparing the draft Regional Plan-2041, experts said an economic strategy should be planned first before fixing the master plans, which are largely land use plans.“Identify top economic sectors, understand the demography, impact of climate change, and develop a regional economic concept plan. We could identify strategic projects, mostly infrastructure projects such as RRTS, which have regional implications. And then identify places or locations for which we prepare a development plan. The land use of these areas can be changed accordingly in the master plans. This approach should be used while planning for any metropolitan area,” said Pai.Sameer Sharma, chief secretary of Andhra Pradesh and former director-general and CEO of Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs, said there is an emergence of edge cities around metropolitan areas and pointed out the need for an economic development plan. “The US has a very strong planning system. The Indian system operates differently at the ground level. We make perfect master plans, but only 20-30% gets implemented... we have to do a lot of retrofitting (to address the ground level issues),” said Sharma.To promote economic activities in Delhi, Sharma said that redevelopment has to be planned properly. He cited the case of Mayapuri industrial area where permissions are being given to banquet halls. “There are banquet halls coming up in the area without any parking facility. A better model could be to make it like Bandra Kurla Complex. Mayapuri can be an IT hub or any hub, even a banquet hub. But a proper plan should be prepared for it,” he said.Sharma said that projects like redevelopment of seven government residential colonies where commercial and residential development is planned, will bring in jobs.Rana Hasan, director of Asian Development Bank, said that disharmony between master planning and what happens at the grassroot level is largely due to rigidity in land use management. He said that there is a need to relook at land use management and regulation.Abhijeet Samanta, deputy director at NCRPB, and Bidisha Ganguly, chief economist at Confederation of Indian Industry, said that since 2006, manufacturing industries are gradually moving out of Delhi, mainly due to environmental reasons.Ganguly said that housing is one of the important factors that needs to be planned for in cities: “There is a need for affordable housing, including rental, for workers... The quality of life of people is important and planning should incorporate this aspect.”WRI India said that promoting digital economy, creative industries, IT industry, fashion, tourism etc will help boost the economy, adding that manufacturing industries should be promoted in the peripheral areas.Samanta said that NCRPB’s draft regional plan-2041 has addressed issues of economic development in the region.In another session, urban planners discussed the need to adopt strategic spatial planning which envisions the city’s future while formulating strategic projects and decisions to help leapfrog over current and potential challenges faced by the city.Delhi’s urban development minister Satyender Jain, in a pre-recorded message, said, “Delivering strategic projects that trigger urban transformation is critical for Delhi to meet the current and future challenges. We see strategic projects and planning as key to shape cities into more resilient and equitable spaces for all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/experts-for-sustainable-development-delhi-ncr-needs-a-regional-economic-strategy-before-a-master-plan-101631642976833.html
14-09-2021||Gurugram||Dust control cell to be formed ahead of winter pollution spike||On the directions of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) will set up a dust control and management cell by the next month to keep a check on air pollution levels in winter, officials said on Tuesday.Along with setting up the cell, the agencies concerned will also be monitoring complaints regarding air pollution across all social media platforms. S Narayanan, member secretary of HSPCB, said, “In Gurugram, the main issues are dust pollution due to construction and demolition activities, transport, vehicular pollution and burning of solid waste. So, these will be our main focus issues. To manage this, the CAQM has directed us to constitute a dust control and management cell in individual operational departments by October. Along with this, we will address all social media complaints and grievances which will be made through grievance cell.” The official said that talks are underway with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority to use their grievance cell for addressing complaints regarding air pollution. A complaint cell will also be set up at the regional offices of the HSPCB. In January this year, the CAQM, in its second meeting, had reviewed the problem of road dust, a major source of pollutants contributing significantly to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM 10. In a letter to all NCR states, it had said, “Controlling dust pollution has been a major challenge and needs much more focused attention in NCR.” The commission had stated that dust control and management cells must be set up with the specific task of monitoring and implementation of dust control measures. Some dust control measures include mechanical cleaning and sweeping of roads and water sprinkling to reduce dust pollution.In the first week of October, the CAQM will hold another meeting with districts from multiple states located in the National Capital Region to review the situation. Pollution levels in Gurugram are usually higher in winter due to smog accumulation. Cool air gets trapped due to cold weather conditions, which leads to an increase in daily pollution levels. Incidents of crop residue burning in neighbouring districts add to the high pollution levels in the National Capital Region, with vehicular pollution, bursting of crackers during the festive season and open burning of waste listed as major causes. Last year, the district administration compiled a list of the most polluted roads in the city that comprises Sohna Road, Golf Course Road, Golf Course Extension Road, stretch from Hero Honda Chowk to Basai, Dwarka Expressway, stretch from Sector 10 Chowk to Ghadoli village, Mini Secretariat and Vikas Sadan parking, the vehicle training ground near Leisure Valley Park, Huda City Centre in Sector 29, internal roads between sectors 58 and 67, Genpact Chowk, internal roads from sectors 83 to 93 and roads in Udyog Vihar. “The CAQM has also directed us to control fire at the landfills and open fires. The power department has also been asked to give uninterrupted power supply as no exemptions will be given to different units that are dependent on diesel gensets for electricity, in the absence of power connections. These steps must help us control air pollution in a better manner this year,” Narayanan said. Several housing complexes and condominiums across Gurugram and Faridabad districts are reliant on diesel generator sets for electricity due to the absence of power connections from state agencies and also for power backup. Besides, industries are also reliant on diesel-powered backup systems to ensure continuous production. However, a blanket ban on diesel generator sets was implemented from 2020 in the city. For other parts of the state, the HSPCB has also identified red districts where maximum crop residue burning has been noticed. This includes districts of Fatehabad, Karnal, Jind, Kurukshetra, Sirsa and Ambala, among others. In these districts, officials said that there will be a special focus on controlling crop residue burning through regular patrolling, issuing challans to offenders and filing cases against repeat offenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dust-control-cell-to-be-formed-ahead-of-winter-pollution-spike-101631641658308.html

Along with this, a 200-metre service road will be constructed for the sectors 59/61 road. Around four kilometres of roads will be repaired in this project across all locations, officials said. “We are focussing on special repair of these roads, which primarily includes laying a layer of bitumen and gravels to strengthen the road. We will also focus on ensuring proper lighting on these roads and construction of footpaths. With monsoon, potholes have also increased on these stretches which can lead to accidents, so those will also be repaired to ensure smooth movement of traffic,” Suresh Kumar Chahal, the joint chief executive officer of GMDA, said. During the meeting last week, officials said that no treatment, except for patchwork, has taken place in the past eight years on the master roads of sectors 62/65, 58/61 and 59/60. These roads run parallel to the Golf Course Extension Road and provide access to residential areas. Officials said that the issue of repairing the outer road of Sector 114 was raised during a chief minister’s grievance meeting and that the project will be sent for approval. Chahal said that tests were conducted recently to understand the load-bearing capacity of these roads, which were found to be satisfactory; after which the decision for special repair was taken. “We have to ascertain if the roads are strong from inside to ensure that cave-ins do not take place. Incidents of road cave-ins have been reported in the past, but this time, the roads were found to be okay. Before starting the repair work, we are also seeking suggestions from public on how the repair work can be carried out or suggestions for new technologies. These can be submitted till the 23rd of this month on our website,” Chahal said. After the suggestions are submitted, the projects will get administration approval, following which the tendering process will start. With all the formalities pending, work on the ground is likely to start from November, said officials.Chahal said that the infrastructure-I department of the GMDA will be working alongside the urban environment division as green belts will be identified and developed on these stretches, adding to the beautification of these roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/key-roads-to-be-repaired-by-gmda-work-to-start-from-november-101631641656813.html
14-09-2021||Gurugram||Ward 34 polls: Waterlogging, pending MCG takeover and civic issues take centre stage||Residents of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s (MCG) Ward 34, who are set to elect their councillor next month, said that civic issues, pending transfer of two townships, waterlogging, poor condition of amenities are the issues that the next office-bearer must resolve on priority.Members of residents’ welfare associations said that while major issues regarding the ward were addressed over the past four years, a few more issues were in the process of being addressed before the demise of the incumbent. Delay in the takeover of colonies by the MCG was a major concern, residents said.“The MCG takeover of the two colonies was announced way back in 2016. Five other colonies, four of which were added in 2017, were transferred to the MCG in 2019. However, the transfer of DLF Phases 1 and 2 is still pending. We want the new councillor to expedite the process as we also want to avail of optimum civic services offered by the MCG,” Gaurav Singh, a resident of DLF Phase 1, said.Dhruv Bansal, the spokesperson for DLF Qutub Enclave RWA, which looks after DLF Phase-1, said, “We want the new councillor to be well versed with localised issues and be approachable. He or she needs to expedite the ongoing transfer of DLF Phases 1 and 2 from the developer to the MCG, which the former councillor had also been regularly taking up with the authorities concerned,” said Bansal.The polls to elect the MCG Ward 34 councillor will be held on October 3. The post has been vacant since May 30 following the death of the incumbent, RS Rathee, an independent candidate, due to Covid-19.The ward includes upscale areas of DLF Phases 1 and 2 townships, Silver Oaks Apartment in DLF Phase-1, Oakwood Estate in DLF Phase-2; Beverly Park 1 and 2, Heritage City and Essel Towers on the Mall Mile; Belvedere Towers in Cyber City; The Ivy apartments in Sector 28 and The Magnolias in Sector 42.During the 2017 MCG elections, the ward had 23,402 eligible voters. According to MCG officials, the ward now has around 29,000 eligible voters, with a total population of 100,000-125,000.In February 2016, the Haryana government had announced the transfer of maintenance of DLF Phases 1 and 2 from the developer to the MCG. Five years later, the transfer is still pending as the developer opted to fix the deficiencies instead of paying monetary compensation.Naveen Kumar, a member of DLF Phase-2 RWA, said that the erratic power supply is a major issue that has to be resolved on priority.“Rathee addressed a large number of issues in the area and had just started working towards taking up the matter of power cuts and irregular power bills before his untimely demise. We want the councillor to take up this matter with the power distribution company and provide relief to thousands of residents,” he said.Residents living along the Mall Mile said that localised waterlogging is a recurrent problem that needs to be fixed. Manish Sinha, a resident of Essel Towers in Sector 28 said that this monsoon, the entrance to the condominium was blocked due to heavy rainwater accumulation.“Our condominium is at a disadvantage as it is located in a low-lying area and on a slope, compared to the main carriageway of the Mall Mile. Due to this, rainwater from nearby areas accumulates outside the colony gate. Residents cannot enter or exit the colony until the motor pumps drain out rainwater. I want the new councillor to take up this matter on priority and resolve it at the earliest,” said Sinha.Residents in Cyber City pointed to the poor condition of service roads as their major concern. “The service road from Cyber City to MG Road is in pathetic condition, especially in the stretch falling opposite Sikanderpur village. It is pothole-ridden and needs immediate fixing, as it is accessed hundreds of commuters on a daily basis,” Swaroop Pillarisetti, a resident of Belvedere Towers, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ward-34-polls-waterlogging-pending-mcg-takeover-and-civic-issues-take-centre-stage-101631641598353.html

To note, Rahul Gandhi had said in a tweet: “Jo nafrat kare, vah yogi kaisa” (What kind of yogi is one who hates). Yogi in his tweet quoted a ‘Ramcharitmanas’ verse to make his point about how his government was acting against criminals and mafia and would continue this. Opening with the ‘Ramcharitmanas’ verse “jaaki rahi bhavna jaisi, prabhu murat dekhi tin taisi” (In whichever way one chooses to perceive the Lord, in that very form the Lord appears to him) Yogi’s tweet further said “If bulldozing the criminals and extremists is hatred, then yes! It will continue.” An official press statement later said Yogi’s tweet, giving a befitting reply to Rahul Gandhi, was receiving an overwhelming support on social media. It said Rahul must read the harmonious history of Gorakshapeeth before commenting on Yogi and added that pursuing a divisive policy was the tradition of the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yogi-reply-to-rahul-tweet-if-bulldozing-criminals-is-hatred-it-will-continue-101631641477189.html

She will be the first Rajya Sabha MP from Bengali speaking Barak Valley part of Assam since Karnendu Bhattacharjee was elected as Rajya Sabha MP from the Congress party almost a decade back. Talking to Hindustan Times, Sushmita Dev said, “I did not expect such a big reward from Mamta Banerjee and her party just after joining them. It indicates that Mamata Banerjee wants to extend a strong leadership beyond West Bengal. Our party is looking forward to strengthening the women leadership and by nominating me as the Rajya Sabha candidate from West Bengal, the party has proven that it is possible. I am the first woman from North East India to get such an honour.”The youngest daughter of former Union minister Santosh Mohan Dev and former MP from Silchar Sushmita Dev’s name has been nominated as Trinamool Congress Party’s candidate for the upcoming Rajya Sabha election. The party officially announced the decision on Tuesday afternoon.She said she was informed over the phone on Tuesday evening from the party’s headquarter about her candidature. “I could not believe what I have heard over the phone until I saw the tweet from the party’s official Twitter handle. It is an honour and a responsibility as well. I have to work at the grassroots level in Assam and Tripura as the TMC party’s cadre. I am in Tripura right now and will be visiting my home in three days. I hope people of my native land are happy.”Sushmita Dev left Congress Party on August 16 this year and joined Trinamool Congress later. More than 500 Congress party workers followed in her footsteps and joined the TMC within 15 days. Her parents were lifelong Congress workers. But she claimed that she did not compromise her father’s ideology by joining TMC. Congress leaders in Assam, especially in the Barak Valley, however, criticized her heavily and call her iterator. Answering to question regarding the Congress party’s criticism she said, “I have joined Trinamool Congress party to save their future. Because the Congress party has compromised its ideology and lost relevance amongst the commons. On the other side, BJP never cares about the pride of Barak Valley. I don’t like to sound narrow, but in Assam, we need a person who can speak for the Bengali speaking population. I had to take a stand because so many people were looking at me. Now after getting such an honour, I can definitely tell my supporters that our decision was not wrong.”Karnendu Bhattacharjee’s term as Rajya Sabha MP ended in 2008. He was nominated twice.

The air force officials became suspicious and a close scrutiny led them to the espionage trail. Police had arrested factory worker Jaswinder Singh, 22, of Uchi Daud Village in Maloud, as the number was registered in his name. According to the police, a Pakistani agent contacted Jaswinder on Facebook, posing as Jasleen Brar from Bathinda, and honeytrapped him using pictures of a woman. Jaswinder started chatting and gave access of his WhatsApp to the agent, who later used the number to join WhatsApp groups of defence personnel namely ‘Western cmd mutual posting’ and ‘MES information update’. The police are going to summon the administrators of the WhatsApp groups to know how they added an outsider’s number in the groups and who had asked them to add the numbers. The police have also found conversation of the Pakistani agent with seven defence personnel, who also can be summoned to join the investigation. Jaswinder was sent to five-day police remand by a local court on Tuesday.

Parents remained worried till the girls returned home,” said Modi in his well -crafted speech of 40 minutes, “All changed with chief minister Yogi Adityanath assuming office and all mafia and goons calling the shots were placed behind the bars.

There will be new encouragement for the MSMEs,” he said. UP governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath were also present at the event held in Lodha village of Aligarh district.

In the entire process there is no involvement of humans. It’s purely remote-controlled robots that flawlessly perform the task using ultraviolet rays,” said Deepak Kumar, chief public relation officer (CPRO), Northern Railways (NR). He said the technique was first introduced in Lucknow Shatabdi Special in July and the results were unbelievable. Now plans are afoot to introduce the same in other trains as well. Kumar said the bot is capable of disinfecting the entire train compartment, including the most narrowest areas that are far from human reach, automatically. “This technology utilizes a robotic device with autonomous wings installed with UVC lights for 100% disinfection. The device is operated with the help of wireless remote control for the safety of the operator and the surroundings,” he said. He further said the technology not only destroys the nucleus of the Coronavirus, rendering it unable to replicate but is also eco friendly. “Lab tests by the government certified lab have shown that 99.99% bacteria, viruses and germs were killed after disinfection by the UVC robots,” he added. General manager NR Ashutosh Gangal said the UVC technology has been adopted after rigorous testing and trials. “This is approved and tested by the Indian Council of Medical Research, CSIO and Tanuvas Study Centre, Government of India and is already being used by Air India Express for cabin disinfection and hospitals for a couple of decades,” he said. He further said the UVC technology was safe and user-friendly.

The recommendations have been made by the special committee led by MLA and former minister Rana Gurjit Singh, which submitted its report to assembly speaker Rana KP Singh here on Tuesday. Harpartap Singh Ajnala, Gurpratap Singh Wadala, Hardev Singh Laddi, Raj Kumar Chabbewal and Gurmeet Singh Hayer (MLAs) were members of the committee. Rana Gurjit said that Punjab needed to make alternative arrangements to recharge groundwater and change cropping pattern by giving a strong push to DSR technology and diversification to tackle the fall in water level in the state. “The state requires about 62 billion cubic metre water annually, drawing most of it from underground resources and recharges only a fraction of it, leading to fall of 70cm per year in sub-soil water,” he said, stressing the urgency of the matter. The committee head said there was a time when 7.5 lakh hectare of land was under cotton but this came down to 3 lakh hectare. “We need to make efforts to increase the area under cotton back to the same level because the crop consumes 50% less water as compared to paddy. Water availability should be ensured during the sowing season in that area,” he said. The committee has incorporated the suggestions by experts of the water resources department and Israel-based firm Mekorot which is advising the state government on checking the depleting groundwater table and replenishing it. The committee was assisted by principal secretary, water resources, Sarvjit Singh and his team. Rana KP Singh said the report would be sent to the state government through proper channel for further action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vidhan-sabha-panel-bats-for-direct-seeding-to-replenish-groundwater-101631637276740.html

This was the second time Kafeel was suspended by the state government, while he was already under suspension following the August 2017 tragedy at Gorakhpur’s BRD Medical College, where 60 children had died due to shortage of oxygen. Justice Saral Srivastava directed to conclude inquiry against the petitioner within a period of one month. The court further directed that the petitioner shall co-operate in inquiry and in case the petitioner does not co-operate, disciplinary authority may proceed to conclude the inquiry ex parte. While directing to list this case on November 11, 2021, the court directed that when the matter is next listed, the respondents shall inform the court about the outcome of the inquiry.Dr Kafeel, by means of present writ petition, assailed the suspension order dated July 31, 2019 on the ground that the suspension order had been passed on July 31, 2019 and more than two years have passed and the inquiry had not been concluded. It was further contended that since the petitioner was already a suspended employee, therefore, there was no purpose of passing a second suspension order. However, the state government’s counsel submitted that inquiry report against the petitioner had been submitted on August 27, 2021, copy of which was sent to the petitioner on August 28, 2021, asking the petitioner to submit objection against the report. “Considering the submissions advanced by the parties, matter requires consideration,” the court said.

The annual fest draws crowds from across the country of all religions to the Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount. This year, the Novena fell between September 3 and 11. The fair would have coincided with the Feast and Octave (September 12 to 19). Like last year, the church is holding masses online. “We are holding masses online, which are relayed on our social media channels. We see many devotees stop outside the church gate and offer prayers,” said rector Bishop John Rodrigues. Every year pilgrims flock to offer prayers for the sick and the aged at the church that was built in 1904. Stalls are set up by locals along the steps of the church to sell candles of different shapes, including human limbs and body parts. The devotees light candles seeking relief from any ailments in their bodies.Even as masses are held online, Mumbaiites miss the fair sorely. “The Mount Mary fair is a 300-year-old tradition that has brought all communities together each year,” said Anil Joseph, 48, who has lived in Bandra since his childhood. “We miss the fair terribly. But safety is important during the pandemic and the life of people has to be given priority. Even Mother Mary would want that. We should all get vaccinated and hope that we get to enjoy the fair next year,” said Joseph, who is also the chairperson of the Perry Road Residents Association.Apart from candles, locals also set up sweetmeat shops, food stalls and entertainment hubs along the road outside the church. While the stalls on the steps of the church are under the jurisdiction of the church, pitches outside the church are administered by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “Last month the BMC informed that it won’t be allotting pitches for stalls owing to the pandemic. We, too, have not allotted any slots for stalls this year in the interest of the safety of devotees,” said Rodrigues.Ashish Shelar, BJP MLA from Bandra, said, “While the government has allowed the opening up of restaurants and gyms, it has not allowed any religious activities. We could have held the fair albeit with restrictions.” He further said the government must incentivise those individuals, whose businesses have been lost because the fair was cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiites-miss-bandra-fair-for-second-year-in-a-row-101631636557659.html

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) made the necessary arrangements for immersion by providing tanks across the city.Mobile tanks on the backs of trucks were available in all areas of the city with ward offices as the point of contact. The PMC and the Pune police have appealed to citizens to avoid crowding this year in the light of the Covid pandemic. The water tanks are a push to ensure that the festival remains eco-friendly and immersion of idols does not pollute water bodies.While most Ganpati idols made their way to the PMC tanks, a random check by HT still found a sizeable number of idols being immersed in rivers across the city. “As the pandemic is on, we decided only two people from our family will do the immersion. We have immersed our Ganpati at the PMC centre. The arrangements were good, but the number of such centres needs to be increased as we had to walk 2-km from our house to get here,” said Sanket Khaladkar, a resident from Narayan peth.Another citizen Manish Janardhan said, “PMC cannot force or make it compulsory to immerse idols only in their tanks. We did the immersion in a river. There are many people who want to do immersion the traditional way.”Meanwhile, riverside roads were closed for vehicles as water was released from the Khadakwasla dam on Monday night. As a result, access to the rivers was difficult for many seeking to immerse idols there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ganesh-festival-mixed-response-to-pmc-tanks-for-fifth-day-immersion-101631636495863.html

The plea filed by three persons argues that state government notified on July 15, 2021, that SC certificates obtained by Rai Sikhs prior to August 30, 2007, are also valid. Taking note of this, departmental proceedings initiated have either been dropped or are to be dropped against those who obtained these certificates and got jobs or admission in educational courses on the basis of those certificates. The court was told that prior to August 2007, the Rai Sikh caste was included in the Backward Class category, and was notified as SC only on this date. A substantial number of Rai Sikhs obtained jobs in the state and were facing departmental inquiries for procurement and use of false SC certificates, the court was told, adding that the July communication now intends to close all pending disciplinary proceedings against them. The court was told that the July 15, 2021, communication cannot make valid the SC certificates obtained prior to August 2007.

With four-time MLA and former SAD minister, Adesh Partap Singh Kairon, again, asked to contest from Patti, his 33-year-old son, Dilsher Partap Singh Kairon, an entrepreneur, is reaching the town on Wednesday to campaign for him. The local party workers are also ready to welcome him. Dilsher, the elder of Kairon’s two sons, will play the role of a youth leader in the constituency which Congress MLA Harminder Singh Gill, who had defeated Kairon by 8,000-odd votes in 2017, represents in the assembly. Before this defeat, Kairon, son-in-law of SAD patriarch Prakash Singh Badal, had represented the constituency four times in a row. Kairon’s right-hand man and his political adviser, Gurmukh Singh Ghulla Blehar, said, “Dilsher will lead our youth brigade into the assembly polls. He is coming to Patti on Wednesday and we welcome him. He will not only support his father to win the seat, but also remain present for locals.” He added, “To date, I have been leading the youth brigade in Patti. From tomorrow, Dilsher will do this. He has studied in the most prominent universities of America and England. We need his vision in these elections.”Dilsher did his Bachelors in economics from Yale university of America and an MBA from Cambridge University in England. In March, Kairon had held back-to-back political gatherings in Khemkaran constituency, the home turf of senior SAD leader Virsa Singh Valtoha. During these gatherings, Kairon had announced that ‘one of my family’s member’ would fight the assembly election from Khemkaran, a statement that had infuriated Valtoha. At a rally here in April, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal has snubbed Kairon, saying that Valtoha would be the party candidate from Khemkaran. Since then, Kairon has not organised any political event in Khemkaran, but his supporters continue to claim that his wife Bibi Parneet Kaur Kairon would fight the elections ticket from here on a SAD ticket. “Bibi Kairon will fight elections from Khemkaran. Valtoha is our rival and the Kairon family will not budge from its decision,” Ghulla maintained, even on Tuesday. The SAD, however, has named Valtoha as Khemkaran candidate in the list released on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/another-son-rise-in-kairon-dynasty-101631635717899.html

A total of 100 minors will participate in phase two of the on-going safety trials. The data of the safety tests is being collected and will be declared by the sponsor in a week or 10 days. Meanwhile, we will administer the second dose to candidates three weeks after the first dose.” The sponsor, in this case, is the Serum Institute of India.Apart from the KEM Hospital and Research Centre in Vadu, the Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital has also been selected as a site for the Covavax trials.Covavax, also known as Novavax, is being developed by US firm, Novavax Inc. It will be mass produced by the Pune- based SII, mainly for the paediatric age group, i.e. below 18 years of age. Earlier, Dr Badvekar had said that once the vaccine is found safe for this age group, the trial would move to a younger population in two more phases, 12-6 years and 6-2 years of age. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy director of Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital said, “We do not have any confirmed date on when phase three trials would begin. Once the safety results are out we will begin phase three. This should probably happen in the next 15 days, however, the final date will be declared in collaboration with the sponsor.” The standard protocol for any new vaccine is to test it for safety (phase two) among a few hundred participants and then, phase three, which tests the vaccine for its efficacy against the said virus. The phase three trials are conducted among at least 1,000 volunteers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/results-of-covavax-phase-two-trial-expected-in-10-days-docs-101631635235787.html
14-09-2021||Patna||Bid to enforce NRC on the sly in Kishanganj: Owaisi||All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday slammed a move by the Kishanganj district magistrate (DM) to identify suspected foreign nationals in pursuance a Patna High Court order, saying it was wrong to pinpoint any particular area and looked like an attempt to implement national citizenship register (NRC) through back door.“I am disappointed. I expected the state government to give clarity on the matter before the court. The government should take it seriously and not get swayed by the RSS agenda,” he told reporters in Patna.In 2020 Bihar polls, AIMIM had won five assembly seats in Seemanchal region, of which Kishanganj is a part.Owaisi said his party would take a call on contesting in the two seats going to by-elections in Bihar later this year.He also took on UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath for the latter’s “abba Jaan” remark and said it was a desperate attempt to resurrect his government’s falling image by polarising votes, but it would not work.“Had he worked, he would not be required to take recourse of ‘abba Jaan’ at the time of election. The bitter truth in UP is that Muslims have the lowest literacy rate and the highest dropout rate, while merely 10% of the central fund allocated for minority welfare could be spent. UP has the highest number of children with malnutrition. As Yogi does not want debate on them, he is trying to polarise,” he said.On the number of seats AIMIM would contest in UP and the charge against him that he was trying to polarise votes, Owaisi said the number was not final, but his party would certainly contest with all seriousness and that Muslims were no more ready to be taken for granted as vote bank.“We are preparing to contest 100 seats in UP. So far there is no tie-up. We can go alone also. We will fight to win. Those who point fingers at us for helping any party should explain what happened in the Lok Sabha election when AIMIM was not in the fray. In Bihar, we fought 19 assembly seats and won five. We are expanding to ensure that the Muslims get their deserved rights, which has not happened,” he said.On whether tainted faces Mukhtar Ansari and Aateek Ahmad could be fielded by AIMIM, Owaisi said why the same question was not being put to the BJP, Samajwadi Party and others. “How many tainted leaders are in JD-U? It should be an issue for all the political parties. Unless proven guilty, if a person can legally contest election, what is the problem?. We would like to field Ansari, though we have not talked to him,” he said.The AIMIM chief also dared the Narendra Modi government to declare Taliban a terrorist organisation.“If the government has courage, it should put Taliban in the list of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. I have been reiterating since 2013 that Taliban’s emergence could be a sign of concern for India, while it might benefit China and Pakistan. But for BJP, all Muslims appear to be Taliban. The Indian government has done strategic blunder by isolating Muslims in the National Register for Citizens (NRC). I always maintained it should not be on religious lines, ” he said, while talking to media persons in Patna.On Bihar BJP MLA Haribhushan Thakur’s statement that he was trying to be the next Jinnah, Owaisi hit back, saying the BJP leader should know who had gone to Jinnah’s tomb. “LK Advani praised him. I always reject Jinnah’s two-nation theory,” he said.BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand later said Owaisi was trying to instigate Muslims in the name of NRC to do his brand of politics, like the Congress and RJD always did. “Nobody can stay in any country without passport and visa, unless one gets political asylum or is treated as refugee. Rest are treated as illegal immigrants and every country requires to prepare their list. The same needs to be done in India as well. What is happening in Seemanchal is a normal police process, as the issue of illegal immigration is no secret in the bordering areas like Kishanganj, Katihar, Araria etc. At present, NRC has not been implemented and Owasi should refrain from deriving political mileage out of it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bid-to-enforce-nrc-on-the-sly-in-kishanganj-owaisi-101631635120567.html
14-09-2021||Patna||RJD set to back SP in UP polls||Unlike other Bihar-based parties, state’s main opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is in no mood to contest the assembly polls in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh due early next year and would be extending support to the Samajwadi Party (SP) as a part of its strategy to strengthen the opposition unity against the BJP, party insiders said. After several rounds of discussions on whether the party should contest the UP polls next year or not, there is a consensus it should extend support to the SP, which is the main challenger of the BJP in the largest state in the country, they said. Over a month ago, ailing RJD chief Lalu Prasad had called on Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh in New Delhi during which SP president Akhilesh Yadav was also present. The SP patriarch’s grand nephew and former MP Tej Pratap Yadav is married to Lalu’s youngest daughter Raxlaxmi. In 2017 too, RJD had not contested UP polls and supported SP candidates. In 2012 UP assembly polls, RJD contested four seats and forfeited deposit in all four, bagging just.0.04% of the total votes polled. “RJD is working for opposition unity against the BJP. In West Bengal polls, we extended support to the Trinamool Congress and it helped. In UP polls, we are working on similar lines and looking forward to support the Samajwadi Party,” said Bhola Yadav,national general secretary of RJD. Among Bihar-based parties, Janata Dal (United) and Vikashsheel Insaan Party ( VIP), both constituents of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) along with BJP, are keen on contesting the UP polls early next year.Sources said JD(U) poll managers are keen on striking an alliance with BJP and have sent feelers for getting 20 seats . The VIP has announced its plans to contest over 100 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjd-set-to-back-sp-in-up-polls-101631635119215.html

Sanitation workers of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) and other civic bodies have been on strike since September 7 in support of their 12-point demands, including regularisation of job, substantial hike in monthly remuneration, introduction of provident fund facility, financial benefits as per the recommendation of 7th pay commission etc. Nearly 40,000 workers across the state were on strike called by Bihar Local Bodies Karmchari Sanyukt Sangharsh Morcha (BLBKSSM), which also asked for removal of anomalies in scales of regular fourth grade employees and discontinuance of fashion to keep outsourced employees. The HC bench, also comprising Justice S Kumar, directed the striking employees to end the strike forthwith. BLBKSSM president Chandra Prakash Singh said that they would take the decision to end the strike after going through the court’s order. “We will maintain the status quo till then,” said Singh. During the hearing, advocate general (AG) Lalit Kishore told the court that the state government would consider the striking employees’ grievances, and an appropriate decision would be taken in the stipulated time frame. He, however, added that outsourcing, if required, was the government’s right and the PMC was free to hire staff on outsourcing as and when necessary. “However, existing employees would not be affected due to outsourcing,” said Kishore. The AG also said that the striking employees, who were ousted from job due to defiance of the order, would be rehired. “However, those facing other penal charges would be dealt with in accordance with the law,” Kishore told the court. Even as the Patna HC had rescheduled the hearing of case of striking employees for Tuesday, principal secretary of urban development department (UDD) on Monday issued a statement saying that there was no impact of the strike on cleanliness drive in more than 70% urban areas. Contrary to the claims of departmental officers, heaps of garbage laid strewn on the roadside and in various lanes and by-lanes. “Officials are misleading the court, as door-to-door collection of household waste has been discontinued for the past couple of weeks,” said Anuj Kumar, a Patna resident. A staff member of the PMC said that around 6,000 tonnes of waste was dumped near the roadside in Patna due to the strike. “Patna usually generates around 800-900 tonnes of waste on a daily basis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-hc-asks-municipal-workers-to-end-strike-tells-govt-to-fulfil-demands-in-8-weeks-101631635117975.html
14-09-2021||Ranchi||Soren’s remark on local languages creates stir, BJP accuses CM of ‘polarisation’||strap: Ex-Cong minister describes statement unconstitutional  The main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday hit out at chief minister Hemant Soren over his remark on regional languages spoken in the state, and non-inclusion of few of them such as Bhojpuri and Magahi in examination syllabus for grade 3 and 4 government jobs under the recently notified employment policy of the state. In a recent interview with the Hindustan Times on Sunday, the Jharkhand chief minister (CM) desribed Bhojpuri and Magahi languages as “imported languages from Bihar”, besides underlining that people, who allegedly raped women during Jharkhand’s separate statehood Jharkhand, “used to abuse in Bhojpuri”. Hitting out at Soren, former minister and BJP legislator Bhanu Pratap Shahi alleged that the CM was trying to create friction and “polarise” the populace on the basis of language. “Earlier, the JMM (CM Soren’s party) tried to polarise on the basis of religion by allotting Namaz room in Vidhan Sabha and including Urdu as a regional language. However, they removed Hindi from the merit list paper in employment policy, and also did not include languages such as Bhojpuri, Magahi and Angika in it. And now, he is terming Bhojpuri as language of rapists. The BJP condemns it. If Bhojpuri and Magahi are not regional languages, has not Urdu come from Pakistan? The CM is now trying to polarise people on grounds of language. This is unconstitutional for a CM to make such a remark,” said Shahi at a press conference called by the BJP at its state headquarters here. The BJP legislator also challenged the Congress and the RJD, the alliance partners in the Hemant Soren government, to make their stand clear on the issue. “There are several legislators from the ruling combine who speak Bhojpuri. Is the CM also terming them rapists? JMM’s Mithilesh Thakur should comment on this issue. Earlier, he had demanded to include Bhojpuri and Magahi in the employment policy. Congress legislator Dipika Pandey Singh also demanded inclusion of these languages. Several other Congress legislators speak Bhojpuri and Magahi. What does the RJD has to say on this?,” said Shahi. Several other BJP leaders, including former CM Raghubar Das and party’s state unit president Deepak Prakash, hit out at the CM for his remark. The ruling JMM, however, defended the CM’s remark. Principal general secretary and party spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya said there was nothing wrong in the remark. “We stand by his statement. A big population in the state speak Urdu, Bengali and Oriya, while very few people speak Bhojpuri and Magahi,” said Bhattacharya.While the Congress was yet to make it’s official stand clear on the issue, senior party leader and former minister KN Tripathi described Soren’s statement unconstitutional. “His statement is unconstitutional and against the dignity of the chief minister’s chair,” said Tripathi, who earlier represented Daltonganj assembly seat that is part of Palamu division, where Bhojpuri and Magahi are predominant local languages. While there is no official data on the number of people who speak regional languages in the state, Bhojpuri, Magahi and Angika are spoken in several districts across the state, especially those bordering Bihar such as Palamu, Garhwa, Latehar, Chatra, Hazaribag, Bokaro, Dhanbad, Giridih, Deoghar, Sahibganj and Godda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/sorens-remark-on-local-languages-creates-stir-bjp-accuses-cm-of-polarisation-101631635116512.html

14-09-2021||Chandigarh||SAD to resume poll events after farmers’ September 27 Bharat Bandh||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will resume its poll meetings and rallies after September 27, the day Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) will observe Bharat Bandh against the three central farm laws. The party will stage a protest outside Parliament in New Delhi on September 17 against the farm laws, which all office-bearers have been asked to attend, SAD’s former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra said. The party has planned another dharna on September 24 outside Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s residence in Patiala against the low compensation paid to the farmers against the land acquired for the national highway passing through many districts in the state. “In the meeting with farmer leaders on September 10, it was conveyed that we will start our political activity after the Bharat Bandh,” said Chandumajra, adding that party cannot stop its political activities for long as the polls are approaching. Party’s core committee is expected to meet on September 28 to decide further course of action. The SAD is already in a poll mode. On Monday, it released a list of 64 candidates for the upcoming polls. In a meeting last week with the representatives of 32 farm bodies, a four member Akali panel had asked farmers to reconsider their appeal for postponing political activity. On September 3, farmers created ruckus at Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal’s rally in Moga, which was part of his mass-contact programme ‘Gal Punjab Di’. The SAD postponed all its public events. “There are suggestions for not forcing political parties to suspend their activities beyond October 15. The SKM is holding a meeting to take a final decision soon,” said Jagmohan Singh general secretary of BKU (Dakounda). Box Why no disruptions at Cong events: Majithia to SKM AMRITSAR Senior Akali Dal leader and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia on Tuesday asked the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) to explain to Punjabis why it was not objecting to political functions being held by the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He also criticised chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for “insulting” the farmers by asserting that their agitation was running successfully due to support of the Congress party. He was talking to the media after welcoming local Congress and AAP leaders into the SAD fold. Among those who joined the SAD included Congress Kisan Cell vice-chairman Satpal Singh Wadali and AAP state committee member Jasbir Singh Wadali. ‘It is astonishing that chief minister, who had been holed up at his farm house for more than four years, was trying to take credit for the sacrifices of the brave farmers. The truth is that the farmers were betrayed by the Gandhi family,” Majithia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-to-resume-poll-events-after-farmers-september-27-bharat-bandh-101631633856506.html

14-09-2021||Mumbai||IIT Bombay designs AI-based translation app to help students from linguistic minorities||A professor and his team from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) have launched an artificial intelligence (AI)-based software ecosystem that translates scientific and technical content from English to Hindi and several other Indian languages. This software —Project Udaan — launched at a virtual event on Tuesday, can translate engineering textbooks and learning material in one-sixth the time it would take for a team of domain and linguistic experts to work manually. “The Indian Constitution requires every state and local authority to provide adequate facilities for instruction in the mother tongue at the primary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minorities,” said professor Ganesh Ramakrishnan, IIT-B chair professor, department of computer science and engineering. “Project Udaan’ will help translate scientific and technical terms into several languages other than English and could help students pursuing courses in engineering and technology,” he said.Project Udaan is a donation-based project with an end-to-end ecosystem that helps in translation. “We have developed a very robust bilingual OCR (optical character recognition) technology and several post-editing tools by which we now have access to digital bilingual dictionaries in a machine-readable format. We are therefore able to use appropriate scientific and technical terms available in Hindi, instead of transliterating the English terms,” added Ramakrishnan. However, Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra, who was not involved with the work, said while the concept is keeping in mind the new National Education Policy (NEP) provisions giving aid to regional languages, the use of the software might be limiting. “There’s hardly been a case where students could not understand scientific terms because of the community they came from. And while it could be of aid for some, what will such students do once they graduate and enter the job market? There’ll be no software helping them there,” said Thampi.Through donations, the IIT-B team aims to translate 500 engineering texts in Hindi in one year and 15 Indian languages in three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-designs-ai-based-translation-app-to-help-students-from-linguistic-minorities-101631632296794.html

The decision came after a five-member delegation of protesters met state government officials led by Sandeep Sandhu, political adviser to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. The bus services remained crippled since September 6 when nearly 8,200 roadways employees went on strike, seeking regular jobs. Resham Singh Gill, state president of Punjab Roadways, Punbus and PRTC contract workers’ union, said, “The government has assured 30% hike in salary for the contractual and outsourced employees, along with 5% annual hike. The notification in this regard will be issued by September 15,” he said. On the demand for regularisation of job, Sandhu assured that a decision will be taken after discussing the issue with chief minister, Gill said. “The government had sought a week’s time but we have asked them to take two weeks to decide on our regularisation demand. If no decision is taken, we will resume our strike from September 29 onwards,” said Harkesh Kumar, state general secretary of the union. Currently, the contractual conductors are being paid ₹9,118 per month, while the drivers get ₹10,200. Kumar said it was a big relief for most of the employees as they were being made to work on meagre salaries for the past 10 years. On their demand for introducing new buses, the government informed the delegation that the process to order a fleet of 850 new buses was in the pipeline. The PRTC has already floated the tenders for purchasing 255 new buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/assured-30-per-cent-salary-hike-punjab-public-transport-workers-call-off-strike-101631629836217.html

The Court had directed the Maharashtra government to deposit ₹20 crore with the Court and recover the same from the defaulting medical college. In that order, the Court said that the amount should be utilized for “issues of juvenile justice”.As the money lying with the Court had now swelled with interest to ₹25 crore, the Court Registry contacted the state government to know what is to be done with the money. The matter was put up before a bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna on Monday.The state government informed the Court that the amount will be utilized to finance a scheme for providing ₹5 lakh compensation for children who lost both parents due to Covid-19. Advocate Sachin Patil for the state said, “In Maharashtra, 593 children lost both parents due to Covid-19. This has been ascertained on a district-wise basis and is so far the highest number to be reported by any state in the country.” In all, he pointed out that 19,129 children lost either or both their parents during the pandemic beginning March 2020.As per the state’s calculation, the amount of ₹25.53 crore lying with the Court would be utilized for financing ₹5 lakh each for the 593 orphans when they shall receive on attaining 21 years. This scheme was announced by the state government on June 17 this year and the money was supposed to be placed in a fixed deposit.The bench said, “We do not intend that you use this amount for distributing the ₹5 lakh financial support. That you otherwise will also do. Why don’t you reverse your policy and provide something more for these children using this amount?”Patil, in the interest of the affected children, told the Court that the state shall present a concrete plan on utilizing the said amount for the welfare of Covid-affected children. The Court granted him three weeks directing the affidavit to be filed by the Women and Child Development Department of the state government.The bench said, “Before we direct disbursal of ₹25.53 crore back to Maharashtra government, let a concrete statement be placed by the state with regard to the manner in which this money is to be utilized by state for children who lost one or both their parents during Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-seeks-maharashtra-s-response-on-utilizing-rs-25-cr-for-covid-19-affected-children-101631628937249.html

14-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai police stations to have Nirbhaya Squad to bolster women’s safety||Against the backdrop of the Sakinaka rape and murder case, the top brass of the Mumbai police has decided to create a dedicated ‘Nirbahaya Squad’ in every police station to prevent crimes against women, officials said. Directives to this effect were issued by the commissioner of police Hemant Nagrale on Tuesday. The city police came up with the idea a day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met with the state Director General of Police and Mumbai police commissioner along with other senior police officers at the state police headquarters to review the measures being taken by the police department for the safety and security of women. The women safety squad would be on regular patrolling duty and would constitute a lady sub-inspector, a woman constable, a male constable and a driver. The squads will work to prevent the cases of harassment of girls, women and children. The city police have also initiated a project called ‘Saksham’ in collaboration with an organisation called ‘M Power’. Under this project, survivors of sexual offences and juveniles in conflicts and law would be provided with psychotherapy and counselling for their recovery from post-incident trauma, rehabilitation and psychological counselling. A lady assistant commissioner of police or an inspector level lady officer in each of the five regions would be the nodal officers who would supervise and review the functioning of the Nirbhaya Squads. The squads will also gather intelligence of any wrongdoings in children homes, orphanages, hostels, etc. The squads have also been entrusted with the responsibility of creating awareness about the stricter provisions and harsh sentences prescribed under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, mainly in slum areas that witness a maximum number of POCSO cases in the city. This includes dense slums of Cuffe Parade, Kurla, Antop Hill-Dharavi, Malwani, Bhandup, etc. Such awareness would help cops prevent sexual crimes against minors. To ensure that the squads function as per the expectations, the senior police officers have also announced monthly rewards to the squad for best performance. Officers in ‘Nirbhaya Squads’ have also been instructed to attend parents meetings, seminars organised by schools, colleges and create awareness about the squads as well as the legal rights of women and children. The squad will also be distributing booklets on laws and legal provisions meant for the safety, security and welfare of women. The squads will be given two days of training before they start functioning.A Nirbhaya complaint box will be kept at these places (including schools and colleges) and a record will have to be maintained on action taken after receiving complaints in these boxes.“The Nirbhaya Squads are being formed with an aim to create a safer environment for women and children in the society and also to create fear of law in minds of sexual offenders and deterring them from indulging in crimes,” Mumbai Police said in a statement released on Tuesday.All the police station incharges in Mumbai have been asked to identify areas that are prone to crimes against women and create a list of such hotspots so that a patrolling pattern can be created for regular patrolling of these areas. This would include roads leading to schools, colleges, cinema halls, subways, malls, market areas, gardens, playgrounds, bus stops and railway stations, deserted places, etc.Nirbhaya teams will also create a separate database of all sexual offenders who have a criminal record in the last five years. The squad members will keep a tab on these offenders’ activities to ensure they are not targeting women again after coming out on bail.The squads will be armed with secret pen-cameras for tracking the movements of stalkers. The videos taken by squad members will also become evidence in cases of staking generally registered under sections 354D of IPC, the police’s circular reads.The women cells were already there previously in each of the 95 police stations in Mumbai to look into the investigations of cases of sexual crimes against women and children, but with the new directives issued by the police commissioner, additional dedicated outdoor teams are entrusted with a slew of new duties focussing on prevention of such crimes, creating awareness, tracking habitual offenders, enlighting students and women with knowledge about their legal rights and laws pertaining to sexual offences, identifying victims, reaching out to them, encouraging them to speak out and then counsel them, said a senior police officer. A special training centre will be created for the Nirbhaya Squads in each of the five regions under the supervision of respective additional police commissioners. At these centres, training will be given to the Nirbhaya Squad members pertaining to women safety and for providing counselling to victims of sexual crimes and juveniles caught in conflict with law.The squad officers have also been asked to conduct sessions on self-defence technics, guide students and distribute booklets on laws and legal provisions meant for the safety, security and welfare of women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/every-police-station-in-mumbai-to-have-nirbhaya-squad-to-bolster-women-s-safety-101631628218357.html

However, dengue cases have increased in the same period in August and SeptemberBetween August 1 and 12, the city recorded 395 malaria cases, which dropped to 210 in the same period this month. In the corresponding period, dengue cases increased from 61 to 85 in the city. Civic health officers said when monsoon recedes, malaria cases reduce, while dengue cases pick up from September onwards.“It is the pattern of mosquito-borne diseases. Anopheles mosquito that causes malaria breeds extensively in stagnant, dirty water leading to a rise in the number of cases during the peak of monsoon season between June and August. But when the downpour decreases, the Aedes Aegypti mosquito that causes dengue starts breeding. So, post-August, dengue cases become higher,” said Dr Jeetendra Jadhav, medical officer L ward comprising Kurla and Chembur.BMC is screening construction workers for malaria symptoms. Already 446,077 houses have been inspected and 4,108 mosquito breeding grounds have been destroyed.“We have seen a definite resurgence of dengue and malaria in the last two months. Dengue patients are more serious where some of them are coming with very high ferritin (blood protein that contains iron) levels. We have warned patients from taking self-medication for any type of fever. Over the month we have seen dengue and gastroenteritis cases increasing in Mumbai,” Dr Behram Pardiwala, head of internal medicine, Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central.BMC has instructed dispensaries to conduct rapid antigen tests for malaria for all suspected cases. People with fever, chill and cough are being tested for both malaria and Covid-19 as both have similar symptoms.Dr Manjusha Agarwal, senior consultant-internal medicine at Global Hospital, Parel, said, “Water containers, water storage tanks, empty tires, and pots act as dengue breeding sites. Keeping surroundings clean, emptying unnecessary stored water containers is important. Dengue fever can be life-threatening and proper treatment under the supervision of a doctor will avert complications.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malaria-cases-drop-in-mumbai-dengue-on-rise-101631627136307.html

14-09-2021||Mumbai||Amid Covid pandemic, online gaming addiction among kids a concern, say experts||On August 25, a 16-year-old from Andheri (East) left his house after his father reprimanded him for having spent ₹10 lakh, in a month, from his mother’s bank account for making in-game purchases, while playing PUBG online. The teenager had left a note behind, citing that he will earn and pay back the entire amount to his parents, and till then, he will not return home. Police traced the teenager to Mahakali Caves the next day and reunited him with his parents.On Sunday, a 16-year-old girl consumed rat poison because her younger brother did not allow her to play online games on their father’s mobile phone. The daughter of a rickshaw driver purchased a bottle of rat poison from a nearby medical store, returned home and consumed the poison in front of her younger brother.These are not isolated cases. More and more children, in their teens, are hooked to mobile phones, online games, watching series or gambling. It may appear harmless at first, but it does not take much time to further develop into an addiction, say experts. According to Childline and city psychologists, the age of students being reported with mild as well as severe screen addiction has gone down to six years. Experts said due to online classes, owing to the pandemic, children have suffered psychological problems including screen or online gaming addiction.Dr Anand Nadkarni, a reputed psychologist who has founded the Institute of Psychological Health (IPH) said that before the lockdown, in 2019, they got at least three to four online addiction cases, however, they have now increased to seven or eight in a month.“A teenager who has a low attention span and needs fast-moving objects to keep him occupied, usually are observed playing fast-paced games. If adolescence and raging hormones are combined with dysfunctional family background, this gaming activity can turn into an addiction,” said Nadkarni.In cases, the doctors have observed that several online games develop low patience in kids.“When the kids are noticed to be irritational or impatient, we often get a call to find out whether their kid is an addict,” said Dr Parth Soni from the Alpha Healing Centre, a de-addiction centre. He said in a year they used to have two or three admissions of teens addicted to online gaming, but now they get at least three to four calls in a month for counselling or curious parents to understand the symptoms of screen addiction.Free Fire, Call of Duty, PUBG are some of the violent online games that have impacted a large number of students, leaving child welfare agencies concerned. However, with online education, restricting access to gadgets has become near impossible for parents.“As education and even meeting friends is online, and with less parental supervision, the cases of addiction have gone up, which needs to be addressed,” said a worker at Childline who receive at least eight calls in a month of parents seeking counselling for their kids addicted to online gaming.As the problem increase across the world, The World Health Organisation declared compulsively playing online games as a mental health condition in 2018. Naming it “gaming disorder”, this applies to people who play excessively and till the extent of “sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months.”Dr Harish Shetty, a renowned psychiatrist from Mumbai, said in the last three years many girls and boys have been counselled by him for stealing cards of parents to buy weapons for their online games or upgrade their online games. “A student of fashion designing was upset about a failure, leading to anxiety and online gaming addiction.

Heading out to experience the outdoors, meet others, tasting a different cuisine, is becoming a way of emerging from lockdown restrictions, and a change from online calls and work from home. Indeed, travel now is not only about broadening the mind, but also reconnecting with the world and mental health. Much has changed with the climate and ecological crises and the risks of the pandemic, and so there are new mantras for tourism too. It goes without saying that we need to take care that the pursuit of enjoyment and leisure should not increase waste and pollution, cause disturbances or traffic congestion, or worse, destroy natural or cultural heritage that is a common resource. Instead, we need to think about how tourism can contribute to the healing of our minds, economies and ecosystems. A recent conference on sustainable tourism development in Pune, hosted by the BN College of Architecture that brought together entrepreneurs, local government, policy makers, academia and social enterprises had some pointers. Dr Shubhada Kamlapurkar, anchoring the conference management team says that “sustainable tourism requires multiple agencies to work together to set up standards and certification of tourism sites and facilities, and capacity building to strengthen the current systems. For example, it’s essential to have solid waste management, and safe water and sanitation systems to handle tourist influx, and sustainable site management within site carrying capacity, avoiding tourists venturing into fragile biodiversity zones.” As travellers, we need to be respectful to host communities, local customs and traditions, as well as staff and service providers. Privacy is a concern, so it is best to ask before taking photos of other people. Responsible tourism includes reducing waste, avoiding single use plastic, and taking care not to disturb wildlife and natural habitats. We should try to contribute to the local economy by buying local products, paying a fair price, and hiring local guides. Initiatives like the global Blue Flag award for beaches show how tourism can be an impetus for environmental improvement and conservation action. When preparing Ghoghla beach in Diu for meeting the Blue Flag criteria, the local administration had to first remove about 20 trucks of broken glass, plastic waste and other debris. Next, they set up drinking water facilities, sparkling clean toilets and showers, life guards, first aid, and opportunities for nature walks and environment education for the local population and visitors. Meeting the stringent criteria also required setting up excellent waste and sewage management facilities, and regular water quality testing within the bathing zone at the beach. Most interestingly, the beach managers also took up dune conservation by removing invasive exotic plants and protecting local plants. Such dune conservation and environmental management efforts are implemented at all the eight beaches in India that have been awarded the Blue Flag, with support from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the respective state governments. All tourism activity needs to be transformed into such sustainable forms. Most interesting are initiatives where tourists can themselves support environment conservation efforts. These include clean-ups, plantations, biodiversity documentation such as annual bird counts, monitoring and safeguarding turtle nesting, and ecosystem restoration efforts. Here is hoping for individual responsibility of tourists and collaborative, multi-stakeholder efforts promoted by the government so we can continue to enjoy the beauty and adventure our world offers, not only with reduced ecological footprints but also contributing to sustainability!

14-09-2021||Chandigarh||SKM giving political twist to my appeal for lifting sit-ins unfortunate: Capt Amarinder||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said it was unfortunate that the farmers agitating against the farm Laws had given a political twist to his remarks instead of understanding the misery caused to the people by their protests in the state, which were quite uncalled for, given his government’s continued support to them. Reiterating that the stir was damaging interests of state and its people, Amarinder lamented that despite his government’s unequivocal support to their cause, the farmers had misinterpreted his appeal and had, instead, tried to link it with the upcoming assembly polls in the state, he said. In a written statement, the CM said his government, as well as the people of Punjab, had always stood with the farmers on the issue of the farm laws, and it was sad that they were now suffering due to the continued protests of the farming community across the state. Amarinder, while addressing an event on Monday, had appealed to the farmer unions not to hold protests in Punjab as they were affecting the state’s economy. The CM’s statement drew flak from farmer leaders who attributed the statement to his fear that the farm stir could damage his party’s prospects in the upcoming state polls. The Punjab CM asserted that there was no question of trying to split the farmers of Punjab and Haryana, all of whom were equal victims of the apathy of the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in the neighbouring state. He pointed out that it was not the Adanis or the Ambanis whose interests were being hurt by such protests but the common people of the state, as well as its economy. The Adanis’ assets in Punjab were a miniscule 0.8% of the total, and the presence of the Reliance Group stood at a nominal 0.1%, the chief minister said, adding that the losses caused to these industries due to the farmers’ unrest in the state were too minor to be of any serious concern to them. He said continued protests in Punjab would push industry out of the state and have a severe impact on the economy. The situation was already becoming serious on the grain storage and procurement front due to the agitation, with lifting of the stocks by the FCI and state agencies getting obstructed, he said, adding that the stocks lying in the FCI Adani silio at Moga alone was worth ₹480 crore. “All the movement of wheat stocks from FCI Adani silo, Moga, and FCI silo, Kotkapura, is halted due to the on-going farmers protest, whereas, 1,60,855 MT of wheat stocks of previous crop years stored in the Adani silo, Moga, by FCI needs to be liquidated on priority, as deterioration of these stocks may lead to losses to the Public exchequer”. The CM said that construction of silos awarded by FCI was getting delayed as farmer unions were not allowing JCBs and trucks to enter the construction sites. “What is further likely to damage the state’s interests is reports of silo concessionaires/parties also considering to shut down the projects being set up in Punjab. If things continue in this manner, we will lose out on investment, revenue and employment opportunities,” he warned, adding that this would lead to serious paralysis of the government in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/skm-giving-political-twist-to-my-appeal-for-lifting-sit-ins-unfortunate-capt-amarinder-101631626176635.html
14-09-2021||Lucknow||Before 2017, UP was run by gangsters; things have changed now: PM Narendra Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said Uttar Pradesh was run by gangsters and mafias before 2017, but now things have changed under chief minister Yogi Adityanath and such elements are behind the bars.He also said that earlier roadblocks were created in the implementation of welfare schemes meant for the poor, but now there are no such hurdles and the benefits of these schemes are reaching the needy.Modi was addressing a function after laying the foundation stone of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University in Aligarh.The university is being established by the state government in the memory and honour of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, the great freedom fighter, educationist and social reformer. It is being set up in a total area of over 92 acres at Lodha village and Musepur Kareem Jarouli village of Aligarh's Kol tehsil.The university will provide affiliation to 395 colleges of the Aligarh division.The prime minister also visited an exhibition on the Aligarh node of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor.He said India was earlier seen as an importer of defence equipment, but today it is considered a leading defence exporter."Today not only India, but the world is watching how equipment ranging from modern grenades, rifles, fighter planes, drones and warships, are manufactured in the country itself," he noted.Modi also remembered veteran BJP leader Kalyan Singh and said had he been there on this occasion, he would have appreciated a university coming up in the name of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, in his home district.The Adityanath government's decision to set up the university after the noted Jat figure is being politically seen as part of the ruling BJP's bid to win over the community ahead of the crucial state assembly polls early next year.A section of Jats, who live in sizeable numbers in western Uttar Pradesh, is seen to be aggrieved with the BJP over the farmers issue.Meanwhile, Adityanath and deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma briefed Modi about the upcoming university.Governor Anandiben Patel was also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/before-2017-up-was-run-by-gangsters-and-mafias-things-have-changed-now-pm-101631622832976.html
14-09-2021||Chandigarh||Never too late to discover life and your true calling||As a child, I was fed with many idioms because mother would come up with a unique one for every occasion. One such adage that I found intriguing, though couldn’t decipher it completely until recently, was: Life begins at 40. I would wonder how and why? However, during the first Covid-19 lockdown, amid the restrictions and constraints, I discovered its true ethos and consequently the meaning of life. As I readied to ring in my much-awaited 40th birthday this July, I realised that life is certainly not about running to work every day at 9am, waiting to be home by 5pm, being wrapped up in the monotony of the routine or living on terms dictated by society. It is the opposite! There is so much more to life which we do not even attempt to unveil. Life is finding time to sit with yourself, not using work as a form of escapism and following your heart. My newfound love for life became stronger in the past year and a half that we have been playing peekaboo with this seemingly perpetual pandemic. The activities that remained on my bucket list for years became a reality. For instance, I tried my hand at golfing, painted Vincent van Gogh’s Field with Irises, practised yoga, took nature walks, wrote poetry, visited the farm regularly, enrolled for a French course, spent time with my family and, most importantly, experienced little pleasures like having tea with my husband. I realised life is too short to be engulfed in the mundane, so I revamped it by quitting my noble profession of teaching computer science in a college to pursue my passion of being a personality development trainer. Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama’s words guide me: The purpose of our lives is to be happy. My journey hitherto had been a rollercoaster ride as I got married at 22, became a mother at 23 and started working full time at 25 along with continuing my studies. There was no looking back, slowing down or pausing for more than a decade and a half which was spent in proving myself to the world. Nevertheless, as I stepped into my forties, I suddenly started to feel more confident and less bothered about how people perceive me. Thankfully, I welcomingly embrace my flaws and have finally begun to take charge of my life. The sudden awakening in me has made me realise that I have to press the reset button to refill the pending gaps in accordance with Albert Einstein’s statement, If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things. Even though my longstanding plans to celebrate my milestone 40th in Goa with my gang of girlfriends went down the drain because of travel restrictions, my plan to live life free and fully will continue forever. I seek solace in the couplet, “Kabhi kisi ko mukammal jahan nahi milta, kahin zameen toh kahin asma nahi milta.” nazam81@gmail.comThe writer is a Hoshiarpur-based personality development trainer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/never-too-late-to-discover-life-and-your-true-calling-101631621736749.html
14-09-2021||Kolkata||Kishore Datta, Bengal’s 4th advocate general since 2011, resigns like the rest||Chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government appointed senior lawyer Gopal Mukherjee as the state’s top law officer on Tuesday. The move came hours after the government suffered a blow with incumbent Kishore Datta stepping down from the post citing personal reasons.Datta is the fourth advocate general of the state to resign since 2011 when the Trinamool Congress first came to power.Senior Calcutta high court advocate Gopal Mukherjee was appointed as the new AG by Governor Jagdeep Dhankar. An eminent lawyer, Datta was appointed in February 2017 after his predecessor, Jayanta Mitra, stepped down following differences with the government over some important cases. Lakshmi Gupta, the additional AG, also announced his resignation on that day. Appointed by the governor under Article 165 of the Constitution, the AG is the highest law officer of a state. The tenure of appointment is not defined by the Constitution. In a letter sent to Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday morning, Datta wrote, “I do hereby tender resignation as advocate general for the state of West Bengal, with immediate effect, owing to personal reasons. Please accept the same. It was a wonderful experience working for the state of West Bengal.” A copy of the letter, which HT has seen, was sent to law minister Moloy Ghatak, who, incidentally, was summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to its Delhi office on Tuesday for questioning in the coal smuggling case. The minister informed the ED that he would not be able to fly to Delhi at such short notice and volunteered to face its officers either in Kolkata or through video conference. “The government was not happy with Datta as it suffered one blow after another at the Calcutta high court in recent months. The biggest blow came on June 18 when the court asked the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to probe the allegations of murder, rape and other crimes reported in the districts after the March-April state polls. Our lawyers could not convince the court that the NHRC report was biased. As a result, the court, on August 19, ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),” a senior TMC leader told HT on condition of anonymity. “The high court, while hearing a case, recently observed that counsels for the state were often found absent during hearings. This was an embarrassment,” the TMC leader added. Datta avoided the media but members of the high court bar council and state officials said the process to find his successor has started. The TMC government suffered another setback on September 1 when a special CBI court in Kolkata permitted the ED to send summons to ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, TMC legislator Madan Mitra, former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee in the Narada case. The ED has charged them under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. These leaders were arrested by the CBI on May 17 in the Narada case and sent to judicial custody after the high court’s five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal set aside a bail order passed by a special court. The case pertains to a controversy that erupted ahead of the 2016 assembly elections after the Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing several high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. Since 2014, the ED and the CBI are probing the operations of several chit fund companies such as Saradha, Rose Valley and I-Core. Several TMC leaders are named as accused in these cases. Industry minister Partha Chatterjee was questioned by the ED on Monday in the I-Core case. Anindya Mitra was the first AG to resign after TMC came to power in 2011. His successor, Bimal Chatterjee, also resigned citing personal reasons. Jayanta Mitra was appointed towards the end of 2014. Mitra’s resignation created a sensation in 2017 with many eminent lawyers accusing the government of putting legal experts under pressure for political reasons. “Let the government go ahead with its policies. I am grateful to my colleagues and support team for letting me serve the people successfully,” Mitra said after putting in his papers. Manjit Singh, the chief public prosecutor, too, resigned in January 2017. Critics pointed fingers at the government after Datta resigned. “The post of the AG is a Constitutional position. The TMC government is corrupt. It does not want to follow any law. An AG cannot become part of political decisions. Datta at least served for a longer period than his predecessors,” former AG of Tripura and CPI-M Rajya Sabha member Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya told HT. Bhattacharya is representing petitioners against the government in most of the important cases, including Saradha. “We have heard from different sources that Datta was forced to resign. No lawyer, no matter how qualified he may be, can ensure the rulings that the TMC government expects from courts,” said Samik Bhattacharya, chief spokesperson of the Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kishore-datta-bengal-s-4th-advocate-general-since-2011-resigns-like-the-rest-101631621497698.html

This happened a day after the Union home ministry asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to probe the September 8 bomb attack outside the lawmaker’s home. Officers from Bhatpara police station said Tuesday’s bomb was lying near a wall. “Nobody threw the bomb. There was no injury,” an officer said on condition of anonymity. “The repeated attacks have exposed the inefficiency of the police. There is no sign of law and order,” said MP’s son and BJP legislator from Bhatpara, Pawan Singh.Singh, who left the Trinamool Congress (TMC) prior to the 2019 polls, represents the Barrackpore Lok Sabha constituency which has come to be known for killings and political clashes in the last two years.

On September 8, at least three crude bombs were hurled by miscreants outside Singh’s residence. Eyewitnesses told the police that two bombs hit the main gate while a third landed inside the premises. The MP was not at home and no one was injured. He alleged that it was an attempt to kill him and his son. Police arrested two people in this connection. “The real culprits went scot free,” Singh told HT on Monday evening while reacting to the MHA’s decision. He is the BJP’s observer for the Bhawanipore bypolls in Kolkata where chief minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bomb-goes-off-near-bengal-bjp-mp-s-home-day-after-mha-orders-nia-probe-101631618675362.html

Madhepura district jail too has inmates nearly three times the capacity.A senior official said that pendency of cases and bail matters increased due to disruptions caused in functioning of courts due to Covid-19 pandemic, which has contributed to the pressure on jails. This year alone, over 6,000 inmates were added, taking the number of prisoners to 56,424 in April and 61,362, including 2,278 women, in July.In Patna’s Beur Model Prison, the number of inmates has reached 4,233 against the capacity of 2,360, while Buxar Central jail has 1,709 prisoners against the sanctioned capacity of 1,126, and Muzaffarpur Central jail has 3,415 inmates against the sanctioned strength of 2,135. Other Central prisons are also in no better condition. Purnea has 1,853 prisoners against the capacity of 1,198, Motihari has 2,782 inmates against the capacity of 2,503, Gaya has 2,714 against the sanctioned capacity of 2,606 and Bhagalpur has 2,171 against the capacity of 1962.Bhagalpur special Central jail is the only prison with fewer inmates (1,678) than the sanctioned capacity (3,288).Mithilesh Mishra, inspector general (IG) (prisons) said that in view of the growing pressure, the proposal for 93 additional wards in 21 jails, including eight central jails, has been sent to the government. “Once the new wards are ready, the pressure will ease,” he added.Prachi Pallavi, an advocate at the Patna high court, said that the Supreme Court, while dealing with the health crisis in prisons and remand homes due to the pandemic, had in March last year directed for constitution of a High-Powered Committee (HPC) comprising of chairman of the State Legal Services Committee, the principal secretary (home) and the director general (DG) of prison(s), to determine which class of persons could be released on parole or an interim bail for such period as may be thought appropriate. Though Bihar was quick to form the committee for compliance the very next day, the objective of the exercise to release prisoners for decongesting prisons could not be achieved.“As a matter of fact, the state of Bihar has the second highest number of undertrial prisoners as per the report of the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) and there is an urgent need for safety mechanisms in the prisons of Bihar, which requires less crowding as a prerequisite. The best way is to release prisoners who can be released,” Pallavi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-planning-93-additional-wards-to-decongest-overcrowded-prisons-101631618555430.html

The saffron party candidate has alleged that Banerjee did not reveal the pending criminal cases against her.A letter written by Tibrewal's election agent Sajal Ghosh to the returning officer of the Bhabanipur assembly constituency also mentioned several news reports carrying information pertaining to the pending criminal cases against Banerjee.Tibrewal, who joined BJP in 2014 and is the West Bengal vice-president of BJP’s youth wing, represented her party in the Calcutta high court during the hearings over the alleged post-poll violence in the state.After filing her nomination on Monday, Tibrewal said that her battle for the Bhabanipur seat will be a “fight against injustice, and also a fight for justice, for the people of West Bengal.”“I would like to tell the people of Bhabanipur that they’ve got a big opportunity. So, they should come forward and make history,” she added.The lawyer began her poll campaign on Sunday by drawing BJP’s symbol – a lotus — on a wall in Bhabanipur locality. On Saturday, she visited the iconic Kalighat Temple in south Kolkata to offer prayers to Goddess Kali, when she stressed her fight is against the members of the ruling dispensation in West Bengal.Notably, Banerjee who delivered a landslide victory of the BJP in Assembly elections this year, has to win from any constituency before November 5 to become a member of the state assembly – a mandate for her to continue in the chief minister’s chair. She was defeated by a narrow margin of 1,956 votes by her former aide Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram. Later, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay vacated his seat from Bhabanipur – where he had won as a TMC candidate, for Banerjee to contest.The Bhabanipur bypolls will be held on September 30, and the counting of votes will take place on October 3 – a week before Durga Puja celebrations.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bhabanipur-bypolls-bjp-s-priyanka-tibrewal-objects-to-mamata-s-nomination-101631615875112.html

I have been saying since 2013 that Taliban’s emergence could be a sign of concern for India, while it might benefit China and Pakistan. But for the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), all Muslims are Taliban. The Indian government has made a strategic blunder by isolating Muslims in the National Register for Citizens (NRC). I always maintained that it should not be on religious lines, ” he said, while talking to media persons in Patna.Also Read | 2 FIRs against Asaduddin Owaisi a day after public meetReacting to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s ‘abba jaan’ remark, Owaisi said, “Had he worked, he wouldn’t have had to take recourse of ‘abbajaan’ at the time of election. UP Muslims have the lowest literacy rate and the highest dropout rate. UP has the highest number of malnutritioned children. Yogi is only diverting attention from those issues.”“We are preparing to contest 100 seats in UP. So far there is no tie-up. We can go it alone also...Those who point fingers at us for helping any party should explain what happened in the Lok Sabha election when AIMIM was not in the fray. In Bihar, we fought 19 seats and won five. We are expanding to ensure that the Muslims get their deserved rights, which has not happened and is apparent through their poor economic and educational condition,” he said, adding the state unit of the party would take a call on the two seats going to by-elections in Bihar later this year.Owaisi was also critical of a letter from Kishanganj district magistrate for identification of suspected foreign nationals, citing Patna high court. He said it looked like an attempt to implement NRC through the backdoor. “I am disappointed. I expected the state government to give clarity on the matter before the court,” he added.BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said Owaisi was trying to instigate Muslims in the name of NRC for his brand of politics, like the Congress and RJD always did. “Nobody can stay in any country without passport and visa, unless one gets political asylum or is treated as refugee. Rest are treated as illegal immigrants and every country requires to prepare their list. The same needs to be done in India as well. What is happening in Seemanchal is a normal police process, as the issue of illegal immigration is no secret in the bordering areas such as Kishanganj, Katihar, Araria etc. at present, NRC has not been implemented and Owaisi should refrain from deriving political mileage out of it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/owaisi-dares-centre-to-declare-taliban-a-terrorist-outfit-101631616275451.html

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said the “bubble” of the Gujarat model of development has burst.Patel, a first time MLA, was chosen to replace Vijay Rupani, then CM, who resigned past Saturday. The state elections are due late 2022. The editorial said that the move to replace the CM was to appease the powerful Patidar community. It added that the change of guard was also done to counter the anti-incumbency against Rupani ahead of 2022 state polls. There was an overall resentment towards the government over Covid-19 management, rising unemployment, and disrupted economy, the editorial said.Also Read | After Sakinaka rape and murder, Thackeray holds urgent meet; Sena says Mumbai is safest“The government machinery has clearly crumbled during Covid where funeral pyres were burning in every village. There was resentment among people that the government was helpless and silently watching the dead being cremated. “Besides that, unemployment has risen in Gujarat and many big businesses have shut shop. Across the state, farmers and the unemployed are angry. Knowing well that this anger would affect the party in the next election, Rupani was replaced with Bhupendra Patel.

The amendment bill is to add a new section “27-A” in the Rajasthan Tourism Trade (Facilitation and Regulation) Act, 2010 which makes the offence cognizable and bailable. If repeated, it will be a non-bailable offence as per sub-section 4 of Section 13 of the Act.Tourism is a key industry in the state with 1.6million foreign and 45million domestic tourists visiting it annually in pre-Covid times. However, tourists have often flagged misbehaviour by touts and illegal vendors. Also Read | NHRC seeks reports from Centre, 4 states over farmers’ stirMinister of state for tourism Govind Singh Dotasra said the legislation was brought in 2010 to boost tourism business and prevent misbehaviour with tourists. However, it did not spell out whether the offence was bailable or not, hence, requiring an amendment.Tour Operator Association of Rajasthan representative Sanjay Kaushik said, “It is a welcome step and a move towards safe and secure tourism. If tourists are cheated, it not only maligns the state but also the country’s name.” President, Rajasthan Hotel and Restaurant Association, Kuldeep Singh said it is a good step when it comes to misbehaviour with tourist but should not be there for touts.

14-09-2021||Lucknow||UP polls 2022: Expelled Congress leaders question Priyanka Vadra's leadership||Ahead of the Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh, expelled Congress leaders Satyadev Tripathi and Siraj Mehandi on Monday questioned the leadership of party's general secretary and state in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.Former state minister Satyadev Tripathi and former MLC Siraj Mehandi who were expelled from the party by the Uttar Pradesh Congress Disciplinary Committee in 2019 for 'indulging in anti-party activities' said under Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's leadership, the party will suffer the same fate it did in Amethi in the Lok Sabha elections of May 2019."The Congress party does not value its workers. I worked for the party non-stop from 1986 to November 14, 2019, and was expelled without any proper reason. Since then no one has answered any communication from our end. We meet people on the ground and get reports. Party does not value its workers and has no connection with them," said Tripathi.The reaction came after former Union minister Salman Khurshid on Monday said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will be the face of the party in the state elections.Tripathi said the Congress general secretary, who was the 'face' of her brother Rahul Gandhi's election campaign in Amethi in 2019 was unable to take Congress towards victory because she lost touch with the ground workers of the party."If things continued in the Congress the way they were in 2019, the party will suffer the same fate," he said.Meanwhile, former MLC Siraj Mehandi went a step further and said Congress leadership is 'arrogant' and does not consider party leaders' opinions about party related matters."Congress leadership is keeping an arrogant stance. It is a sad affair that Priyanka Gandhi comes to UP for two days like she is going on a picnic. Nobody wants to meet the workers. When Rajeev Gandhi was Prime Minister, he used to meet at least a thousand people in a day. It is difficult to meet Sonia ji, and by chance, if you meet her, she says meet Rahul. Rahul says to meet Priyanka and Priyanka does not have time to meet people. The biggest problem in Congress today is that high command's touch with the ground workers and does not listen to anyone else," said Mehandi.The former MLC further attacking the Congress state in charge said that she went to Raebareli, which was referred to as the 'family bastion' of Gandhi family, and was not able to take party towards victory in the Zila Parishad election.Talking about Congress rebel Aditi Singh, Mehandi said the issues between her and the party would have been sorted if Priyanka Gandhi paid her a visit and listened to her grievances."Recently Sushmita Dev left Congress. We talked to her and her core issue with the party was that there was no communication with the high command. She is such a senior leader. If she's having problems in communication, imagine the plight of the common workers," he added.Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections are scheduled to take place early next year.In the 2017 Assembly elections, the BJP won a landslide victory winning 312 Assembly seats. The party secured a 39.67 per cent vote share in the elections for 403-member Assembly. Samajwadi Party (SP) bagged 47 seats, BSP won 19 while Congress could manage to win only seven seats.

He added that Kaimur, known for paddy, wheat and vegetable production, had a great potential for agro-based industries and the state government was planning to make the district a hub of rice milling, food processing and ethanol industries.Government’s initiative was likely to create jobs and also encourage entrepreneurship, he said.Earlier in the day, Hussain met with the district administration to review the progress in implementation of industrial schemes, especially those meant for scheduled caste, scheduled tribes, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and minorities.Responding to Hussain’s claim, All India Congress Committee (AICC) media panelist and member of Bihar legislative assembly Prem Chandra Mishra said that no prominent Congress leader had joined the BJP recently and the BJP leaders were worried about their own future. “The BJP leaders feared about their own future because of the party’s fast deteriorating popularity owing to rising costs and unemployment in the country. Their support base was badly sinking all over India and people were seeing Congress as the only alternative,” Mishra said, adding that Hussain should instead “focus on the worsening industrial scenario in Bihar during the NDA’s 15-year rule".Political analyst Dr Haridwar Pandey said that though people’s confidence in the Congress was low due to internecine bickering, lack of leadership and innovative solutions, it was still the only alternative to the BJP once it came out of the present situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/shahnawaz-hussain-says-congress-is-sinking-boat-welcomes-rebels-into-bjp-fold-101631603674904.html

The bench has directed Lalit to surrender in four weeks, failing which a non-bailable warrant will be issued against him.As per the prosecution’s case, Lalit abused and shot at Lorna six times in the early hours of October 28, 2007, when she objected to his friend’s car being parked in her parking slot at a Cuff Parade residential apartments, where the siblings lived together amid strain caused by a property dispute. Lorna received injuries in her chest and hand but survived. Lorna told police that Lalit continued to pull the trigger even after exhausting all the bullets in his gun. The incident had taken place in the parking lot of the building.Lalit was prosecuted for attempted murder but the trial court convicted him only for causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon and sentenced him to three years imprisonment on February 1, 2012, while giving him bail after the verdict.Lalit then moved HC challenging his conviction, while the state and Lorna filed separate appeals challenging his acquittal on the charge of attempt to murder and pleading for enhancement of his sentence.Lalit told the high court that he shot at Lorna in self defence after she charged at him with an iron rod. He claimed that he was living under fear since Lorna had threatened to get him killed using names of different gangsters. It was also argued on his behalf that the attack was not premeditated and therefore the charge of attempt to murder did not apply.Assistant public prosecutor Geeta Mulekar, however, pointed out that Lalit had acted in cruel manner and the very fact that he fired six bullets at the unarmed victim indicated he wanted to kill her.The court accepted her argument and said, “The accused had fired six gun shots at PW 1 (Lorna) who was unarmed and thus acted in cruel and unusual manner. ...the accused is, thus, not entitled to benefit of exception 4 to Section 300 of the IPC.”HC held that the trial court had “ignored the well settled legal position that determinative factor for constituting offence punishable under section 307 of the IPC (attempt to murder) is intention and not injury.”“Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we have not the slightest doubt in our minds that the intention of the accused was to kill PW 1,” said the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-sends-lalit-d-souza-to-10-years-in-jail-for-attempt-to-murder-sister-101631588493657.html

The CJI, however, did not specify a date of hearing.Singhvi submitted that the Government of National Capital Territory (Amendment) Act 2021, or GNCTD Act, is contrary to the constitution bench judgement of the Supreme Court.He added, “It is against Article 239A (which deals with the status of Delhi) under the Constitution...the extra power given to the LG has made governance difficult.”The senior counsel also said that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s plea should be listed urgently, as it was cleared by the apex court’s registry on August 19.The Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha passed the GNCTD Amendment Act in March. In March, after the Parliament approved the bill, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had termed it as a “sad day for Indian democracy”.The amended Act has changed four provisions of the National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991. The new law makes it mandatory for the Delhi government to seek the opinion of the LG before taking any executive action in pursuance of decisions by the council of ministers, or any other decision under any law in force in the Capital.Another contentious amendment seeks to invalidate retrospectively rules made by the legislative assembly of Delhi or committees/house panels to consider the matters of “day-to-day administration of the Capital” or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions.The Delhi government, in its petition before the top court, has maintained that the 2021 law is contrary to two judgments by the Supreme Court: a Constitution bench verdict on July 4, 2018 and a two-judge bench decision on February 14, 2019.It has demanded that such provisions should be struck down as being unconstitutional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/top-court-agrees-to-list-delhi-govt-s-plea-against-gnctd-act-101631577703735.html

But it’s a beautifully old-fashioned sliding glass door through which one enters inside its cosy interiors. This afternoon a grey-haired lady, the owner, is standing behind the counter. “Until recently my husband would also be here,” she says, her voice suddenly overcome with intense feelings. Moti Nankani passed away early this year to Covid. Rekha Nankani turns to gaze towards her husband’s portrait adorned with a white pearl necklace. The frame shares the shelf space with paperbacks by Haruki Murakami, Jhumpa Lahiri, Aravind Adiga and Suketu Mehta. Ms Nankani, 65, admits of struggling through the predictable challenges that independent bookstores like hers are facing in these days of the pandemic. During the lockdown the shop’s business had come to a standstill. “But my staff is very supportive,” she says, introducing shop assistants Nand Kishore, Anil Mishra and Pooran Prakash. These gents have been serving here for more than 10 years, and their friendly nature helps sustain the shop’s bond with its long-time patrons.Ms Nankani graciously admits her neighbour’s widespread popularity. “They have their business. We have ours. They have their faithful customers. We have ours.” Here she pauses, chuckles a bit, saying, “Many young people frequent their bookshop, while we have customers who have been coming to our bookshop for many years.”Commuting daily from her home in Sarvapriya Vihar, Ms Nankani is joined by her son in the evening. The shop was named after her daughter, who lives in the United Kingdom. “My husband set up the bookstore in 1984, the year this market opened… but I started working in it only in 1997, after the children grew up.” She briefly glances at her husband’s portrait. Now a customer shows up, and the place gets busy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-other-bookstore-in-aurobindo-101631576785142.html

The new courts complex has offices of police commissioner, deputy commissioner, senior officials of the police, judiciary and district administration. The courts complex also houses a police post and offices of the crime investigation agency (CIA staff).Residences of all police, judicial and district administration officials are situated near Rakh Bagh of Basant Singh Khalsa road (Club Road) due to which cops remain deployed here 24/7. On September 1, a Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle parked outside the civil surgeon’s office, which is located just opposite the police commissioner’s residence was stolen. It is learnt that police had initiated a special drive to deter vehicle-lifting incidents from Rakh Bagh and even installed closed-circuit television cameras in the area, but to no avail.Other areas in the city where vehicle-lifting cases are rampant include Transport Nagar, Pindi Street, Ferozepur road near Sidhwan Canal and Dayanand Medical College and Hospital.Hero Splendor ‘a favourite’ Between August 28 and September 11, a total of 74 motorcycles were stolen from the city. Of these, 42 were of the Hero Splendor brand. The second favourite of the criminals was the Honda Activa as at least 14 scooters of this brand were stolen. A Maruti Zen car, a three-wheeler and a Mahindra Bolero were also stolen from the city. As per police officials, the wide presence and high resale value of Splendor bikes makes it an easy target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianas-high-security-areas-fail-to-keep-vehicle-lifters-at-bay-101631568812356.html

SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal had announced the names of Paramjeet Singh Dhillon and Sharanjit Singh Dhillon while holding rallies in Samrala and Sahnewal, while district party president Ranjit Singh Dhillon will contest polls from the Ludhiana-East constituency. The candidature of Harish Rai Dhanda from Atam Nagar constituency has sent ripples through the political circuits as the constituency is represented by Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief Simarjeet Singh Bains, who is facing rape charges. The complainant is being unequivocally supported by Dhanda, who is a bitter rival of the MLA. Playing the panthic card, the SAD has fielded Gurudwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib president Pritpal Singh Pali. Many names including Youth Akali Dal (YAD) district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha and former LIP leader Vipan Sood Kaka were doing the rounds, but the party preferred Pali over Gosha and Kaka Sood.Former Cabinet minister and senior SAD leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal has been offered the seat from Ludhiana West, which is currently being represented by Congress heavyweight and sitting cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.It was speculated that Kamal Chatly, who had recently left the saffron party to join SAD, would be offered the seat. Chatly had fought against Ashu in the previous election and had even put up his hoardings in the constituency. His supporters in the Sham Nagar Area had also begun campaigning for him. However, SAD banked on the old warhorse, instead of Chatly.Darshan Singh Shivalik, a Dalit leader, has been offered the seat from Gill Constituency. He had lost the last election to bureaucrat-turned-politician Kuldip Singh Vaid.Sitting MLA Manpreet Singh Ayali is SAD’s pick from Dakha constituency. Ayali had defeated chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s confidant Captain Sandeep Sandhu during the 2019 bypolls.Former legislator SR Kaler has been offered a seat from Jagraon. He was defeated by AAP leader Sarabjit Kau Manuke last time. SAD has not announced candidates from Raikot, Ludhiana North and South, Payal and Khanna. Those in the know say leaders from the Bahujan Samaj Party will contest polls from Ludhiana-North and Payal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assembly-polls-sad-announces-candidates-from-9-ludhiana-constituencies-101631568512456.html

The victim, Nitin Wadhwani, 45 of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, said, “On September 10, I had gone to Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar for dinner around 8pm. Later, I decided to Lodhi Club Road for a milkshake and was having the beverage in my car when three men forcibly took my car key, held me at gunpoint, took my gold bracelet, gold chain, ring, two mobile phones, debit cards and identification proofs.” “The robbers forced me to sit in the car and asked for directions of my house, so that they could rob it too. Two security guards were deputed at the main gate of my colony, but I did not ask them for help as the accused had held me at gunpoint. When they slowed down, I jumped off and fled. I raised the alarm, following which they drove away,” he said.Significantly, the incident occurred at the same place where four miscreants had robbed a couple of their car on August 25. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 3) Sameer Verma said the accused had forced the victim to yield details about his family members, and cash and gold kept in his house.

14-09-2021||Chandigarh||Excess rain in September leaves Haryana paddy growers anxious||The more than normal rainfall in September has left paddy farmers worried about the impact on the yield at this stage.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Haryana received 113.3mm rain from September 1 to 13 – 124% more than 50.7mm considered normal in the month. More rain has also been forecast till September 16 in most of parts of the state.Farmers, who grew early varieties, are troubled as the crop was ready for harvest, but was now left ridden with higher moisture content.“I am unable to get my five acres of Pusa 1509 harvested because of the bad weather. Even the price is good this year, but the rain in the past couple of days has delayed harvesting by one week,” said Raj Kumar, a farmer in Kurukshetra district.The delay, farmers said, will also hold up sowing of next crops. “Most of the farmers grow early varieties of paddy so that they can vacate the field for vegetables like potato, cauliflower, radish, carrot and peas,” said Harish Kumar, who has rented five acres in Karnal’s Gharaunda area to grow cauliflower.Agriculture experts also maintain that excess rain in September is harmful for paddy, especially for the early varieties. “Most of the crop is at the flowering or milking stage. The rain will not only affect the growth of the grain but also cause lustre loss,” said Dr Narender Goyal of Krishi Vigyan Kendra at Damla, Yamunanagar.Karam Chand, deputy director, Haryana agriculture department, advised farmers to avoid harvesting immediately and wait for the next couple of days.According to figures of the state agriculture department, this year Haryana has reported around 18% decline in the area under paddy cultivation, which has dropped from 15.27 lakh hectares last year to 12.5 lakh hectares this year.The government claims that the fall in the area under paddy is a result of its incentive schemes. But there are also reports that several farmers failed to grow water guzzler paddy due to the long dry spell from June 15 to July 11.The state saw only 58mm rain in scattered places against a normal of 87.4 mm in the first 11 days of July – a 34% shortfall.Even the precipitation in June was 12% deficient, with the state recording 57.8mm showers from June 1 to July 10 against the normal of 86.2mm, according to IMD data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/excess-rain-in-september-leaves-haryana-paddy-growers-anxious-101631566833648.html
14-09-2021||Chandigarh||Police lathicharge on farmers was wrong: Haryana BJP chief||Haryana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Om Prakash Dhankar on Monday said the police lathicharge on the protesting farmers in Karnal on August 28 should not have taken place.“It was wrong,” Dhankar said in a news conference, adding that he had conveyed this to chief minister Khattar and asked to hold an inquiry into the police action. The state BJP chief applauded the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government for tackling the farmers’ agitation with “huge restraint and decorum”, while reiterating that the government was functioning with full restraint and its priority was to ensure Karnal-like incidents didn’t recur.“This decorum must also become the part and parcel of those protesting...Because others also have the right to hold their programmes and this decorum must be maintained by all,” Dhankar said, regretting that the ongoing farmers stir had become “purely a political protest”.The politics, he said, had hijacked the farmers’ agitation, which now had nothing to do with the welfare of the cultivators. He said even though the agitation had moved beyond its real issues, the Union government was still open to dialogue on all outstanding issues. “But they have gone past the agenda of agitation. It has become purely political and least bothered about the welfare of farmers,” Dhankar said. Responding to a question, the BJP chief said it was equally wrong to say the agitation had the backing of all farmers of Haryana. There were, he said, 19 lakh families of cultivators in Haryana and that only one farmers’ organisation was unhappy with the government. One or two odd farmer unions’ agitation cannot be dubbed as the protest of the entire farming community, he said. Asking the opposition Haryana Congress leaders to persuade the Congress government in Punjab to give compensation to farmers and procure crops on the lines of Haryana, Dhankar dared the party to replicate Haryana’s procurement model in Punjab and Rajasthan. He said Haryana will procure bajra at ₹2,250 and asked the Congress to procure it in Rajasthan also. He said it was after four years that Punjab hiked sugarcane price. “Yahan gian dene ko bade chatur ho, vahan daam kayun nahi dete (they are very clever in giving sermons here, but why don’t they give money to the farmers in neighbouring states),” he quipped.BJP plans events to celebrate PM’s 71st birthdayHaryana BJP chief OP Dhankar said the party will launch a 20-day long Sewa Aur Samarpan campaign in the state from September 17, coinciding with the 71th birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During this campaign, concluding on October 7, the BJP plans to hold 71 blood donation camps, seminars on 71 big ticket policies and programmes of the Centre and plantation of 71,000 saplings. The party also plans to greet the prime minister by dispatching 20 lakh letters from people who will pen their views independently about the Union government’s policies they like the most.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/police-lathicharge-on-farmers-was-wrong-haryana-bjp-chief-101631566832351.html

14-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab school board mid-term question papers leaked online||Some of the question papers of the Punjab State Education Board (PSEB) mid-term examination were leaked on a YouTube channel three days before the tests were scheduled to start on Monday. The matter came to light after a complaint in this regard was lodged with secretary (school education) Krishan Kumar and Ludhiana district education officer (DEO) Lakhvir Singh Samra by Sukhdarshan Singh, president of the Anti-Cheating Teachers’ Front, Punjab. However, the multiple-choice question (MCQ)-based tests were held in two shifts on Monday despite the paper leak. The mid-term exams are also aimed at preparing the students of Classes 3, 5, 8 and 10 for the National Achievement Survey (NAS). Among the question papers leaked on the YouTube channel named Virdi Blog are Class 8 mathematics, Class 9 Hindi and Class 10 science and mathematics. In the comment section, the users requested for question papers of various subjects, including Class 12 chemistry, physics and maths. “A teacher in my school received a message from a Class 10 student about the paper leak. He approached us with videos. We were shocked to see the exact question papers on the channel which we received for the exams. We immediately lodged a complaint with the officials of the education department,” said Sukhdarshan Singh who is posted at Government High School, Kot Mangal Singh, in Ludhiana. Another teacher aware of the paper leak termed the criteria of examination a political agenda. “These papers are prepared keeping the National Achievement Survey in mind. Due to pressure from the authorities, all the schools in the state are focusing on getting top spot in the NAS that is scheduled in November. These question papers are objective type unlike the usual descriptive types for the mid-term exams. This is happening to woo the voters ahead of the state polls,” he claimed. Senior officials, including DEO Lakhvir Singh, were unavailable for comments. Sukhdarshan Singh said the department should lodge a police complaint. Teachers said no written order of cancellation of examinations was received by the schools yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-school-board-mid-term-question-papers-leaked-online-101631566173068.html

14-09-2021||Chandigarh||Blackbuck deaths at Bathinda zoo due to poisoning caused by bacterial infection, reveals autopsy||An analysis of viscera samples by experts at the Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana, have attributed the death of three blackbucks at a mini zoo in Bathinda’s Bir Talab to ‘toxemia’ or poisoning due to bacterial infection. Histopathology of all three has ruled out any external injuries on the young female antelopes that were found dead within a short span of time on August 19. While two were aged 3 and 4 months, the third one was three-year-old. The development, however, has perplexed the wildlife authorities as they are unable to link the cause of poisoning in the deer safari which is closed for visitors since March last year in view of the Covid-19 restrictions.Tests of feed and fodder samples by the Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (NRDDL) has already ruled out any quality deficiency in the food given to zoo animals.Swaran Singh Randhawa, in-charge, Animal Disease Research Centre, College of Veterinary Science, GADVASU, said toxemia is a condition of poisoning by toxins from bacterial infection.“It is difficult to ascertain the source of such infections,” said Randhwa, who was not associated with the autopsy of antelopes.Blackbuck is Punjab’s state animal and is covered under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.Autopsy report says a panel of GADVASU experts studied heart, lungs, spleen, liver and kidney.Experts have not found any symptoms of foot and mouth disease, which is common among cattle, or any factor other than toxemia.

In a press statement, the Aam Aami Party (AAP) MLA said the Congress leaders, particularly Sidhu, were acting as if they were in the opposition. Sidhu should now stop playing the “letter game” on the problems of the farmers and other issues and work to get them resolved from his government. “The state Congress chief remembered reforms in the agriculture sector such as getting the farmers out of the cropping cycle as the elections approached,” the AAP leader said. Cheema questioned if Sidhu could not come up with any concrete promise or policy from the ruling Congress in his meeting with the farmers’ leaders, then what did he do there. “If the AAP could decide to give support after listening to the views of farmers during the meeting, why couldn’t Sidhu do so?” he asked. Hitting out at chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, the AAP leader said he did not fulfill any of his promises to farmers who had to wage a struggle against the state government, like the Union government, on their demands related to sugarcane price and procurement of crops from mandis. “Sidhu gets publicity by writing a letter, but the issues of farmers remain unresolved,” Cheema said, asking the PPCC president to give up drama and play the role of leader of the ruling party. He also said that Amarinder had lost the trust of his MLAs and ministers and should immediately resign from his post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-s-letter-to-amarinder-on-farmers-issues-is-a-publicity-stunt-aam-aadmi-party-101631565032235.html

After laying the foundation stone of government college at Mukhliana village in Chabbewal constituency which is to come up at ₹13.44 crore, the CM said when the entire state stood like a rock in their favour, the farmers should not hold protests in Punjab as it went against the interests of the state. “The protests going on at 113 places in Punjab impacted its economic development. I hope my request would be accepted by the farmers. These laws have already been rejected in the assembly and replaced by the state government’s farm laws which were sent to the governor for his assent but unfortunately they were not forwarded to the President,” he said.He said these laws had already been rejected in the state assembly and replaced by the state government’s farm laws which were sent to Governor for his accent but unfortunately these had not yet been forwarded to the President of India.Amarinder said that a delegation of various farm leaders met him recently for hike in sugarcane price and it was promptly hiked from Rs. 325 to Rs. 360 per quintal. The Chief Minister also announced to name the upcoming college after the name of Dr. BR Ambedkar.

14-09-2021||Chandigarh||Gangsters’ solitary confinement: Prisons department to challenge HC’s ‘illegal’ move order||The Punjab prisons department has decided to challenge high court’s single-judge bench order that termed the confinement of notorious gangsters in newly created ‘dead zone’ at Bathinda Central Jail as illegal. A decision in this regard was taken in a meeting of department officials after holding discussion with the advocate general’s office last week. The prisons department’s move to lodge 42 gangsters, who were drawn from different jails, in the ‘dead zones’ had come after receiving suggestions from the Special Task Force (STF) to check their illegal activities. ‘Dead Zone’ is a new concept introduced by the jails department comprising special cells where there is no signal to operate mobile phones. The zone is guarded by a three-tier security, including the CRPF personnel. The prisons department has also decided to curtail movement of these inmates by increasing their confinement inside the cells to 22 hours as compared to the ordinary inmates who are freed from the cells for nine hours. This move was challenged by seven gangsters and their family members in the Punjab and Haryana high court citing it as ‘quasi-solitary’ confinement in violation of rights guaranteed under Article 21. The court has also suggested some observations on steps that can be taken to lodge these criminals. The gangsters who had challenged the decision include Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, Ramandeep Singh Rammi, Chandan alias Chandu, Kulpreet Singh alias Neeta Deol. The single-judge bench had termed depriving human company for extended hours as ‘quasi confinement’. “The judgment of the Supreme Court that made the basis for the single-judge bench order dates back to 1978. The world has changed and evolved thereafter and so has style of the criminals,” a senior prisons department functionary said. Officials are of the view that the idea behind restricting the freedom of the gangsters inside cells was to make them feel what it means to be inside jails as many of them were found running their rackets from inside jails. During the court hearings, the department even had given an affidavit in the court, citing instances of dangerous/notorious prisoners found operating their illegal activities from the high security zones of the jails already in place. Additional director general of police (ADGP), prisons, Praveen Kumar Sinha, said the department is filing the letter patents appeal (LPA) to challenge the single-bench decision, taking various grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gangsters-solitary-confinement-prisons-department-to-challenge-hc-s-illegal-move-order-101631564312244.html
14-09-2021||Chandigarh||Centre to cross-check farmers’ land records before paddy procurement||In a first, the Centre has decided to cross-check land records before the procurement of paddy from next month in a bid to ensure the MSP reaches farmers and not traders, food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said on Monday. Most procuring states, barring Assam and Uttarakhand as well as Jammu and Kashmir, are ready and have also integrated digital land records with the Centre’s nodal procurement agency Food Corporation of India (FCI) for this purpose, he told reporters. Asserting that this new mechanism is in the interest of farmers, Pandey said the crop cultivated by farmers whether in their own land or in rented land will be procured by the government. “It is not necessary for farmers to own the land or not. If farmers have cultivated any land, that will be procured,” he said. The whole idea is to cross-check how much crop has been cultivated in what area and accordingly procure it, he said, adding this is where digital land records integrated centrally with FCI will help during the procurement process. The main objective behind this mechanism is that the government procures the crop from genuine farmers and not from traders. According to the secretary, “most states, including Punjab are in complete readiness.” Every state wants farmers to benefit from the procurement process and not the traders. This mechanism will ensure the minimum support price (MSP) reaches farmers and not traders, he said. Many states like Uttar Pradesh and Odisha had already integrated their land records, while some states had not done and they are doing this year, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-to-cross-check-farmers-land-records-before-paddy-procurement-101631564252284.html

The plea has been filed by Sandeep Kumar and Randeep Suri, both ex-directors of Punjab Small Industry and Export Corporation (PSIEC), who were removed in July 2021. The 31-acre land (Plot Number 32 in Phase 8, Mohali) was liquidated from JCT Electronics, allotted to it in 1984. It was auctioned last year and the lone bidder got it for ₹90.56 crore. The plea alleges that the bidder firm is selling small plots on the land for ₹465 crore. Last month, Punjab Lokpal had summoned industries minister Sham Sunder Arora and PSIEC director for October in this controversy, taking cognisance of a complaint. However, the plea in high court does not make Arora a party in the case though alleges ‘interference by politicians’. The plea alleges involvement of top officials and political functionaries “who are trying to use their influence on petitioners, who are whistle blowers and are being harassed and humiliated and threats being extended”. They allege that they were removed as they had complained about the manner this land deal was being dealt with by the corporation. According to the plea, after liquidation proceedings, an e-auction notice was issued in January 21 for sale of 1,50,040 square yards land and building on 3,33,445 square feet at a reserve price of ₹90.5 crore. A firm became the lone bidder and got the plot for ₹90.56 crore allegedly due to political pressure and official liquidator got only ₹45 crore. The decision to approve the deal was taken on March 26, 2020, when the country was under lockdown and a curfew was imposed, claims the plea, adding that in October 2020 in the board meeting of PSIEC, demand for referring the matter to finance department and advocate general were not adhered to and file was put up before the government by giving it a colour of “warranting immediate attention”. In advocate general’s opinion, obtained by the government later, neither officers of Punjab Infotech and PSIEC nor the department of industries performed due diligence in arriving at a valuation, claims the plea, seeking a CBI probe. The matter will now be taken up on October 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jct-electronics-land-deal-high-court-notice-to-punjab-cbi-on-plea-seeking-probe-by-central-agency-101631563055712.html

A meeting with representatives of Punjab and Haryana governments will be held soon in this regard, he said. Harvesting of paddy, the main kharif crop, will begin from October onwards. The stubble burning in northern India has long been a major cause of air pollution even as the central government has spent ₹2,245.17 crore to address this issue in the last four years. Speaking to reporters, Agarwal said the states have also been asked to allow gram sabhas to open custom hiring centres so that small farmers can have access to machines and equipment used in the management of crop residue. In the 2021-22 financial year, the central government released ₹491 crore funds to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for tackling the stubble burning issue. Of that, ₹235 crore has been released to Punjab, ₹141 crore to Haryana and ₹115 crore to Uttar Pradesh, he said. In the last four years, a total of ₹1,050.68 crore has been released to Punjab, ₹640.9 crore to Haryana, ₹489.08 crore to Uttar Pradesh and ₹4.52 crore to Delhi for this purpose. The fund has been released as part of a central scheme on promotion of agri-mechanisation for the management of crop residue in these states. Consequently, about 21,125 custom hiring centres were opened in Punjab and 4,224 centres in Haryana, the secretary said. Besides, a mobile app was launched for the benefit of farmers to ascertain which custom hiring centre was having what kinds of machines and equipment, he said, and added many farmers are taking advantage of these centres. Besides giving subsidies for buying machines and setting up of custom hiring centres, the government is creating awareness among farmers on this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-releases-rs-491-crore-to-punjab-haryana-up-to-tackle-stubble-burning-101631562151966.html

14-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala residents protest over no dues certificate issue||Led by councillor Tony Chaudhary, Ambala residents staged a protest over the difficulty in obtaining no dues certificates for property registration, outside the municipal corporation office on Monday.The issue was also highlighted by several councillors at the MC House meeting last month, and mayor Shakti Rani Sharma heard around 250 such complaints during a Janata Darbar last week. A no dues certificate states that there are no outstanding dues on the property concerned, and protects the buyer while also enabling municipal authorities to maintain updated records.Chaudhary alleged that the MC is intentionally harassing locals in the name of these certificates by raising unnecessary objections. “There are several approved colonies in the MC area which are being shown as unapproved,” he alleged.The main bone of contention is Section 7A of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act. Citing its breach, the applications are being denied. “This is an undue objection as the colonies have been approved by the state government in 2014 and the department of town and country planning has no say in this. The breach is valid when a new colony is carved out,” said Chaudhary. Aman Handa, deputy municipal commissioner, denied that there was any issue concerning certificates. “People can apply for it online and the certificate will be issued in 10 working days,” he said. Commenting on the contentious section, he said: “There is no breach. When a colony is approved, all such acts are nullified. To rectify the problem, I’ve written to the higher authorities, which will soon issue a clarification to departments concerned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-residents-protest-over-no-dues-certificate-issue-101631560412061.html

14-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court acquits Maharashtra CMO accountant of forging travel bills after 25 years||Twenty five years after he was charged for cheating and forging of travel allowance bills in the names of his colleagues, a metropolitan magistrate court on Monday acquitted an accountant working in the chief minister’s office (CMO). The court, observed that the prosecution had “miserably failed” to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Several personal assistants (PA) and personal secretaries (PS) to the chief minister (CM) had deposed as witnesses, but did not support the prosecution case.The case was registered in 1996 by Sadashiv Bhatkhande, the then joint director in the funds and accounts department of CMO. The accused, Vinayak Damle, used to work as an accountant and prepare all the travel allowance (TA) bills of CM’s personal secretaries.It was alleged that TA bills of ₹62,540 and ₹32,498 of two particular personal secretaries were submitted and shown as received by them. However, both had claimed that they had not received the money and that somebody might have committed a fraud, after which a case was registered.It was alleged after the investigation that the accused had submitted fake travel programme and misappropriated an amount of ₹95,038. The Cuffe Parade police further learnt that the accused had also submitted separate false TA bills of ₹12,326, ₹23,363, ₹82,925, ₹7,480 and ₹24,705 in the name of some other CMO staffers and misappropriated a total amount of ₹3.45 lakh.Damle was charged in 2003 for cheating, forgery and criminal breach of trust. He had pleaded not guilty and requested that he be tried.The counsel for the accused argued that the very basic documentary proof the original documents have not been brought on record by the prosecution, in the absence of which Damle cannot be connected with the alleged crime. According to the counsel, “The prosecution has failed to prove the very fact that the accused was entrusted with the job of sanctioning TA bills. They have also not proved that it was the accused who had prepared false bills and withdrawn the money. The prosecution has not obtained the signature of the accused to verify with the handwriting expert. The prosecution witnesses – CMO staffers – did not support the prosecution.”The court had found that the chief examination of informant had taken place in 2007. In 2010, he had failed to come for cross-examination and later it was informed to the court that the informant had died. The accused had lost his opportunity to cross-examine the informant, that too for no fault of his, after which the court had refused to consider his evidence, as mere chief examination had taken place.Two personal secretaries of the then CM, whose TA bills were allegedly forged by the accused, also appeared before the court as witnesses. However, they did not support the prosecution. They further told the court that there were several clerks who had prepared TA bills, and whatever they had come to know about their bills also been forged, it was through the late informant. The investigating officer also admitted certain lacunas and prejudices in the entire probe. He admitted that the informant had not given him important documents at the time of lodging a first information report (FIR). He also admitted that he had not taken the specimen signature of the accused to match it with the forged bills.Metropolitan magistrate A V Kulkarni of the Esplanade Court observed that there are several lacunas in the entire investigation, which is based upon “hearsay evidence”. The investigation officer even went to the extent of admitting the fact that whatever is his conclusion about the alleged fraud in the instances of the accused is only based upon the information extended by the informant, the magistrate observed.The court further said that another investigating officer had accepted all the probe was carried as per the information given by the informant. He also accepted that every PAs and PSs of CM prepared their TA bills through their assistants.Judge Kulkarni observed in a detailed judgment that none of the witness possessed direct knowledge of the crime. Merely because the alleged misappropriation took place during the span of the service of the accused, it cannot be concluded automatically that the accused was responsible for the alleged preparation of forged bills and misappropriation, the judge observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-acquits-maharashtra-cmo-accountant-of-forging-travel-bills-after-25-years-101631560295025.html

The digitisation process was initiated a few years ago at the varsity, but was not completed due to some issues.Now, the varsity has again started the process to review the matter. “It was found that there already exists a committee in this regard. Now, it has been decided that the members of the new committee will work with the previous panel,” said a committee member.During the meeting on Monday, it was also decided that past records related to the digitisation project should be sought first to deliberate on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/seniority-list-pu-panel-for-reviewing-draft-prepared-by-varsity-101631560112222.html

14-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: New UT home secretary joins office||Building up specialisation in police force to improve both law and order function and investigation capacities will be the top priority for new Chandigarh home secretary Nitin Kumar Yadav, who joined office on Monday. A 2000-batch Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer of the Haryana cadre, Yadav replaced Arun Kumar Gupta, who was relieved on August 31 after completion of his inter-cadre deputation. “Recruitment has to be pushed through. If we don’t have requisite number of people to man the forces, the efficiency will get affected. The division of work between law and order and investigation would require specialisation and adequate manpower,” said Yadav. Yadav on his first day in office also directed the director, prosecution, to make a robust mechanism for monitoring all the cases and quality of investigation being done. While announcing training workshops for police officials, he said, “The culprits should not go scot free because of faulty investigation. Our approach is quite clear, but it has to be streamlined and expedited.” On the traffic problems in the city, Yadav said, “Resolution of traffic issues through involvement of both police and transport departments will be undertaken comprehensively.”Involving the citizens also will be done on priority basis, he said, adding, “Our effort will be to make the administration citizen-centric. We will expedite the projects already in the pipeline. New projects will be brought up here keeping in mind the heritage and character of the city.” The three-year deputation period of Gupta, a Haryana cadre IAS officer of the 1992 batch, had ended in May, but due to surge in Covid cases, the UT administration had sought extension in his service for three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-new-ut-home-secretary-joins-office-101631559813109.html
14-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Decks cleared for walk-in aviary near Sukhna Lake||The decks have been cleared for setting up a walk-in aviary near Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh. “The ministry has given the go ahead for the project, as it doesn’t violate any prescribed rules for such a facility,” said UT adviser Dharam Pal. Earlier, the construction was suspended by the UT forest department on directions of the assistant inspector general (AIG) of forests, Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. The issue involved whether the aviary is a zoo or not. “The ministry on Monday concluded that the aviary does not come under the purview of a zoo. They accepted our contention that it is not a zoo and it does not have any scheduled species,” said Pal. The ministry’s decision came after the appraisal committee of the central zoo authority under the ministry of environment inspected the site and interacted with UT forest department officials. Earlier, the AIG had intervened after a city-based RTI activist objected to the aviary, claiming it be like a cage for the birds. Animal rights activist and politician Maneka Gandhi had also raised objection to the project.The aviary is coming up at City Forest near Sukhna Lake and will house over 40 rare species of exotic birds. It will have separate enclosures for aquatic and terrestrial birds.  “Apart from free flight, the best possible natural habitat will be provided to the birds for nesting and breeding. It will become a major tourist attraction in the city,” said a forest official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-decks-cleared-for-walk-in-aviary-near-sukhna-lake-101631559631654.html

The snake, coiled around a 20-foot pole on a football field, was spotted by the staff of the Maharishi University of Information Technology, officials said. Animal rescue and rehabilitation organisation Wildlife SOS rescued the snake and released it back into its natural habitat. “We received a call from the university about the snake at our helpline 9871963535,” said a statement from Wildlife SOS. According to authorities at Wildlife SOS, a two-member rescue team from the NGO’s rapid response unit was immediately dispatched to the spot. The team proceeded with caution to ensure the reptile did not suffer a potentially lethal fall from the pole, they said.“After two gruelling hours, the snake was safely extricated from the pole and transferred into a transportation carrier. Post a medical examination at the NGO’s transit facility, we released the snake back into its natural habitat,” the statement said.According to the forest department, the city houses several micro habitats to support snakes. “During the monsoon, snakes are spotted more frequently because their habitats are often affected due to rain. There are many snakes in the city area due to several habitats that support them. We urge people not to engage with the snakes if they spot any,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastav, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.“Cobra rescue calls, in general, need to be handled wit the utmost caution since cobras are venomous snakes. In this case, we had to be doubly cautious because the snake could have been severely injured if it fell from such a height. Our team is meticulously trained to carry out such precarious rescue operations keeping in mind the safety of the animal as well as the public,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/5footlong-cobra-rescued-from-noida-varsity-in-uttar-pradesh-101631558852843.html

On September 8, a Jalandhar court had dismissed his plea for the same. Maan was booked under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code at Nakodar city police station in Jalandhar on August 26. During a religious fair in Nakodar on August 24, Maan had described Ladi Shah of Dera Baba Murad Shah as a descendant of the third Sikh master, Guru Amar Das. When a social media campaign started against his statement, Maan uploaded a video on social media, offering an apology for his statement. However, an FIR was registered against him. He has argued that no offence under Section 295A of the IPC can be made out against him. It has to be demonstrated that an act has been committed with deliberate and malicious intention, in order to outrage the religious feelings of any class of citizens and such act insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class. “In the present case, the FIR prima facie fails to disclose that the essential ingredients of offence, were made out,” his plea states. The plea adds that the trial court judge apparently got ‘influenced by the show of public outcry, generated by some sections through a sustained campaign’. “As a humble Sikh and a sensitive citizen, the petitioner made a widely circulated public apology, as detailed hereinabove. His words ought to be interpreted in the total background of his lifelong devotion to the venerable Sikh Gurus and to the principles of Sikhism,” the plea, which will be taken up later this week, states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurdas-maan-moves-hc-seeking-anticipatory-bail-101631558851710.html

14-09-2021||Mumbai||NGO in Mumbai objects to use of herbicides in Powai lake||A Mumbai-based environment group on Monday wrote to authorities, strongly objecting to the use of herbicides to clear the growth of water hyacinths in Powai lake. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had in August floated a tender for removal of water hyacinths at Ganesh Ghat, Pawarwadi and other areas to make space for immersion activities during Ganesh Chaturthi. “Our preliminary enquiries with locals have revealed that as part of the preparations for immersion of Ganpati idols, the lake boundaries are being cleared to facilitate easy and safe immersion of the idols. BMC is undertaking this exercise. This may be needed considering the safety aspect of the devotees as the lake is a crocodile habitat. However, the point of serious concern here is that instead of manual removal of the water hyacinth, a herbicide has been sprayed on the vegetation,” wrote Stalin D, director of non-governmental organisation Vanashakti, in Monday’s letter. Herbicides typically contain a chemical known as glyphosate, which can pose adverse toxicological effects on flora and fauna, especially in aquatic ecosystems. Depending on the extent of use, it may lead to an increase in the water body’s phosphorus content, which in turn will lead to the proliferation of algae and exacerbate eutrophication. This can reduce the ability of zooplankton to reproduce in turn for other biodiversity to thrive. “This kind of a dangerous chemical should never have been used in a wildlife habitat of a Schedule I protected species (Indian marsh crocodile) under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972). We urge you to immediately direct the stoppage of this practice and take action against those responsible,” wrote Stalin in his letter, addressed to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, BMC and the forest department. Satellite images and ground observations by environmentalists and citizens reveal that the issue of water hyacinths in Powai lake is worsening rapidly, with a large part of the water spread now having been subsumed under the growth of this invasive weed, which thrives in polluted environments – in this case, due to the dumping of raw sewage into Powai lake. Several citizens have previously drawn attention to this development, and called for a comprehensive plan to address the cause of these hyacinths, which are a clear indicator of environmental degradation. However, it has also been cautioned that simply removing these weeds is not enough to restore the health of the lake. “The water hyacinths no doubt reduce the levels of the lake and reduce its boundaries, but at the same time they also remove organic pollutants and heavy metals in the lake. If the hyacinths are removed without tackling the issue of pollution due to discharge of sewage, the move will be counterproductive,” Stalin explained, while also advocating for the area to be handed over to the forest department for safekeeping. “It is most important that the entire area becomes a conservation zone under the custody of the forest department. A joint forestry model may be activated with the help of the forest department, BMC and other stake holders like the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, which abuts a large part of the lake, to conserve the area,” he said. Forest department and MPCB officials as well as Ajay Rathore, chief engineer of BMC’s hydraulic department, did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment on Vanashakti’s letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ngo-in-mumbai-objects-to-use-of-herbicides-in-powai-lake-101631558731637.html

14-09-2021||Mumbai||More trouble for Maharashtra government as ZP bypolls in October||Adding more trouble for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, the State Election Commission (SEC) has announced bypolls for six zilla parishads (district councils) — Palghar, Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim, and Nagpur — and 33 other panchayat samitis on the seats vacated following the Supreme Court (SC) order against the political reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) community. The polls will be held on October 5 and the counting will be held the next day.With the decision, SEC has also paved the way for ‘mini-Assembly elections’ to be held early next year. More than 15 municipal corporations (including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane), 29 of 36 district councils and over 90 municipal councils will go for polls over the next one year. The election to local bodies in such a huge number is considered as the ‘mini assembly polls’.All the political parties in the state have already opposed bypolls until the political reservation of the OBC community is reinstated. Holding elections without reservation for OBCs may create unrest in the community, which might be politically damaging for MVA government.SEC’s announcement comes following SC’s decision on Saturday, in which it had directed the poll body to take a call on the local body elections at its level and added that the state government has no authority to decide when to hold local body elections. Earlier, it had also stated that the absence of the political quota to OBCs in local body elections cannot be the grounds for the postponement of the polls.“Earlier, the bypolls [on the vacated seats] were declared on July 19, but following SC’s decision on July 6 and the state government’s request, it was decided to postpone them. However, on September 9, the Apex court clearly stated the state government’s notification (issued on August 9) imposing curbs owing to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic cannot be applied to the bypolls and ordered us to take the decision on the polls at the earliest,” said UPS Madan, state election commissioner, in a statement released on Monday.While scrapping OBC reservation in local bodies, the Apex court in March had asked the state government to collect empirical data of the community to decide quota. Thus, the community will not get reservation until empirical data is collected.“The bypolls have been declared following SC’s decision. We will discuss it with the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) and will also call an all-party meeting. As it’s SC’s decision, I won’t be able to comment more on it. A potential third wave is likely to hit the state. We, however, still have 15-20 days to hold deliberations and see what can be done. If not, the bypolls will be held as per schedule. All parties have already agreed to field only OBC candidates for the bypolls,” said relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar.“We have formed the backward classes’ commission to collect empirical data. If the Centre would have given the caste-based data, we may not have been in this situation. We have also filed a petition in the Apex court, seeking the caste-based census data from them. The state government will promulgate an ordinance to bring amendment in the legislation to provide reservation to the OBC community, if required,” he said in response to the mini-Assembly polls to be held early next year.In an all-party meeting held on September 3, it was decided that the state government will direct the Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes (MSCBC) to try and collect the empirical data necessary to restore reservation for the OBC community in the next few months. MVA government is also planning to bring an amendment in the legislation to provide reservation to the OBC within the 50% reservation cap mandated by the Apex court. It has filed a writ petition in SC, seeking Socio-Economic Caste Census, 2011, data from the Centre. The next hearing is going to be held on September 23.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has alleged that the Thackeray government did not take the issue seriously. “The MVA government had three months but the issue was not taken seriously which led to this situation. SC has clearly said that the state has to collect empirical data, and caste-based census data has no role to play in it. However, BJP has already decided that if bypolls become imminent, then all the candidates on those seats will be from OBC community only,” said party spokesperson Keshav Upadhye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/more-trouble-for-maharashtra-government-as-zp-bypolls-in-october-101631558612842.html

Thackeray, in slew of directives to the police force, has called for keeping records of people coming from other states, revision in style of working of fast-track courts for speedy implementation of punishment and registering every complaint raised by women.The CM chaired the meeting of the key police officers from the force, including police commissioners of all cities and district heads. It was attended by home minister Dilip Walse Patil, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and additional chief secretary Manu Kumar Srivastava, among others. Thackeray also batted for night shelters for homeless women living on pavements and at railway or bus stations with the help of Central government. He said the state government will raise the need of redesigning the working style of the judicial system to ensure speedy enforcement of conviction orders given by fast-track courts, during a meeting with NITI Aayog officials on Tuesday.The government has also announced that the Shakti Act, modelled on Andhra Pradesh’s Disha Act, for stricter punishment for crimes against women and children, will be reintroduced in the legislature in the forthcoming winter session. The bill, introduced in the legislature in December 2020, has been sent to the joint select committee for further deliberation. Home minister Walse Patil said the report of the committee will be tabled. “We will also deploy senior police officers for follow-up of cases pending in the fast-track court for speedy disposal. Police force should be more vigilant and alert to keep up its formidable reputation,” he said. The minister has also directed the police to register each and every case of women visiting police stations and giving priority to the investigation in these cases. He has also directed the police to file charge sheets at the earliest in the heinous crimes against women and monitor them rigorously for early disposal. Without naming anybody, the CM said everyone should be careful while giving reactions in such cases and introspect about outcome of such reactions. Earlier in the day, the CM met vice-chairman of National Commission for Scheduled Castes, Arun Haldar, and apprised him of the steps taken by the state government after the incident. The CM told the VC of the commission that the state has taken up the responsibility of the education and upbringing of the children of the victim. He said that the family if the victim will be compensated from Manodhairya and atrocities compensation scheme. “After Thackeray directed to appoint a special public prosecutor, leading counsel Raja Thackeray has been appointed to represent the victim,” the statement reads.Mumbai police officers said that 7,000 more CCTVs are being added to the existing network of 5,000 cameras in the city. A delegation of women of Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of party’s Mumbai chief Mangalprabhat Lodha met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Monday morning and demanded quick steps to reduce the cases of crime against women. The delegation in its memorandum has stated that the crime cases against women are on the rise and it has resulted in the uncertainty among women.

Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Monday hit out at the BJP saying the Mumbai case was not Hathras where the Uttar Pradesh government did not accept that it was a rape. The Marathi daily also said that Mumbai is the “safest city” in the world for women. Amid outrage against the brutal crime that bore similarity to the 2012 Delhi gang rape case, the Sena mouthpiece said that Mumbai is the safest city. “The rape and murder of the woman in Sakinaka has shocked one and all. But, Mumbai is the safest city in the world for women and there should be no doubt about it in anyone’s mind,” the editorial said.BJP leaders, following the incident on Friday, slammed the Uddhav Thackeray-led government saying it is not focusing on law and order and on women safety. The mouthpiece also defended Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, who had said that police cannot be at all the crime scenes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-sakinaka-rape-and-murder-thackeray-holds-urgent-meet-sena-says-mumbai-is-safest-101631558311594.html

According to Shivaji Nagar police, six members of the Valecha family from Ulhasnagar had set out to immerse their Ganpati idol in two rickshaws when the mishap occurred around 7.30pm near an open plot belonging to MIDC in Ambernath. “The Valechas, acting on the advice of Kisan Shinde, 24, one of the two rickshaw drivers, were going to immerse their idol in a pond in Kakole village, instead of doing so in one of the civic corporation’s designated spots. They were on their way to Kakole when the SUV, which was being driven by Ninad Yadav, 26, collided with one of the rickshaws head on, after which both the vehicles careened into the second auto rickshaw behind the first one,” senior inspector Madhukar Bhoge said. Locals informed police about the accident. All the occupants of the vehicles were rushed to a nearby hospital. The police said Shinde and his three passengers were declared dead before admission. The other victims are Varsha Valecha, 52; her sister-in-law Aarti, 42; and their nephew Raj, 12. Yadav and his two friends and Aarti’s daughter sustained injuries. “Yadav has been placed under arrest,” said Bhoge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-of-family-driver-killed-in-accident-on-way-to-immersions-in-ambernath-101631558194696.html

Apples account for around 90% of the state’s horticultural production, and fruit growers are vexed over the low prices and exploitation by commission agents. They are also blaming corporate-run cold stores for fixing low rates for premium apples that sets the benchmark in the market. In Shimla, the manch staged a protest march to the Deputy Commissioner’s office. Accusing the government of exploiting farmers and benefiting corporations, the farmer leaders also criticised the statements by urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj and horticulture minister Mahender Singh Thakur. Legislators Mohan Lal Brakta and Rakesh Singha also participated in the protests in Rohru and Theogh, respectively. Himachal Kisan Manch convener Harish Chauhan sought the government’s intervention to raise the minimum support price (MSP), stating that the ₹6,000-crore economy was in crisis.The protesters demanded that along with the APMC Act, the government also implement the Market Intervention Scheme on the lines of Kashmir for apples of different grades. The fruit cultivators also sought abolition of various charges being deducted from payments by the commission agents. They submitted a charter of demands through the respective SDMs and tehsildars at the sub-division level. Among their other demands are compensation for the loss caused due to natural calamities and water vagaries, payments according to weight of produce, and restoration of subsidies on fertilisers, seeds, insecticides, fungicides and other cost items.

In the 2022 polls, the eyes of the entire world, not just the country, would be on UP and that’s why the media unit would have to be well prepared,” Yogi Adityanath said. Adityanath took a veiled dig at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and referred to its allegations regarding bungling in the purchase of corona kits. “A Delhi party spread misinformation in UP about the purchases we made, but when we gathered information about the purchases made by the party in Delhi, we found that purchases thrice the price of UP were made there. FIRs were registered in Delhi to expose the culprits,” Yogi Adityanath said. The media workshop assumes significance ahead of the 2022 UP assembly elections. Well-known party spokespersons Sambit Patra and Zafar Islam arrived in Lucknow to impart tips to the party’s media unit in UP. Mentioning how to market the achievements of the government, Yogi Adityanath said, “Work is in progress to start rapid rail between Meerut and Delhi. Once complete, it would reduce the travel time between the two points from 3 hours to just 45 minutes. There would hardly be any assembly constituency in Uttar Pradesh (UP) where works between ₹ 500 crore and ₹1000 crore weren’t sanctioned. We will have to take these works to the masses.”Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal said the party would have to formulate a proper strategy ahead of the assembly elections to counter misinformation. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya referred to the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three new farm reform laws. “This is not a farmers’ agitation. It is a poll agitation which is being backed by anti-farmer forces aimed at diverting public attention from the government’s achievements,” Maurya said.National spokespersons Sambit Patra and Zafar Islam stressed on the need for homework before speaking to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-says-eyes-of-the-entire-world-will-be-on-uttar-pradesh-assembly-election-101631558131566.html

Suresh Kumar Singh, a resident of the society, was allegedly assaulted by nearly a dozen security guards following an argument over a maintenance issue. The entire episode was caught on CCTV and mobile phone cameras and the videos were circulated online.Following this, a case was registered against five named and 15 unnamed persons under sections 147 (rioting), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at Sector 39 police station. Singh also named the apartment owners’ association office bearers in his complaint.Also Read | 30 CCTV batteries stolen from Eastern Peripheral Expressway in UP’s GB NagarOn September 9, the police arrested eight security guards while one more was arrested the next day. All the suspects are currently in judicial custody after their bail application was denied, police said.However, the security agency, CISS Bureau, has called for further investigation in the matter as they maintain that it was Singh who first initiated the altercation.“We waited for over two hours today [Monday] at the local police station with our grievance, which the cops have not taken into consideration,” said Sandeep Kumar, regional manager of the security agency.He said the agency filed a complaint with the Sector 39 police station asking for a probe against Singh and his cohorts, and to also take into consideration the statements of the guards who were present at the spot. The society has terminated its contract with the agency and is looking for a replacement while the Noida police have recommended the agency’s licence be revoked.Police officials said that they will look into the allegations made by the agency. “We have received a complaint and will investigate the claims. Any charges will be combined with the initial FIR and due action will be taken against any offender,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1.Meanwhile, the resident has denied any knowledge of a complaint against him. “I am receiving calls from people with vested interests pressurising me to take back the charges. I have not even received my medical reports, let alone any information about the developments in the case.

14-09-2021||Mumbai||Draft of Mumbai Climate Action Plan to be showcased at COP26 in Glasgow in November||A draft version of the Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP), to be completed next month by the World Resources Institute (India), will be showcased at the upcoming 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow in November. The final plan, a spokesperson of WRI said during an online webinar held Monday, will be completed by the end of the year.The online webinar, which happened to be organised by WRI (India) under the banner of ‘Connect Karo’ also marked the first public address on MCAP by state environment and climate change minister Aaditya Thackeray after the recent public consultations hosted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which ended on September 9. During the webinar, Thackeray delivered a keynote address under the title ‘Towards a Climate Resilient Mumbai’.“We speak about the future being clean, green and electric, but there is no future unless we act on developing climate mitigation and adaption plans today. With MCAP, we are looking at an ambitious plan to restructure the city on the basis of ‘ease of living’. At a national level, there is a lot of talk about ease of doing business, where laws that are now redundant are being done away with, but in Maharashtra we are giving equal emphasis to ease of living also,” Thackeray said.He also highlighted his government’s efforts to protect the Aarey forest and about 9,800 hectares of mangroves, which have been given the status of reserve forest since the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government came to power. “I don’t think any other state government would have the audacity to declare 800 acres a forest in the middle of an extremely urbanised city,” he said.In addition, he also said that the proposed State Council for Climate Change, which was sanctioned by the Maharashtra cabinet earlier this month, will have weekly meetings to set and review climate action targets in the state. “The real challenge is in redefining urbanisation by reimagining what constitutes development. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray believes that development is essential, but we cannot do it at the cost of our forests. That would be counterproductive,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/draft-of-mumbai-climate-action-plan-to-be-showcased-at-cop26-in-glasgow-in-november-101631558013714.html

He said some locals, who were returning from ‘prikrama’ of Mount Manimahesh Kailash, spotted them lying in a glacier near Kamal Kund, the glacial lake at the foot of Mount Kailash. Initially, we had information of four people stuck near Kamal Kund. However, only two bodies were found and a search operation is on. “They should have taken the trek from Kugti village,” he said, adding that emergency teams are bringing the bodies to Bharmour. Three fatalities have been reported in the Kamal Kund area in two days. One body was found in the same area on Sunday. The deceased, has been identified as Aman, resident of Mai-Ka-Bag in Chamba.

However, people take unmanned trek from Kugti village across Jotnu pass. It is not possible to set up check post on that side due to high altitude,” he added.People who want to undertake a ‘parikrama’ use the trek.Manimahesh Yatra is considered one of the toughest pilgrimages as devotees have to ascend 14km through an arduous trek.Before Covid-19, more than three lakh people would undertake the yatra to the Manimahesh Lake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-trekkers-found-dead-near-manimahesh-lake-in-chamba-101631557891646.html

The TPR over the last few weeks has gone below one and the number of recoveries has gone up to over a million. The recovery percentage of Odisha has risen to 98.5, higher than the national average of 97.45.In June this year, Odisha had announced a new scheme called Ashirbad for the education, health and maintenance of children orphaned due to the pandemic. Under the scheme, they would have ₹2500 deposited into the bank account of their family members every month till they turn 18.As many as 1,773 children lost their parents in Odisha to Covid-19 infections since 1 April 2020, according to a report compiled by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). While 163 kids lost both their parents, 1,610 children lost one of their parents since the outbreak of pandemic in Odisha on 1 April 2000, the NCPCR report said.The commission, in an affidavit filed before the SC last month, said at least 101,032 children in the country lost one or both their parents during the first and the second waves of the Covid-19 pandemic between April 1, 2020, and August 23 this year.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik who announced the scheme had said children who lost their parents or the main earning person of the family on April 1, 2020, or thereafter to Covid-19 will be covered under it. The orphans can be children who have lost both their parents or either one of them. The amount of ₹2500 per month will be deposited in the bank accounts of family members who have taken the responsibility for the orphans. The assistance will continue till the child attains the age of 18 years or till such date if somebody adopts him/her.However, if the orphan stays in a child care institution, a recurring deposit of ₹1000 per month will be made in his or her surviving parent’s account till 18 years of age. If the child has lost either of his parents who was the only earning member, ₹1500 per month will be provided for maintenance. If the surviving parent is the mother, she will also be entitled to a pension under the Madhu Babu Pension scheme of ₹300 a month.These orphans will get treatment under the state government’s Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana, a state government scheme under which medicines, diagnostics, dialysis, chemotherapy, operation, ICU and in-patient admission is all free in government hospitals. Besides, they will be also included as beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).The children can also continue in the schools in which they were studying before the death of their parents. However, in case the family member taking responsibility for the child stays somewhere else, an arrangement of schooling will be made in that place. If necessary, the government will help in the admission of the children in Adarsh Vidyalaya or Kendriya Vidyalaya.The Ashirbad scheme mirrored several provisions of the PM Cares For Children scheme announced by the Centre in May this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-govt-discontinues-scheme-for-covid-19-orphans-cites-dip-in-virus-cases-101631557834170.html

Announced on Monday by the office of the deputy director of education (DYDE), NM College in Vile Parle, HR College in Churchgate and RA Podar College in Matunga — all popular colleges for commerce — had no seats left for the third list.“All our seats were allotted in the first two merit lists and very few withdrawals happened. So no seat was left for the third list. We plan to start the orientation for our new FYJC batch this week, and classes will follow too,” said Parag Ajgaonkar, principal of the institute.As per information shared by DYDE office, 39,964 seats were allotted to eligible students in the third round. “Of the 39,964 students allotted seats in the third merit list, 6,916 students have been allotted colleges of their first preference, 7,364 have got seats in the second-preference college and 5,969 students have been placed in colleges of their third preference,” an official statement released by the office of DYDE, Mumbai region, on Monday read. The statement also highlighted that in the third round, 3,152 students were allotted seats in arts stream, 25,539 in the commerce stream and 11,058 in the science stream. Most colleges ended up with higher cut-offs in their third merit list as compared to the second list. “Students get to refill their college preferences after every round. So many with higher marks end up seeking admissions in the following rounds, thereby resulting in higher cut-offs as compared to the previous round,” said Vidyadhar Joshi vice-principal of VG Vaze College, Mulund. While no seats were left for allotment in commerce and science streams in the college, the arts cut-off went up by 2 marks. Similarly, at St Xavier’s College, the arts cut-off went up by over a percentage point, while the science cut-off dipped by less than a percentage point. In Mithibai College, Vile Parle, cut-offs for all the three streams reduced by less than one percentage point.A total of 117,883 FYJC aspirants were allotted seats in the first merit list on August 27. However, nearly 50% students of these aspirants had not confirmed admissions. Similarly, 60,037 students were allocated seats in the second merit list, of which only 21,116 (35.17%) of those confirmed admissions. There are 119,000 seats available in junior colleges.“Not confirming admissions during common admissions is a worry because most colleges will now receive a barrage of individual applications from students aiming for vacant seats as per their preference. We will know the situation in the next couple of days,” said the principal of suburban college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-seats-left-in-some-popular-mumbai-colleges-in-3rd-fyjc-merit-list-101631557831815.html
14-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports 2,740 new Covid cases, 27 deaths on Monday||Maharashtra on Monday added 2,740 new Covid-19 cases — its lowest single-day cases in 219 days or over seven months. The state also reported 27 deaths in the past 24 hours which is its lowest in 190 days. While the dip in cases is being attributed to a lower number of testing on account of weekend, the state is seeing an overall downward trend. To be sure, the lowest one-day state figure comes on the back the lowest one-day testing figure since March 22. On that day, Maharashtra reported 105,830 tests, with 24,645 new cases at a positivity rate of 23.29%. Monday’s positivity rate was 2.54%.However, a month after suburban train services in Mumbai were opened up for fully vaccinated population, Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has seen an increase. State health department officials are concerned about the rise but added that a pattern would emerge by early October.Mumbai logged 345 cases on Monday and six fatalities, taking tally to 735,400 and toll to 16,028. The city and its surrounding areas in MMR logged over 22% of the state’s total cases on Monday.The state’s active case count dropped to 49,880, while overall positivity rate stood at 11.59%. In the past 24 hours, Maharashtra tested 108,216 samples for Covid, showing a positivity rate of 2.54%. The overall case tally in the state went up to 6,500,617, and death toll rose to 138,169.The state government reopened train services for people who have taken both their vaccine doses, from Independence Day, completing 30 days on Monday. In the past few days, Mumbai has been clocking between 350 and 400 new Covid cases daily. However, it had reported 500 new cases last week, after a gap of seven weeks.Between August 15 and September 8, Mumbai added 8,274 fresh cases to its tally. However, the health department “omitted” over 15,000 cases from the overall tally due to duplication, of which 5,435 were from Mumbai, the data showed. Since September 8, Mumbai has added 1,504 new cases to its tally. Thane district, which has a vast rural area and five densely populated municipal corporation areas, has added 7,096 new Covid cases between August 15 and September 13. Panvel city has added 1,740 new cases, while Vasai-Virar added around 912 infections during the same period.Thane district has seen a rise in cases. Between July 15 and August 15, the district added 5,861 cases. In the past 30 days, it added 7,096 cases, which is a 21.07% rise.State health department officials said they were monitoring the situation closely in conjunction with the civic bodies in Mumbai and MMR. They said that a pattern can only be ascertained by October first week.“While cases across the state are seeing some gradual dip, cases in Mumbai are stagnant and has also seen occasional spike. The cases were expected to rise a bit given the curbs were relaxed by the state in mid-August. However, it is not a trend. We will know if the curve is taking an upward trajectory by October first week,” a state health department official said.Relaxation in restrictions clubbed with festivals such as Dahi Handi and Ganesh Chaturthi have raised the concerns of local authorities. Officials said that by October 5, which is 14 days or one incubation cycle after Ganpati festival ends, they would know the impact of the increased movement of people. During the two festivals, the cities in MMR saw crowding and poor masking.Meanwhile, a chunk of the state’s tally on Monday came from Pune, Solapur and Satara districts. Collectively, it contributed 35.29% of the total cases on Monday. Pune rural areas added 318 new Covid cases, while Pune city added 130 new cases and Pimpri-Chinchwad 108 fresh infections. Solapur city added six new cases, while the rural areas of the district saw 228 cases. Satara saw 177 new cases in the past 24 hours.

14-09-2021||Delhi||North MCD to conduct fresh survey in Sabzi Mandi to identify dangerous buildings||North Delhi Municipal Corporation officials said on Monday that they will launch a fresh survey over the next 48 hours to assess the structural integrity of buildings in the Sabzi Mandi area after a four-storey building collapsed, opposite Robin Cinema, killing two children.Relief and rescue operations continued till Monday evening at the accident site, with fire department and police officials saying that at least three people were feared trapped under the debris.North corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel has ordered an inquiry in the matter. “The buildings department (HQs) has been asked to conduct an inquiry in the matter and submit a report within a week. Further, necessary action against errant officials will be taken after receipt of the report,” said a statement issued by the civic body.Goel has also asked all zonal authorities to depute engineers for re-assessment of the condition of buildings that were already declared dangerous, and to take immediate action as per relevant provisions of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. “The civic body will also recommend to the government for offering incentives to house owners for retro-fitting of such dangerous buildings and for rehabilitation of occupants of the building till retrofitting work is completed,” he said.North corporation officials said the front portion of the building located on the main road, Old Sabzi Mandi area, collapsed around 11am. They said the building was at least 50 years. They said it was not found dangerous in the pre-monsoon survey carried out by the civic body May-June this year. They added that nine other buildings on the same stretch were marked as dangerous.Overall, during the survey, the north civic body marked 699 properties as dangerous and identified 444 others that needed repairs, said officials. “There are no reports of any unauthorised construction being carried out in the building, and it possibly collapsed because of the old structure. It was not marked as dangerous in the survey conducted earlier this year because it did not have any signs of its structure being weak,” said senior corporation official who asked not to be named. “However, since heavy rains pose a threat to other old structures, it has been decided to carry out to survey of all buildings marked dangerous, again.Those found at imminent risk will be vacated immediately,” the official said.He said notices under section 348 of the DMC Act, 1957, were issued to all buildings identified as dangerous, and residents were asked to vacate the vulnerable portions. Monsoon this year broke a 46-year-old record in Delhi. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city has received 1136.8mm rain so far, making it the wettest monsoon after 1975 when the season recorded 1155.6 mm rainfall.Local councillor Guddi Devi said the incident took place on a day when the market is closed, otherwise the toll could be higher. “The area has many old structures, some even date back to 1947. The survey is conducted every year, but most times after notices are issued, people either do not take it seriously, or do not cooperate with the civic officials. We will carry out an awareness drive in the area over the next few days,” she said.Experts say identifying dangerous structures requires a technical and scientific survey, and it should be done by an agency dedicated for the job. They also said that people should be made aware about the importance of structural safety of their “These buildings are on nobody’s radar. Factories and small businesses keep mushrooming in these spaces without any checks or structural audits. With building contractors operating with impunity, and house owners not being aware of the requirement of structural safety, many of those living in these structures are at risk. These constructions and private contractors need to be regulated,” said Chetan Vaidya, former director, School of Planning and Architecture.Aditya Sharma, a structural safety consultant for the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) pointed out that the building bye-laws in Delhi, and in most parts of the country, do not have structural drawings of a building as a pre-requisite for sanctioning of building plans. “This lacuna in the bye-laws needs to be fixed. House owners just get the architectural design sanctioned and do not bother about structural stability, as its not a pre-requisite in the bye-laws,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-mcd-to-conduct-fresh-survey-in-sabzi-mandi-to-identify-dangerous-buildings-101631556331970.html

We need to generate a similar density of economic activities from our cities to answer the call by our Prime Minister of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy in the short term and USD 10 trillion economy by 2030,” said Puri, who is also the minister for petroleum and natural gas.For this, there is a need to address urban challenges related to climate, urban planning, housing and transportation, the minister said.“These issues become even more important due to the coronavirus pandemic, as cities faced a huge challenge in containing the spread of the contagious infection due to high population density residing in informal settlements such as slum clusters,” the Union minister said.The minister said the government will launch the Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0, with an outlay of ₹1.41 lakh crore to focus on sludge management, waste water treatment, source segregation of garbage, and reduction in single-use plastics and controlling air pollution by managing construction and demolition waste, and bio-remediation at dump sites.The conference will see over 150 experts discuss rapid urbanisation, its challenges and need for planned development to address issues of climate change. Hindustan Times is the media partner for the conference.Roopa Kudva, managing director, Omidyar Network India (a philanthropic investment firm), said the pandemic has shown that public health, housing, water, etc are all connected issues and there is a need for an integrated planning approach. She said the urban poor were the most impacted by the pandemic.“The virus spreads much faster in crowded slums where they had low access to water and sanitation. We need to plan for cities in an integrated manner…Getting urbanisation right would go a long way in mitigating risks from climate change. Compact, connected and coordinated cities that design public spaces and transportation around pedestrians are more inclusive, productive and resilient,” said Kudva.The housing and urban affairs minister said the central government is taking steps to address the issue such as housing and transportation through its various initiatives.Quoting estimates which state that urban Indian population is bound to rise up to 630 million by 2030, Puri also pointed out that in the past seven-and-a-half years, the government invested over ₹11 lakh crore in urban development. He also pointed out the government’s promptness in identifying issues and addressing them.The minister said the government started a new initiative to meet the housing needs, as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) reached a point of maturity. “We discovered that there are people who come looking for work to the urban centres… and we immediately moved for a new scheme which is to provide affordable rental housing. I’m delighted to say that this scheme, which started recently, has begun to take off,” said Puri.The minister also stressed on the need to provide cost effective and efficient transportation service, especially the mass transit systems such as Metro, in cities.Speaking about the five-day event that will see over 150 speakers share their views on electric mobility, urban planning, air quality, child-friendly cities, safer streets etc, OP Agarwal, CEO, WRI India, said, “India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world today. Its urban population is projected to multiply to nearly 814 million by 2050. To harness such expansion and drive a sustainable model of growth, it is important that we focus on building cities that are clean, green and just. At Connect Karo, we envision bringing together significant stakeholders to accelerate a climate-forward, nature-based and inclusive urban development.”Jamshyd Godrej, managing director and chairman, Godrej & Boyce, and Chairman WRI India, said, “We are facing a climate emergency today that requires companies, investors, governments and communities alike to transform to a cleaner, low-carbon and socially equitable way of living and doing business. Collaboration is the key to drive such concerted action.”The minister acknowledged the role of civil society members, organisations like WRI India, Omidyar Network etc for working with the government, giving ideas and making cities demonstration hubs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/purineed-plan-for-equitable-and-sustainable-cities-to-drive-growth-101631555972567.html
14-09-2021||Delhi||‘For an inclusive city, women need to be at the centre of policymaking’||To bring about an increase in women participation in the India workforce, there is a need to keep women at the centre of urban planning and policy decisions, said women speakers at the WRI India’s Connect Karo-2021 conference on Monday. They also said more women should be part of the decision-making process in order to better address issues faced by women.The five-day conference will focus on pressing concerns related to climate change, urban planning, and making cities inclusive. Hindustan Times is the media partner of the event.Citing a World Bank report, Jaya, director of integrated urban planning, WRI India, said women participation in India’s workforce has dropped from 30.27% in the 1990s to 20.8% in 2019. “The pandemic has further aggravated the situation, as it has pushed a lot of women, both in the informal and formal sectors, out of work. It (women participation in workforce) is below 20% after Covid,” she said.Unsafe public spaces, lack of efficient public transport, access to jobs, availability of facilities such as toilets etc., continue to be major concerns for women workers, especially in urban areas. To change the present scenario, there is a need for greater participation of women in decision-making, said Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Priyanka Chaturvedi.Speaking during the discussion on “women leaders changing conversations in cities”, Chaturvedi said safety is a huge concern for every woman and college/school going girl. “It is the unfortunate truth. Until now, all urban planning has been done from the focus of women not being at the decision-making tables. Their problems have not been addressed — whether it’s regarding toilets, hostels, safe spaces etc.”Referring to crimes against women, especially in public spaces, Chaturvedi said measures have to be taken to prevent such incidents. It is important to not deny women a seat at the decision-making table and that can be done only through reservation for women in corporations, state assembly and Parliament.Karnataka MLA Sowmya Reddy, who is also the general secretary, All India Mahila Congress, Karnataka, too said women should get better representation in decision-making bodies.Cecilia Vaca Jones, executive director, Bernard van Leer Foundation, said there is a need for more women to get involved in designing a city. “It is not just in decision-making roles; we need more women designing the city as well. Therefore, we need more women architects, engineers, planners etc. They should be a part of the ecosystem,” she said.Also, the urban planning process has to keep women at the centre, said Manu Dangi, chief operating officer, Egon Zehnder KCI. She said there is need to explore possibilities of developing workspaces near residential areas as a lot of women quit work on account of the time taken to commute between home and office.She also said there is a significant number of educated women, who left work after marriage as they had to relocate or have children. “There is a need to get this workforce back into the mainstream. During the pandemic, people worked from home. If women are given flexible timings, they too can return to work,” Dangi said.D Thara, joint secretary, Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, said there is a need to look at urban planning of cities again. “The streets will be safer if you have more people, especially women, out in public spaces,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/for-inclusive-city-women-must-be-kept-at-centre-of-planning-and-policy-101631555971386.html
14-09-2021||Delhi||Need a holistic plan for switch to hydrogen-based energy sources: Experts||India needs a holistic plan to develop infrastructure and formulate policies to encourage the use of hydrogen-based energy sources, experts said in the 2021 edition of World Resources Institute’s (WRI) annual flagship event, Connect Karo, which highlights ways to make Indian cities inclusive, sustainable and climate forward.In the session, ‘Hydrogen—a road map for India’, industry experts, researchers and policymakers discussed how hydrogen as a clean fuel can be pushed in India, and a holistic plan can ease various aspects related to its adoption, including production, transportation and research.“With India announcing the Hydrogen Mission in the budget this year, it becomes important that we now come up with a holistic plan in becoming self-reliant. A strong policy and financial support in areas such as technology development, research and scaling up manufacturing capabilities will give India the push it needs in the area of clean fuels,” said OP Agarwal, CEO, WRI (India).Addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi on Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his government’s decision to set up the National Hydrogen Mission, with an aim for India to become the new global hub and the exporter of green hydrogen. “Not only will green hydrogen be the basis of green growth through green jobs but it will also set an example for the world towards clean energy transition,” he said.Hydrogen has attracted international attention because it is a clean fuel which when consumed in a fuel cell, produces water as an end product.A report released by WRI during the session on Monday pointed out that India needs to pioneer green hydrogen because renewable energy will enable the country to meet the emission concerns under the Paris Accord as well as help the country achieve self-reliance in energy.The report also highlighted the current high costs in hydrogen production. It said that hydrogen production through electrolysis costs ₹433 per kg, and ₹280 per kg through the biomass microbial method. “...land acquisition and access to resources are still the biggest impediments to green hydrogen in India. Government specific mandates and long-term stable policy are required for building a stable hydrogen economy in India,” said Akshay Bharadwaj, general manager, Acme Solar Holding, which operates a hydrogen plant in Rajasthan.According to the Union ministry of new and renewable energy website, the Centre has been supporting a broad based research development and demonstration programme on hydrogen energy and fuel. With respect to transportation, support to works at Banaras Hindu University, IIT Delhi, and Mahindra & Mahindra has led to development and demonstration of internal combustion engines, two wheelers, three wheelers, and mini buses that run on hydrogen fuel. Two hydrogen refuelling stations have been established, at Indian Oil R&D Centre, Faridabad, and National Institute of Solar Energy, Gurugram, the website said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/need-a-holistic-plan-for-switch-to-hydrogen-based-energy-sources-experts-101631555615501.html
14-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board to offer financial assistance for rainwater harvesting system||New Delhi:Water minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) will provide a financial assistance up to ₹50,000 and a rebate of 10% on water bills to those who install rooftop rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems in their homes.“For the installation of RWH systems, the government will provide financial assistance of 50% of the cost, up to a maximum of ₹50,000, along with a 10% rebate on water bills,” said Jain, who is also the chairperson of the DJB. According to a statement issued by the DJB, plots measuring between 100 square metres and 199.99 square metres, will get a financial assistance of 50% of the total cost of the RWH structure or ₹10,000, whichever is lesser. Similarly, ₹20,000 or 50% of the cost of the RWH structure will be given for plots measuring between 200 sq m and 299.99 sq m, and so on.Jain said the DJB will also adopt the Inline Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) system, which is a cost effective model and is being implemented in the tribal-dominated Dungarpur district of Rajasthan. The reason for adopting this model is that it does not require a heavy installation set-up. While conventional RWH system set-up requires ₹75,000 to Rs. 1 lakh, the Inline RWH System can be set up at a cost as little as ₹16,000, he said. “This model uses innovative techniques and is centred on routing the rainwater directly to a bore well, instead of a regular rainwater-harvesting pit. The rainwater gets filtered within the pipe, removing any need for an additional filter system and harvesting pit. The Inline Rainwater Harvesting System comprises a pipe filter installed horizontally in the rainwater pipe. This pipe is then connected to non-functional and defunct bore wells. The filter media of the Inline Rainwater Harvesting System has a Geotextile membrane as cover, at the mouth of the rainwater pipe. This is followed by wire mesh at the entry point of the different media. This includes coarse sand, gravel/stone aggregate, gravel/stone aggregate. The total length of the filter media is around 90 cm,” he said. The Delhi Jal Board had earlier issued guidelines mandating owners of existing and new properties measuring 100 square metres and above to install RWH structures. Now, it has extended the last date for the implementation of the RWH provisions till December 31, 2021. Also, it will no longer be mandatory to take DJB certification for rainwater harvesting systems from now on.“The Kejriwal government has also relaxed the compliance guidelines…the installed RWH systems can be certified by an architect registered with the Council of Architecture on the condition that the structure is made as per DJB guidelines,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-jal-board-to-offer-financial-assistance-for-rainwater-harvesting-rwh-system-101631555611378.html
14-09-2021||Delhi||Protect the eye-witnesses in Ankit Gujjar case: Delhi HC orders Tihar officials||The Delhi high court Monday sought a status report from the prison authority on the steps taken to ensure the safety and security of witnesses in the alleged murder of inmate Ankit Gujjar in Tihar jail, and directed them that they be kept in a cell in an area under CCTV monitoring.Justice Mukta Gupta, who last week transferred the investigation from Delhi Police to the CBI, saying the deceased “lost his life to custodial violence”, also sought the medical report of two witnesses who were allegedly not receiving proper treatment in spite of suffering “grievous injuries” in the same incident.Gujjar, 29, was found dead inside his cell in Tihar jail on August 4.“Director General (Prisons) will file a status report indicating measures taken to ensure the safety and security of petitioner 1 to 3 is being maintained and also on surrender, safety and security of petitioners 4 and 5 will also be maintained.DG will also ensure that the petitioners 1-3, in custody, and petitioners 4 and 5, who will surrender on September 24, are kept inside an area where the CCTV is fully functional so that the ingress and egress to the cell is properly monitored,” ordered the judge.The court was hearing a petition by the five witnesses seeking directions to ensure their safety and security as well as to restrain the authorities from “threatening/coercing/injuring them with a view to prevent them from seeking justice for themselves and the deceased inmate”.“The petitioners are all inmates of Delhi Prisons and are eye witnesses to the brutal murder of one Ankit Gujjar (deceased), by Respondent No.1 officials, inside Central Jail No.3 on 03.08.2021,” the petition reads.Two of the petitioners, it is claimed, were the co-inmates of the deceased who are also victims of the same assault while the other three saw the deceased being beaten up by jail officials.Lawyer Mehmood Pracha, counsel for the petitioners, apprehended threat, injury and pressure from officials to coerce them into changing their stand.Two of the petitioners, who were released on interim bail on the same day, informed the deceased family about the events that transpired in jail and they are scheduled to surrender on September 24, he said.“The sequence of events clearly demonstrates the existence of an imminent threat to the lives of the Petitioners on account of the fact that they are eye witnesses to a gruesome and brutal murder inside the jail premises by influential and powerful jail officials, at the behest of the highest rung authorities of the administration,” the plea reads.In its order passed on September 8, the court had stated that the post-mortem report of the deceased “belies the version” of the jail officials that a scuffle took place in which both Deputy Superintendent and Gujjar received injuries.Saying that it is unfathomable that the jail doctor failed to see the multiple injuries on the deceased, the court opined that an investigation was needed into not only the offence of brutally beating the deceased but also into “the role of jail doctors in not providing proper treatment at the right time”.The court observed that the DIG Prisons “failed to notice the connivance/laxity” of the jail deputy superintendent who did not permit the local police to go inside the jail to inquire into the PCR call made in relation to the beating of the deceased on the intervening night of August 3-4.In the petition for transfer of investigation from Delhi Police, the family of the deceased inmate alleged that Gujjar was being harassed by the jail officials as he was “unable to meet their regularly increasing demands for money” and was murdered “as a part of pre-planned conspiracy”.The matter would be heard next on September 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/protect-the-eye-witnesses-in-ankit-gujjar-case-delhi-high-court-orders-tihar-officials-101631555072004.html
14-09-2021||Delhi||Gahlot lays foundation stone for EV charging plaza at Nehru Place bus terminal||New Delhi: Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Monday laid the foundation stone for setting up the first public electric vehicle (EV) charging plaza in Delhi Transport Corporation’s (DTC) Nehru Place bus terminal and inaugurated one EV charging station at the site. The project, for which Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL) has been allotted 10mx9m space at Nehru Place bus terminal, will be completed and opened to the public within a month.“We are moving closer to our agenda of developing innovative charging infrastructure and EV ecosystem in the national capital and we are happy to be collaborating with CESL, who comes with an expertise in EVs and charging infrastructure in the country. Since the launch of the EV policy last year, we’ve had a significant rise in the number of EVs plying on Delhi roads, with more than 17,000 EVs registered,” said Gahlot. CESL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), Ministry of Power, in collaboration with the state-run DTC will develop public EV charging stations and battery swapping stations at seven DTC terminals and depots in Delhi. Each of the seven locations will have a total of six charging points, three of which will be for two- and three-wheelers, and three charging points for four-wheelers. Once installed, these locations, with their real-time status and availability of charging points, will also be available on the One Delhi app of the Delhi government. The minister said: “We are also in the process of deliberation on adding 20 more sites of the transport department in the next phase of installation, apart from the 100 public charging stations which will be installed through an open tender. This will significantly ease the transition towards e-mobility for public transport and subsequently for the residents of Delhi.”The government’s EV policy, unveiled last year, aims to push for faster adoption of electric vehicles in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gahlot-lays-foundation-stone-for-ev-charging-plaza-at-nehru-place-bus-terminal-101631555011375.html
14-09-2021||Gurugram||Kanhai intersection to be redesigned by GMDA for smoother, safer commute||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will redesign the Kanhai intersection, one of the most important points of the city, from next month to eliminate possibilities of accidents and make commute smoother, officials said on Monday.The problems at the intersection were discussed in detail during a GMDA meeting held last week, with special emphasis on improving a left slip road and a right turn for commuters heading from Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg.“During the meeting, the mobility wing of the GMDA made a digital presentation on the challenges at the intersection as well as the possible solutions for it,” a senior GMDA official, who attended the meeting, said.The intersection, also known as the sector 44-45-52 T-junction, is the point where vehicles from Vikas Marg, Sohna Road, Saint Thomas Marg, Golf Course Road, Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg and Huda City Centre converge.Despite its importance, the intersection is riddled with problems, including a massive pothole that makes commute difficult. Among the main issues is a boomerang-shaped free-left slip road near Sushant Estate that is mostly avoided by commuters heading from Saint Thomas Marg, as it takes them much longer to travel through this stretch instead of simply taking a left turn on the main carriageway. Most commuters prefer to opt for the latter, despite the movement being regulated by a signal, due to which the number of vehicles taking a left tends to be higher than those moving straight, towards Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg, and causing congestion on the carriageway.“If the service lanes at the Kanhai intersection is fixed and designed correctly, it can reduce the congestion by half. Nobody ever takes the slip lane. The service lane is potholed and like a zig zag,” Rakesh Kapoor, a resident of DLF-5, said. Another issue is that the median on the Vikas Marg stretch ends abruptly, much before the traffic signal, leaving a large gap at the central point of the intersection, which increases the scope for accidents. As a result, commuters heading from Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg towards Vikas Marg and those heading straight from Sushant Estate towards Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg often get in each others’ way.Commuters say that out that traffic signals at the intersection are also poorly placed and difficult to spot. The intersection also lacks basic amenities for pedestrians and cyclists.The GMDA official cited above, who did not wish to be named, said, “One of the suggestions was to use the existing green belt and align the left slip road while for the right turn, compacting the intersection with either large-scale engineering work or placement of jersey barriers was discussed.”A second official privy to the development said that senior GMDA officials assessed the possible changes and their effectiveness for the public. “It was jointly decided to expedite the work at the intersection. Formalities for the tendering process is underway and we are aiming to start on-ground work from October, once the monsoons clear up,” an official of the GMDA’s mobility wing said. The official of the mobility wing said that the redesign is a part of the GMDA’s long-term plan to fix a five-kilometre stretch between the intersection and Sohna Road, passing along key arterial stretches of Vikas Marg and San Felipe Marg. Last month, the GMDA floated a ₹9-crore tender to repair and upgrade the five-kilometre stretch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/kanhai-intersection-to-be-redesigned-by-gmda-for-smoother-faster-and-safer-commute-101631553934683.html
14-09-2021||Delhi||DTU students want fee waivers, admin cites running costs||Several students of Delhi Technological University (DTU) have expressed concerns over paying the full annual fee of ₹2.06 lakh due to financial hardships arising out of Covid-19 pandemic and requested the administration to waive off several components of the fee which “will not be used by students”.University officials, however, said they cannot reduce the fee and pointed out that they are already giving fee concessions in genuine cases.Many students protested last year as well, when the annual fee was ₹1.90 lakh, but the university did not reduce the fee. In 2019-20, students had to pay a yearly fee of ₹1.66 lakh.On August 19, the university released a notice for second-year students to pay their annual fee by September 22, failing which they would be required to pay a late fee. While first-year students are yet to join the university, most third- and fourth-year students have already paid their fee.A group of students have submitted multiple memorandums to the university administration.“With all such difficulties (due to the pandemic) faced by students and their parents and as the future looks uncertain and grim, it becomes nearly impossible for us to pay such exorbitant fees. And given the campus has remained closed for more than a year now, and classes are continuing online, students shouldn’t be charged the full fees,” the students wrote in the letter sent to multiple officials, including the Registrar and Dean of Students’ Welfare, on Saturday.The students have proposed waiving off several fee components – student welfare fee, extracurricular activities, facilities and service charges, examination fee, facilities, fests, gathering, and conferences.Anup Lather, public relations officer of the university, said that the university cannot reduce the fee, and added that the administration already offered concessions for those who approached the university with “genuine causes” like Covid-19 deaths in the family, among other reasons.“There has been no fee hike as such and this fee structure was mentioned in the prospectus at the time of the admission... We cannot reduce the fee because only classes have moved online. Other expenditures like employee salaries, maintenance of university, setting up a new hostel and student centre – all of these things are still going on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dtustudents-seek-fee-concession-cite-financial-hardships-due-to-covid-101631553875174.html
14-09-2021||Delhi||236k+ apply for entry to Delhi’s govt schools||The Delhi government on Monday said it has received over 236,500 applications for admission to public schools in nursery to Class 12 for the academic year 2021-22. Of these, over 158,400 aspirants have already been admitted.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted the figures on Monday and said it was the first time that “this (of students moving to government schools in such large numbers) is happening in India”.“Till date, the Directorate of Education, Govt. of NCT of Delhi has received 236,522 applications for admission in classes between Nursery to 12 for the session 2021-22. So far, 158,484 students have been admitted in Delhi government schools. The admission process is still on,” the education department said in a statement.The department also said the enrolment – number of students in government schools – had increased substantially. “After the new admissions, the enrolment in government schools is now 17.67 lakh [1.76 million] for the session 2021-22, from 16.28 lakh [1.62 million] in the previous academic session, which is also higher than the 15.05 lakh [1.5 million] in 2019-20,” the statement said.The Delhi education department conducts two types of admission – planned and non-planned.Students who from switch one government school to another are considered planned admissions while those switching from private schools to government ones are considered non-planned admissions.A senior education department official, requesting anonymity, said, “A substantial part of the 236,522 applications is made up of non-planned admissions. We can’t say that all these students are from private schools since the figure also includes applications for entry-level classes (nursery, kindergarten and class 1) and the aspirants may or may not be from private schools. The non-planned admissions, from Class 6 onwards can be considered as those who have migrated from private schools.”Several government school principals reported an increase in admissions when compared to previous years.Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of the government principals’ association, said, “Non-planned admissions have increased a lot. We received over 3,000 applications for classes 6 to 9 this year as compared to around 1,800 last year. This is mainly due to the economic crisis wrought by the pandemic and lack of in-person classes. Parents do not want to continue paying for online classes that often ignore the plight of students without smartphones. Government schools at least have worksheets for such students.”Mary Jyotsna Minj, principal of a government girls’ school in New Kondli, said, “In most government schools, the strength has increased because parents have been considering it a safe choice as they don’t have to pay fee. We have all streams and that is why we get more students from our cluster. The admissions to classes 6 to 12 have jumped manifold in the past two years. Before the pandemic, every year, we saw a jump of 200-250 students in non-planned admissions to classes 6 to 12. This figure jumped to around 400 during the last academic year and this year, we received around 4,900 students which is a jump from 4,100 from the pre-pandemic year.”Rohini resident Rashmi Bhatnagar, whose son was admitted to Class 11 in a government school this year, said, “The infrastructure of Delhi government schools has improved over the years and we have noticed a change in the quality of teaching in these schools. Public schools are coming up with several schemes to help students with learning. They focus on the holistic development of children with entrepreneurship mindset curriculum, etc. We do not have any economic challenges as such but we made the switch only on account of the quality of education.”Closure of schools for younger children and continued online education also prompted parents to opt for government schools. Old Delhi resident Nazia, who has two children studying in Delhi government schools, said the family faced hardships during the pandemic due to delayed disbursal of salaries. Her husband, who also works as a teacher in a low-budget private school, was worried about the stability of his job.“Covid-19 affected the household income of many families. We didn’t know if my husband would even retain his job. My older son studied in a private school till Class 5 and was going to switch to another private school in Class 6. But the pandemic delayed the transfer process indefinitely. We did not want our child’s year to be wasted so we enrolled him in a government school. I also enrolled my younger son in a nearby government school for now because we don’t know when classes will resume for younger children,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/236000-apply-for-admissions-to-delhi-govt-schools-says-education-dept-101631553751794.html
14-09-2021||Pune||Maha-Metro to resume installing girders across Lakdi pul after Ganesh festival||PUNE: Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Maha Metro) will take a call regarding installing girders across the Sambhaji bridge popularly known as Lakdi pul after the Ganesh festival.Atul Gadgil, director of Maha Metro, on Monday said, “It is a technical matter and will take some time to study. We have requested city mayor Murlidhar Mohol to give us one week’s time for the purpose. We will report and make a presentation to the mayor. The decision will be taken after the Ganesh festival is over.”After around eight prominent Ganesh mandals located in the peth areas raised objections to the work of placing girders on the pillars at Sambhaji bridge last week, Mohol intervened and instructed Maha Metro to stop work apart from calling a meeting of Metro officials to discuss the issue.Maha Metro, which is executing the Pune metro project, started work on installing a 50metre-long steel girder across Sambhaji bridge, which is the longest girder on the metro stretch between Vanaz and Civil court. However, workers of Ganesh mandals objected to placing the girder at a height of 20 metre above Sambhaji bridge and demanded that the height be increased from 20 feet to 28 feet as they would otherwise face problems passing through the bridge to immerse Ganesh idols in the Mutha river during the Ganesh immersion procession. Office bearers of the mandals claimed that placing girders at a height of 20 feet may pose obstacles during the Ganesh immersion procession. Officials of Maha Metro said that the measurement of the height of Ganesh idols along with their chariots and other decorations has been completed and that till date, these have a maximum height of 24 feet.As per National highway height clearance standards, a height of 20 feet is mandatory and the two pillars above Sambhaji bridge upon which the girder is going to be placed are kept at a height of 6.5metre by Maha Metro. Maha Metro has taken permission for temporary traffic diversions due to closure of the Lakdi pul from August 24 to September 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maha-metro-to-resume-installing-girders-across-lakdi-pul-after-ganesh-festival-101631550514338.html

14-09-2021||Pune||Monsoon likely to linger till end of September: IMD||PUNE With monsoon rainfall likely to continue into the last week of September, the withdrawal of the annual monsoon, earlier forecast as September 17, may be delayed. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department at India Meteorological Department (IMD) Pune said, “There is a lot of time for the monsoon to retreat. The monsoon as of now is very active and vigorous over some parts of the country. For monsoon retreat to be declared, there has to be no rainfall for a few days,” said Kashyapi.He however added that rainfall activity over Maharashtra will be subdued after September 17. “The low pressure area over Bay of Bengal which has now intensified into a depression is moving. Due to this, the monsoon will be vigorous. Konkan and Goa will receive widespread rainfall till September 15,” said Kashyapi.For Pune city, Kashyapi added that the city is forecast to experience light rainfall till September 19. Pune reported continuous rainfall on Monday. On Monday, Shivajinagar reported 3.2mm of rainfall, whereas Lohegaon reported 2.6 mm of rainfall, weather officials said.IMD officials noted that Mahabaleshwar on Monday reported 81 mm of rainfall. In Central Maharashtra, Kolhapur also reported 13 mm of rainfall on Monday.“Ghat regions have an orange alert for very heavy to heavy rainfall on September 14. After that there is no alert for the city,” said Kashyapi.Between June 1 and September 13, Pune has reported a deficiency of 20.1 mm of rainfall. This departure is on the higher side due to three consecutive monsoon breaks. With good rainfall across Maharashtra, the state itself has received 112 per cent excess rainfall in September alone, as per the weather department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monsoon-likely-to-linger-till-end-of-september-imd-101631550150247.html
14-09-2021||Mumbai||Railways issued 7.4 lakh season tickets for Mumbai local trains in a month||More than 743,000 commuters have obtained railway season tickets for suburban train journey in almost a month since local train services resumed for fully vaccinated general public in Mumbai. Central Railway (CR) issued 548,046 railway passes while Western Railway (WR) issued 195,397 suburban railway passes to passengers to travel in Mumbai locals, in a month.The maximum numbers of passes were issued at Dombivli and Borivli railway stations. Meanwhile, the number of ticketless commuters has significantly increased on CR with more than 100,000 passengers fined for travelling without a ticket in a month. The railway has collected ₹3 crore as fine from them. On WR, 15,786 passengers were fined for travelling without railway tickets and ₹43.92 lakh was recovered from them. “We appeal to the passengers to travel with proper and valid railway tickets to avoid inconvenience and travel with dignity and follow all norms mandated for Covid-19,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR. Local train services resumed for fully vaccinated passengers on August 15. Passengers have to register showing their vaccination details and get a universal pass through online or offline procedure and then buy monthly railway passes to travel by local trains.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the nodal authority in charge of issuing universal passes, said it does not have the exact number of passes issued. “We have not collated the number of universal passes issued yet. It is a tedious process as it involves collecting the numbers from both online and offline systems,” said a senior BMC official. Passenger associations said the Maharashtra government should consider allowing people to travel by local trains who have taken one dose of vaccine. “People who are travelling ticketless are the ones who have no choice but to make a living. It is important for them. People who have taken one dose of vaccine should also be allowed to travel by local trains. The Maharashtra government should consider that,” said Subhash Gupta, president of Rail Yatri Parishad.Local train services were suspended for the general public on April 15 due to the rise in Covid-19 cases in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/railways-issued-7-4-lakh-season-tickets-for-mumbai-local-trains-in-a-month-101631548650798.html
14-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC aims to conduct 60,000 Covid tests daily after Ganesh Chaturthi in Mumbai||Anticipating a surge in Covid-19 cases after Ganesh Chaturthi, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has instructed ward officers to ramp up daily testing for Covid. The civic body aims to conduct around 60,000 tests daily including rapid antigen tests (RAT) for early identification of infected patients. Amid the ongoing Ganpati festival, Covid-19 tests have plummeted in the city. As per BMC data, on September 10, the civic body conducted around 50,000 tests which dropped to 29,849 on Sunday (September 12) and 25,581 on Monday. Last year, the pandemic curve had witnessed a surge after Ganesh Chaturthi due to violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Due to the festival, the number of tests is low. But we have instructed ward officers to increase testing after the festival is over. We are eyeing at increasing tests up to 60,000 daily so that we can identify infected patients early,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner.In the past one week, the test positivity rate (TPR) has risen to more than 1% which was around 0.8% earlier. For instance, on Monday, TRP was 1.36%. With this in mind, the civic body has plans to set up RAT desks in each ward. “We will run RAT on the floating crowds in populated areas, especially at railway stations, markets and malls. We will also test shopkeepers and vendors,” said Kakani. Though medical experts have welcomed the move, they laid emphasis on conducting more RT-PCR tests, which has a higher accuracy rate than RAT. Dr Kedar Toraskar, critical care specialist at Wockhardt Hospital and member of the state’s Covid-19 taskforce, said, “Testing and vaccination hold the key to controlling the anticipated third wave. We need to test more than 60,000 people daily before the pandemic curve surges again. This will not only control the transmission rate but also help in early treatment which will lessen mortality rate.”With the festive season beginning in the city, BMC has urged people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and get tested immediately if they have any symptoms.Dr Ramakanta Panda, chief consultant for cardiovascular thoracic surgery and managing director of Asian Heart Institute, Bandra-Kurla Complex, said parents should pray from home and not take children to visit pandals. Dr Panda said Sars-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19 — enters the body through ACE2 receptor, the protein which provides the entry point to the virus to hook into and infect a wide range of human cells. These receptors are not matured in children. However, as seen in the second wave, a large number of children contacted Covid-19 and a certain percentage of them also developed complications.“Rare but severe incidences of systemic inflammatory diseases have been found as a result of Covid-19 in kids. In the absence of a vaccine for children, it is best that families pray from home,” he said. As HT reported earlier, BMC has changed testing rules where high-risk and close relatives of Covid-19 positive patients will be tested on that day itself instead of waiting for five-seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-aims-to-conduct-60-000-covid-tests-daily-after-ganesh-chaturthi-in-mumbai-101631548530605.html
14-09-2021||Pune||Covid testing wanes in Pune as positivity rate shows slight increase||PUNE The number of Covid-19 tests being conducted in the district has been dropping, week on week, this despite the positivity rate showing a slight increaseBetween August 8 and August 14, when 124,638 Covid-19 tests were conducted, 6,917 new Covid-19 cases were reported. The positivity rate at the time was 5.5%. In the week between August 25 and August 31, 115,914 Covid-19 tests were conducted and the positivity rate climbed to 6.2% with 7,263 new Covid-19 cases found. In the last week between September 5and September 11 105,863 tests were conducted and the positivity rate as at 6.01% as 6,372 cases were reported. Along with Pune which is at a 6.6% combined positivity rate, other districts of concern are Ahmednagar (5.5%), Sangli (4.4%), Satara (3.4%), Nashik (3.7%) and Osmanabad (3.6%). Ravindra Bhinwade, additional municipal commissioner said, “I have already spoken to the health department saying that the Covid-19 daily test numbers should remain above 10,000 daily. On Sunday, this number had fallen down to 5,000. However,on Sunday swab collection centres are also functioning with limited staff since it is their weekly off. We are also in talks with various Ganesh mandals to ensure that possible super- spreaders are tested. Also for mandals to come forward as volunteers to conduct Covid-19 tests. We want to focus on RTPCR tests. Rapid antigen tests (RAT) are only limited to symptomatic contacts of positive Covid-19 patients. We do not miss any patient who may test negative on RAT.” With the Ganesh festival on and crowds returning to the streets the fear of a third wave is palpable and only increased testing could see the administration know if there is a renewed outbreak of the virus.As reported by Hindustan Times in its Sunday edition, members of the Covid Task Force have pointed out that negligence towards Covid-appropriate behaviour can have serious repercussions in the near future. Dr Shashank Joshi member of the state task force, even asked for caution and alert as the mass gatherings have increased during the festivities in cities like Pune and Mumbai. “We have to be on the red alert. We have to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour must be followed. We must delay the third Covid wave as long as possible,” Dr Joshi said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19 management, had said that the last week of September would be crucial as Covid cases may go up post Ganesh immersion. “Covid-appropriate behaviour is nowhere to be seen in the semi-urban and rural areas. Even in the urban parts only a few people have been following the norms such as wearing masks. It is a dangerous sign. We have seen the effects of the negligence. We should all be aware,” Dr Salunkhe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-testing-wanes-in-pune-as-positivity-rate-shows-slight-increase-101631548409914.html
14-09-2021||Lucknow||Covid: Preschoolers back in classrooms in Lucknow||Preschoolers were back in classrooms as the preprimary sections of many schools in Lucknow reopened after a prolonged closure due to the Covid pandemic but the attendance remained moderate at about 50 per cent. In some schools, it was even less.Schools under the umbrella of the Unaided Private School Association Uttar Pradesh (UPSA) and the Preschool Association started classes for preprimary children from Monday, said Anil Agarwal, president of UPSA.The school campuses came alive resonating with music, floral welcome and vibrant decorations for the nursery to upper kindergarten (UKG) children on Monday. All branches of St Joseph School welcomed the nursery, preparatory and kindergarten students with beautiful displays. The school band performed as the tiny tots entered into the school campuses.Wearing face masks, the kindergarten students went through the sanitisation tunnel to their brightly decorated classes and corridors. Teachers greeted the children with chocolate treats. Arrangements were made for thermal scanning of all students.Agarwal said since the schools were already running successfully for classes 1 to 12, the little ones could come safely.Preschool Association president Tushar Chetwani said that all preschools and playway schools would ensure complete compliance with Covid protocols and standard operating procedures.However, a number of other educational institutions under Unaided Private School Association Uttar Pradesh (UPSA) chose to keep the preschools shut for different reasons. Debjani Pakrasi, principal of Pioneer Montessori School (Rajajipuram branch in Lucknow), said, “Though the government has given proper guidelines for the reopening of preschools, still the parents of toddlers seem to be quite apprehensive in sending their little ones to school.”Pakrasi said, “On average, 60% parents have still not given their consent for sending their children and wish to wait till October before taking any decision. The school management is cooperating with such parents by running both online and offline classes simultaneously.”There are many educational institutions like City Montessori School, which is part of Unaided Private School Association Uttar Pradesh (UPSA), that reopened the kindergarten section on September 8 itself while the association had given a call to do so from September 13.CMS founder Jagdish Gandhi said that the safety of students remained the topmost priority and all CMS campuses were strictly following the Covid protocol while running their offline classes.To maintain physical distancing for students and parents outside the campuses, social distancing circles have been painted for their safety and posters spreading awareness about Covid prevention measures have been put up at prominent locations on every campus. Social distancing is being ensured during seating and classrooms are also being sanitised on a regular basis for the safety of students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-preschoolers-back-in-classrooms-in-lucknow-101631533829346.html
14-09-2021||Mumbai||Sakinaka rape, murder over monetary dispute: Mumbai Police||monetary dispute led to the brutal rape and murder of a 32-year-old Dalit woman in Sakinaka last week, Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said on Monday, adding that the victim and the lone accused in the case, who has confessed to the crime, knew each other.The weapon used in the incident has been recovered, he added.Since the victim was a Dalit, the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act has been invoked against the accused, who is already facing rape and murder charges, Nagrale said at a press conference.On September 10, the 32-year-old woman was raped and brutalised with a rod by a man inside a stationary tempo in suburban Sakinaka. She succumbed to her injuries during treatment early on Saturday.“We have the sequence of events, like when the victim reached the spot, when the accused reached the spot, how the crime took place - everything is on record,” Nagrale said.The accused, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, worked as a driver and lived on a pavement in the same area. He was identified with the help of CCTV footage collected from the area and traced within a few hours of the incident, the police have said.The police have taken up this case on priority and a charge-sheet will be filed within one month, he added.“We will send all evidences for DNA analysis. All relevant CCTV footage has been collected from the area. There was some monetary dispute between the two (accused and victim) due to which the incident took place,” the senior IPS officer said.Earlier in the day, amid severe backlash from the Opposition parties over the case, the Shiv Sena termed Mumbai the “safest city” in the world for women and there should be no doubt about it in anyone’s mind.“The rape and murder of the woman in Sakinaka has shocked one and all. But, Mumbai is the safest city in the world for women and there should be no doubt about it in anyone’s mind,” said an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with the senior officials from state police force and home department, where he issued a slew of directives regarding women’s safety. “Police force should be more vigilant and alert to keep up its formidable reputation. Fingers are being raised over the capability of the force and it needs to be taken seriously by it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sakinaka-rape-murder-over-monetary-dispute-mumbai-police-101631533588939.html

14-09-2021||Indore||Indore hospital conducts rare liver transplant. Here's all about the condition||A 26-year-old man, whose liver and heart were on the wrong side of his body, was operated upon in a hospital in Indore city of Madhya Pradesh so that he could donate one of his organs to his father. Doctors at the city's Choithram Hospital said the surgery was conducted on the man, who has a condition called situs invertus totalis, on August 28. The 59-year-old father was suffering from liver cirrhosis, which called for the donation, doctors said."The liver is usually found on the right side, but due to a congenital condition, it was on the left side for Prakhar. A team of four doctors performed the surgery, which if not done in time, could have caused danger to the life of the recipient," Dr Sudesh Sharda, the hospital's organ transplant surgeon, was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Sharda claimed that only five such transplants had been performed in the world. The man has been discharged while his father would also be allowed to go home soon, he added. Situs inversus totalis is a condition in which internal organs are totally reversed. "Situs Inversus totalis has been estimated to occur once in about 6-8,000 births. Situs inversus occurs in a rare abnormal condition that is present at birth (congenital) called Kartagener's syndrome," medicine.net says.Situs inversus can occur alone with no other abnormalities or conditions or can occur as part of a syndrome with various other defects. "Congenital heart defects are present in about 5-10% of affected people. The underlying cause and genetics of situs inversus are complex. Familial cases have been reported," according to US Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD).In isolated situs inversus, there is a complete mirror image transposition of the chest and abdominal organs, and front-back symmetry is normal. "Many affected people have no associated health issues when the condition is isolated. When situs inversus occurs in association with other conditions such as Kartagener syndrome or primary ciliary dyskinesia, additional signs and symptoms relating to these conditions will be present," GARD says.Diagnosis of situs inversus is done through a thorough physical examination, followed by radiographic imaging of the chest and abdomen and electrocardiography. "The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition," GARD says."In isolated situs inversus, no treatment may be necessary. When situs inversus is associated with another condition, treatment may depend on the associated condition and the signs and symptoms present in the affected person," it says.GARD also said that the long-term outlook for those with situs inversus depends on whether the condition is isolated, or is associated with additional abnormalities affecting the heart or other parts of the body.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/indore-hospital-conducts-rare-liver-transplant-here-s-all-about-the-condition-101631503211534.html
14-09-2021||World||Top Democrat joins Republicans to criticise Blinken on Afghanistan withdrawal||The Joe Biden administration came in for a second round of withering criticism in Congress on Tuesday over its handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, this time with a top Democrat joining Republicans in accusing officials of bungling the pullout.Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the withdrawal “clearly and fatally flawed” and scorched President Joe Biden and his team for failing to anticipate the Taliban’s speedy takeover of Afghanistan. The New Jersey senator also threatened to subpoena Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who he said declined an invitation to testify alongside Secretary of State Antony Blinken.“This rapid collapse laid bare a fundamental fact -- that successive administrations lied to the Congress over the years about the durability of Afghan military and government institutions and we need to understand why,” Menendez said.It was a bipartisan challenge, a day after Blinken testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where Republicans attacked the administration and demanded Blinken’s resignation while Democrats largely blamed former President Donald Trump for the deal his administration cut with the Taliban last year for the U.S. to withdraw.On Tuesday, James Risch of Idaho, the Senate committee’s ranking Republican, called the Biden administration’s handling of Afghanistan a “dismal failure” and “a stain on America’s credibility.”“The Biden administration left Afghanistan in total disarray and singlehandedly created a humanitarian crisis,” Risch said. “The Taliban is now one of the best-armed terrorist organizations on the planet.”Repeatedly questioned about the failure to predict the rapid Taliban advance, Blinken said there was nothing the administration saw that “suggested that this government and security forces would collapse in a matter of days”“We need to look back at all of this,” Blinken said. “We did not see this collapse in a matter of 11 days but it is important that we go back and look at all of this.”Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire criticized the efforts to assign blame, saying “the important thing for us to do now is to figure out how we can work together to address those people who still need to be evacuated from Afghanistan. There are a lot of people to blame, and we all share in it.”Blinken told lawmakers on Monday that the US had given many warnings to Americans that they should leave Afghanistan and is still working to evacuate the 100 or so believed to remain there. He said the U.S. also wants to help all those Afghans to whom the US “has a special commitment.”As the United Nations and other groups warn of a humanitarian catastrophe in the country, Blinken said the US will provide $64 million in new humanitarian aid to Afghanistan that “will not flow through the government” but instead through nongovernmental organisations.The demand by Menendez that Austin appear before his panel is a departure from the usual protocol that the secretary of state testifies to the Foreign Relations committee while the secretary of defense goes before the Armed Services panel. Austin is schedule to testify there on September 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-democrat-joins-republicans-to-criticise-blinken-on-afghanistan-withdrawal-101631641056031.html
14-09-2021||World||US senator moves bill for climate ties with India||Bob Menendez, a Democratic lawmaker who heads the foreign relations committee of the US Senate, introduced a legislation on Monday proposing to create a main forum for cooperation between the United States and India related to clean climate technologies and energy transmission.The forum will be called United States-India Climate and Clean Energy Partnership (CCEP) as proposed by the Prioritizing Clean Energy and Climate Cooperation with India Act moved by Bob Menendez.“By establishing the US-India CCEP, we are laying the groundwork for successful partnerships between not only the US and Indian governments, but also our universities and private sectors,” Bob Menendez said, adding, “I am proud to lead this effort to further strengthen our relationship with India.”The introduction of the bill comes amidst heightened cooperation between India and the United States on climate. US Presidential Envoy on Climate John Kerry is wrapping up a three-day visit to India during which the two countries activated a mechanism to fund India’s transition to clean energy, which was launched by the two sides at the time of the Climate Summit convened by President Joe Biden in April.Climate will figure in the first in-person summit that President Biden is hosting on September 24 here at the White House of the Quad leaders Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga.Bob Menendez’s office said the bill introduced by the senator follows his visit to India in 2019 with a congressional delegation. The senator had met Indian ministers and business leaders to discuss what can the two countries do to address the threat of climate change and deepen cooperation on clean energy production.In addition to “establishing groundbreaking new programmes”, this bill will also serve to bolster the Biden administration’s US-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership, which aims to elevate bilateral cooperation on strong climate action and support the achievement of India’s ambitious climate targets, said Bob Menendez’s office.Apart from setting up a main forum for cooperation on climate and energy, the legislation proposes to promote ties between universities and government research laboratories on the research, development, and application of clean energy technologies. It aims to promote sharing of intellectual property between private sector entities for renewable energy technology, air conditioning technology, refrigeration systems technology, and other advanced energy technologies. It will encourage US private investment in the Indian clean energy technology market; support technical assistance and expertise on electrical grid and energy efficiency improvements in India and support initiatives to develop new renewable energy generation capacity in India.The statement said the bill also requires the administration to submit a multi-year strategy to congress for implementing the CCEP; it seeks a report on opportunities for states in the countries to cooperate on these issues; and, finally, sets advancing climate risk reduction and resilience capacities as a priority for the US’s diplomatic, security, and development work in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senator-moves-bill-for-climate-ties-with-india-101631639316631.html

Anti-migrant sentiment has been running high in Turkey as it grapples with economic woes, including high unemployment, that have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.“President Erdogan underlined that Turkey does not have the capacity to handle a new migration burden,” said a statement from the presidential communications office.Erdogan added that “no one wants to relive an experience similar to the Syrian refugee wave of 2015,” when hundreds of thousands of people reached Greek islands by boats from the nearby Turkish coast, on their way to seek asylum in more prosperous EU countries.In 2016, Turkey and the EU signed a deal for Ankara to stem the flow of migrants heading toward Europe, in return for visa-free travel for Turkish citizens and substantial EU financial support.Erdogan told the German president that the EU should “rapidly take steps” to ensure that the deal is implemented by re-starting Turkey's stalled membership talks, updating the customs union with Ankara and granting visa-free travel to Turkish citizens, according to the statement.There was no statement on the call from the office of the German president, whose duties are largely ceremonial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-have-capacity-to-handle-new-refugee-influx-turkey-on-afghanistan-crisis-101631636764630.html

Sirajuddin Haqqani, a dreaded terrorist with a bounty of $5 million on his head, has been given the role of the interior minister, while Mullah Muhammad Yaqoob, the eldest son of Taliban founder Mullah Omar, was named the defence minister, apart of Muttaqi, the acting foreign minister.The reclusive Taliban chief Haibatullah Akhundzada was named the supreme leader with the final say on religious, political and security affairs.Meanwhile, the United States has expressed concern over the “lack of diversity” in the composition of the Taliban-led caretaker government of Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-coordinate-with-countries-pledging-humanitarian-aid-to-afghanistan-taliban-101631627576618.html

He also said that a third dose might extend the protection offered by the vaccine against the disease for longer than the second dose.Meanwhile, England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam too made similar remarks regarding the booster, saying that the third doses would be used to keep the pressure of the National Health Service (NHS) during the winter. “The booster programme will make a very substantial impact on keeping the lid on things Covid wise in terms of hospitalisations and deaths and keeping pressure off the NHS (National Health Service) this winter,” Reuters quoted him as saying.The comments from the experts came even as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is scheduled to brief his government’s strategy for the winter in a media conference later on Tuesday, during which he is expected to warn the public that the fight against the pandemic was not over.“The booster programme will make a very substantial impact on keeping the lid on things COVID wise in terms of hospitalisations and deaths and keeping pressure off the NHS (National Health Service) this winter,” a statement from Johnson’s office said. “Today I will set out a clear plan for the autumn and winter, when the virus has a natural advantage, to protect the gains we have made,” he added.The UK would join France, Germany and the Netherlands among other European nations in administering the booster doses to its citizens.While many western nations, including the US, have made clear their plans for booster doses, several experts of the World Health Organization (WHO) including the body’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus have expressed their concerns over vaccine distribution.The WHO chief has even sought a moratorium on boosters globally at least until the end of this year for poor nations to immunise their population. Supporting the WHO’s concerns, a report published in the medical journal Lancet, co-authored by WHO’s chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan, said that a booster dose was not needed for fully vaccinated individuals as they continue to be protected against hospitalisation and death by the vaccines.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-provide-covid-19-boosters-for-vulnerable-people-above-50-pm-johnson-to-set-out-plan-for-winter-101631622613049.html
14-09-2021||World||Covid affected everyone, but not equally: Melinda Gates||On the occasion of Gates Foundation’s fifth annual Goalkeepers Report launch on Tuesday, Melinda French Gates, co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, talks in an email interview about how health care delivery system is going to change post Covid-19 pandemic; and how India has managed to scale up Covid-19 vaccination remarkably well. Goalkeepers is the foundation’s campaign to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. How do you think the whole health care system will change post Covid-19 pandemic? The Covid-19 pandemic affected everyone. But it didn’t affect everyone equally. Historically marginalised countries and communities were hit the hardest, and they continue to bear a disproportionate burden of the suffering, both in their lives and in their economies. What’s also clear is that the countries that had invested in their health systems over decades were better prepared to manage the pandemic. In the years to come, in addition to strengthening health systems, I’m optimistic the world will heed this lesson and make the long-term investments we need in research and development and manufacturing, especially when it comes to vaccines, and focus on interventions that best serve the most vulnerable. These investments are critical not just to addressing the next pandemic, but to getting the world back on track to meet the Global Goals. And these investments must be made closer to the people who most stand to benefit, which helps us ensure that life-saving interventions and technologies are distributed equitably. In the Indian context, what should be the key focus areas of the government to manage such public health crisis? The pandemic proves that preparing for crises starts years before they happen. India’s Covid-19 management and country-wide immunization drive have demonstrated why long-term investments in health systems are crucial. In particular, India’s thriving R&D and vaccine manufacturing and delivery ecosystem have enabled the country to rapidly scale up Covid-19 immunization to deliver more than 750 million doses. That’s remarkable. Also Read | India vaccinations cross 750 millionIt is also important for governments to put systems in place that can more quickly help the most vulnerable people to minimize the impact of such a crisis. India is taking some encouraging steps to do just that, such as implementing its Digital Health Mission to boost the efficiency and transparency in the country’s healthcare services. And the Indian government’s direct benefit transfer program, which has provided financial support to 200 million women during the pandemic, has helped those who have been disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. Putting women at the centre of the economic recovery is something that all governments must continue to focus on and at the Gates Foundation we remain committed to providing strong support to this. We’ve committed $2.1 billion globally over the next five years to promote women’s economic empowerment, to strengthen women and girls’ health and family planning, and to support women’s leadership. It’s clear that we have to make sure that the most vulnerable groups and communities are protected whenever such crises occur. Strengthening social safety nets, improving service delivery to vulnerable communities, including women, and ensuring access to affordable quality healthcare will continue to be critical areas to focus on. How do you see this pandemic affecting global efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? It will take years to understand the full extent of the pandemic’s impact on the SDGs. As this year’s Goalkeepers report demonstrates, we have already witnessed considerable setbacks, but we’ve also been able to avoid some of the worst-case scenarios on several key indicators—thanks to people around the world stepping up. Consider the global goal for routine vaccine coverage. A year ago, we predicted a drop of 14 percentage points in global vaccine coverage, which would have amounted to 25 years of progress lost. New analysis from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) shows the drop, while still unacceptable, was only half that. We have a lot of ground to cover on some important indicators, especially on gender equality, and we need to ensure continued efforts and commitment even on the issues where we avoided catastrophe. This is not simply a fight for one country. Regaining the lost ground on the SDGs needs to be a priority global effort. What’s your opinion on the inequity that we have seen in use of Covid-19 vaccines globally, wherein developed countries have vaccinated a major chunk of their population and are already looking at booster shots, and low-income countries still waiting for doses? Despite some historic successes and unprecedented collaborations, we still have a long way to go to ensure everyone has equal access to vaccines. Outbreaks and new variants around the world show the consequences of this vaccine inequity and the significant and tragic costs of inaction. We have a moral imperative to remove all barriers and use every lever available to rapidly improve access to Covid-19 vaccines for everybody, everywhere. We’ve been focused on this mission over the last year, and we will keep it up. Until more people worldwide get the vaccine, we won’t be able to put the pandemic behind us. Also Read | Covaxin may get WHO nod this week: ExpertWe’ve also seen that Covid-19 vaccine access is directly correlated with locations with vaccine R&D and manufacturing capability. Africa, for example, has 17% of the world’s population, but less than 1% of the world’s vaccine manufacturing capabilities. That’s why we support efforts to invest in and build a sustainable regional vaccine development and manufacturing ecosystem—to ensure vaccines can be available everywhere. The path forward is challenging. But it’s not impossible. We all can, and must, do more to accelerate the distribution of Covid-19 vaccine doses. Any country or company sitting on the sidelines should step in to do its part. In the past one-and-a-half year, what has been the silver lining ? It’s hard to think about silver linings amid so much devastation, but the Covid-19 pandemic has also shown our collective resolve, resilience, determination, and capacity to fight these challenges with innovation and collaboration. In the toughest of circumstances, countless individuals, organizations, and countries went above and beyond to innovate, adapt, and build resilient systems and to look out for one another. In India, we witnessed the unprecedented efforts of government, private institutions, and millions of ordinary individuals coming together to help those in need. The Gates Foundation was proud to partner with the government and Indian non-profits to expand testing, surveillance, vaccine discovery, and evaluating new and repurposed drugs. We also witnessed remarkable efforts from small collectives in India. Self-help groups played a crucial role in management of Covid-19 in their communities. For example, when Covid-19 arrived in Bihar, India—home to more than 100 million people—local self-help groups established trust with their neighbours by delivering meals and home-based health care to those who fell ill, then served as sources of information and support to encourage the community to get vaccinated. In Uttar Pradesh, apart from playing a similar role of community support that peer groups did in Bihar, self-help groups have also been engaged by the government to facilitate the state’s ‘Take Home Ration’ program and to support the most vulnerable. There are so many examples like these, and they all demonstrate that some of the most effective interventions happen at a hyperlocal level, headed by leaders who have worked long and hard to earn the trust of their communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-affected-everyone-but-not-equally-melinda-gates-101631620835923.html
14-09-2021||World||China slams upcoming in-person Quad summit in Washington||China on Tuesday said regional cooperation cliques formed to target a third country will not be popular and have no future, in its first warning shot against the upcoming US-led first in-person meeting of the Quad countries including India, Japan and Australia to be held in Washington on September 24.Beijing has described the Quad, or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, in the past as a clique based on a cold war ideology and “detrimental to the international order”.The Chinese foreign ministry reacted hours after Washington announced that US President Joe Biden will host the first in-person summit of leaders of the Quad countries, which have sought to boost cooperation in an apparent attempt to push back China’s growing assertiveness especially in the Indo-Pacific region.The US visits of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga and Australian PM Scott Morrison will coincide with the United Nations General Assembly in New York, which Joe Biden will address on September 21.When asked about the Quad conclave, which is to be held on September 24, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said: “It (the Quad) should not target any third party.”“China believes that any regional cooperation framework should go with the trend of the times and be conducive to mutual trust and cooperation between the regional countries. It should not target any third party or harm their interests,” Zhao Lijian said. “To form exclusive cliques targeting other countries does not conform with the country’s aspirations, won’t be popular and has no future.”“I want to stress that China is not only an engine for economic growth in Asia Pacific, it is also the main force safeguarding peace,” Zhao Lijian said, adding that China’s growth is an increase in “forces for peace” in the world and “good news” for the region.“Relevant countries should abandon outdated zero-sum game thinking and narrow geopolitical concepts, take a correct view of China’s development, respect the hearts of the people in the region, and do more things that are conducive to promoting unity and cooperation of regional countries,” Zhao Lijian added.China had reacted strongly to an online meeting of the Quad leaders in March, saying that it “will end up nowhere” if it does not abandon its ideological bias and cold war mentality, underscoring its opposition to the bloc.The March summit attended by all four leaders was closely monitored and critiqued by Beijing.The consensus in Beijing was that the four countries came together to counter China’s increasing influence and muscle-flexing in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region.In November 2017, New Delhi, Tokyo, Washington, and Canberra gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue to develop a coordinated strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific region free of any influence.In 2018, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had described the Quad as “...seafoam in the Pacific or the Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate”.By 2020, Wang came around to acknowledging that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue had become a “security threat” and a so-called Indo-Pacific “new Nato”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slams-upcoming-in-person-quad-summit-in-washington-101631617475404.html
14-09-2021||World||Global vaccine coverage dropped to 1/2 of what was anticipated: Gates Foundation||The global vaccine coverage dropped to just half of what was anticipated, finds Gates Foundation’s fifth annual Goalkeepers report, adding that the world stepped up to avert some of the worst-case scenarios amid the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “In last year’s Goalkeepers Report, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) predicted a drop of 14 percentage points in global vaccine coverage—effectively erasing 25 years of progress in 25 weeks. New analysis from IHME demonstrates that the decline, while still unacceptable, was only half of what was anticipated,” said the report.However, the report also acknowledges that disparities caused by Covid-19 remain stark, and those who have been hardest hit by the pandemic will be the slowest to recover. Because of Covid-19, an additional 31 million people were pushed into extreme poverty in 2020 compared to 2019. And while 90% of advanced economies will regain pre-pandemic per capita income levels by next year, only a third of low- and middle-income economies are expected to do so.Also Read | Covid-19: Southeast China cases soar amid outbreak led by Delta variantTo ensure a truly equitable recovery from the pandemic, the co-chairs call for long-term investments in health and economies—like the ones that led to the rapid development of the Covid-19 vaccine—to propel recovery efforts and get the world back on track to meet the Global Goals.“[The past year] has reinforced our belief that progress is possible but not inevitable,” write the co-chairs in the report. “If we can expand upon the best of what we’ve seen these past 18 months, we can finally put the pandemic behind us and once again accelerate progress in addressing fundamental issues like health, hunger, and climate change.”While vaccine against Covid-19 was developed in record time as a result of decades of investment, policies, and partnerships that established the infrastructure, talent, and ecosystems necessary to deploy them quickly, there has not been equitable distribution of the supply.“The lack of equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines is a public health tragedy,” said Bill Gate, Co-chair of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and co-author of the report, in a statement.“We face the very real risk that in the future, wealthy countries and communities will begin treating Covid-19 as yet another disease of poverty. We can’t put the pandemic behind us until everyone, regardless of where they live, has access to vaccines.”According to the report, 80% of all Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries to date, with some securing two to three times the number needed so they could cover boosters; less than 1% of doses have been administered in low-income countries.Further, Covid-19 vaccine access has been strongly correlated with the locations where there is vaccine research and development, and manufacturing capability. Though Africa is home to 17% of the world’s population, for example, it has less than 1% of the world’s vaccine manufacturing capabilities.“We must invest in local partners to strengthen the capacity of researchers and manufacturers in lower-income countries to create the vaccines and medicines they need,” said Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman. “The only way we will solve our greatest health challenges is by drawing on the innovation and talent of people all over the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-vaccine-coverage-dropped-to-1-2-of-what-was-anticipated-gates-foundation-101631617235811.html

The dreaded ministry was notorious for enforcing the Taliban’s harsh version of Sharia law, including a ban on women venturing outside their house without a male relative and prohibition on music and other forms of entertainment.A Taliban official said their main purpose is to “serve Islam”, for which a ministry of vice and virtue is needed, reported New York Post. Mohammad Yusuf, who claims to be responsible for the “central zone” of Afghanistan, told the US daily tabloid that the Taliban regime will punish the violators as per the “Islamic rules”.Yusuf explained that a murderer who has committed the crime intentionally will be killed but “if not intentional, then there might be another punishment like paying a certain amount of money.” During their earlier rule from 1996-2001, the ministry installed moral police in the streets of Afghanistan and violators were flogged, stoned, amputated and even publicly executed depending on the crime.Also Read | Taliban claims to recover $6.5 million,18 gold bricks at former Afghan VP's homeThe Taliban official said that the hands of thieves would be cut off, while those involved in “illegal intercourse” will be stoned, reported New York Post. Although stoning was mostly reserved for women, Yusuf claimed that both males and females involved in “illegal intercourse” would be executed in the same draconian manner. Yusuf further stated that four witnesses with the “same story” would be required to announce conviction in the case.“If there is a small difference in the story, there will be no punishment. But if all of them are saying the same thing, the same way and the same time, there will be punishment. The Supreme Court will overlook all these issues. If they are found guilty, then we will punish,” New York Post quoted Yusuf as saying."We just want a peaceful country with Islamic rules and regulations. Peace and Islamic rulings are the only wishes we have," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibans-feared-ministry-of-virtue-and-vice-returns-in-afghanistan-know-what-s-it-all-about-101631613997599.html
14-09-2021||World||International Day of Democracy 2021: History, significance of September 15||September 15 is celebrated as International Day of Democracy after being established in 2007 through a resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). In the words of the United Nations, “International Day of Democracy provides an opportunity to review the state of democracy in the world. Democracy is as much a process as a goal, and only with the full participation of the international community, can the ideal of democracy be made into a reality.”The International Day of Democracy owes its existence to the Universal Declaration on Democracy, which was adopted on September 15, 1997 by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), which is an international organisation of national parliaments. In the following years, Qatar led efforts to promote an International Day of Democracy. Finally, on November 8, 2007, the day was established as the UNGA adopted by consensus the resolution titled “Support by United Nations system of efforts of governments to promote and consolidate a new or restored democracies.” The IPU suggested that the occasion be celebrated on September 15 to commemorate the adoption of Universal Declaration on Democracy 10 years prior.The first such celebration took place in 2008. Every year, events take place under an individual theme. In 2020, the theme was “Covid-19: A Spotlight on Democracy,” while celebrations in 2019 took place under the theme “Participation.” From 2013 to 2016, the events took place under the taglines of “Strengthening voices for democracy,” “Engaging youth on democracy,” “Space for civil society” and “Democracy and 2030 agenda for sustainable development,” respectively, while that for 2018 was “Democracy under strain: Solutions for a changing world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-democracy-2021-history-significance-of-september-15-101631603548356.html
14-09-2021||World||Hurricane Nicholas makes landfall on the Texas coast||Hurricane Nicholas made landfall along the Texas coast on Tuesday, bringing the threat of up to 20 inches of rainfall to parts of the Gulf Coast, including the same area hit by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and storm-battered Louisiana.Nicholas touched down on the eastern part of the Matagorda Peninsula, about 10 miles (17 kilometers) west southwest of Sargent Beach, Texas, with maximum winds of 75 mph (120 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Nicholas was the 14th named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season.The storm was moving north northeast at 10 mph (17 kph) and the center of Nicholas was expected to move slowly over southeastern Texas on Tuesday and over southwestern Louisiana on Wednesday.The biggest unknown about Nicholas was how much rainfall it would produce in Texas, especially in flood-prone Houston.Nearly all of the state’s coastline was under a tropical storm warning that included potential flash floods and urban flooding. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said authorities placed rescue teams and resources in the Houston area and along the coast.In Houston, officials worried that heavy rain expected to arrive by Tuesday could inundate streets and flood homes. Authorities deployed high-water rescue vehicles throughout the city and erected barricades at more than 40 locations that tend to flood, Mayor Sylvester Turner said.“This city is very resilient. We know what we need to do. We know about preparing,” said Turner, referencing four major flood events that have hit the Houston area in recent years, including devastating damage from Harvey.Numerous school districts along the Texas Gulf Coast canceled classes Monday because of the incoming storm. The Houston school district, the state’s largest, as well as others, announced that classes would be canceled on Tuesday. The weather threat also closed multiple Covid-19 testing and vaccination sites in the Houston and Corpus Christi areas and forced the cancellation of a Harry Styles concert scheduled for Monday evening in Houston.Six to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of rain were expected along the middle and upper Texas coast, with isolated maximum amounts of 18 inches (46 centimeters) possible. Other parts of southeast Texas and south-central Louisiana and southern Mississippi could see 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) over the coming days.A tornado or two may be possible Tuesday along the upper Texas and southwest Louisiana coast, according to the weather service.“Listen to local weather alerts and heed local advisories about the right and safe thing to do, and you’ll make it through this storm just like you’ve had many other storms,” Abbott said during a news conference in Houston.Nicholas brought rain to the same area of Texas that was hit hard by Harvey. That storm made landfall in the middle Texas coast then stalled for four days, dropping more than 60 inches (152 cm) of rain in parts of southeast Texas. Harvey was blamed for at least 68 deaths, including 36 in the Houston area.After Harvey, voters approved the issuance of $2.5 billion in bonds to fund flood-control projects, including the widening of bayous. The 181 projects designed to mitigate damage from future storms are at different stages of completion.But University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said he expects that Nicholas “will be magnitudes less than Harvey in every regard.”The worry with Nicholas will be how slowly it moves. Storms are moving slower in recent decades, and Nicholas could get stuck between two other weather systems, said hurricane researcher Jim Kossin of The Climate Service.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Sunday night, ahead of the storm’s arrival in a state still recovering from Hurricane Ida and last year’s Hurricane Laura and historic flooding.“The most severe threat to Louisiana is in the southwest portion of the state, where recovery from Hurricane Laura and the May flooding is ongoing,” Edwards said.The storm was expected to bring the heaviest rainfall west of where Ida slammed into Louisiana two weeks ago.Across Louisiana, almost 120,000 customers remained without power Monday morning, according to the utility tracking site poweroutage.us.While Lake Charles received minimal impact from Ida, the city saw multiple wallops from Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta in 2020, a winter storm in February as well as historic flooding this spring.Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter said the city is taking the threat of the storm seriously, as it does all tropical systems.“Hope and prayer is not a good game plan,” Hunter said.In Cameron Parish in coastal Louisiana, Scott Trahan was still finishing repairs on his home from Hurricane Laura, which put about 2 feet of water in his house. He hopes to be finished by Christmas. He said many in his area have moved instead of rebuilding.“If you get your butt whipped about four times, you are not going to get back up again. You are going to go somewhere else,” Trahan said.Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said via Twitter that only four other years since 1966 have had 14 or more named storms by Sept. 12: 2005, 2011, 2012 and 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-nicholas-makes-landfall-on-the-texas-coast-101631604471405.html
14-09-2021||World||Joe Biden asks question on wildfires, White House cuts livestream mid-sentence||The White House abruptly cut the livestreaming of US President Joe Biden's speech in Idaho, where he met officials to discuss the wildfires that have been ravaging western United States. The incident took place when Biden was asking a question to an audience member.That person was George Geissler of the national association of state foresters."Can I ask you a question?" Biden asked."Of course," Geissler responded."One of the things that I've been working on with some others is..." the US president had spoken only this much when the feed was cut and was replaced with "Thank you for joining" message.The clip was posted on Twitter by the Republican National Committee.BIDEN: “Can I ask you a question?”*White House feed cuts out” pic.twitter.com/YQ9I9u3r98The White House has so far not responded on the issue.This is not the first time that such a thing has happened with the 78-year-old US President. The livestrem was interrupted last month when Biden was about to answer a reporter's question on American forces' withdrawal from Afghanistan.In March, Biden was attending a Democratic Party event and said he was "happy to answer" questions when the feed was cut, Fox News reported.The buzz around abrupt ending of the President's speech gained traction since Politico carried a report last week which quoted White House staffers as saying that they "mute" Biden's remarks over worries that he will veer off the scheduled agenda prepared by his office.The US President, meanwhile, used his visit to Idaho and other western states to hold out the wildfires burning across the region as an argument for his $3.5 trillion rebuilding plans. He called the year-round fires and other extreme weather a climate change reality the nation can no longer ignore.“We can't ignore the reality that these wildfires are being supercharged by climate change,” Biden said, noting that catastrophic weather doesn't strike based on partisan ideology. “It isn't about red or blue states. It's about fires. Just fires.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-asks-question-on-wildfires-white-house-cuts-livestream-midsentence-101631604227532.html
14-09-2021||World||Stuck in India: Academics allege racism on Canada’s Covid testing policy||Two Indo-Canadian academics stuck in India due to the ongoing ban on direct flights to Canada are alleging Ottawa of pursuing racism with regard to this and allied measures.Among them is Mitu Sengupta, a professor in the department of politics and public administration at Ryerson University in Toronto, who is particularly upset with the Canadian government rejecting Covid-19 RT-PCR tests conducted in India and instead mandating such molecular tests at the final point of departure for Canada for connecting flights. “It’s absurd they don’t trust the Indian Covid test. That’s an instance of blatant discrimination. This particular policy - a blanket no to Indian Covid tests does smack of racism to me. What is racism, after all? When you think a group of people are inferior to you based on something like their nationality and this is what they’re suggesting. I find that really objectionable,” she said. Mitu Sengupta is presently in Delhi.Her comments follow a letter to the editor published by the Canadian daily Toronto Star last week, in which Arun Paramekanti, professor of physics at the University of Toronto, alleged, “The prolonged Canadian government regulation to forbid direct flights from India to Canada, and to completely distrust pre-flight Covid-19 RT-PCR tests carried out in India while trusting test results from any other third country, is a racist policy which places significant burden on Canadian citizens of Indian origin.”“To ban travel from India at this stage, when nearly 80% of the eligible Canadian population (76.35% of Canadians aged 12 and older have been fully vaccinated) has been fully vaccinated, and we have far more knowledge of the disease, reeks of racism,” he claimed. Arun Paramekanti, who is in Bangalore at this point, confirmed that viewpoint while speaking to the Hindustan Times, saying such policy seemed to be “picking on India” and was “overkill and really discriminatory”.Canada opened its borders to fully-vaccinated travellers from the United States in August and earlier this month, to all fully-vaccinated visitors even if that was for discretionary reasons. Cases per thousand in America and in European nations like the United Kingdom are higher than in India.Responding to emailed queries from the Hindustan Times, a spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said, “The requirement for pre-entry molecular testing in a third country is in place so that the Covid-19 molecular test is performed after leaving a high-risk country (India in this case). In this way, the risk of the traveller being exposed to the virus and its variants in India between the time of testing and boarding the plane, which can take up to 72 hours, is reduced.”As for the high cases in the US and UK, also driven by the Delta variant, she replied that the flight ban and testing requirements were “implemented to address a consistently high number of imported cases into Canada from India. PHAC is continuing to monitor the situation.”Finally, as to the charge of racism, she said, “Canada’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic is guided by the latest science and research.”Dr S D Dwivedi, national president of the Canada India Global Forum (CIGF) isn’t convinced by these explanations, as he said the flight ban extension “was purely a political decision to insulate the government from complaints that they were irresponsible in protecting Canadians against Covid”. He added that the policy was a “sham” and the government “acted in this way with blatant disregard for actual facts, and showed no regard for the hardships faced by the Indo-Canadian community”.The flight ban and the testing regimen were put in place in April as India faced its second wave with the Delta variant causing havoc. The ban has been extended several times since then, and is in place till September 21, a day after the federal elections in Canada end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stuck-in-india-academics-allege-racism-on-canada-s-covid-testing-policy-101631600194581.html
14-09-2021||World||Justin Trudeau vs Erin O’Toole: Pollsters yet to pick a winner in Canada elections||The campaign for the 44th Federal elections in Canada has entered its final days and attacks have turned sharper as the ruling Liberal Party and the principal opposition Conservatives are locked in the closest of contests in the final week before the September 20 voting day.The difference between the two principal parties in most polling is within the margin of error but, in the last couple of days, incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did benefit from a revival of sorts, catching up with the Conservatives. Opposition leader Erin O’Toole has seen his party’s upward trajectory stall and in fact, head in the wrong direction.According to the latest data from the tracking website 338 Canada, there’s dead heat between the two parties. The Liberals have 31.9% support, just 0.3% behind the Conservatives. 338 Canada now projects that the Liberals will get 146 seats and the Conservatives 20 fewer, at 126. In either case, neither party is in a position to garner a majority, that is 170 seats in the next House of Commons.The four-year term of the House of Commons would normally have expired with elections in October 2023 but Trudeau precipitated snap elections in his quest for a majority verdict. In the 2019 federal elections, Liberals won 157 seats forming a minority government under Justin Trudeau. The Conservatives got 121 seats to emerge as the official opposition party.The tracker for CBC News points in the opposite direction with the Liberals having the same numbers but the Conservatives trailing by only 0.6%.A fresh survey from the non-partisan foundation Angus Reid Institute (ARI) on Monday underscored this trend, as it said, “New data finds the Conservative (32%) and Liberal (30%) parties in a statistical deadlock, with each garnering support from three-in-ten voters.”“The 44th federal election campaign is in its final week, with no party separating itself among Canadian voters, half of whom are saying they’re not yet fully committed to their party choice,” it added.Campaigning in Vancouver on Monday, Justin Trudeau focused on Erin O’Toole and linked the Conservatives to the anti-vaccination groups in the country. “What we need is leadership that will be unequivocal that Canadians need to get vaccinated, not leadership like Mr O’Toole who pretends that testing is equivalent to vaccination,” he said, as anti-vaxxer protests continue in the country.And as the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic also makes its presence felt, Erin O’Toole again questioned scheduling an election amid a health crisis. In the town of Carp in Ontario, Erin O’Toole said, “Every Canadian has met a Justin Trudeau in their lives - privileged, entitled and always looking out for number one. He was looking out for number one when he called this expensive and unnecessary election in the middle of a pandemic. That’s not leadership, that’s self interest.”With margins wafer-thin, the rhetoric will only become shriller till voting next Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-vs-erin-o-toole-pollsters-yet-to-pick-a-winner-in-canada-polls-101631597435767.html

14-09-2021||World||Joe Biden’s nuclear envoy tells North Korea door is open for talks||President Joe Biden’s envoy for North Korea said the door remains open for talks, after Pyongyang claimed it tested new long-range cruise missiles that bolster its nuclear strike capabilities against Japan and South Korea.“We hope the DPRK will respond positively to our multiple offers to meet without preconditions,” Sung Kim, the State Department’s special representative for North Korea, said in Tokyo on Tuesday ahead of discussions with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea. Kim was referring to North Korea by its formal name. Kim also reiterated the long-stated US position that Washington has no hostile intentions toward Pyongyang.About a day before Biden’s envoy arrived in Tokyo, North Korea said it tested new cruise missiles that flew in “pattern-8 flight orbits” for more than two hours on Saturday and Sunday, covering some 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) over land and waters off North Korea before hitting targets.The tests, if confirmed, would be North Korea’s first reported missile launches since firing off two short-range ballistic missiles in March. The new cruise missiles were designed to fly below the radar and evade defense systems, which fits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s goal of deterring a U.S.-led attack. North Korea is barred from launching ballistic missiles under United Nations resolutions, but its cruise missiles don’t face the same restrictions. Even though Biden has indicated the U.S. could offer incentives that would help North Korea’s struggling economy in return for disarmament steps, Pyongyang has shown no interest in coming back to the talks that have been stalled for about two years. Pyongyang has touted efforts to build up its tactical strike capability, with leader Kim telling a top ruling party meeting before Biden came to office in January that he was putting North Korea on a path to develop more advanced nuclear technologies and missiles. The plan included making smaller and lighter nuclear weapons, and suggested a sweeping modernization of the country’s nuclear and conventional forces. The talks in Tokyo with the three envoys come as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was due to arrive in Seoul on Tuesday on a two-day trip that includes discussions with South Korean officials on issues such as the security situation on the Korean Peninsula.   China is North Korea’s biggest benefactor, for years providing a lifeline that helped keep its neighbor’s struggling economy afloat. The Biden administration has told Beijing that it’s in its own self-interest to get Pyongyang back to the bargaining table.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-nuclear-envoy-tells-north-korea-door-is-open-for-talks-101631585633198.html
14-09-2021||World||Pakistan involved in harbouring Taliban, must 'line up’: Blinken||Pakistan has "harboured" members of the Taliban, including terrorists from the proscribed Haqqani Network, and needs to "line up" with a broad majority of the international community regarding Afghanistan, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Monday. The top diplomat said Pakistan has a "multiplicity of interests", including some that are in "clear conflict" with that of the United States, when asked about how the US sees Islamabad’s involvement in Afghanistan. Blinken, while testifying before Congress on the Taliban victory in Afghanistan, said India's involvement in Afghanistan has influenced some "detrimental" actions by Pakistan."What we have to look at is an insistence that every country, to include Pakistan, make good on the expectations that the international community has of what is required of a Taliban-led government if it's to receive any legitimacy of any kind or any support," Blinken told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "So Pakistan needs to line up with a broad majority of the international community in working toward those ends and in upholding those expectations," Blinken said.Also read | US warns Pak, says will reassess ties based on its relationship with TalibanPakistan has had deep ties with the Taliban and has been accused of supporting the group overtly and covertly. Those charges have been denied by Islamabad. Pakistan is also considered as one of the two countries, along with Qatar, with the most influence over the Taliban. It is also a place where many senior Taliban leaders were thought to have escaped to after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Former Afghan vice president Amrullah Saleh alleged earlier this month the Taliban are being micromanaged by ISI—Pakistan’s notorious intelligence agency—and that Islamabad is in charge of Afghanistan effectively as a colonial power.US lawmaker Bill Keating during the testimony reminded Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's remarks after the Taliban seized control. "Prime Minister Khan claimed Afghanistan had broken the shackles of slavery. So we used to always hear diplomatically that we have a complicated relationship with Pakistan. I would say it's often duplicitous," he said.Also read | Pakistan's poll says 55% Pakistanis are happy that Taliban seized AfghanistanHe said that Pakistan's ISI had such strong ties in cooperation with the Haqqani Network, "responsible for so many things including the deaths of some of our soldiers, and even recently when the Taliban took over in the last month".Keating asked Blinken how the US can reassess that relationship “how we, how we learn from their actions” as well as a way forward. Blinken said Pakistan is involved in "hedging its bets constantly" about the future of Afghanistan. "It's one that's involved harbouring members of the Taliban, including the Haqqanis. It's one that's also involved at different points, cooperation with us on counterterrorism, and so there are a number of things that have come into play it. It has a multiplicity of interests, some that are in conflict, clear conflict with ours," Blinken said."When it comes to Afghanistan, it's focused, of course as well, on, on India and the role that India is playing in Afghanistan, and it looks at it through that prism as well. All of these things, I think, have influenced what it has done on many occasions detrimental to our interests. On other occasions in support of those interests," Blinken added.Also read | ISI chief meets intelligence heads of China, others over Afghanistan situationThe US top diplomat said that if the Taliban want any legitimacy or any support going forward, it must ensure freedom of travel to include making good on its commitments on not allowing Afghanistan to be used as a haven for outward-directed terrorism to include upholding the basic rights of the Afghan people. Democratic Representative Joaquin Castro also called on the United States to consider removing its status as a major non-Nato ally, which gives Pakistan privileged access to US weaponry.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-involved-in-harbouring-taliban-must-line-up-blinken-101631579468773.html

The government has said it aims to increase travel to and from the nation once 80% of the adult population is fully vaccinated. Currently that rate stands at about 34%, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. Australia sets 70% Covid vaccination target to start reopeningEurope is so far the only region where so-called vaccine passports are widely used. The International Air Transport Association, which represents almost 300 airlines globally, last month urged countries around the world to adopt the European Union’s Digital Covid Certificate as the global standard for vaccine certification.

14-09-2021||World||‘Inherited a deadline, not a plan’: Blinken on US withdrawal from Afghanistan||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday insisted the Biden administration had prepared for worst-case scenarios in Afghanistan, as irate lawmakers accused the White House of presiding over a historic disaster.The famously even-tempered top US diplomat stayed cool as he faced the toughest grilling of his career at the first congressional hearing on President Joe Biden's end to the 20-year war, which brought a swift victory by the Taliban.As rival Republicans raised their voices, waved pictures of slain soldiers and occasionally demanded he resign, Blinken repeatedly noted that former president Donald Trump had set the withdrawal from Afghanistan."We inherited a deadline; we did not inherit a plan," Blinken told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.After Trump's February 2020 deal with the Taliban and drawdown of US troops, the Islamist movement was in the "strongest military position it had been since 9/11," the attacks 20 years ago that prompted America's longest war, Blinken said.Blinken said the Biden administration was "intensely focused" on the safety of Americans and had been "constantly assessing" how long the Western-backed government could survive."Even the most pessimistic assessments did not predict that government forces in Kabul would collapse while US forces remained," Blinken said."Nonetheless, we planned and exercised a wide range of contingencies," he added."The evacuation itself was an extraordinary effort -- under the most difficult conditions imaginable -- by our diplomats, by our military, by our intelligence professionals."- 'Unmitigated disaster' -Republican lawmakers, seeing a vulnerability for Biden, have portrayed the pullout as chaotic and accused the president of abandoning Americans to the fate of the Taliban."This was an unmitigated disaster of epic proportions," said Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the committee."I never thought in my lifetime that I would see an unconditional surrender to the Taliban," he added.Accusing the administration of "betrayal" of Afghan allies, McCaul pointed out that the Taliban's caretaker government included figures such as Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose arrest is sought by Washington on terrorism allegations. "We are now at the mercy of the Taliban's reign of terror," McCaul said, warning of a "dark veil of sharia law" as the Taliban reinstitute their draconian treatment of women.Republicans noted that last year's agreement with the Taliban -- signed in the presence of Blinken's predecessor Mike Pompeo -- had set conditions for the withdrawal."You can't blame the Trump administration for your failure," said Representative Greg Steube."Your administration in the White House was seeing in real time what was happening in Afghanistan and you did absolutely nothing to stop it," he said.Blinken, however, suggested that the Taliban violated the accord through their "relentless march," even as the Trump administration pressed the former Afghan government to free battle-hardened militants.Blinken said that the new administration's planning made it possible to draw down the embassy within 48 hours, and secure the airport and start evacuations within 72 hours.The United States and its allies ultimately evacuated 124,000 people out of Afghanistan, one of the largest airlifts in history.The administration says only around 100 US citizens remain and that all had been contacted repeatedly by US diplomats, with some leaving after the withdrawal in line with promises by the Taliban.Blinken said there was "no evidence that staying longer would have made the Afghan security forces or the Afghan government any more resilient or self-sustaining.""If 20 years and hundreds of billions of dollars in support, equipment and training did not suffice, why would another year, another five, another 10?"Representative Gregory Meeks, the Democrat who led the committee, accused Republicans of having been silent when Trump and Pompeo pursued the same policies on Afghanistan."Disentangling ourselves from Afghanistan was never going to be easy," Meeks said."I would welcome hearing what exactly a smooth withdrawal from a messy, chaotic 20-year war looks like," he said. "I don't believe one exists."sct/sw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inherited-a-deadline-not-a-plan-blinken-on-us-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-101631575205462.html

It is one that's also involved in different points cooperation with us on counterterrorism," Blinken said.Asked by lawmakers if it is time for Washington to reassess its relationship with Pakistan, Blinken said the administration would soon be doing that."This is one of the things we're going to be looking at in the days, and weeks ahead - the role that Pakistan has played over the last 20 years but also the role we would want to see it play in the coming years and what it will take for it to do that," he said.The United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan culminated with a hastily organized airlift that left thousands of US-allied Afghans behind and was punctuated by a suicide bombing outside Kabul's airport that killed 13 US troops and scores of Afghans.The United States and Western countries are in a difficult balancing act in the aftermath of the Taliban's victory - reluctant to recognize the Islamist group while accepting the reality that they will have to engage with them to prevent a looming humanitarian crisis.Pakistan has had deep ties with the Taliban and has been accused of supporting the group as it battled the US-backed government in Kabul for 20 years - charges denied by Islamabad.It is also considered as one of the two countries, along with Qatar, with the most influence over the Taliban, and a place where many senior Taliban leaders were thought to have escaped to after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-pak-says-will-reassess-ties-based-on-its-relationship-with-taliban-101631574506704.html

14-09-2021||India||SC rejects plea over aid to kin of lawyers who died due to Covid||The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a petition seeking compensation for lawyers who died of COVID-19 as bogus and imposed cost of ₹10,000 on the lawyer who filed the public interest litigation (PIL) terming it as publicity interest litigation.The PIL filed by advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav demanded ₹50 lakh compensation for family of lawyers aged less than 60 years who died due to COVID-19 or any other reasons.Not willing to make an exception for lawyers, the bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna said, “Just because you wear a black coat does not mean that your life is precious than others…A lot of people died due to COVID-19, you cannot be an exception.”Dismissing the petition with a cost of ₹10,000, the bench held, “We see no reason to make an exception for members of the bar who suffered from COVID.” On a plain reading of the petition, the bench said that the lawyer had done a “copy and paste” job as none of the grounds mentioned in the petition were relevant to the issue raised in the petition. “In the present circumstances, we dismiss the petition with a cost of ₹10,000 to be payable within a period of one week from today.”The bench was of the view that time had come to stop lawyers from approaching the Court with bogus PILs.Advocate Yadav sought permission from the Court to withdraw the Court and file a better petition. The bench said, “This is publicity interest litigation. It can’t be that lawyers keep filing PILs and demand compensation from judges in the hope they will allow.” The bench pointed out that another bench of the Supreme Court on June 30 had held that all persons who died due to COVID will be entitled to compensation under the National Disaster Management Act 2005.The PIL had made the Centre, Bar Council of India and Supreme Court Bar Association as parties to the petition demanding that in times of pandemic, additional monetary help should be provided to surviving families of lawyers who were the sole earning member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-plea-over-aid-to-kin-of-lawyers-who-died-due-to-covid-101631642978371.html

After going through the material, AG Venugopal said, “The allegations made by Ajeet Bharti against the Supreme Court are, among other things, of bribery, favouritism, nepotism and abuse of power... I find that the contents of the video, which has been watched by about 1.7 lakh viewers, are vituperative, gross and are highly derogatory to the Supreme Court of India and the judiciary as a whole, being clearly intended to denigrate the courts.”He proceeded on the basis that the video is authentic and said, “I have no hesitation in granting my consent for the initiation of contempt proceedings against Mr Ajeet Bharti based on the contents of the video posted by him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attorney-general-gives-consent-for-contempt-against-derogatory-video-against-sc-judges-101631642557838.html

In her opening statement at the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday, Bachelet had criticised restrictions on public assembly and frequent communication blackouts in Jammu and Kashmir. Responding to the statement, secretary (West) Reenat Sandhu of the external affairs ministry said India’s approach to global promotion and protection of human rights is based on “our own experience as a pluralistic and inclusive society and vibrant democracy”. She added, “We believe that promotion and protection of human rights are best pursued through dialogue, consultation and cooperation among states and through the provision of technical assistance and capacity building.” Pointing to the references to India in Bachelet’s statement, Sandhu expressed India’s “disappointment over her unwarranted remarks on the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which do not reflect the ground reality”. “Any shortcomings in upholding human rights must be addressed in a transparent and impartial manner, anchored in respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs of states,” Sandhu said. India’s Constitution enshrines basic human rights as fundamental rights, and the Parliament, independent judiciary, media and civil society ensure full enjoyment of human rights by the people, she said. As part of a development agenda, the Indian government has undertaken targeted policy measures to empower the most vulnerable segments of society and had followed this approach despite challenges posed by the Covid-19 to save lives and livelihoods, she added. Sandhu also referred to the situation in Afghanistan and said it continues to be of grave concern. The UN Security Council resolution 2593 should guide the world community’s approach to Afghanistan as it reaffirms the importance of upholding human rights, including those of women, children and minorities, allowing safe passage for those wanting to leave the country and ensuring unhindered access for humanitarian aid. “The international community must stand with the people of Afghanistan in their desire to live in peace and dignity,” she said. Sandhu also said India is seeking re-election to the UN Human Rights Council for 2022-24, and looks forward to the continued support of member states for its candidature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unwarranted-remarks-india-rejects-un-rights-chief-s-criticism-of-situation-in-kashmir-101631639857814.html

Additional sessions judge Shailesh Sharma convicted Shekhar Korram (28) under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, special public prosecutor Parvez Akhtar said.The special court, notified under the POCSO Act, delivered its verdict on Monday. Its details were, however, made available on Tuesday.Apart from the death penalty, the court also sentenced the 28-year-old to rigorous imprisonment for seven years each under IPC sections 363 (kidnapping) and 201 (causing disappearance of the offence), and 10 years under IPC section 366 (kidnapping or abducting a woman to compel her for marriage or to cause her defilement), the prosecutor said. “The offence is of a heinous nature and the accused deserves no leniency. The accused has committed a crime which brings shame to humanity. There is no possibility of any reformation and rehabilitation of the accused in the society,” sessions judge Sharma said in his verdict.Punishing the accused with such harsh punishment will strengthen the faith of society and the relatives of the deceased on the court, and in future, those who commit such heinous crimes will not be spared under any circumstances,” the court said. On August 22, 2020, the accused abducted the girl, a resident of his native village in Rajnandgaon district, while she was playing near her house. The man took the girl to his house, where he raped her and later smothered her to death with a pillow cover, the prosecutor said.

14-09-2021||India||Karnataka HC dismisses PIL against privatisation of Mangaluru airport||Karnataka High Court on Tuesday dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) filed against the privatization of Mangaluru International Airport. The state-run airport operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), was taken over by the Adani Group on October 31 and has commenced commercial operations there. The PIL filed by the Airports Authority Employees Union had sought to quash a 2019 cabinet decision approving the leasing of three airports including the one at Mangaluru, terming the same as “illegal, arbitrary and beyond the scope of the Airport Authority Act, 1994.” A Division Bench of Acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum however said that since the leasing Mangaluru airport was done based on a Government of India policy, there was no scope for the HC’s intervention. In 2018, the Union government had announced an in-principle approval for leasing out six airports in India —Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram, and Mangaluru Airports through Public-Private Partnership (PPP). Adani groups, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Ltd, was the highest bidder, the Union government announced later. The bench’s order copy is awaited. Senior Advocate Ashok Haranahalli, appearing for the petitioners, referred to Section 12 of the Airports Authority of India Act and argued there was no revenue sharing with the government and that the entire fixation of the lease is on per passenger fee. He added that even though it is called a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project, there is no revenue generated for the formulation of a PPP partnership. “The airport is given to a third party, which is not in consonance with the policy of Public-Private Partnership model. This is not a partnership but just giving away,” Haranahalli submitted. Additional Solicitor General MB Nargund, appearing for the Union government, said that a branch of the same petitioner union had filed a plea before the Kerala High Court, which was rejected. The present petition is thus not maintainable, it was contended. Meanwhile, on Saturday, following protests, the tag ‘Adani airports’ was removed from the name boards of the Mangaluru International Airport. Following the takeover of operation on October 31, the logo of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) was replaced with the Advani groups logo. Changes were also made on Google Map where it was listed as ‘Mangaluru International Airport by Adani Airports’. A reply received under the Right to Information (RTI) also revealed that there was no provision to change the airport name as per the agreement for operations and maintenance of the airport. A legal notice was served in March this year to the AAI and the MIA director questioning the ‘Adani’ tag attached to the name boards based on this RTI reply by activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-hc-dismisses-pil-against-privatisation-of-mangaluru-airport-101631636318966.html

It is clear that the BJP is scared of our increasing popularity. Our leaders want peace and so we have deferred our programme to September 22,” TMC leader Kunal Ghosh said on Tuesday.Ghosh said if the police declines them permission again, the TMC will go to court.Inspector General of Police ( Law and Order) Arindam Lodh said, “There is Viswakarma puja on September 17 here. The puja is celebrated here in grand way and preparations for the puja, like, buying idols etc., will be on September 16. And police will be busy in looking after law and order. So, the permission was not given for conducting any political activity on that day.”He also said that the Trinamool Congress has applied for their programme on September 22. “ We will convey our decision to them soon, “ he said. The ruling BJP defended the police decision, accusing the TMC of planning to create unrest in the state by bringing people from Kachhar, Karimganj, Silchar in Assam for the roadshow.Ghosh trashed the allegation, insisting that the TMC had enough supporters in Tripura and didn’t need to bring people from outside.The roadshow, the first big ticket event planned by the Trinamool Congress in Tripura, was seen to indicate the opposition party’s effort to scale up its campaign pitch ahead of the 2023 state elections.Already, Trinamool leaders claim that the TMC, and not the CPM had emerged as the lead opposition party in the state. The CPM is silent over public issues and former chief minister Manik Sarkar could not enter his own constituency, Dhanpur in these three and half years, said Susmita Dev who quit the Congress in August and joined the TMC. On Tuesday, Dev was named as the TMC candidate for the Rajya Sabha elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-cops-decline-permission-for-abhishek-banerjee-s-roadshow-again-says-tmc-101631633016284.html

Humans of Bombay, which catalogues stories of humanity and journey of individuals, shared an inspiring story of that person on the occasion of Hindi Diwas.Hindi was the favourite subject of Raju Jangid, the carpenter-turned-Wikipedia editor who wanted to pursue a career in writing. In his own words, Jangid worked till 9pm every day and earned ₹7,000 a month to support his family but the thought of working as a carpenter for the rest of his life made him sad.Once, Jangid watched a Bollywood movie and wanted to read about it afterwards. He took his sister-in-law’s phone and ended up finding Wikipedia. Everytime he searched for other topics or people, Google threw a Wikipedia page most of the time. But Jangid couldn’t read English and wondered why the online encyclopedia isn’t available in Hindi when a majority of Indians, according to him, speak the language.“There wasn’t a page about my village either. That’s when I thought, ‘Mujhe likhna chahiye!’ (I should write) I wrote about my village and with every story, my reach increased to those who were more comfortable with Hindi! I also began editing Wiki pages and made them more resourceful. To see my words published online made me want to write more!” Humans of Bombay quoted Jangid as saying.Also Read: Hindi Diwas: Lyricists talk about the evolution of Hindi in Bollywood musicGradually, the boy from Rajasthan started writing on different topics in Hindi, including history and cricket, that helped him educate himself. As Jangid’s monthly income increased, he used to save some amount to resume his high school education. He continued to write after passing board exams and made friends with other online editors.“When Wikipedia learnt about my challenges back home, they provided me with my own laptop and a free internet connection! They told me, ‘Thank you for keeping Hindi alive and inspiring other Hindi writers too’,” he said, adding that Wikipedia also paid for his graduation studies.He finally decided to quit carpentry and got a job as a writer in 2017. Jangid has now a steady income and has made at least 57,000 edits on Wikipedia.“And now whenever I mentor writers to contribute their work in Hindi, I always say, ‘If one’s mother tongue is forgotten, one’s value will also be forgotten’,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindi-diwas-how-love-for-language-bollywood-helped-carpenter-become-wikipedia-editor-101631632005836.html

As many as 27 wings of the defence ministry, including a navy station INS India, the Armed Forces Clinic and a medical wing of the armed forces have been operating from these hutments for several decades.On September 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the new defence ministry office complex at Africa Avenue, paving the way for the relocation to begin, said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named.“The shifting of offices will free 50 acres of land for Central Vista development. The defence ministry will vacate 9.2 lakh square feet of space in these hutments and take up 9.6 lakh square feet in two new multi-storeyed complexes that are spread over a total area of 13 acres,” said a second official. The complex at Africa Avenue is scattered across four blocks and offers a space of 5.08 lakh square feet while the KG Marg set up has three blocks and an office area of 4.52 lakh square feet.The new office complexes have been constructed at a cost of ₹775 crore provided by the defence ministry, with the work carried out by the ministry of housing and urban affairs as part of the Central Vista project, the second official said. The two complexes together have parking space for 1,500 cars. Instead of being spread out in various hutments and old buildings (A, B, E, G, H, J, L& M Block, Plot No 30 and Plot No.108 and Jodhpur House), co-location of these buildings will ensure greater efficiency and working, he said. The new buildings will also provide modern amenities, connectivity and welfare facilities like canteens and banks. The construction of the new complexes did not involve uprooting of trees, he added.According to the Central Vista plan approved by the Centre, the North and South Block office complexes will be turned into national museums, the Indira Gandhi National Centre will be relocated, and the National Archives will be remodelled. The Prime Minister’s residence will be shifted behind the existing South Block complex while the residence of the Vice President is proposed to be relocated behind North Block.On June 30, HT reported the vice president’s enclave and the new Parliament House will be the first buildings to be completed, and work on shifting the national museum to the North and South Block will commence last, in the elaborate plan for the Central Vista revamp that requires moving people and offices over the course of the next six years....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-revamp-7-000-defence-ministry-officials-to-move-to-new-offices-101631631338663.html

From the peak of the second wave in April-May, the cases have been brought under control and vaccination coverage increased. But despite this, many restrictions have still not been lifted.This includes the ban on international flights. And the chief executive office (CEO) of low-cost carrier IndiGo feels that it would be impractical to restart scheduled international flights right now.Ronojoy Dutta said on Tuesday that gradually increasing the number of air bubble flights with various countries is the way forward."I think this process of 'let's have more and more bubble flights' and increasing it slowly is a good graduated way of opening up. We did it domestically also, right? We started from 33 per cent, went to 50 and then further. So, a graduated approach is a good approach," he told news agency PTI.Dutta said it is not up to India to unilaterally open up scheduled international flights and the other countries have to agree."There are, of course, health concerns, which I won't minimise in any way. Different countries are on different points of managing Covid-19. Then all these testing issues are sort of confusing the passengers," he added.The central government last month extended the suspension on international scheduled commercial flights till September 30 in the face of a looming threat of the third wave of infection.In its circular, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said that scheduled international flights might be allowed on selected routes on a case-to-case basis.The Indian government banned international commercial flights since March 23, 2020, to check the spread of the Covid-19 infection. It eased the restrictions on flights in certain countries with which India has had an air bubble arrangement during the past year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restarting-international-flights-indigo-ceo-suggests-correct-way-forward-101631628581692.html

14-09-2021||India||World taking note of India’s defence manufacturing prowess: PM Modi in Aligarh||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said India is shedding its image of being a major importer of military hardware and carving an identity for itself as a defence exporter, at a time the government has taken several measures to boost self-reliance in the key sector as well as tap the potential of defence markets globally.The PM said the world had taken note of the strides made by the country in defence manufacturing with locally produced equipment ranging from modern grenades, assault rifles and drones to fighter jets and warships. The PM made the comments during a ceremony to lay the foundation stone of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University at Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh.Aligarh, once famous for its locks and lock-making skills (a fact acknowledged by the PM during his speech), is one of the six nodes of the UP’s government’s ambitious defence industrial corridor project aimed at boosting indigenous defence production and the Make in India initiative. The other five nodes in the state are Agra, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Kanpur and Lucknow. In the Aligarh Node, land has so far been allotted to 19 firms who will together invest ₹1,245 crore. The Centre has also set up a defence corridor in Tamil Nadu.India is wooing foreign partners to invest in the defence corridors for co-development and co-production of equipment.The PM said the hundreds of crores of rupees being invested in the Aligarh node will create thousands of jobs. He said the new industries coming up to support the manufacture of small arms, armaments, drones and aerospace-related products would give a new identity to Aligarh and its nearby areas.Also Read | India-UK to sign early harvest deal by March 2022The defence industrial corridors will go a long way in creating much-needed manufacturing hubs in the country that will further help India’s transition from a weapons importer to exporter, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“These corridors, along with other steps taken to boost self-reliance, will not only provide fillip to the Make in India initiative but also create an ecosystem that will allow us to strengthen our position as an exporter globally,” Chopra said.The PM’s comments come at a time when the domestic defence sector is poised for big leaps in several areas including fighter jets, helicopters, airborne early warning systems, missiles, drones and other weaponry.State-run plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has set a March 2022 deadline to carry out the first flight of the LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jet. The defence ministry awarded a ₹48,000-crore contract to HAL for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF) in February. The first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the air force by March 2024, with the rest slated to join its combat fleet by 2029.Earlier this month, the PM-headed Cabinet Committee of Security (CCS) cleared two big Make in India projects worth ₹33,000 crore. It cleared the much-delayed purchase of 56 C-295 medium transport aircraft to replace the IAF’s ageing fleet of Avro-748 planes. The C-295 project is estimated to be worth ₹22,000 crore.It also cleared a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) proposal to develop new airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft for the IAF using Airbus jets bought from Air India. This project is estimated to be worth around ₹11,000 crore.Last week, the IAF inducted a medium range surface-to-air-missile (MRSAM) system capable of knocking out aerial threats such as enemy fighter jets, missiles, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles at a range of 70 km. India and Israel have jointly developed the MRSAM or the Barak 8 air defence system.Last month, the Indian Army accepted the delivery of the first batch of multi-mode hand grenades manufactured by a private sector firm. The defence ministry signed a contract with Nagpur-based private firm Economic Explosives Ltd (EEL) last October for supplying 1 million hand grenades to the army. These will replace a World War-II vintage hand grenade design being used by the army.The government has taken several measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector over the last two years. These include raising foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence manufacturing, creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware and notifying two lists of 209 defence items that cannot be imported (ban to be implemented progressively from 2021 to 2025).The items that cannot be imported include AEW&C systems (Airborne early warning and control systems, light combat aircraft, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, long-range land attack cruise missiles, basic trainer aircraft, specified types of helicopters and artillery guns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-taking-note-of-india-s-defence-manufacturing-prowess-pm-modi-in-aligarh-101631621735478.html

He also said that a decision regarding the price of the vaccine is currently ongoing and would be taken soon.“The discussion on its pricing is ongoing, a decision will be taken soon. We are looking to include this vaccine in the national vaccination program,” news agency ANI quoted Dr Paul as saying regarding the ZyCoV-D vaccine.Currently, Covishield manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccines are being used in India for immunisation against the Covid-19 pandemic.Also read | Booster dose of Covid-19 vaccines not needed yet, says review in LancetThe comments from Dr Paul came as the needle-free ZyCoV-D vaccine is expected to be available by early October. The vaccine is based on the plasmid DNA technology and follows a three-dose regimen with a 28-day gap between each dose. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) gave its nod to the vaccine earlier on August 20. It is also India’s first indigenously developed vaccine and is also the first vaccine in the country that has received emergency use authorisation (EUA) for being administered in the 12 to 18 age group.Further, the company has also planned to seek approval for a two-dose regimen of its vaccine due to the burden on healthcare and the cost factor of three doses. Previously, 2mg of the vaccine would be prescribed in three doses each but now the company is planning to administer 3mg of the vaccine in two doses each, according to a report by ANI.Earlier in June, the Union government had capped the price of all the three vaccines, currently being used in the country’s vaccination drive, at private hospitals. It directed the private hospitals to charge a maximum of ₹150 as service charge for administering the vaccines. Inclusive of the service charge, the maximum price that can be charged for a dose of Covishield vaccine would be ₹780, ₹1,410 for a dose of Covaxin and ₹1,145 for a dose of Sputnik V.Meanwhile, more than 750 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the country, of which over 7.8 million doses were administered in the last 24 hours. As of 7am on Tuesday, 752,238,324 doses have been administered, the Union ministry of health and family welfare said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plans-afoot-to-add-zycov-d-covid-19-vaccine-to-national-vaccination-programme-says-dr-vk-paul-101631616739363.html
14-09-2021||India||Hunt for Tiger that killed youngster in Karnataka’s Hunsur intensifies||The hunt for a Tiger in the Nagarhole National Park in Mysore has intensified after it killed a 19-year-old from a tribal community on September 8 in Hunsur, Karnataka forest officials said.The Tiger, possibly aged between 3 and 4 years, is believed to be on the prowl in the range and at least 50 personnel are trying to track its movements using various tools including 70 camera traps and thermal drones that have managed to take pictures of other animals in the area but not of the predator responsible for killing the teenager from the Jenu Kuruba community, a forest dweller tribe, officials said.“We are trying to collect data from the ground and three are no signs of the individual (Tiger) which was involved in the conflict. We are getting signs and data from other individuals (Tigers),” D Mahesh Kumar, deputy conservator of forests and director, Karnataka forest department told Hindustan Times on Tuesday.There has been an increase in human-animal conflict in Karnataka mainly since animals are getting pushed out of their territory due to encroachments for farming and other purposes. According to the forest department data, 17,561 human-animal conflicts took place in the state in 2020-21 compared to 16,314 in 2019-20. At least 434 cases of Tigers attacking cattle or humans were also reported in 2020-21, a 37% increase from 316 such encounters in 2019-20, as per the data, which puts the figure of loss of human lives in these two years at least nine.Wild animals straying into human settlements, agricultural lands and plantations in search of food outside the forest is also a major reason for growing conflicts.With 524 Tigers estimated to be in Karnataka following the last official count, the state has the second largest population of these majestic big cats spread over forest ranges such as Bandipur, Nagarhole, Biligiri Ranganatha Swamy Temple (BRT) and Bhadra among other reserves.According to a Right to Information (RTI) response by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the National Tiger Conservation Authority on September 3 to a Kerala-based activist, RK Govindan Nampoothiry, ₹50 lakh was paid as compensation for deaths caused by tiger attacks in Karnataka between 2014 and 2020. Maharashtra with ₹998.20 lakh followed by ₹169 lakh in Uttar Pradesh and ₹128.53 lakh in Madhya Pradesh topped the compensation amount for deaths caused by tigers during that period.This March, a tiger was found dead in Karnataka’s coffee growing district of Kodagu after it had killed four and critically injured at least one other person apart from killing at least 25 cattle.On February 21, the forest department captured a Tigress lurking in the locality.A 2018 report titled, Status of Tigers, Co-predators & Prey in India, shows that only around 1923 of these big-cats live within the reserves while around 35% of them live outside the protected forests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hunt-for-tiger-that-killed-youngster-in-karnataka-s-hunsur-intensifies-101631616320292.html

Jalpaiguri has been the epicentre, with majority of the cases being reported from the district.Hindustan Times' sister publication HT Bangla reported that a six-year-old died due to fever. It quoted doctors as saying that the young one was brought from Mekhliganj on Monday and reported breathing difficulty along with symptoms of pneumonia.At least 130 children has been admitted to Jalpaiguri Sadar Hospital with high fever and dysentery, a health department official said on Monday.The development came amid warning by experts that the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic might pose a greater risk to children."We are keeping a tab on the situation and trying to develop the hospital's infrastructure so that no one is denied admission. The situation is quite worrisome," the official told news agency PTI.Two of these children were later shifted to North Bengal Medical College as their condition worsened, the official further said.District Magistrate Moumita Godara Basu, who also visited the hospital, held back-to-back meetings with authorities to assess the situation and find a way ahead.Meanwhile, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Monday wrote to all states and union territories (UTs) for accelerating activities for prevention and control of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and calling for sustained efforts to reduce the vector density to control these diseases.He emphasised that rapid response teams should be kept ready with all necessary logistics. "Entomological surveillance, source reduction activities and prompt vector control measures must be implemented for minimising the risk of transmission," Bhushan said in his letter.The Union Health Secretary also said that a multi-sectoral approach is necessary for controlling the vector-borne diseases. The role of departments other than health, such as urban and rural development and panchayati raj, is crucial, said the Union health secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/child-dies-of-fever-in-north-bengal-s-jalpaiguri-130-in-hospital-101631614028220.html
14-09-2021||India||Another senior Kerala Congress leader quits to join CPI(M)||Another senior Kerala Congress leader KP Anil Kumar, who was suspended from the party for criticising the state leadership in public, resigned and joined the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) CPI(M) on Tuesday. Announcing his decision in Thiruvananthapuram, Kumar, also a former Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) general secretary, said most of the present office-bearers of the state unit behaved in an “authoritarian” manner. He also made some other serious allegations against state Congress president K Sudhakaran. Later, CPI(M) politburo member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan inducted Kumar at the party headquarters at AKG Centre. Soon after Kumar’s press conference, the PCC chief said Kumar had been expelled from the party and the CPI(M) was similar to a “waste bin” collecting disgruntled leaders from other parties. Earlier, another expelled Congress leader PS Prashant had joined the CPI(M). Dissension was simmering in the state unit of the Congress party after the elevation of new leadership and it came to a boil after the announcement of district Congress presidents on August 28. Anil Kumar and another senior leader K Sivadasan Nair then criticised the state leadership during a discussion on a news channel, resulting in their suspension. After announcing his resignation, Kumar said the Congress had lost direction and it was in the wrong hands in the state. “We have a PCC president who threatened to join the Sangh Parivar outfits on a number of occasions. I never tried to pressurise the party like this. Disciplinary action should be applicable to all,” he said. Even former CM Oommen Chandy and senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala had expressed their displeasure publicly over the new appointments but no action was taken against them, he alleged. “I have a 42-year-old relationship with the party. Hailing from a freedom fighter’s family, I used to attend party programmes at a tender age of eight. I faced many sacrifices for the party but no point in continuing in the party,” Kumar said. Sudhakaran, however, denied the allegations made by Kumar saying it was natural for an expelled leader to make such wild charges. Opposition leader VD Satheesan also decried his statement. The latest round of infighting in the Kerala Congress began with the appointment of K Sudhakaran, a tough leader from Communist heartland of Kannur, as PCC chief and VD Satheesan, a grassroots leader, as the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly.The move sidelined two powerful blocs, led by former CM Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala, who dominated the state unit for more than a decade-and-a-half. The announcement of new district presidents added to the internal conflict, but more fireworks are expected when the list of PCC office-bearers is announced, as the new PCC president is expected to prune the jumbo committee. The party has 150-odd secretaries and many other office-bearers now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-senior-kerala-congress-leader-quits-to-join-cpim-101631613155578.html

The bench said, “This is publicity interest litigation. It can’t be that lawyers keep filing PILs and demand compensation from judges in the hope they will allow.” The bench pointed out that another bench of the Supreme Court on June 30 had held that all persons who died due to Covid will be entitled to compensation under the National Disaster Management Act 2005.The PIL had made the Centre, Bar Council of India and Supreme Court Bar Association as parties to the petition demanding that in times of pandemic, additional monetary help should be provided to surviving families of lawyers who were the sole earning member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-pil-for-covid-compensation-to-lawyers-101631610275067.html
14-09-2021||India||Delayed by Covid, NATGRID likely to be implemented soon. Check details||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to launch the National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID), which will enhance India's capabilities to fight terror and crime through technology. The NATGRID was mooted after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks in 2008.News agency PTI reported that final "synchronisation and testing" of the ambitious electronic database is going on after which it is expected to go live.Union home minister Amit Shah had said earlier this month that NATGRID was delayed due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. "I am hopeful that the Prime Minister will dedicate NATGRID to the country in some time," Shah had said during the 51st Foundation Day event of the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) on September 4.What it NATGRID?It is a master database of 21 databases designed to provide real-time information to fight terror and crime. According to people aware of the matter, NATGRID will include data related to credit and debit cards, tax, telecom, immigration, airlines and railway tickets, passports, driving licenses.It has been envisaged as a robust mechanism to track suspects and prevent terrorist attacks with real-time data and access to classified information.How will NATGRID work?The NATGRID will involve high-end algorithms designed especially for the database. The programme has been designed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and will be capable of analysing data and behaviour to generate trends and leads for the agencies to follow up.The Union Cabinet cleared the NATGRID in 2011 and allocated ₹3,400 crore for it but the work slowed down after 2012. PM Modi, who came to power for the first time in 2014, later gave directions for its revival.Who will have access to NATGRID?PTI reported that 10 central agencies - including the Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing, the Enforcement Directorate and Department of Revenue Intelligence - and 21 service providers will be connected with the the master database in the first phase. In later phases, about 950 additional organisations will be brought on board, it further reported.The government finally plans to integrate more than 1,000 organisations in NATGRID, the news agency said.According to PTI, other agencies that are expected to be integrated in the programme are Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, Cabinet Secretariat, Directorate General of GST Intelligence, Narcotics Control Bureau, Financial Intelligence Unit and the National Investigation Agency.26/11 and NATGRIDThe 26/11 terrorist siege in Mumbai back in 2008 exposed the deficiency that security agencies had no mechanism to look for vital information on a real-time basis.Lack of quick information was considered to be one of the major hurdles in detecting David Headley's movement across the country during his multiple visits between 2006 and 2009.Headley had provided key information and videos of terror targets to Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba that carried out the Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, including foreigners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delayed-by-covid-natgrid-likely-to-be-implemented-soon-check-details-101631609979429.html

We have to be aatmanirbhar even with languages and only then our imagination of Aatmanirbhar India will be fulfilled. If we don't become aatmanirbhar in terms of our language, self-reliance would not mean anything," Amit Shah said while addressing a gathering on the occasion of Hindi Diwas. "If the Prime Minister can speak Hindi on international fora, what are we embarrassed about? Gone are the days when speaking in Hindi was a matter of embarrassment,’’ Amit Shah said.He also said that all Indian languages complement each other. "When we accepted the Constitution, we also accepted a decision on September 14, 1949, that this country's rajbhasha will be Hindi and the script will be Devanagri... Along with Hindi, we also took a decision to accept regional languages," Amit Shah said.

"There are allegations of adverse impact on the industrial units, seriously affecting more than 9000 micro, medium and large companies. Allegedly transportation is also adversely impacted, causing the commuters, patients, physically challenged people and senior citizens to suffer due to the heavy congestion on roads," the NHRC stated in the notice. It also took note of reports that people have to travel long distances to reach their destination due to the ongoing farmers' agitation and barricades that have been put on the borders."Since the agitation involves the issue of human rights, the right to agitate in a peaceful manner is also to be respected. The commission needs to take care of various human rights issues," it stated in the letter as it also asked for action taken reports from chief secretaries of the respective state governments, director generals of police and commissioner of police.Since November last year, farmers from Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan have been protesting against the three central laws that opened the agriculture sector to the private players of the country. Agitating farmers say the laws, introduced in September 2020, would erode a longstanding mechanism that ensures farmers a minimum guaranteed price for their produce but the government says this will help growers get better prices.Over the months, the Union government has had several rounds of discussions but they have failed to bring any resolution to the impasse, as farmers remain firm on their demands of complete repeal of laws.The NHRC has also asked the Institute of Economic Growth to examine the adverse impact of the farmers' agitation on industrial and commercial activities, production and disruption of transport services on commercial and normal consumers including inconvenience and additional expenditure etc. The institute has given a deadline of October 10 to send the report.It has also directed the Delhi School of Social Work of Delhi University to conduct a survey and assess the disruption of livelihood, lives of people impacted due to the agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-seeks-reports-from-centre-4-states-over-farmers-stir-says-industries-and-people-are-suffering-101631603786715.html

We have to fight together all the forces that are against development here,” PM Modi said.Taking a swipe at the opposition Samajwadi Party (SP), which was in power here from 2017, the Prime Minister said that people cannot forget the scams that took place before the BJP came to power. He also pointed to “lawlessness” that prevailed while the SP was in power. “However, with Yogiji in power, criminals think twice before committing a crime,” PM Modi said.He made these remarks while laying the foundation stone of a university named after Jat king Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh in Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh.

PM Modi then announced ₹9000 crore for the development of BrahMos missile at the defence corridor's Lucknow node.The Prime Minister's visit to Aligarh is being seen as the launch by the ruling  BJP of its campaign for the upcoming assembly elections in the country's most populous state, likely to take place early next year.UP governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma were among dignitaries who attended the ceremony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lays-foundation-stone-of-raja-mahendra-pratap-singh-university-in-up-s-aligarh-101631599978032.html

14-09-2021||India||5 challenges for joint committee on Personal Data Protection Bill||The Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 will be meeting on Wednesday and Thursday to finalise its long-pending report. This will be the first meeting under the leadership of PP Chaudhary.The committee was formed in 2019 to deliberate on the nuances of the data protection legislation.Five members, including chairperson Meenakshi Lekhi, were inducted into the Council of Ministers in July this year. Following this, PP Chaudhary took over.Here are some key considerations for the committee while formulating the data protection legislation: Limitations to govt control and access of public data While some national security concerns may require the state to access and maintain records of public data, it is important that the Bill does not make the citizens’ right to privacy secondary to the nation’s security interests. A deliberate elevation of the nation’s security over the right to privacy will vest power with the government to collect and use public data as it deems fit. Effective limitations on giant firms The Cambridge Analytica data breach row saw the Central Bureau of Investigation file a case against the British data analytics firm for allegedly accessing and misusing the personal data of 562,000 Indian Facebook users in 2018. The firm allegedly used the data to influence elections in India. Thus, ensuring effective regulations on data mining strategies of giant corporations must be a key focus of the legislation. Also Read | China passes robust legislation on data protectionCentrality to citizens’ right to privacyAny legislation on data privacy and protection must be premised on the Supreme Court’s 2017 judgement regarding right to privacy. In August 2017, a nine-judge Constitution Bench of the apex court ruled that right to privacy is “intrinsic to life and liberty” and thus, is inherently protected under the various fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Indian Constitution. The government should strike a balance between personal data protection and the nation’s national security interests. Preventing cyber attacks and surveillanceIndia reported 1.16 million cyber security cases in 2020, that’s 3 times more than those of 2019, as per government data presented in Parliament. Recently, allegations over the usage of Pegasus spyware for surveillance by several governments have also surfaced. In India, it is unclear whether the spyware was deployed by the Centre or if it was used by a secondary entity. The Bill must take into consideration data security and privacy risks posed by such modern surveillance technologies. Focus on proactive implementation The committee must identify potential challenges in the implementation of the legislation, and incorporate specific strategies to target the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-challenges-for-joint-committee-on-personal-data-protection-bill-101631599834503.html

M Visvesvaraya is considered one of the foremost nation-builders, creating marvels upon which modern India was built. He was referred as the ‘precursor of economic planning in India’, according to the Institution of Engineers India (IEI). M Visvesvaraya is also known as ‘VM Sir’ due to his various contributions to the field of engineering and being a pioneer of education.Born on September 15, 1861, in a small village called Muddenahalli in Karnataka, Visvesvaraya received a degree in civil engineering from Pune College of Engineering. His expertise was in the fields of irrigation and flood disaster management. He rose to fame with his groundbreaking works in these fields with modern irrigation techniques as well as flood control and mitigation.He designed the ‘automatic barrier water floodgates’ which was installed in Pune in 1903 at the Khadakvasla reservoir. He was the chief engineer responsible for the construction of the Krishna Raja Sagar dam in the Mandya district of Karnataka and the chief engineer of the flood protection system for Hyderabad. He also established the famous Government Engineering College, now known as University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering in 1917.He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the British Indian Empire (KCIE) by King George V for his contributions towards public good. M Visvesvaraya received India’s highest honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 1955.Greeting engineers on Engineers Day last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “…We remember Sir M. Visvesvaraya on his Jayanti. India is proud of the contribution of our engineers towards nation building." In 2019, PM Modi said engineers are synonymous with diligence and determination. "Human progress would be incomplete without their innovative zeal. Greetings on #EngineersDay and best wishes to all hardworking engineers. Tributes to the exemplary engineer Sir M. Visvesvaraya on his birth anniversary,” he added.In 2018, PM Modi commended the engineers of the country. He took to Twitter to honour engineering genius M. Visvesvaraya. "On #EngineersDay, I congratulate our hardworking engineers and appreciate their dexterity as well as dedication. Their role in nation building is extremely vital. I also pay tributes to the noted engineer, Shri M Visvesvaraya, on his birth anniversary," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/engineers-day-2021-remembering-m-visvesvaraya-on-his-160th-birth-anniversary-101631589709128.html

Panna collector Sanjay Kumar Mishra told reporters that Ratanlal Prajapati and others found the diamond from leased land in the Hirapur Tapariyan area of the district. The diamond will be put up for auction later this month along with other gems, Mishra said.Officials have said the proceeds from the auction of the raw diamonds would be given to the respective miners after deduction of government royalty and taxes, according to PTI. Officials also said that the auction of the latest precious stone found by the labourers and 139 other diamonds will start from September 21. Local experts say the diamond found by the labourers may fetch up to ₹40 lakh, it reported.Also read | Diamond excavation plummets in Madhya Pradesh’s PannaRaghuvir Prajapati, one of the labourers who found the gem, told reporters that they spent the last 15 years quarrying in various mines in their quest to find diamonds. “We leased small mines in different areas for the past 15 years but did not find any diamond. This year, we have been mining on leased land at Hirapur Tapariyan for the past six months and were pleasantly surprised to find a diamond weighing 8.22 carat,” he said.Also read | Diamond believed to be world's third-largest unearthed in BotswanaRaghuvir Prajapati said he and his partners will use the money from the auction of the diamond for providing a better life and education to their children.PTI cited officials as saying that Panna district, which is more than 380km from the state capital of Bhopal, has reserves estimated to be containing diamonds totalling 12 lakh carats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-labourers-find-8-22-carat-diamond-in-panna-after-a-15-year-hunt-101631597438218.html
14-09-2021||India||Nitin Gadkari says rare to find a happy politician||The road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said it was rare to find a happy politician since they were mostly insecure about power and position. Gadkari’s comments, made in a light vein in a seminar on Parliamentary System and People’s Expectations in Jaipur on Monday, didn’t appear to be aimed at any particular political party.“The MLAs were unhappy as they couldn’t become a minister; ministers were unhappy as they didn’t get a good department; those who got a good department were unhappy as they couldn’t become the chief minister. And the CMs were unhappy as they were not sure how long they will stay in office,’” Gadkari said at the concluding session of the seminar organised by the Rajasthan branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Gadkari’s statement comes close on the heels of Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani’s replacement and during the ongoing friction in Rajasthan Congress over delayed cabinet expansion.Gadkari cited well-known satirist Sharad Joshi’s comments that politicians of no use in the states were sent to Delhi and those of no use in Delhi were made governors and those who couldn’t become governors were made ambassadors. “When I was the BJP President, I have not found anyone who was not sad. A journalist once asked me how to stay happy, and I replied that those who do not worry about the future remain happy,” he said.Drawing a parallel with cricket, Gadkari said politics is also a skill and should be played like one day cricket.Gadkari said a Congress leader from Nagpur, who was his good friend, once asked him to jump ship to Congress after Gadkari lost one election when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was not as strong as it is today. “I politely declined, since ups and downs come in life, but you must remain loyal to the ideology,” Gadkari said, underlining the core principles of good politics.He said social service was the main objective of politics, an effective tool to bring about socio-economic change through welfare of the last person in the society.He said democracy was meant to ensure welfare of the society for qualitative changes in the lives of people and its strength depended on people’s representatives. He said honesty and credibility were a politician’s biggest asset and his/her aim should be welfare of the poor while keeping faith in democracy.Rajasthan assembly speaker CP Joshi said democracy will be strong only if our ideology is strong. “We have to work together to strengthen democracy. It is the responsibility of the government to make policy and work for the people, while the opposition has the responsibility to draw the government’s attention to people’s problems.”Leader of Opposition in Rajasthan assembly Gulab Chand Kataria said a structure of democracy could not be built in the last 70-75 years.“In today’s era the individual and the party have become dominant while the country has become secondary. Our thinking should be to take the country forward by doing welfare works in every area of the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-says-rare-to-find-a-happy-politician-101631597374285.html

The Covid-19 cases on Tuesday saw a fall of 1,850 cases against Monday when there were 27,254 infections. The major chunk of the infections came from Kerala, which accounted for more than half of the total daily cases. On Monday, Kerala recorded 15,058 Covid-19 cases, 28,439 recoveries, and 99 deaths in the last 24 hours.The death toll due to Covid-19 has climbed to 443,213, with 339 daily fatalities recorded across the country, the data updated at 8am showed. Meanwhile, active cases have declined to 362,207.A report published in Lancet has said that there is currently no need for a booster dose for those who are already vaccinated with two shots of the jab. It added that the available vaccine supply will save far more lives if given to those who haven’t been vaccinated at all.The paper co-authored by two scientists who recently quit the US Food and Drug Administration--Philip Krause and Marion Gruber--also noted that unnecessary boosting might lead to some adverse events, which can then reduce vaccine acceptance.The researchers conclude that booster doses might eventually be needed because of waning immunity from the current vaccination or the virus evolving to escape the immune response generated by current vaccines and infections. In such a case, vaccines developed based on the newer variants are likely to be more effective.The government said on Monday that those who died at home or a hospital within 30 days of testing positive for Covid-19 will be considered Covid fatality. People who continued being treated for the infectious disease at hospitals beyond 30 days but died subsequently can also show the cause of their fatality as Covid-19.The new rules were formed as part of the simplified regulations issued jointly by the ministry of health and family welfare and the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) on September 3 following the Supreme Court judgment directing the Centre to consider expanding the scope of Covid-19 deaths to such people who were admitted initially for the viral disease but subsequently died due to related complications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-continues-to-account-for-more-than-50-of-daily-covid-cases-101631597138306.html

Modi, who will be making only his second visit abroad since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, is expected to begin his visit with a bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden in Washington. This will be the first in-person meeting between the two leaders since Biden assumed office earlier this year, though they have interacted at virtual events and spoken on phone several times. The Prime Minister will join Biden and his Australian and Japanese counterparts, Scott Morrison and Yoshihide Suga, for the Quad Leaders’ Summit at the White House in Washington on September 24 – six months after their first virtual summit held on March 12.“The Biden-Harris administration has made elevating the Quad a priority, as seen through the first-ever Quad Leaders-level engagement in March, which was virtual, and now this summit, which will be in-person,” White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said. Hosting the Quad leaders demonstrates the US administration’s “priority of engaging in the Indo-Pacific, including through new multilateral configurations to meet the challenges of the 21st century”, she said. The in-person summit will be an opportunity to review progress made since the virtual summit and to discuss regional issues of shared interest, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. Among the issues that are expected to figure prominently in the Quad Summit are the situation in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover on August 15, and ways to given fresh impetus to the ambitious Quad vaccine partnership, which was announced in March and envisages the distribution of one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines across the Indo-Pacific. Also Read | For the Taliban, why the Afghanistan of 2021 is different from 1996At their first 2+2 ministerial dialogue on September 11, India and Australia insisted Afghan soil must not become a safe haven for terrorists or be used for attacks on other nations, and called for steps to ensure an inclusive governing structure in Kabul. The US has said it intends to hold the Taliban to its counter-terrorism related commitments, including severing ties with al-Qaeda and other terror groups active in Afghanistan. The deliberations at the Quad Summit are expected to shape the approach of the four countries on the crucial issue of any recognition of the Taliban setup in Kabul. The statement from the external affairs ministry said the Quad leaders will “review the Quad vaccine initiative” as part of their ongoing efforts to contain the pandemic. Under the vaccine partnership, the four countries were to supply US-developed vaccines, such as the Johnson & Johnson shot, that would be manufactured in India with funding from American and Japanese financial institutions. Australia will provide logistics support to deliver the doses to countries across the Indo-Pacific. The initiative stalled after India was hit by a devastating second wave of Covid-19 infections in March-April and the country restricted vaccine exports. Under a new timeframe, the vaccines are expected to be rolled out next year. The four leaders will also exchange views on global issues such as critical and emerging technologies, connectivity and infrastructure, cyber security, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, climate change, and education, the statement said. Also Read | India, Australia share concerns on AfghanistanAt the maiden virtual summit, the four leaders had agreed to work towards setting global standards for critical technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence, and to take further steps to ensure the Indo-Pacific remains a free, open and inclusive region with trade activities conducted under the framework of international rules. These steps were perceived as efforts to counter China’s aggressive and assertive actions across the region. The statement also said the upcoming summit will “provide a valuable opportunity for dialogue and interactions among the [Quad] leaders, anchored in their shared vision of ensuring a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region”. Psaki said the Quad Leaders will focus on deepening ties and advancing practical cooperation in areas such as combating Covid-19, the climate crisis, and partnering on emerging technologies and cyberspace. Modi is scheduled to address the general debate of the high-level segment of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly in New York on September 25. The theme for this year’s debate is “Building resilience through hope to recover from Covid-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of people, and revitalise the United Nations”. There had been some uncertainty regarding the holding of the Quad Summit following Suga’s recent decision to step down and not seek re-election as leader of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) in the face of mounting criticism of his handling of the Covid-19 crisis. Suga took over just under a year ago after Shinzo Abe resigned citing ill health. The Japanese side had proposed holding the Quad Summit in a hybrid format, with Suga joining virtually. There were also suggestions for holding the summit after the election of a new Japanese prime minister at the end of this month, but the four countries ultimately decided to go ahead with the summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-attend-quad-summit-in-washington-on-sept-24-mea-101631594253925.html

It added that the available vaccine supply will save far more lives if given to those who haven’t been vaccinated at all.Earlier, the World Health Organisation had called for a moratorium on booster doses till the vaccines reach more people across the globe.“The limited supply of these vaccines will save the most lives if made available to people who are at appreciable risk of serious disease and have not yet received any vaccine. Even if some gain can ultimately be obtained from boosting, it will not outweigh the benefits of providing initial protection to the unvaccinated,” said the report, co-authored by WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan, published in Lancet on Monday.The paper was co-authored by two scientists who recently quit the US Food and Drug Administration, Philip Krause and Marion Gruber.ALSO READ: Hesitant about getting the Covid-19 vaccine, ladies? An expert clears your doubtsThe report cautions against believing that a dropping titre of neutralising antibodies predicts a decline in efficacy of a vaccine. The ability of vaccines developed using proteins of the original Wuhan variant of the virus to protect against the current variants shows that the virus hasn’t evolved to the point of escaping the memory immune response induced by the vaccines.In addition, unnecessary boosting that might lead to known adverse events can reduce vaccine acceptance. “There could be risks if boosters are widely introduced too soon, or too frequently, especially with vaccines that can have immune-mediated side-effects (such as myocarditis in mRNA vaccines, or Guillain-Barre syndrome (a condition where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its nervous system leading to numbness and paralysis), which has been associated with adenovirus-vectored Covid-19 vaccines). If unnecessary boosting causes severe adverse reactions, there could be implications for vaccine acceptance that go beyond Covid-19 vaccines.”The researchers conclude that booster doses might eventually be needed because of waning immunity from the current vaccination or the virus evolving to escape the immune response generated by current vaccines and infections. In such a case, vaccines developed based on the newer variants are likely to be more effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/booster-dose-of-covid-19-vaccines-not-needed-yet-says-review-in-lancet-101631592514365.html
14-09-2021||India||‘Will have to continue wearing masks through next year’: Dr VK Paul||Dr VK Paul, NITI Aayog member (health), has said that people will have to continue wearing masks for as long as until next year against Covid-19 and warned that a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic cannot be ruled out.“Wearing the mask will not go away for some time, we will have to continue to wear the mask even through the next year,” he told NDTV in an exclusive interview. This, according to the senior doctor, is because the fight against Covid-19 will require a studied combination of disciplined social behaviour, vaccines and effective drugs.“I am of the view that this combination will finally see us through this pandemic,” he further said.Disciplined social behaviour in context of the coronavirus disease refers to what is known as Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, which includes wearing masks, washing hands with sanitisers, practicing social distancing etc. Wearing masks is considered as one of the most effective ways to guard against this contagious disease.Questioned on the possibility of a third wave of infections of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, Dr Paul was emphatic in his response, saying that it cannot be ruled out. “The next three-four months are very important when the vaccine is rolling up to build the Great Wall of herd immunity. We need to protect ourselves and avoid the outbreak,” he remarked.Dr Paul also cautioned against lowering guard during the upcoming festive season. Doing so, he warned, could lead to massive spread of the infection. “We have a risky period in front of us, and guidelines should be invoked when the time cones. Timely intervention from the administration is likely to prevent any significant outbreak of the disease,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wearing-masks-not-going-away-for-some-time-dr-vk-paul-101631592043125.html
14-09-2021||India||Saudi foreign minister visiting India, Taliban and Afghanistan are priority||Saudi Arabia foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud is expected to visit India this weekend to discuss the unfolding situation in Afghanistan even as Qatar has taken lead in diplomatically engaging Kabul and towards legitimising the Taliban. India’s close allies in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are worried about the security ramifications of the medieval theocratic Afghanistan state and the ties of the global jihadist network with the Taliban regime. The two countries are also perturbed with the active role played by Qatar, Turkey and Pakistan in engaging the Sunni Islamist regime with Islamabad sending its first commercial flight to Kabul. Qatar is handling the technical side of the Kabul airport operations, while the Taliban is still considering handing over perimeter security to the Turkish military.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the Afghanistan situation with UAE crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on September 3 over the telephone, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar hosted Dr Anwar Gargash, Diplomatic Advisor to UAE President, on August 30 and exchanged notes on the Kabul crisis.It is in this context that the Saudi foreign minister is scheduled to arrive in India on September 19. Prince Faisal is expected to hold meetings with EAM Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and call on Prime Minister Modi. Jaishankar departs for New York for UNGA and QUAD summit the next day.Even though Qatar has been the lead player in the rise of Taliban in Afghanistan with Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani and Special Envoy Mutlaq bin Majed Al Qahtani visiting Kabul last Sunday, the global community is a long way off in legitimizing the ultra-conservative Kabul regime. It is quite evident to the international community that the present Taliban regime has full military and political support of Pakistani ISI with its chief playing the kingmaker in government formation in Kabul.However, the international community is worried about the fall-out of Sunni Pashtun force usurping power through military means with no less than 17 out of the 33 ministers designated as global terrorists by the UN and sanctioned against. As per the UN 1267 list, the following ministers of the Taliban cabinet are on the UN list with interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani being the crown prince of terror with a bounty of $5 million on his head by the US State Department. The head of Haqqani Network, the most lethal of terrorist groups operating in Afghanistan, is also the head of intelligence.1. Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund, Prime Minister2.

14-09-2021||India||Rain, floods killed 6,800 people in India in last 3 yrs; Bengal tops list||India has lost 6,811 people in the last three years to hydro-meteorological disasters such as heavy rain, lightning, flood and cyclones till March this year, according to government information to Parliament. West Bengal topped the list of states with at least 964 such deaths, revealing the state’s vulnerability to climate change. This means one in every seven such deaths were reported from the state between April 2018 and March 21, according to data placed in the Lok Sabha in August this year. Madhya Pradesh came a close second with 917 deaths and Kerala was placed third with 708 deaths during the same period. Madhya Pradesh alone recorded 674 deaths in 2019-20, mostly due to floods. Data of some states like Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana and Bihar were missing for some years. Hydro-meteorological disasters include heavy rains, lightning strikes, cyclones, floods, droughts, avalanche, heat wave and cold wave. Also Read | Next month, air pollution will be back“Intensity and frequency of extreme weather phenomenon, such as heavy rain, lightning, thunderstorms, heat waves and cyclones have increased in the last two decades triggered by climate change. Recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment says that for every 1°C rise in temperature, the water holding capacity of the atmosphere will increase by 7%. So the quantum of high intensity precipitation in each of the events is going up and we are seeing the consequences,” said KJ Ramesh, former director of India Meteorological Department (IMD). Data available with the Union ministry of earth sciences also show that while in 2016, at least four cyclones had hit the Indian coast, out of which only one was a severe cyclone, in 2020 the country was battered by five severe cyclones. Likewise, events of very heavy rainfall and extremely heavy rainfall have also been increasing, ministry data have shown. While in 2016, around 1,864 IMD stations across India recorded very heavy rain and 226 stations recorded extremely heavy rain, in 2020, 1,912 stations registered very heavy rain and extremely heavy rain was recorded in 341 stations. The data, however, do not include deaths reported this year during the monsoon season. Data released by the Union government showed that this year between June 1 and September 1, at least 680 people have died in rain related accidents. Around 75 such deaths were reported from West Bengal alone till September 1. In May 2021, cyclone Yaas killed 14 people in West Bengal and Odisha. Also Read | Climate action dialogue: US envoy lauds India’s leadership on renewable energyIn 2020, cyclone Amphan killed 98 people in West Bengal, while cyclone Tauktae, which hit the western coast this year, killed 118 people. West Bengal has been hit by three back-to-back very severe cyclones in November 2019 (Bulbul), May 2020 (Amphan) and May 2021 (Yaas), which together killed around 153 people. The ‘Assessment of climate change over the Indian region’ – a report published by the Union earth sciences ministry in 2020 – suggests that the frequency of daily precipitation extremes with rainfall intensities exceeding 150 mm per day increased by about 75% during 1950-2015 in central India. The report also suggests that the country’s average temperature has shot up by 0.7% between 1901 and 2018. “Our analysis of IMD data of a century says that the number of depressions intensifying into cyclones has dropped in the Bay of Bengal. But when a cyclone develops its intensity is very high. Similarly, the overall rainfall in the monsoon season has increased but the number of rainy days has dropped, resulting in intense spells. The latest IPCC report has already pointed out that Kolkata recorded the highest rise in surface air temperature within the studied cities and regions across the world in 1950-2018. Except for desert, West Bengal has everything -- from mountains to sea and river floodplains -- and so it is also vulnerable to the effects of climate change. What aggravates the situation is that while on one hand, alteration of nature is going on in an unbridled way, we lack mitigation and preparedness,” said Tuhin Ghosh, director of School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University in Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-floods-killed-6-800-people-in-india-in-last-3-yrs-bengal-tops-list-101631589513739.html

The state also reported 27 deaths in the past 24 hours, which is its lowest in 190 days. While the dip in cases is also due to lower number of testing on weekends, the state is seeing an overall downward trend in daily infections, as per official data.To be sure, the lowest single-day infection figure in the last seven months coincides with the lowest one-day testing figure since March 22. On that day, Maharashtra reported 105,830 tests with 24,645 new cases at a positivity rate of 23.29%. Monday’s positivity rate was 2.54% of the 108,216 samples tested for Covid over the last 24 hours.However, a month after suburban train services in Mumbai were opened up for the fully vaccinated population, Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) have seen an increase in the number of daily infections.

14-09-2021||India||Hindi Diwas 2021: How Mahatma Gandhi promoted the language||Hindi Diwas or Hindi Day is observed across the country every year on September 14 and its main objective is to preserve and maintain this language. Mahatma Gandhi called Hindi the language of the masses and talked about making Hindi the national language of the nation. “Using Hindi in national practice is necessary for the progress of the country," he said.Role of Mahatma Gandhi in promoting HindiWhen Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi came to India from South Africa in 1915, his first movement started from Champaran in Bihar. When Gandhi went to Champaran, the biggest problem he faced was the language. Some local colleagues helped him in this matter, but Gandhi himself learned Hindi very diligently.Before joining the freedom movement, Gandhiji travelled all across India and found that Hindi is the only language that can connect the whole country. That is why he talked about making Hindi the national language and linked the entire national movement with it. After Independence, a foreign journalist asked him to give a message to the world. To that, Gandhi said that the entire world does not know English.Gandhi's association with HindiGandhi's relationship with Hindi writers and poets also remained very close. Poet Premchand admitted that his association with Hindi and the national movement was possible only because of Gandhi. The Hindi that Gandhi used to write and speak was not called Hindi, but Hindustani. It was different from the Sanskritised Hindi of that time. It was simple Hindi, which Gandhi used as a communication language.Gandhi also brought out several newspapers in Hindi, English and Gujarati languages. He brought out two newspapers in Hindi - Navjeevan and Harijan Sevak.

The Waqf Board has no power to overstep the lessee,” said the counsel for the Centre Rajat Nair.However, the judge said “some persons were in possession of the property. Due to the pandemic, an FIR was registered.. (and) you take possession as case property. It has to be handed over. It can't be that the property is kept forever (subject to court orders). What is your stand on the facts of the case? You tell me from whom you took it. How long will you keep it locked as case property.”The court issued notice on an application filed by a member of the Managing Committee of the markaz in question for his impleadment and allowed the Waqf Board to file its reply to the Centre's affidavit and posted the matter for next hearing on November 16.Senior counsel Ramesh Gupta, representing the Board, argued that the petition has remained pending for more than a year and a half and clarified that his petition pertained to the release of the entire markaz property comprising the masjid, the madarasa and the residential portion.“Now they should release the property to us. UOI has no role to play,” he stated.Senior counsel Salman Khurshid, representing the intervening member, added that he is “on the same page as the Waqf” and when allowed to be re-opened, the markaz would adhere to the relevant protocols.In its affidavit affirmed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime, the Centre has maintained that it is “necessary and incumbent” to “preserve” the Markaz property as the investigation in the case registered for violation of the Covid-19 protocols has “cross borders implications and involves nation's diplomatic relationship with other countries.”“As such, in view of the seriousness of the case which has trans-border implication and diplomatic consideration, it is just and necessary that the case property in such a case is preserved in letter and spirit so that due process of law in dealing with such cases is followed,” the affidavit said.  “Since about 1300 foreigners were found to be residing in the said premises and cases against them have cross borders implications and involves nation's diplomatic relationship with other countries, it is necessary and incumbent on the part of the Respondent to preserve the said premises for the purpose of Section 310 of Cr.PC,” it added.It said since the issue of keeping the markaz premises locked is pending adjudication before another bench, it “cannot be agitated by the petitioner (Waqf) in guise of its power of superintendence”.It added that the right to administer the markaz is subject to law, public order and health and that the authorities have “always relaxed the entry norms upon a proper application made by the person administering the religious affair” as and when the organizers apply for a relaxation in view of any ensuing religious festival or for any other reason.On April 15, the court had allowed 50 people to offer namaz five times a day at Nizamuddin Markaz during Ramzan, saying there is no direction in the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) notification to close down places of worship.The board, in its plea filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, contended that even after unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the markaz -- comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and attached hostel -- continues to be locked up.It has further contended that even if the premises was part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it "under lock as an out of bound area" was a "primitive method" of enquiry process.Several FIRs have been registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the Covid-19 lockdown last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nizamuddin-markaz-case-has-cross-border-implications-centre-to-delhi-hc-101631582874078.html
14-09-2021||India||Hindi Diwas 2021: Know its history and significance||India celebrates Hindi Diwas, also known as Hindi Day, on September 14 every year to commemorate the adoption of Hindi in the Devanagari script as one of the official languages of the nation. One of the reasons behind celebrating this day is to prevent the increasing trend of the English language in the nation and the neglect of Hindi. It is to be noted that Mahatma Gandhi called Hindi the language of the masses. The Father of the Nation also talked about making Hindi the national language of the nation.History of Hindi DiwasThe Constituent Assembly of India accepted Hindi, written in Devanagari script, as the official language of India on September 14, 1949. Officially, the first Hindi Day was celebrated on September 14, 1953. The reason behind adopting Hindi as one of the official languages was to simplify administration in a nation with multiple languages. Efforts were made by several writers, poets and activists for the adoption of Hindi as the official language.Significance of Hindi DiwasHindi Diwas is celebrated every year to promote the Hindi language. In order to promote Hindi, it is advised to use Hindi in place of English in all government offices. Many literary and cultural events are organised on this day across the nation, wherein people celebrate great works of Hindi literature. Rajbhasha Kirti Puraskar and Rajbhasha Gaurav Puraskar awards are also given to ministries, departments, public sector units (PSUs), nationalised banks and citizens on Hindi Diwas for their contribution and promotion of Hindi.Many schools and colleges organise various literary and cultural programmes, as well as competitions to showcase the importance of the day and raise awareness about the language. The President of India honours people for their contributions to the language at a function held in Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindi-diwas-2021-know-its-history-and-significance-101631577473141.html

14-09-2021||India||Fiscal policy not courts’ call: SC||The fiscal policy of a government cannot be dictated through the judgments of constitutional courts, held the Supreme Court on Monday while underscoring that any such order “would constitute an impermissible judicial encroachment on legislative power” of the State.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah highlighted that legislative choices and fiscal policy decisions are based on complex balances drawn between political, economic and social needs and aspirations, and are a result of careful analysis of the data and information regarding the levy of taxes and their collection.“Fiscal policy ought not be dictated through the judgments of the high courts or this court. For it is not the function of the court in the fiscal arena to compel Parliament to go further and to do more by, for instance, expanding the coverage of the legislation (to liquor, stamp duty and petroleum) or to bring in uniformity of rates. This would constitute an impermissible judicial encroachment on legislative power,” said the bench, while deciding a clutch of cases relating to Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act 2017.The SC was called upon to decide the validity of Section 54(3) of the Act, which contained a provision for refund of unutilised input tax credit where the rate of tax on inputs is higher than the rate of tax on output supplies.A slew of petitions stated that Section 54(3) must be rendered unconstitutional if it is to be interpreted as confining the refund only to input goods and not to input services. Further, they contended that Rule 89(5) of the Act must also be declared ultra vires in so far as it excludes tax on input services from the refund formula. The petitions added that the entire basket of unutilised input tax credit, whether traceable to goods or services, is eligible for refund.The cases reached the SC following divergent views taken by the high courts of Gujarat and Madras in the manner of interpreting the legal provisions. The Gujarat HC, by its July 2020 judgment in VKC Footsteps India Pvt Ltd case, held that Rule 89(5) is ultra vires Section 54(3) of the Act. However, Madars HC, by its September 2020 judgment in Tvl Transtonnelstroy Afcons Joint Venture case, affirmed the validity of the impugned GST rule.The bench rejected challenges to the validity of both the provisions, and upheld them on the ground that it was within the legislative competence to provide for differential regime for goods and services and confine the scope of the refund under the impugned provision only to goods. “The court while interpreting the provisions of Section 54(3) must give effect to its plain terms. The court cannot redraw legislative boundaries on the basis of an ideal which the law was intended to pursue,” said the court, pointing out that when there is no uniform rate of taxes on inputs goods, input services and outward supplies, such distinctions will have to be made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fiscal-policy-not-courts-call-sc-101631572034849.html
14-09-2021||India||Cheapest to build a solar farm in India, says Kerry||India and the US launched a clean energy financing initiative on Monday, as the US’s special envoy on climate John Kerry held discussions with Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav and nudged New Delhi to commit to net-zero carbon emission goals during his two-day visit to the Capital.After an hour-long discussion with Yadav in Delhi, the two leaders launched the Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation Dialogue (CAFMD) — an India-US initiative that aims to attract investment and technology in clean energy projects. CAFMD is part of the India-US Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership that was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden at the Leaders’ Summit held in April this year.“The dialogue will facilitate finance and technology to achieve it. Over the past six months, the six largest banks in America have all publicly committed that over the next 10 years, they will invest a minimum of $4.16 trillion in this effort to make this transition happen,” he said.Kerry also lauded India’s leadership on pushing ahead with clean energy and targeting 450GW of renewable energy by 2030. “India is a world leader in demonstrating economic development and clean energy can go hand in hand. I am confident that the 450GW goal will be reached,” he said.But the former US secretary of state, who has been laying the groundwork for a key UN climate conference in November this year, underscored the need for all Paris agreement signatories to commit to a net-zero emissions target by 2050.“No country can do this alone,” Kerry said. “And the world can’t do it if everybody doesn’t sign up to be part of the solution. That’s why we are rallying the world to address this massive challenge and to raise global ambition in the lead up to the COP26 (UN climate change conference).”“Floods, forest fires, record levels of rainfall are happening everywhere. And to keep 1.5 degree warming limit in reach, and avoid more catastrophic consequences, we must act now,” he asserted, invoking the findings of the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released last month.Based on 14,000 scientific papers studied by 234 experts, the first part of the IPCC report said the world will miss its target of keeping global warming to under 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels, and that this will be exceeded in the next two decades, resulting in a higher frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Attributing the heating almost exclusively to human activity, it also called for immediate action, including a move away from fossil fuels if the world wants to keep global warming to under 2°C.Under the 2015 Paris agreement, India has pledged to reduce emissions intensity of GDP by 33%-35% below the 2005 level by 2030 and raise the non-fossil share of power generation capacity to 40% by 2030, among other measures.Ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Glasgow this November, several other countries including Germany and UK climate chief Alok Sharma have also pushed New Delhi to commit to a net-zero carbon emissions target and enhance its Paris deal goals.New Delhi, however, maintains that developed countries which have historically contributed the most to global warming and reaped the economic benefits of industrialisation should bear a larger responsibility of battling the climate crisis.On Monday, Bhupender Yadav said India was committed to fighting climate crisis, but added that he hoped the world will take into account the needs of developing countries. “I believe this dialogue will not only strengthen India-US bilateral cooperation on climate and environment, but will also help demonstrate how the world can align swift climate action with inclusive and resilient economic development, taking into account national circumstances and sustainable development priorities,” the environment minister said at the launch.An expert on UN climate negotiations too said it will be “unfair” to have a “uniform” timeline for all countries on net-zero emissions. “Keeping equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in sight, its unfair to have uniform timelines for all economies to transition to net zero. The largest polluters with historical responsibility should transition by 2030 or 2040 and give the developing world time. China has committed to net zero emissions only by 2060,” the expert, who wished to remain anonymous, said.Making his case for net-zero emissions, Kerry said it is now economically feasible for countries to transition to clean energy.“It is cheaper to build a solar farm in India than anywhere else in the world. Investors are flocking to clean energy and energy transition rebounding after worst of the pandemic… the International Energy Agency forecasts that if India seizes the clean energy opportunity, it could become the world’s largest markets for batteries and solar panels,” he said.Experts said Kerry’s two-day visit to Delhi — his second since appointment to this post — is a step in the right direction.“With COP26 around the corner, the visit of John Kerry and the launch of the Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation Dialogue, are steps in the direction of restoring trust between the developed countries and the Global South.... In 2010, India had less than 20 megawatts (MW) of solar energy. Today, it is the largest renewables market that follows market principles... For developed countries like the US, forging new partnerships with India, which would cover co-operation on climate-resilient infrastructure and green hydrogen, creating a joint platform for sustainable finance and building capacity in the Global South would be critical to accelerate the pace of the energy transition and convert climate ambition into action,” said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of Council on Energy, Environment and Water.Earlier in the day, Kerry also met Union power minister RK Singh in Delhi and called on external affairs minister S Jaishankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cheapest-to-build-a-solar-farm-in-india-says-kerry-101631571419673.html
14-09-2021||India||Farmers earned ₹27 a day from cultivation in 2018-19||An Indian farmer earned ₹27 per day on average from cultivation in 2018-19. This is less than what they would have earned doing MGNREGS work through the year.These numbers underline the magnitude of the viability crisis in Indian agriculture.India’s inability to shift a large part of its workforce from agriculture to non-agricultural work, especially manufacturing, is considered one of the biggest failures of its economic policy. Agriculture is considered to be the employment of last resort in India. This became apparent during the lockdown last year, when share of agricultural employment increased for the first time in India (read.ht/J9kZ).Markets, however, always find a way to surprise. The latest Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) – it is the most comprehensive official survey on economic conditions of farmers in the country – published by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on September 10, and first reported by Hindustan Times on September 11, presents one such surprise.SAS – it was conducted in calender year 2019 and collected data for the July 2018-June 2019 period – shows a unique contradiction in the Indian economy. Agriculture continues to be the largest employer . The corresponding Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) for 2018-19 put the share of agricultural employment at 42.5%. But cultivation of crops – the activity considered synonymous with agriculture by most people – is no longer the largest source of income for the average Indian farmer or agricultural household (more on this later).Experts believe the declining share of cultivation in the overall income of farmers highlights the marginalisation of farming itself within the Indian economy. This is a development that does not bode well for private investment in improving farm yields and ensuring sustainability.Almost half of India’s rural households have insignificant stakes in agricultureSAS estimates that there are 93.1 million agricultural households in rural India. It also lists another 79.3 million non-agricultural households in rural India (SAS is a rural survey). An agricultural household is defined as one which produced field or horticultural crops, livestock, or other specified agricultural products worth more than ₹4,000 and had a member self-employed in agriculture in the 365 days preceding the survey.This means that almost half of India’s rural population does not even have the minimal economic stakes in agriculture, which is what it takes to qualify as an agricultural household. Almost all (99%) of non-agricultural households possess less than one hectare of land and the major source of income for almost half of them is from casual employment. Approximately one in five non-agricultural households reported having salaried work, which might be a sign of economic well-being – salaried employment is the highest paying kind of work in India – rather than distress.Cultivation incomes are losing importance even for agricultural householdsSelf-employment in cultivation and animal farming is the largest source of income for 71% of the estimated 93.1 million agricultural households . An average agricultural household earned a smaller share of its total income from cultivation (38%) than from wages (40%). Unfortunately, SAS surveys are not conducted as regularly as NSO’s employment and consumption surveys. So, a proper historical comparison of the declining importance of cultivation is not possible. However, in the last SAS round, which collected data for the July 2012-June 2013 period, the share of income from cultivation in total income was 48%. While cultivation incomes were not an overwhelming majority of farmers’ incomes even earlier, this is the first instance where cultivation is not even the largest source of income for India’s agricultural households.An MGNREGS worker can earn more than the average farmer in IndiaThe Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) provides guaranteed unskilled work for hundred days in a year in India’s villages on demand. Wages under MGNREGS are slightly below par with unskilled wages in the open market. This makes the programme very good at self-targeting. Only those who find nowhere else to work will ask for manual work under MGNREGS.In the traditional village hierarchy, an MGNREGS worker will be seen as the poorest of the poor. SAS shows that for all but five states, average income from cultivation per agricultural household is actually less than what MGNREGS work would theoretically pay in 365 days.The average wage under the MGNREGS for each month by states is available from the scheme’s public data portal. This can be used to calculate annual earnings for an MGNREGS worker if that work was available on all 365 days in the July 2018-June 2019 period, when SAS was carried out. The potential earning numbers under MGNREGS in 23 out of 28 states is higher than the average annual income from cultivation per agricultural household given in SAS. To be sure, it is higher than the total income of an agricultural household in only Jharkhand and Odisha. At the all-India level, average annual income from cultivation per agricultural household would be 0.7 times potential MGNREGS wages in 365 days. This comparison does not include income from sources other than cultivation.Whither “progressive farmer”?The SAS report gives detailed accounts of receipts and expenses for agricultural households reporting crop production. This balance-sheet, however, does not include investment spending, which is important for augmenting yields.Summary statistics present a dismal picture. Paid out expenses, as a share of receipts, rise as cultivation incomes increase with land-size. This suggests diseconomies, rather than economic of scale in farming, as it is practised in India.Net incomes, i.e. receipts less expenses, left an average of ₹816.5 per person per month or ₹27 per person per day for agricultural households. The average household size for agricultural household given in the SAS report is 4.9. Even if one person of the agricultural household worked on average MGNREGS wages of ₹179.7 a day throughout the year – farming normally occupies more than one member of the household – per person daily incomes would have been ₹36.7. This makes it clear that cultivation leaves very little surplus for long-term investment.“The latest SAS report clearly shows that farming is an economic burden rather than a gainful activity. Per person daily earnings of ₹27 from farming makes older poverty lines, which were criticised as being too low, look good” said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “That this has happened under a government that promised to double farm incomes and claims to offer guaranteed returns through Minimum Support Prices, speaks volumes about the efficacy of agricultural policy. These numbers also show the pointlessness of trying to offer small cash transfers instead of focusing on the larger viability crisis in farming.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-earned-27-a-day-from-cultivation-in-201819-101631569791714.html

It said its aim is to ensure “social justice, uphold equality and equal opportunity, protect all vulnerable student communities from being discriminated (against) and bring them to the mainstream of medical and dental education, and in turn to ensure a robust public healthcare across the state particularly the rural areas.”NEET was conducted across India on Sunday; hours before that, a 19-year-old son of a farm labourer, was found dead ; he was to write the exam for a third time and police said that circumstantial evidence pointed to fear of failing. Since NEET was introduced, more than a dozen students, some of whom were toppers in class 12 have died by suicide either due to fear of failing or having failed NEET.The AIADMK on Monday wore black badges blaming the DMK for the Salem student’s suicide. Former CM and leader of the opposition Edappadi Palaniswami said, “DMK failed to provide proper and timely information about whether NEET will be held this year or not... (Chief minister MK) Stalin stated that cancelling NEET will be one of the first tasks of the DMK government. But though they have come to power, NEET still remains.” Palaniswami said that his party supports the bill.Inside the assembly, chief minister Stalin blamed the AIADMK for suicides during their regime and said they hid the fact that the President rejected the 2017 NEET Bill which was passed unanimously.After coming to office in May, the DMK set up a committee led by retired justice A K Rajan to study the impact of NEET on socially and economically backward students. This was challenged by the BJP in the Madras high court, which ruled in favour of the state.A senior NTA official said that several initiatives have been taken to help students writing competitive exams amid the pandemic. “The states rationalised their class 12 syllabus differently in view of the pandemic. To make things easier for students, NTA provided five extra questions in each category,” the official added, requesting anonymity. Judicial experts say that the state does not have the power to seek exemption from a parliamentary law. A Supreme Court order in August 2016 made NEET mandatory. However, the SC agreed to grant a one-year amnesty to several states who contended that students need time to prepare and hold the exam in the academic year 2017-18 onwards instead of 2016-17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-adopts-bill-to-scrap-neet-centre-objects-101631565356901.html

It was headed by Rajiv Jain who served as the Intelligence Bureau chief under the present government at the Centre till 2019. He was earlier joint director of IB when Prime Minister Narendra Modi served as Gujarat chief minister,” Sibal said.The state’s counsel also alleged “bias” by two other members in the committee – Atif Rashid, vice chairman of National Minorities Commission and Rajulben Desai, a member of National Commission for Women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-govt-plea-against-calcutta-hc-order-on-bengal-poll-violence-101631562730539.html

14-09-2021||India||J&K curbs may violate human rights; use of UAPA worrying, says UNHRC chief||UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Monday criticised the use of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act across India as well as restrictions on public assembly and frequent communication blackouts in Jammu and Kashmir.In her opening statement at the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Bachelet largely focused on the impact of the “triple planetary crises of climate change, pollution and nature loss” on human rights, but also raised what she described as a “number of specific and fast-moving situations”.“Indian authorities’ restrictions on public assembly, and frequent temporary communication blackouts, continue in Jammu and Kashmir, while hundreds of people remain in detention for exercising their right to the freedom of expression, and journalists face ever-growing pressure,” the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said.“Ongoing use of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act throughout India is worrying, with Jammu and Kashmir having among the highest number of cases in the country,” she said.While acknowledging the Indian government’s efforts to counter terrorism and promote development in Jammu and Kashmir, Bachelet said that “such restrictive measures can result in human rights violations and foster further tensions and discontent”.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Bachelet’s remarks. In the past, India has described such criticism as interference in the country’s internal matters based on inadequate understanding of the ground situation.In the case of China, Bachelet said she was unable to report progress in her efforts to seek “meaningful access to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region”. She said her office is finalising its assessment of the situation in Xinjiang on the basis of “available information on allegations of serious human rights violations in that region” and the findings will be made public by the end of the year.Bachelet’s speech was largely focused on the impact of climate change, pollution, and nature loss on a broad range of rights, including the “rights to adequate food, water, education, housing, health, development and even life itself”.She described displacement caused by environmental disaster as a “particularly serious phenomenon” in Asia, where the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reported that India, China, Bangladesh and the Philippines witnessed “more disaster displacement than all other countries combined” in 2019.The displacement in these four countries amounted to 70% of the global total and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report of last month presents a “troubling forecast for South Asia”, she said.“Combating and recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic will require billions of dollars to be spent on rebuilding and supporting national economies. Policy choices can direct that spending into new, green directions that tackle inequalities and stimulate innovative environmental solutions that also uphold and promote human rights,” Bachelet said.Several countries have issued new climate commitments and the European Union adopted a new climate law in June that creates a legal obligation to attain climate neutrality by 2050, and requires a 55% reduction of EU-wide greenhouse gas emissions from their 1990 levels.Bachelet noted it wouldn’t be easy achieving these targets as it would means that EU member states must reduce emissions in the next eight years by more than what was achieved in the last three decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-curbs-may-violate-human-rights-use-of-uapa-worrying-says-unhrc-chief-101631560531893.html

It was alleged that the key personnel occupying posts of prominence in the State of Andhra Pradesh by intentionally targeting the Judiciary, made derogatory posts on social media platform against Judges and Judiciary following some Court verdicts delivered by the Judges of Hon’ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh.Those chargesheeted are - Dhani Reddy Konda Reddy, Pamula Sudheer, Adarsh Pattapu alias Aadarsh Reddy and Lavanuru Samba Siva Reddy @ Siva Reddy. Earlier, on September 2, the first chargesheet was filed against another accused - Lingareddy Rajasekhar, who was arrested on July 9.CBI spokesperson R C Joshi said on Monday that after taking over the probe, CBI had got objectionable posts removed from the social media platforms, public domains and a lot of such posts/accounts were removed from internet.

14-09-2021||India||Supreme Court stays HP high court order to set up district Covid control committees||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday stayed an order of the Himachal Pradesh high court setting up a Covid monitoring committee in each district with a lawyer and legal services authority official to assist the district deputy commissioner in monitoring state operations to curb spread of the pandemic.Terming the Committee amorphous and lacking expertise, the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna said, “At the Supreme Court, we also set up a National Task Force but that comprised of doctors. This kind of an amorphous committee having district bar association president and district legal services authority secretary, we do not know what is going to be the effect.”The top court was hearing an appeal by the Himachal Pradesh government challenging the July 7 direction issued by the High Court.“There was no need for the high court to constitute a district-level committee. Prima facie, we feel that the committee constituted by the high court is not an expert committee consisting of domain experts to deal with specific aspects of Covid-19 pandemic.”Issuing notice on the state’s appeal, the bench posted the matter after four weeks and ordered staying the high court’s directions. At the same time, the court clarified that the pendency of this matter will not deter high courts from exercising their power under Article 226 to monitor steps taken to specifically deal with various aspects of the pandemic.Additional advocate general Abhinav Mukherjee told the court that Himachal Pradesh is the first state in the country to administer the first dose of vaccine to 100 per cent of its adult population. By November, the state expects to achieve 100 per cent target for the second dose of vaccine too.“Such orders have a demoralizing effect on the state bureaucracy particularly when the high court has noted the work being carried out by the state government on every front of Covid management,” Mukherjee said. He said this as one of the directions of the high court required state officials to update the three-member committee on various aspects of Covid control measures.The court noticed that a state task force was constituted by Governor in November 2020 followed by four district-level committees in May this year to cater to logistics, patient and ambulance management, corporate social responsibility to involve corporate funding for welfare programmes, and media committee.The state also constituted panchayat-level monitoring committees on May 27. Mukherjee informed the court that the test positivity rate in the state was only 0.7 per cent.The directions of the high court were passed on a public interest litigation filed by a practising advocate Tarun Pathak last year highlighting various shortcomings by the state in complying with the standard operating procedures in handling Covid-19 as prescribed by Union ministry of health and family welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-hp-high-court-order-to-set-up-district-covid-control-committees-101631559993093.html
14-09-2021||India||India plans space sector boost in global market||India will soon allow overseas companies to invest in the space sector with a revised foreign direct investment (FDI) policy, taking the next step in opening up the sector to not only private players within the country but also abroad, the chairperson of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) on Monday said.At the same time, India will set targets to increase its share in the global space economy from less than 2% at the moment to 10%, said Dr Pawan Goenka, the newly appointed chairperson designate of the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (INSPACe), the body responsible for promoting and regulating space activity in the country.“The space foreign direct investment policy is getting revised and it will open huge opportunities for space companies to invest in India. It will ensure sustained engagement between Indian and overseas companies that will greatly benefit both. With this policy, space sector will not only be open in India but also to foreign investments. ISRO on the other hand will concentrate on research and development as well as space science missions. It will work on overcoming challenges and reducing the technological gaps in a timely and more responsive manner,” Dr Sivan said at a conference.Last year, the Union government opened up the space sector to private players, announced by Union minister Prakash Javadekar in June 2020,leading to a growth in the space start-ups. Several start-ups were working on space projects but were collaborating with other countries due to a lack of framework in India. An interim INSPACe, headed by Isro’s scientific secretary Dr Umamaheshwaran, is in the process of looking at nearly 40 applications by the industry for various space missions and space-based applications.The regulatory mechanisms for INSPACe – by which it will be able to take action against erring space players – is also currently under review. “INSPACe will also have a regulatory mechanism… It is already going through departmental reviews and inter-ministerial consultations before being tabled in the parliament,” said Dr Umamaheshwaran in the conference. The government has a draft space activities bill, 2017 which provides a regulatory framework, but has not been tabled yet.In addition, the department of space is also finalising new policies on satellite-based communication and remote sensing to aid penetration of the industry in the space applications domain. The drafts of other policies to help the private sector such as satellite-based navigation technology are also being edited.Dr Pawan Goenka, a former director at Mahindra & Mahindra and the chairperson designate of INSPACe, said he will be interacting with Isro scientists and industry experts over the next few days. Although India is one of the top space faring nations, it perform poorly when it comes to the space economy, he said. “Space is a $440 billion sector globally but India has less than 2% share even though India is a leading space fairing country. I would target for India achieving a certain market share globally; I would say 10% based on my limited knowledge. I would set a time frame after learning more,” said Goenka.He added that the investment by space sector startups in India is just $21 to $22 million, which is less than 0.5% of that by global startups, and stressed that creating clarity on the regulatory policies will be his first priority as the chairperson.“There have been long-term issues with capacity constraints such as that of human resources, facilities, but mainly budgets. ISRO’s budget hasn’t significantly increased in recent times and that is an important driver of foreign investment. This step can create competition for Indian players but it is more likely to create partnerships. The newer, smaller space start-ups are always looking for various avenues for funding; youngsters are putting their money into the start-ups. This step could help in bringing in the finances and build strong partnerships with the start-ups that already have the technical know-how,” said Dr Rajeswari Rajagopalan, director of the centre for security, strategy and technology at the Observer Research Foundation.She said increasing India’s global market share to 10% is a big ask and the country will have to strengthen manufacturing as well as launching services to do so. “We will have to strengthen everything from manufacturing, infrastructure to launching in order to capture a big chunk of the market. Launches have seriously gone down during the pandemic; ISRO was significantly affected. However, it is a good sign,” said Dr Rajagopalan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-open-space-sector-for-foreign-investment-target-10-of-global-market-share-101631558791899.html

The woman tried to fight off the gang, but they escaped in a car that didn’t have a number plate. The video soon went viral on social media, with requests to identify the gang. However, hours after the incident, Mangaluru police commissioner N Shashi Kumar issued a statement claiming that the incident was a mock drill to assess the reaction of the public and police preparedness. “Under Kadri police station limits, a gang tried to snatch a bag from a lady near St Agnes College where the lady retaliated. This was a mock drill undertaken by the police department to see how the public, police and victim respond to such a situation. The lady was Shobhalatha Kateel, Swaraksha for Women Trust, where she gives training on self-defence,” said Kumar. The officer said the local police who didn’t know about the drill responded to the incident within four minutes. “The incident took place at 11 am. Within 4 minutes, we received a call on 112 and by 11:10 am, the 112 vehicles reached the spot and took information about the incident,” he said. Kumar said that seeing the woman retaliating against the attackers, passerby joining in as well, was a good sign. “Some youth also tried chasing the car. They also gave information to the police about the accused’s faces, car and its model. I urge the public to be prepared in such situations. The victim should retaliate without any compromise on safety. Meanwhile, the public should rescue the victim and try to catch the accused,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-fights-off-gang-mangaluru-police-hold-mock-drill-to-test-response-101631558312811.html
14-09-2021||India||Don’t disturb Punjab... move to Delhi: Amarinder to farmers||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday appealed to the representatives of various farmers’ unions to stop local protests against three central agriculture laws as it was hurting the state economy. After laying the foundation stone of a government college, the chief minister said while the state stood with the farmers, cultivators should not hold protests in Punjab as it went against the interest of the state. He said the protests going on at 113 places in Punjab impacted its economic development. “I want to appeal to our farmers that it’s your state and your own people, we should not disturb our state. Whatever pressure the farmers want to build on the central government should be done in New Delhi but we should look at the development of the state as our population has been increasing with time,” said Singh. He further said that he was hopeful that farmers will accept his appeal to not protest in Punjab. “Do you know farmers are also sitting at 113 places in Punjab? What will be the gain out of it? Punjab will suffer financially. They are doing it at Delhi (borders) and in Haryana. You do it there,” Singh told the farmers. He said that the three controversial central laws, which were passed by the Union government last year, had already been rejected in the state assembly. He also listed a slew of farm-friendly policies undertaken by his government. Punjab goes to the polls in early 2022.Reacting to Singh’s statement, Haryana home minister Vij accused him of instigating farmers. “It is a very irresponsible statement of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to tell farmers that do whatever you want in Haryana or at Delhi borders but do not do it in Punjab,” Vij said in a tweet. “This proves that Amarinder Singh has done the work of instigating farmers,” he added. Last month, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had accused the Congress government in Punjab of fuelling farmers’ unrest in his state. The three farm laws, enacted last year, promised major reforms in the agriculture sector but farmers, primarily from Punjab and Haryana, launched massive protests blocking arterial highways in the national capital. The farmers say the new rules favour big corporations to whom they will lose business and gradually end the system of state-set minimum prices – charges refuted by the government. For roughly 10 months, farmers have been protesting at sites such as Singhu and Tikri outside the Capital. Earlier in a day, Singh accused Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir Singh Badal of playing a double game on farmers, for initially backing the farm ordinances and later taking a U-turn on the issue after facing farmers’ ire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-disturb-punjab-move-to-delhi-amarinder-to-farmers-101631558258576.html

Though Shivamogga police are yet to release details of the arrested as the investigation is underway, officials said the suspects in custody include workers of the private firm that fed poison to the dogs, a JCB operator, two members of Kambadalu-Hosur gram panchayat, secretary and a bill collector of the panchayat. Officials of Bhadravati Rural police station, where the complaint was registered on September 7, said local residents who observed some suspicious activity in the area informed a group involved in animal rescue. Activists of the group then found carcasses of dogs. They alleged that gram panchayat officials contracted a private firm to kill the dogs and that some of them were buried alive. Police officials said the investigation confirmed the allegation, but added that only some members of the panchayat were part of the plan. Officials of the police station said the gram panchayat gave the task of catching and sterilising stray dogs within panchayat limits to private contractors. The decision was taken during a meeting of the panchayat and an amount was set aside for the task. “While the original decision was to catch stray dogs and release them after neutering them, some members of the panchayat, including the secretary, conspired with the private party to kill the dogs by giving them poison, and bury some of them alive,” a police official said on condition of anonymity. The police have got the post-mortem conducted on 60 dogs. Skin, hair and liver samples have been sent to a forensic science laboratory (FSL). However, a report confirming the use of poison is yet to be received from the FSL. “They (FSL) haven’t been able to identify the cause of the death because the carcasses are more than 5 days old. But they have said that they will be able to give a detailed report soon,” said a police official. The incident happened a month after police in Hassan district arrested seven people, including a woman, for killing 38 macaque monkeys in Chowdenahalli. On July 29, as many as 38 bonnet macaques were poisoned to death and they were found stuffed in a gunny bag at a road junction in Belur taluk in Hassan district. One monkey managed to escape and was spotted sitting near the gunny bag. The Karnataka high court on July 30 initiated public interest litigation (PIL) proceedings, after taking suo moto cognizance of media reports on the deaths. Describing the incident as ‘disturbing’, the bench of Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice NS Sanjay Gowda ordered the registrar general to register a suo motu PIL in the matter. The investigation found that the accused had not planned to kill the monkeys but had hired a couple, known to be experts in monkey-catching, to catch the monkeys after they causes damage to areca nut and coffee plantations in Ugane village in Sakaleshpur taluk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panchayat-secy-among-12-arrested-over-killing-of-dogs-in-shivamogga-101631558252712.html
14-09-2021||India||Traders demand lifting of ‘ineffective’ night curfew||Shopkeepers and business owners have voiced their dissent against the state government’s decision to continue the daily night curfew from 9pm to 5am, claiming shutting down shops while keeping the traffic movement normal at night shows the ineffectiveness of the Covid-19 regulation. Simon Anthony, a shopkeeper in Bengaluru’s Marathahalli, said police would ask to shut down his establishment at 9pm while people would continue moving around on the streets. “The traffic continues as normal till 11pm without any checks. Only shopkeepers are harassed by the police,” he said. A member of the Bangalore Commercial Street Merchants Association said that they have been given assurances that the curbs will be relaxed since the numbers have come down, but so far nothing has happened. “This night curfew has been in place for more than 200 days now. When the government announced a lockdown to control the spread of the virus, we cooperated because it was important. But we can’t understand the purpose of the night curfew now,” said the officer bearer. According to him, several shopkeepers are struggling to keep their businesses afloat since they incurred heavy losses during the lockdown. “If not anything, we should be allowed to stay open late to make up for the loss,” he said. One of the worst-hit by the night curfew are pubs, bars and restaurants, for whom post 9pm is the busiest hour. A pub owner in Indira Nagar said that attempt was made to take a delegation to the government to allow pubs to operate beyond 9pm, however, they have not been able to meet ministers in charge. “We have been following all the precautionary measures given by the government and compared to last month, people are coming out to pubs and restaurants. It is surprising that the government is hoping to get revenue from liquor sales but won’t let us operate,” said the pub owner, who didn’t wish to be named. Meanwhile, the Karnataka government said that the night curfew in the city will continue, however, a review meeting will be conducted soon. Higher Education and IT BT Minister CN Ashwath Narayan said that the government was monitoring the situation closely. “Since there is fear of an increase in the cases in October, we want to wait,” he said. Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj, however, said that the matter of night curfew will be discussed during the monsoon session and a decision will be taken soon. On Monday, Karnataka reported only 673 new Covid cases and 13 deaths, out of which 214 cases and three deaths were reported in Bengaluru city. The total active cases in the state and Bengaluru now stand at 16,241 and 7,211 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traders-demand-lifting-of-ineffective-night-curfew-101631558192859.html

14-09-2021||India||BJP gears up to face Congress heat in Karnataka assembly on price rise||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday issued directions to its legislators to counter protests over price rise, and other issues that the opposition parties are likely to raise during the course of the 10-day monsoon session of the Karnataka assembly.“This was a preparation meeting on the issues that the opposition will raise over petrol and other prices, and the bills that are scheduled to come up, among others. The party has said that attendance is compulsory for all legislators,” said N Ravi Kumar, MLC and state general secretary of the BJP in Karnataka.The BJP and the new Basavaraj Bommai government are gearing up to face an angry opposition who on Monday began their protests against the government over rising prices of petrol, diesel, LPG and other commodities.The three main political parties in Karnataka are hoping to make the most of the monsoon session with the BJP trying hard to defend its administration from allegations of dissent, increasing crimes against women, inadequate flood and drought relief, and an impending third wave of Covid-19 infections. The Bommai government is also staring at a possible revival of the agitation by the Panchamasali, the largest sub-sect within the Lingayats, to press for their demand of being pushed to the 2A category of the state reservation list.The Congress is also trying to corner the BJP government over steep price rise in petrol, diesel, LPG and other essential commodities.Former chief minister BS Yediyurappa sat in the last row of the assembly on Monday when the session was convened mostly for obituaries.“I was the chief minister. I had requested the speaker to get me a seat next to the chief whip which he had agreed to,” Yediyurappa said.The 78-year-old said that he would undertake a state-wide tour in about 15-20 days and after consultation with the state BJP president and other leaders.“In the coming days, we want the BJP to return to power in Karnataka and if Siddaramaiah does win, we hope that he sits in the opposition,” Yediyurappa said.Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition, has also demanded the release of the socio-economic and educational survey or caste census, conducted by the Congress government in 2015 to help revive his AHINDA (Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes and Dalits) support base to counter the dominant caste-political narrative in Karnataka.The Janata Dal (Secular) too is trying to keep a neutral stance and attack the government to quell speculations of the regional outfit getting closer to the BJP.The JD(S) is yet to decide who it will back in Kalaburagi where the September 3 urban local body (ULB) polls have thrown up a hung verdict and given the party another chance to play “kingmaker”.Both the BJP and Congress have reached out to the JD(S) seeking support of its four corporators who will become the deciding factor in the yet-to-be announced mayor elections of the border district and divisional headquarters.The JD(S) has said that both parties have reached out to the regional outfit and added that it will take all factors into account before taking its decision.HD Kumaraswamy, the former chief minister and JD(S) leader, on Monday said that they will raise issues against both the Congress and the BJP over its failed promises.“In the nine days (of the session till September 24) we want to honestly have an issue-based discussion on all the problems in the state. I request that all three parties do not waste time,” Kumaraswamy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpgears-up-to-face-congress-heat-in-karnataka-assembly-on-price-rise-101631558132777.html

14-09-2021||India||Tamil is a language of Gods, says Madras high court||The Madras high court observed that every language spoken by people is God’s language, contending that “the country is made to believe that Gods will listen to only the Sanskrit language.” Hailing Tamil as the “language of Gods,” the Madras high court has said temple consecration should be done reciting Tamil hymns composed by saints like Azhwars and Nayanmars, besides others like Arunagirinathar besides Sanskrit. A division bench in Madurai of the Madras high court comprising of Justice N Kirubakaran (since retired) and Justice B Pugalendhi, in a recent order, said that across the world, local languages are used for services of worship. “However, in our country, it is made to believe that Sanskrit alone is Gods language and not any other language is equivalent,” the bench said. “No doubt, Sanskrit is an ancient language with enormous ancient literature. The belief is spread in such a way that only if the Sanskrit Vedas are recited, the Gods will listen to the prayers of the devotees. However, every language spoken by the people is God’s language.” The order was passed on August 19, based on a petition seeking directions to government authorities to conduct the consecration of a temple in Tamil Nadu’s Karur district – Arulmigu Pasupatheshwara SwamyTirukovil by chanting Thirumuraikal, Tamil Saiva Manthiram (hymns) and also songs of Saint Amaravathi Aatrangarai Karurar. The court referred to ancient literature on how Tamil hymns were used in temples. “Tamil is not only one of the earliest ancient languages of the world, but also a ‘Language of Gods’,” the court said. “If God could not understand Tamil, how was it possible for the die-hard devotees, who were committed to worshipping Lord Shiva, Lord Thirumal, Lord Muruga etc., to compose so many hymns in praise of them. Therefore, the theory that God understands only one language cannot be believed.” Further, using mythical references of the Tamil language to Lord Shiva and Lord Muruga, the court added that it “would only mean that the The Tamil language is connected with Gods”, and that has to be used while performing Kudamuzhuku.” Using Tamil hymns and verses is a long pending demand by devotees as well as Tamil enthusiasts and Dravidian leaders who have ruled the state since 1967. The court’s observations come at a time when it’s often debated whether Sanskrit or Tamil is the oldest language. The DMK which formed the government in May has also been accusing the BJP-led union government of imposing Hindi and Sanskrit as superior languages. The court directed the state government to form a committee of Tamil scholars, devotees and believers of God to consolidate the important ancient Tamil hymns composed by Saints like Nayanmars and Alwars, Arunagirinathar, Pattinathar and other Siddhars. After a report is filed, the state has been asked to decide on the date, from which Kudamuzhuku would be conducted in Tamil or equal importance is given along with Sanskrit. “The The committee should be reconstituted periodically so that if any other worthy hymns are found, they could also be recited along with other verses which are recited at the time of performing Kudamuzhuku,” the court said and disposed of the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-is-a-language-of-gods-says-madras-high-court-101631558073116.html
14-09-2021||India||‘Narcotics jihad’ row: Kerala BJP writes to Centre||Amid a raging row over the Pala bishop’s ‘narcotic jihad’ jibe, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders said they would take up the issue at the national level even as the Nair Service Society (NSS), a socio-cultural wing of the Nair community, supported the religious leader. A worried Congress has asked the Kerala government to convene a meeting of community leaders before the controversy reaches a flashpoint. Leader of Opposition V D Satheesan alleged that the government was waiting for Sangh Parivar outfits to hijack the issue. Many BJP leaders asked the Centre to investigate the nexus between drug and terror activities and bring a law to check it. A senior BJP leader, wishing not to be named, said the party will make it a national issue, citing the disappearance of 21 people from north Kerala in 2016 who reportedly joined the Islamic State. “Many BJP-ruled states have laws to check illegal conversion activities and we want a similar law to contain drug-induced terror,” he said. The BJP state unit has written a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah to provide security to the bishop, citing the case of chopping of palm of a college teacher in Idukki district in 2010 who prepared a controversial question paper. BJP national spokesman Tom Vadakkan decried the move to isolate the bishop and Goa governor Sreedharan Pillai urged the government to address his concern. “He has voiced a genuine concern prevailing in the community. It is the voice of the victims of ‘love jihad’ and narco-terrorism. The state government can’t remain in denial mode always,” Vadakkan said, adding that rising drug cases triggered serious socio-economic issues in the state. The Goa governor supported the bishop. “It seems the bishop has aired his concern and no one needs to go beyond what he said. I hope CM Pinarayi Vijayan will talk to him and clear his concern,” said Pillai, hailing from the state. Last year he was instrumental in the Centre’s move to buy peace between two warring Christian sects, Jacobites and Orthodox. Though the NSS supported the bishop, the organisation said it was not proper to give a communal colour to the issue. “It is fact that girls are being lured by using the weapon of love and converted subsequently. It is a criminal and terror activity. But it is not fair to attribute it to any religion,” NSS said in a statement, urging the government to constitute an independent investigation into charges made by the bishop. Addressing a religious congregation in a church in Kuravilangad (Kottayam) last Thursday, Bishop Mar Joseph Kallaranghatt said Catholic girls and youth were becoming victims of a ‘narcotic jihad’, perpetrated by a section and decried authorities for turning a blind eye towards it. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Congress criticised the bishop for making a sweeping comment, but the Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC), the highest body of Catholics in the state, and the BJP rallied behind him. Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan, hailing from the state, also criticised the attack on the bishop. “It seems he spoke based on conviction, not emotion. The term narcotic jihad is not new. Even world bodies say proceeds from narcotics were a major source of terror funding,” he said, adding that there was a planned move to silence the bishop. Meanwhile, four nuns, who took part in the agitation seeking action against rape- accused former Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal, walked out of a Sunday mass in a chapel in Kottayam when the local priest made some alleged disparaging comments against Muslim during his sermon to justify the Pala Bishop’s statement. “Christ said Love our neighbour as yourself. The priest was churning out disparaging comments against Muslim to justify the Bishop’s statement. It was really painful to hear him and we protested and walked out,” said Sister Anupma, one of them. She said earlier also the priest made such comments. In one of the earlier sermons he said Christian believers were given a particular medicine to ensure that children are not born to them. “We could not digest it so we stormed out. The priest was going out of way to defend the Bishop. We feel the Bishop should have avoided such a statement. Religious leaders will have to take everyone along. Such statements will trigger animosity between different sections,” she said. All four nuns along with the victim are staying in a convent in Kottayam and there were many attempts to forcibly vacate them and they lead a solitary life in the convent as other inmates are barred from interacting with them, they said. The case against Mulakkal surfaced in 2018 after a 43-year-old nun had complained to the police in Kottayam in central Kerala that he had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab. But Mulakkal denied it saying he was implicated after he took action against her for financial irregularities in the convent. Later a special investigation team was formed and it arrested him in Sept 2018. The case is in trial stage now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narcotics-jihad-row-kerala-bjp-writes-to-centre-101631558071924.html

14-09-2021||India||AAP leader Pankaj Gupta gets ED notice in PMLA case, party hits out at BJP||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued summons to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national secretary Pankaj Gupta in connection with alleged foreign funds raised by the party in the run up to 2017 Punjab assembly elections -- a move that the AAP on Monday described as a witch-hunt at the behest of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Officers familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that the agency came to know about the funds while investigating former Punjab leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira, who is under investigation for money laundering in at least two cases. Gupta has been asked to join the ED probe on September 22. A senior ED officer alleged that Khaira, who is in the Congress now, visited the US in 2016, when he was in the AAP, and raised funds totaling $119,000 from the non-resident Indians (NRIs) in the run-up to Punjab state assembly elections. ED recovered the documents pertaining to this funding during a raid in March this year, and when he was questioned about it, he disclosed entire fund-raising trip was organized by the AAP, and that he had no knowledge of the funding, the officer added. “Gupta has been summoned to elicit details about these foreign funds,” said a second officer. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal described the summons as part of the BJP’s “tactics”. “In Delhi, they tried to defeat us with the I-T department, CBI, Delhi Police – but we won 62 seats. As we grow in Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Gujarat – we get an ED notice! The people of India want honest politics- these tactics of BJP will never succeed; they will make us stronger”. AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the summons were not based on facts.“We have just got a two-page notice, which says that Raja Ram Meena, assistant director, has summoned Pankaj Gupta as part of a PMLA investigation on September 22. There is no information about which case this is. ED can give notices under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, Fugitive Economic Offenders Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The notice has been issued under the last one,” Chadha said.“A series of witch-hunts have been launched against AAP and this started even before the party was formed. In 2012, during the Anna Andolan (the anti-corruption protests), MHA sent notices to leaders but said later in court that there were no irregularities. Different agencies, such as IT Department, CBI, ED and Delhi Police have been unleashed on us between 2013 and now but no one has found any wrongdoing,” he added. Prior to Gupta, former AAP leader Vishwas Kumar was questioned last month to know more about the funding. He informed ED team that he is no longer associated with the party and the necessary details would be available with the incumbent office bearer, said a second officer.Khaira, was elected to the state assembly in 2017 from Bholath in Kapurthala district on an AAP ticket. Two years ago, he quit the AAP and formed the Punjab Ekta Party (PEP), which he merged with the Congress in June this year.“I was officially asked by the AAP high command, (Arvind) Kejriwal himself, to make a tour to the US for a fund-raising for the party. I toured about 18 US cities and funds were collected directly for the AAP. During my questioning recently, the ED asked me about this. I told them that I was sent by the party. The AAP teams there organised the meetings and took funds directly from them (participants). I am aware that the money came back here to them, but not how they sent it,” Khaira said. ED is probing him in two money laundering cases registered earlier this year – one based on a transborder drugs smuggling network unearthed in Fazilka, Punjab in 2015, and the second pertaining to a fake passport racket in Delhi. The agency even raided Khaira and his son-in-law Inderveer Singh Johal this March. In the Fazilka drugs case, 1,800 grams of heroin, 24 gold biscuits, two weapons, 26 live cartridges, and two Pakistan SIM cards were seized by Jalalabad police in 2015. Khaira’s name cropped up in the case in 2017. Though he was not named in the Punjab Police charge sheet, a Fazilka court issued summons to him on November 30, 2017. He was Punjab’s leader of opposition and an AAP MLA at that time. The Supreme Court granted him relief by quashing proceedings the following month. In June, ED examined three fashion designers -- Manish Malhotra, Sabyasachi and Ritu Kumar -- in the case against the Punjab legislator as some cash payments were made to them by Khaira.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-leader-pankaj-gupta-gets-ed-notice-in-pmla-case-party-hits-out-at-bjp-101631558012638.html
14-09-2021||India||Bring a ‘logical end’ to 2018 anti-Sterlite protest case: HC||The Madras high court on Monday said that the investigation into the police firing during anti-Sterlite protests in May 2018, that killed 13 persons in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district, should come to its logical end. A bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice TS Sivagnanam observed while hearing a plea, filed by Henri Tiphagne, executive director, People’s Watch, a human rights organisation seeking directions for the National Human Right Commission’s (NHRC) to reopen a probe into the matter. Tiphange, in a previous hearing, had informed the court that the NHRC had closed the case in October 2018 since compensation was paid to the victims’ family, and a judicial commission (retired justice Aruna Jagadeesan) was probing police excesses. The police firing happened on the 100th day of the protests demanding permanent closure of the Vedanta-owned Sterlite copper smelting plant in Thoothukudi, alleging that it caused severe pollution. The NHRC had taken suo motu cognisance of the incident the following day. The previous AIADMK regime ordered the plant to shut, and Vedanta’s plea for reopening is still pending before the Supreme Court.Taking a note that the CBI is also probing the case, the court said, “The matter should be brought to its logical end, as expeditiously as possible, to give a meaningful closure to the matter, and the circumstances in which firing had to be resorted to against unarmed citizens must come out in the report.” The NHRC had submitted its report with recommendations to the court in a sealed cover. “Since the report did not see the light of the day or may not have been forwarded to the state, the recommendations have not been implemented,” the court observed. “To the extent that the recommendations remain relevant and it may be possible to implement the same, all agencies should carry the matter forward.”One of the NHRC’s recommendations was to provide enhanced compensation to victims of the police firing and their families. The court said that the state must be on the side of the families and not be seen as an adversary. “The state is requested to play the real parental role in providing counselling and psychiatric assistance to the members of the bereaved families, if necessary,” the court said. “The state needs to walk the extra mile for such a purpose.” The court requested the Advocate-General, R Shunmugasundaram to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to assuage the feelings of the families of the victims.The court added that the matter before the NHRC should also be brought to its logical end, and the court directed NHRC to report on what steps have been taken based on a report from its Investigation Division when the matter appears next on October 25. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu government granted the Jagadeesan committee an extension to complete its probe before February 22, 2022, after submitting an interim report to chief minister M K Stalin in May when the DMK assumed office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bring-a-logical-end-to-2018-anti-sterlite-protest-casehc-101631558011456.html
14-09-2021||India||Living together is not a compulsory exercise: SC||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday held that living together was not a compulsory exercise as it invoked its constitutional powers to separate a couple through a decree of divorce even as the woman resisted dissolution of the marital tie. A bench, headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, noted that divorce was “inevitable” since the marital tie was not working under any circumstances while the woman continued perpetrating cruelty on the husband by filing cases after cases and trying her best to see that he loses his job too. “Filing of such complaints seeking removal of one’s spouse from job has been opined as amounting to mental cruelty... these continuing acts of the respondent would amount to cruelty. This conduct shows disintegration of marital unity and thus disintegration of the marriage,” held the bench, which also included Justice Hrishikesh Roy. The court also took note of the fact that the couple had not lived together even for a day after their marriage in February 2002 and they were separated for the last 20 years during which the man married another woman after a trial court in Tamil Nadu granted a decree of divorce in 2008 on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. However, the divorce decree was set aside by the Tamil Nadu high court in February 2019, after which the man to approach the Supreme Court to save his second marriage. The court at first suggested mediation after noticing that they had already been living separately for two decades, but the woman remained firm that she will not give her nod for ending the marriage. She also opposed any endeavour by the court to give a decree of divorce on account of irretrievable breakdown of marriage in the absence of her consent. The bench, in its judgment, noted that irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not a ground available under the law for couples seeking separation but the Supreme Court has granted decrees of divorce exercising its unique jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, to do complete justice between the parties. It said the law commission had made recommendations in 1978 and again in 2010 to add irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a new ground for divorce in both the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act, but a draft law prepared in 2013 by the Union government was never passed. The court asserted that societal stigma for a woman after getting divorced coupled with the law’s failure to guarantee economic and financial security to women is stated to be the reason for the legislature’s reluctance to introduce irretrievable breakdown as a ground for divorce. “Living together is not a compulsory exercise. But marriage is a tie between two parties. If this tie is not working under any circumstances, we see no purpose in postponing the inevitability of the situation...” said the bench, emphasising that a marriage is more than a seemingly simple union between two individuals “As a social institution, all marriages have legal, economic, cultural, and religious ramifications... Families are arranged on the idea of a mutual expectation of support and amity which is meant to be experienced and acknowledged amongst its members. Once this amity breaks apart, the results can be highly devastating and stigmatizing,” it added. The court noted that the marriage between the parties never took off and this is one case where both the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of marriage as well as cruelty by woman against her husband would entitle the man a decree of divorce to put an end to continued allegations and litigative proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/living-together-is-not-a-compulsory-exercise-sc-101631557952651.html

14-09-2021||India||India will stand by Afghans as it has in past: Jaishankar||New Delhi: India on Monday reiterated its commitment to stand by the people of Afghanistan and called for “non-discriminatory” and direct distribution of humanitarian assistance through the UN at a time when the war-torn country is going through a critical phase. Addressing a high-level meeting on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan convened by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined the need for humanitarian assistance providers to be given “unimpeded, unrestricted and direct access” to the country. “Once relief materials reach that country, the world will naturally expect a non-discriminatory distribution of humanitarian assistance across all sections of the Afghan society. Only the United Nations has the capacity to monitor such endeavours and reassure donors,” Jaishankar said. “Today, I wish to underline that in the face of a grave emerging situation, India is willing to stand by the Afghan people, just as in the past,” he added. The world community must come together to create the “best possible enabling environment” for helping the Afghan people and addressing challenges such as efficient logistics in the current situation. With no formal recognition yet of the interim setup created by the Taliban following their takeover of Afghanistan on August 15, India and other countries are reluctant to see aid being sent directly to the Taliban. Several nations have called for all aid to be routed through the UN and international bodies. “As the picture becomes clear in respect of the legitimate concerns I am confident that the world will step forward and assist the Afghan people in their hour of need,” Jaishankar said without giving details. He noted that India has “consistently supported a central role” for the UN in the future of Afghanistan. “A multilateral platform is always more effective than small groups in building global consensus and encouraging united action,” he said, adding that India, as an immediate neighbour, is monitoring developments in Afghanistan with “understandable concern”. Jaishankar noted the issue of travel and safe passage “can emerge as an obstacle to humanitarian assistance” and should be “immediately sorted out”. He said: “Those who wish to travel into and out of Afghanistan should be granted such facilities without obstruction. “The normalisation of regular commercial operations of Kabul airport would not only assist in that regard, but then become the basis for a regular flow of relief material.” Jaishankar said UN Security Council resolution 2593, which was passed at a meeting held under India’s presidency of the body last month, should guide the world community’s approach towards Afghanistan in the coming days. He also recalled India’s role as the largest regional donor for reconstruction and development efforts in Afghanistan, with pledges totalling $3 billion in recent years. India’s approach to Afghanistan has always been guided by its “historical friendship with its people” and this will continue to be the case, he said. India’s contributions to the humanitarian requirements of Afghan society have included providing more than one million metric tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan over the past decade. Last year, India shipped 75,000 metric tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan via Iran’s Chabahar port. India’s efforts are also reflected in some 500 development projects in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan in critical areas such as power, water supply, road connectivity, healthcare, education, agriculture and capacity-building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-stand-by-afghans-as-it-has-in-past-jaishankar-101631557892808.html
14-09-2021||India||SC to hear Bengal’s plea against HC order on CBI probe into poll violence||The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear on September 20 the West Bengal government’s plea against a Calcutta high court order directing court-monitored probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into allegations of rape, murder and attempt to murder during the post-poll violence earlier this year. The court’s decision came after the Mamata Banerjee-led government cast aspersions on the members of the committee formed by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), on whose recommendations the high court ordered the probe. Appearing for the state, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told a bench of justices Vineet Saran and Aniruddha Bose that the appeal raised questions on the procedure adopted by five-judge high court bench before directing a CBI probe, monitoring of remaining offences by special investigation team (SIT) and payment of compensation to the victims. “Look at the committee that gathered facts about the incidents and submitted a report to the high court. It was headed by Rajiv Jain who served as the Intelligence Bureau chief under the present government at the Centre till 2019. He was earlier joint director of IB when Prime Minister Narendra Modi served as Gujarat chief minister,” Sibal said.The state’s counsel also alleged “bias” by two other members in the committee – Atif Rashid, vice chairman of National Minorities Commission and Rajulben Desai, a member of National Commission for Women.“Is this a BJP investigation committee,” remarked Sibal, as he told the court, “Rashid served as president of BJP Minority Morcha, was a student leader of BJP’s youth wing ABVP in Satyawati College and later contested the Delhi municipal elections in 2021 on a BJP ticket.” On Desai, Sibal said, “She was associated with Gujarat BJP Mahila Morcha in 2017 and was in charge of Gujarat BJP Beti Bachao and Beti Padhao project.”When the bench said “if somebody has held a political post in the past, can we say that he is still biased”, Sibal pointed out that Rashid continues to make social media posts in favour of the BJP. The court also sought to know if the Beti Bachao project to which Desai was linked was a party project or a state project. Stating that it was a party project, Sibal said: “From any objective standpoint, can you pick up such persons for investigating and picking facts, knowing the sensitivity attached to the case.”Raising questions over the procedure to collect inputs on the violence, Sibal said: “The procedure was left to the committee as the court did not lay down the procedure for collection of facts.”In the appeal, the state government further highlighted that the high court did not define what constituted “post poll violence”, giving instances of cases reported by the committee which were prior to May 2 (date of announcement of election result) and later than July, almost two months after the result declaration.“Never before has en masse, the police force in a state lost confidence in the court,” Sibal said. Though the decision of the high court bench was unanimous, the state government cited two contradictions on facts noted by one of the judges. The state referred to justice Soumen Sen’s remarks which said, “I felt that having regard to the antecedents of Rajulben Desai and Atif Rashid, the inclusion of the said two members could have been avoided as it might raise reasonable likelihood of bias.” Further, justice Sen had also said that post-poll violence must refer to incidents that occurred in the immediate aftermath of the election results.The top court adjourned the matter to next week as one of the documents relied upon by state was not made available to the court in a reader-friendly format. Sibal pressed for an earlier date, saying the CBI was proceeding ahead with the case. However, the top court said that by next week, it will have more time to go through the documents filed.Pursuant to the direction by the high court on August 19, the CBI has initiated its probe and registered more than two dozen cases.The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has been asked to provide security to members of the four CBI teams, comprising seven members in each team.A three-member SIT is probing cases of arson and loot under the court’s supervision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-bengal-s-plea-against-hc-order-on-cbi-probe-into-poll-violence-101631557771919.html
14-09-2021||India||Covaxin may get WHO nod this week: Expert||Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is likely to receive the emergency use listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) this week, a top expert in India’s official vaccination planning body has said.The EUL will pave the way for a wider recognition of Covaxin in documentation sought by many countries that have made an inoculation mandatory for entry into their borders. In the past, students who sought to study abroad were left in the lurch because Covaxin is recognised as a coronavirus vaccine only in few countries.“I hope this week we get the WHO EUL. The company has submitted all the relevant documents; the vaccine safety data has also been submitted to WHO. So, we are hoping this week we should get it,” said Dr NK Arora, chairman, Covid-19 working group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. On July 12, Bharat Biotech announced that it submitted all documents required for EUL to WHO on July 9. “The review process has now commenced with the expectation that we will receive EUL from WHO at the earliest ,” said Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech, in a statement earlier.Bharat Biotech also attended a pre-submission meeting with representatives of WHO on June 23.While the Indian regulator has approved six coronavirus vaccines for emergency use, Covaxin and Serum Institute of India-manufactured Covishield are the mainstay of the country’s inoculation campaign. Covishield, the India-manufactured version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine AZD1222, accounts for close to 90% of the 750 million doses administered till Monday. Covishield has already received a WHO EUL.Covaxin has been developed by the Hyderabad-based vaccine major and the Indian Council of Medical Research. According to people familiar with the matter, WHO began a rolling review of Covaxin on July 6, 2021, and even though the review is still ‘ongoing’, it is a matter of time before an approval is granted.According to the UN health body, WHO EUL is a risk-based procedure for assessing and listing unlicensed vaccines, therapeutics and in vitro diagnostics with the ultimate aim of expediting the availability of these products to people affected by a public health emergency. This will assist interested UN procurement agencies and member states in determining the acceptability of using specific products, based on an essential set of available quality, safety, and efficacy and performance data. On June 22, the subject expert committee of the central drugs standards control organisation (CDSCO) assessed Bharat Biotech’s phase 3 clinical trials data of Covaxin, and found the inactivated whole virion vaccine to be 77.8% efficacious in preventing symptomatic Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-may-get-who-nod-this-week-expert-101631557412171.html
14-09-2021||India||IMD alerts: Deep depression to bring heavy rain in 13 states till September 18||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday made a forecast that as many as 13 states across India will witness widespread rainfall over the next five days due to a deep depression over north Odisha. This comes after the weather department recently cautioned against the monsoon withdrawing late this year after entering an active phase from Saturday because of a low-pressure system that will move over central and northwest India.In its latest bulletin, the IMD said that the deep depression over Odisha has moved further west-northwestwards in the previous six hours with a speed of 13kmph. “It is very likely to move west-northwestwards across north Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh during next 48 hours,” the bulletin forecasted, though adding that the deep depression will likely weaken into a depression in the next 12 hours.Meanwhile, the other low pressure lies over Gujarat and its neighbourhood now, and is likely to become “less marked during next three to four days,” according to IMD.The commissioner of Rajkot municipal corporation said that in the past 24 hours, the Gujarat city has received 13 inches of rainfall. “There’s high rainfall warning for tomorrow also.  [A total of] 1,400 people [have been] shifted to shelters and over 300 people rescued,” the commissioner told news agency ANI, adding that no casualties have been reported yet. Here are the 13 states where heavy rainfall is expected till September 18:1.     Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy downpour over central Maharashtra, Gujarat, east Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and north Konkan is likely till September 17. Isolated extremely heavy rainfall is likely over Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh on September 15.2.     The IMD bulletin said that scattered rainfall is expected to continue over peninsular India till September 18. Meanwhile, isolated heavy rain is likely over coastal and south interior Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry and Karaikal (also in Puducherry) till September 15.3.     There will be an increase in rainfall over parts of plains of northwest India with a fresh spell of heavy rain at isolated places in west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan from September 16 onwards.4.     The IMD has also forecasted a cyclonic circulation over north Bay of Bengal on September 17. The bulletin said that the circulation is likely to move west-northwestwards towards Odisha-West Bengal coast during the next 48 hours, thereby causing an enhanced rain-related activity in the states and also the eastern part of India.5.     Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall over Odisha and Chhattisgarh isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall and isolated extremely heavy downpour are expected for the rest of today. However, this condition will see a reduction thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-alerts-deep-depression-to-bring-heavy-rain-in-13-states-till-september-18-101631556845051.html
14-09-2021||India||‘Will bring new energy’: Bhupendra Patel sworn in as Gujarat CM||First-term MLA Bhupendra Patel was on Monday sworn in as the 17th chief minister of Gujarat by governor Acharya Devvrat at a simple ceremony at Raj Bhavan in Ahmedabad. The 59-year-old was unanimously elected BJP legislature party leader on Sunday, a day after former chief minister Vijay Rupani and his cabinet surprised many with their resignations just 15 months before the assembly elections in the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state. The proposal to elect Patel as the legislature party leader was moved by Rupani.Union home minister Amit Shah, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant,Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, Rupani and former deputy chief minister Nitin Patel were among those present at the event.As decided by the BJP, only Patel was administered the oath of office on Monday. The council of ministers are likely to be sworn in during the next few days after their names are finalised, according to people familiar with the developments. Extending his wishes to the new chief minister, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: “Congratulations to Bhupendra Bhai on taking oath as CM of Gujarat. I have known him for years and have seen his exemplary work, be it in the BJP Organisation or civic administration and community service. He will certainly enrich Gujarat’s growth trajectory.” Responding to this, Patel said: “I will always work for giving new energy and momentum to the sustainable development journey of the state and for the welfare of the people.”Devvrat and Shah congratulated Patel after the ceremony. Shah was the first to congratulate Patel after he took the oath.“My wishes to Bhupendra Patel for taking oath as Gujarat chief minister. I believe under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he will take Gujarat’s development journey to new heights by working with full devotion and dedication for the welfare of the poor, farmers and underprivileged sections of the state,” Shah tweeted. BJP president JP Nadda congratulated Patel for taking the chief minister’s chair. He also lauded Rupani for making every effort for the “development of the state and service of the people” in the previous five years.“I have full confidence that under the guidance and leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the pace of Gujarat’s journey of sustainable development will accelerate,” his tweet in Hindi read.Rupani also “conveyed congratulations” to his successor Patel, according to news agency ANI. He said that he has “full faith” in the BJP and the welfare of the state moving forward under Patel’s leadership. “Gujarat will become a role model for all states,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Hours after the ceremony, Patel held a high-level meeting with top officials to review the flood-like situation in some parts of Saurashtra region and instructed the authorities to airlift stranded people in rain-hit Jamnagar district.Incessant rains battered parts of Saurashtra region on Monday, leaving three people dead in Rajkot and Jamnagar as rivers overflowed and low-lying areas got flooded. The situation also prompted authorities to issue alerts and deploy National Disaster Response Force and state disaster response force for evacuation and relief.Prior to the swearing-in ceremony, Patel instructed Jamnagar district authorities to make necessary arrangements to airlift around 35 stranded persons of three villages, which were inundated and cut off from other parts of the district due to incessant rain on Sunday.According to Jamnagar district’s disaster management wing, the Indian Air Force (IAF) has been requested to airlift people stranded in some of the villages of Kalavad and Jamnagar talukas.The newly-sworn chief minister is the fifth politician from the Patidar community to occupy the top post since the state’s formation in1960, indicating the clout wielded by the influential social group. The state has had five Patel chief ministers out of total 17 since the state was formed 61 years ago.Patel’s elevation is being seen as an attempt by the BJP to woo the Patidars ahead of the 2022 polls and retain its grip on Gujarat, which has been under saffron rule for more than two decades. The Patidars are a dominant caste in Gujarat with a sizeable control over the electoral votes and dominate the political economy with a stronghold over education, realty and cooperative sectors. They constitute around 15 per cent of the state’s population.In the 2017 Assembly elections, BJP won 99 of the 182 seats and Congress got 77.The chief minister is considered to be close to former Gujarat chief minister and current Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel who quit the post in 2016 following the statewide Patidar quota agitation which had turned violent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-bring-new-energy-bhupendra-patel-sworn-in-as-gujarat-cm-101631557234477.html
14-09-2021||India||Oscar Fernandes: Soft-spoken, diligent workaholic who got Congress battle ready||In the spring of 2009, as the Congress party was getting ready to face the national elections, party president Sonia Gandhi told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that some ministers were required to move to the party organisation . The first name in the list was Oscar Fernandes, then the Union minister of labour and employment. Those who didn’t know the soft-spoken Fernandes, a lifelong Congressman from Udupi in Karnataka, may have been surprised at the choice. After all, he possessed neither the political skills of someone like Kamal Nath nor the electoral management abilities that Pranab Mukherjee or Ghulam Nabi Azad did. Yet Fernandes, a Rajya sabha member, who died on Monday at the age of 80 in Mangaluru from age-related illnesses, was a diligent backroom man. He would work for 16-17 hours a day, day after day, on all the small details that got a party battle-ready. Senior Congress leader BK Hariprasad remembers that when Fernandes was around, “the AICC office wouldn’t close before 3am.”  “We are deeply saddened by the demise of Shri Oscar Fernandesji; our heartfelt condolences to his family. A Congress stalwart, his vision for an inclusive India had a huge influence on the politics of our times. The Congress family will deeply miss his mentorship & guidance,” tweeted the Congress. Expressing his condolence, PM Narendra Modi said, “Saddened by the demise of Rajya Sabha MP Shri Oscar Fernandes Ji. In this sad hour, my thoughts and prayers are with his family and well-wishers. May his soul rest in peace.” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted that it was his “personal loss”. “He was a guide and mentor to many of us in the Congress Party. He will be missed and fondly remembered for his contributions.” During his tenure as the labour minister, Fernandes maintained a cordial ties with trade union leaders even from the other spectrum of political ideology. “He was a different labour minister. His biggest contribution was that he prepared the entire groundwork for abolition of the fixed-term employment in the factories that was brought in by the (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee government. When Mallikarjun Kharge succeeded him, the notification was issued,” said CITU general secretary Tapan Sen. His tenure also saw the maternity benefits law being strengthened with its coverage expanded to women in factories, mines, plantations, performance establishments, even stores with more than 10 employees. Fernandes, whose mother was India’s first female magistrate, joined the youth Congress in his district and made is name in 1980, when he defeated Tonse Ananth Pai, a legendary political leader and a banker (responsible for the rise of the Syndicate Bank) in the 1980 Lok Sabha elections from Udupi. He served in the Lower House till 1996; then moved to the Rajya Sabha in 1998. Interestingly, in an earlier election, Fernandes was the election agent of Pai. Oscar Fernandes’s entry into the Lok Sabha took him straight to then PM Rajiv Gandhi’s office where the young leader (he was only 39 at the time) was appointed the parliamentary secretary to Gandhi for a year. Fernandes, who started his career as a member of Udupi municipal council, went on to serve the Lok Sabha for five terms and was the sitting member of the Rajya Sabha in his third term. A trained Kuchipudi dancer, Fernandes and his colleague Veerappa Moily have even performed on stage in a dance recital. While his last outing as the minister was in labour and employment ministry, Fernandes really enjoyed organisational work. His aide BP Singh is now a secretary of the party. Organisational responsibility took him to several places, including the hinterlands of Bihar. Many Congress leaders remembered that in one such meeting, people asked him to speak in Hindi when he introduced himself as “Oscar Fernandes”! A sharp political mind, Fernandes restarted his speech saying, “Main hoon Oscar. Aur meri biwi (Blossom Fernandes) ka naam hai Phoolkumari.” When he was a minister, he once called this correspondent to meet him at 10 pm for a short meeting. The meeting eventually started at 11.50pm and ended at 12.10am. As this correspondent was about to leave the minister’s chamber, a smiling Fernandes said: “Remember, you came here yesterday and are leaving today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oscar-fernandes-soft-spoken-diligent-workaholic-who-got-congress-battle-ready-101631556991936.html
14-09-2021||India||Add suicide cases to Covid-19 death tally, SC tells Centre||The Supreme Court on Monday told the Union government that persons who died by suicide after suffering Covid-19 should also be considered to have died from the viral disease in the latter’s new guidelines for recognising deaths from the coronavirus disease in death certificates.It also wanted some clarifications in the procedure for issuing death certificates. Still, the bench said that it was largely satisfied with the guidelines. “Around 80% has been achieved. There are some creases that need to be ironed out,” the bench observed.Suggesting some other “grey areas” in the guidelines, the top court directed the Centre to consider its suggestions and file a detailed affidavit by September 23; the government is also expected to disclose the quantum of ex-gratia compensation payable to persons who died due to Covid-19.The guidelines presented to the apex court ahead of the hearing on Friday said any death within 30 days of a positive Covid test would be considered a Covid death, irrespective of whether this happened at home or a hospital. But deaths occurring due to poisoning, suicide, homicide, or accident were not to be treated as Covid deaths among people suffering from the disease, the guidelines added. They also clarified that the deaths of Covid patients who spent more than 30 days in hospital would also be treated as Covid deaths. The bench of Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna, said: “If the government is paying compensation to a particular class (of persons who died due to Covid), what about those who died by suicide because they were suffering from the illness. Ultimately, we have to consider suffering of people. Nobody will commit suicide without reason.”The guidelines were filed pursuant to a Supreme Court judgment of June 30 allowing ex-gratia compensation for those who died from Covid under the National Disaster Management Act 2005. These guidelines were meant to identify those eligible for such compensation.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the government said: “The guidelines need to be revisited. The cause of death may be suicide, but the cause of suicide can be Covid. Suppose a person is Covid positive and immediately dies by suicide, it can be considered.” Mehta further pointed out that the Centre had also complied with the scheme for ex-gratia compensation under the 2005 Act. He agreed to file a comprehensive compliance affidavit by the next date of hearing on September 23.The bench said, “Your guidelines suggest that irrespective of the fact that Covid is an accompanying condition, death due to suicide will not be treated as a Covid death.” Advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, one of the petitioners at whose instance the June 30 order was passed, told the Court that as according to a recent research study by NIMHANS, Bengaluru, Covid - related suicides were recorded to be well above the average national suicide rate. He said the Centre’s exclusion of suicide deaths linked to Covid was “irrational, arbitrary and illogical”.The bench told the petitioner, “Let the Centre apply their mind, or else we are here. It is a larger issue that affects suffering of people.”The Court also examined the other aspects of the guidelines which talked about the procedure for issuance of fresh death documents by a district-level committee comprising Additional District Collector, Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH), Additional CMOH/ Principal or HOD Medicine of a Medical College (if one exists in the district) and a subject expert. Requests for issuance of death certificate were to be disposed within 30 days, the guidelines added.The bench asked Mehta: “What about death certificates already issued by the authorities and where family members have dispute about the cause of death being Covid? We find that the district-level Committee is concerning future applications only. Also, what about documents from hospital certifying cause of death as Covid? Suppose any dispute arises, how will the family members prove the death was due to Covid?”The court put other pertinent questions to the Centre. “When will you constitute the Committee. There has to be a timeframe within which the states have to set it up.” In its June 30 order, the bench gave six weeks to the government to comply with its directions on ex-gratia compensation, death certificate guidelines and a national health insurance scheme for disaster-related deaths as envisaged by the Fifteenth Finance Commission. On August 16, the Centre was granted an extension of four weeks to frame the ex-gratia scheme under Section 12 (iii) of the 2005 Act as Covid was notified as a disaster under the same Act in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/add-suicide-cases-to-covid-19-death-tally-sc-tells-centre-101631556811958.html
14-09-2021||India||Jet to resume domestic operations in early 2022||Jet Airways plans to resume operations from the first quarter of 2022, the airline’s new management said on Monday, announcing plans to soon hire 1,000 people, and a shift to Delhi as the base of its operations.The airline stopped flying in April 2019 after it ran out of funds for its operations and debt. It is now controlled by an investor consortium of UAE-based businessman Murari Lal Jalan and London-based Kalrock Capital after a resolution plan was approved by a bankruptcy court this year.“Jet Airways 2.0 aims at restarting domestic operations by Q1-2022, and short-haul international operations by Q3/Q4 2022,” Jalan, the lead member of the Jalan Kalrock Consortium and the proposed non-executive chairman of Jet Airways said.The company also said it has applied for a revalidation of its air operator certificate (AOC), although allocations of flight slots are still pending. The new management is working with authorities and airport coordinators on slot allocation, required airport infrastructure, and night parking, it said.The company has already hired 150 employees, it said.“We received the NCLT approval in June 2021 and since then we have been working closely with all concerned authorities to get the airline back in the skies,” Jalan said.“Our plan is to have more than 50 aircraft in three years and more than 100 in five years which also fits perfectly well with the short-term and long-term business plan of the consortium. The aircraft are being selected based on competitive long term leasing solutions,” Jalan added.At one point, Jet, promoted by the founder Naresh Goyal, operated over 120 planes and flew to several major international hubs such as Singapore, London and Dubai, in addition to a wide domestic network. At its peak shortly after 2010, its business accounted for well over a fifth of the aviation sector in India as it operated over 300 flights a day. But the company slowly began to lose the market share as low-cost carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet grew. By 2018, Jet was running into losses and was unable to meet operational costs, such as payments to aircraft lessors and settling fuel bills.“The revival plan for Jet Airways is being implemented as approved by NCLT and all the creditors will be settled as per the plan in the coming months,” Kalrock Consortium said.Sudhir Gaur, the acting CEO, said that the airline will now be headquartered in the Delhi-NCR region and its senior management will work from the Corporate Office at Gurugram.“However, Jet Airways will continue to have strong and significant presence in Mumbai where it will work from its Global One office in Kurla. Jet Airways also has a state-of-the-art training centre located at Global One, which will be retained and used for in-house training for the Jet Airways team,” said Gaur.Domestic operations will be restarted with a narrow-body aircraft fleet that will be leased from major global aircraft lessors, he added.India’s aviation sector, like the global industry, was dealt a blow by the Covid-19 pandemic as all but essential travel ground to a halt for much of 2020. In India, the second wave took the wind out of a recovery in the first quarter of 2021 -- prompting some companies to talk of a government bailout.Experts said Jet’s revival in the time period disclosed by the company was achievable but some things will be key. Dhiraj Mathur, former partner at PwC, a global consultancy firm said: “Jet Airways 2.0 can be revived in the first quarter of 2022 if they are successful in acquiring slots. Everything else is doable.”Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer of Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA-India) said: “ Jet’s resumption in early 2022 is feasible post the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) approval. It also depends on their level of preparedness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jet-to-resume-domestic-operations-in-early-2022-101631556450831.html
14-09-2021||India||Govt won’t reveal if it used Pegasus, SC told||The Union government on Monday told the Supreme Court that it cannot make public whether its agencies used Israeli spyware Pegasus for mounting surveillance on Indian citizens since such disclosure will be against national interest, returning to a position it articulated on August 17, before suggesting last week that it could reconsider its stand.This prompted the court to remark that the Centre is “beating around the bush”.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, reserved its order on a clutch of petitions demanding a court-monitored probe into the alleged surveillance using Pegasus spyware after an 80-minute hearing during which the government refused to share any information on the use of Pegasus or the alleged snooping on some of the petitioners.The bench, which included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, said that the court will pass an interim order in the next 3-4 days on the constitution of an expert committee and other ancillary issues related to an independent inquiry after considering the materials placed by the petitioners and the submissions made by their lawyers.After seeking time last Tuesday to reconsider its previous stand against filing a detailed response on the bunch of petitions, solicitor general Tushar Mehta reiterated on Monday that the use of a particular software like Pegasus cannot be a subject matter of any affidavit or a public debate.The government is open to having a committee of independent domain experts who can go into all aspects of the controversy and submit its report before the bench, Mehta said, but the use of a particular software “cannot be made a part of the public discourse in the larger national interest and in the interest of the security of the nation”.The law officer said the government stands by its August 16 affidavit filed on the Pegasus snooping matter, which neither confirmed nor denied the use of the military-grade spyware to hack phones of ministers, politicians, businessmen, activists, and journalists, and which offered to set up an expert committee instead.The bench remained unimpressed with S-G’s contentions. “We said it very clearly even on the last date that nobody is interested in the disclosure of information that could compromise national security. We wanted a limited affidavit from you because we have petitioners before us, citing violation of their privacy...In the face of the allegations that some software was used to snoop on certain individuals like lawyers and journalists, it had to be made known whether there are methods of interception other than lawful means,” the court told Mehta.Observing that the S-G was “going in circles” despite the court’s repeated clarification on issues of national security, the bench added: “In your affidavit, you could clarify whether there was a lawful interception of the petitioners or not. And if there was any unlawful interception that was not in your knowledge, then it should be a matter of your concern too. Then, we can pass some directions on guidelines, legislative measures, etc.”Mehta, however, repeated that the government would not disclose whether it used Pegasus or not because that would have its pitfalls and such information could be used by terror groups to hamper the security of the nation.“You are going in circles again and again as if we want to know everything that the government is doing. These are serious allegations that phones were tapped through software and entire privacy was taken. Your minister also took note of the use of this software in his statement in the Parliament in 2019. We wanted a further affidavit to know where we stand...beating around the bush is not an issue here,” the court retorted.It further observed: “If the allegations are true, there are definitely effects (of such surveillance). There are different issues involved here. There is one issue about the technology; then there are issues of legal provisions of interception; there are issues of NSO making such services available to entities...We wanted a further affidavit and depending on that we could proceed. But now you have chosen not to do so, we will pass some interim orders.”Mehta, on his part, maintained that a facade is sought to be created that the government is hiding the truth whereas its stand is clear that it is not evading any inquiry but is rather willing to have it done on its own through a committee of independent experts.This submission was strongly objected to by petitioners’ lawyers, including senior counsel Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan, Rakesh Dwivedi, Dinesh Dwivedi, Colin Gonsalves and Meenakshi Arora. All these lawyers condemned the Centre’s refusal to come clean on the use of Pegasus while also urging the court to reject the government’s proposal to form a committee by itself.Sibal referred to a statement made by Ravi Shankar Prasad, the then Union law and IT minister, in Parliament in response to a question by AIMIM chief and lawmaker Asaduddin Owaisi. Prasad admitted that WhatsApp had notified the government about attempts to hack the phones of more than 100 users in India. Sibal said that the government is impeding the course of justice by keeping relevant information hidden from the highest court of the land and it indicates that the government has been using Pegasus against the citizens without any legal sanction.Most of the lawyers for petitioners pointed out that the government, being the “wrongdoer”, cannot be allowed to have a committee by itself and that the court should set up a panel consisting of members of its choice to go into the issue and report back.While Divan pressed for a directive to the cabinet secretary to file a “disclosure affidavit”, Dinesh Dwivedi asked for an interim order to restrain the government from using Pegasus against anyone.Mehta, at this point, reiterated that the court should allow the government to set up a committee, which, he said, will have experts completely unconnected with the government.“Suppose a committee examines it and places its report before us, then also everything will come into public domain...but ultimately it is your prerogative and you have decided not to file anything. We will now pass an interim order that we have to pass,” replied the bench, reserving its order.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international consortium of media outlets and investigative journalists reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. According to this consortium, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning the phone into a pocket spy.Responding to a bunch of petitions filed by lawyers, politicians, journalists and civil rights activists, the Union ministry of electronics and information technology filed a three-page affidavit on August 16 that refused to confirm or deny whether it had used Pegasus spyware for surveilling Indians. The Centre instead offered to set up an expert committee to look into the controversy and “dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests”.On August 17, the court observed that it is “not averse” to set up an expert committee to look into the alleged surveillance of Indian citizens with Pegasus spyware but that it expects the government to bring sufficient facts on record regarding the interception regime in India.The government, however, replied that any disclosure on its using or not using Pegasus spyware would come at the cost of national security and insisted that it will divulge such information only before the proposed committee, which, it said, can report to the top court.It also added that all interceptions were being done per the statutory procedure, and it would not wish to put out in the public domain details of the software used for lawful surveillance by filing any additional affidavit.Following the Centre’s refusal, the court on August 17 issued a formal notice to the government on the batch of pleas filed by petitioners in the case, a list that includes advocate ML Sharma, former minister Yashwant Sinha, Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas, the Editors Guild of India, journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar, journalists Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, Rupesh Kumar Singh, Ipshita Shatakshi, SNM Abdi, and Prem Shankar Jha, and civil rights activists Jagdeep S Chhokar and Narendra Mishra.Deferring the matter for September 7 , the bench had once again asked SG Mehta to consider filing a detailed reply while observing that the court would ponder over the future course of action in the meantime. On September 7, the S-G asked for some time to reconsider its earlier stand, following which the matter was fixed for hearing on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-won-t-reveal-if-it-used-pegasus-sc-told-101631556090841.html
14-09-2021||India||A different set of rules for ‘special’ Facebook users: Report||Social media company Facebook maintains a special list of users for whom its rules apply differently, at times leaving up content that it would otherwise pull down, according to a news report published on Monday.The Wall Street Journal cited an internal report from the review of a programme known as XCheck, or cross-check. The programme included 5.8 million politicians, celebrities and journalists for whom the rules applied differently. The disclosures contradict the company’s public stand that its rules apply to everyone equally. Today, the story said, XCheck shields millions of VIP users from normal enforcement process, the documents show, with some users “whitelisted”—rendered immune from enforcement actions—while others are allowed to post rule-violating material pending Facebook employee reviews that often never come.The WSJ report, citing the review, gave the example of a post by international football star Neymar, who put up nude photos of a woman who had accused him of rape.While no Indian example was cited in the report, the disclosures tie in with the news broken by WSJ in August, 2020 that Facebook left up an inflammatory post by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader in Telangana since its India-based executives feared blowback from the government.The issue since snowballed into a larger controversy that rang out in Parliament.In Monday’s report, WSJ quoted Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone as saying that XCheck was “designed for an important reason: to create an additional step so we can accurately enforce policies on content that could require more understanding.” Stone, however, accepted that the criticism of the programme was fair, the American newspaper said.The news report also characterised Facebook’s routine content moderation as dispensing “rough justice” – “the automated systems summarily delete or bury content suspected of rule violations without a human review. At other times, material flagged by those systems or by users is assessed by content moderators employed by outside companies”, it said.People on the XCheck list were exempted from these and the internal review of the controversial programme, which took place in 2019, found that most Facebook employees could add users into the system. According to an audit at the time, at least 45 teams around the company were involved in whitelisting users.The WSJ also quoted Facebook employees aware of the matter as saying that pulling VIP content at times required approval from senior executives on communications public policy teams, such as the company’s founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.It also cited discussions on the company’s internal messaging board for employees to say that a product manager involved with XCheck had agreed with the fairness concerns but said “we have to balance that with business risk”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-different-set-of-rules-for-special-facebook-usersreport-101631554950753.html
14-09-2021||India||Hathras rape: A year on, still living in fear, buried under social stigma||Hathras: His phone was buzzing. It was two days after his sister, 19, allegedly raped, died, with her body being consigned to flames with the administration watching. The stream of visitors was constant, from neighbours, to politicians, to an intrusive press. Most had never stepped into his mud and brick home before. There had been no peace. He was used to the ping, almost as if it was now a dirge for his loss.Yet, this alert was different. Ominous. Unsigned and from a number unknown to him. “Accept the reality and stop lying for money. Otherwise you won’t be able to hide anywhere in the country. All of you will be in jail,” read the text in Hindi, dated October 1. His sister was dead, his life torn asunder, but that message was a warning, that trouble was only just beginning. In a four-part series, HT returns to the scenes of crimes against women in rural India that have shaken the country over the past two decades, launched protests, and affected the course of law, to examine what has happened since, and if the social conditions that allowed for, and perpetuated these crimes, have changed at all. The first: Hathras, where exactly one year ago, on September 14, 2020, a 19-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly raped and assaulted. Days later, amid national outrage, her body was cremated in the dead of the night. The dramatic sequence of incidents once again put under the spotlight one of India’s stark realities -- the striking vulnerability of Dalits, especially women, in the countryside where upper caste power permeates every interaction and forces marginalised castes to be dependent on them for survival. The botched probe and police missteps also showed how caste dominance can shape government machinery, and how difficult it is for vulnerable communities to challenge perpetrators, even when the law is technically on their side. In the village, even as the rape-and-murder sparked nationwide protests, forced politicians to make a beeline for the village, and prompted the state government and the Supreme Court to step in and steer the investigation, the family has fought a separate, invisible battle -- against fear. Their trust in the local administration was shattered, and every time they stepped out, it was clear that the villagers had coalesced in support of the four accused – all Thakurs. “People would look at us like we had done something wrong, and said we targeted innocent boys,” said the mother of the victim. “My bacchi (child) was dead. But nobody believed us.” On October 27 that year, the Supreme Court ordered that central paramilitary forces be posted for the family’s security. Today, a year after the incident, roughly 35 personnel guard the family through the day. The Central Bureau of Investigation took over the case on October 10 and indicted the four accused men – Sandeep Singh, Ram Kumar Singh, Ravi Singh and Lavkush Sisodia – in a trial ongoing in the Hathras district court. Yet, attitudes, and theories in the village remain unchanged – the relatives did this for money, the girl was dating one of the accused, this is a family dispute, an attempt to tarnish the government. There is, above all, outrage at how impoverished Valmikis (the caste of the victim) defied local strictures to accuse people many stations above them. This worldview has spilled over into even the legal proceedings, alleged the victim’s sister-in-law. “We go to the courts to bear witness, they treat it like it’s their fief. Hamari beti bas hamari reh gayi, but woh char ladke pure gaon ke ho gayein hain (Our daughter is just ours, but it’s as if the four boys belong to the entire village).” 2 Roughly 20 minutes from the bustle of Hathras town, crop fields ring the village where the Valmiki family lives. Mud tracks branch off from the state highway, cutting through the fields to the village. In the monsoon, the fields flood and the one pucca road in the village turns into an island – where men set up charpoys and children wade through the muddy slush to get to the fields. The village of roughly 350 people has just four Dalit families – all hailing from the Valmiki caste, which is often forced to perform sanitation duties. One shares a mud wall with the victim’s family and another a front courtyard, used for buffaloes to rest and eat, but now occupied by CRPF personnel. Almost every family in the village works in agriculture – the higher castes as owners and cultivators and the rest as sharecroppers or farm labourers. It was in these fields that the victim’s mother first noticed her missing. Around 7.30am on September 14, the family was out cutting grass in the fields when the mother found her daughter injured and barely conscious, her clothes bloody and torn. They rushed to the police station, and then to the local hospital and finally the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh. On September 19, she gave a statement naming the accused and recorded her dying declaration on September 22. After she died in Delhi on September 29, the police rushed her body back to the village and at 2:30am the next day, forcibly cremated her. The administration later claimed that it took the consent the family and wanted to ward off law and order problems – but the family denied this and said only a distant relative was present. “I ran behind the van carrying her but couldn’t stop it. They didn’t let us see her one last time,” said the sister-in-law. 3 The Hathras district court sits atop a hill that it shares with a 200-year-old temple dedicated to Lord Krishna’s elder brother, Balaram. Like many small towns in the heartland, the district court premises is the nerve centre of the dusty town, and rows of tables with black-robed lawyers line the five-minute drive up the hill. It is here, in the special SC/ST court, that the trial has progressed over the past year. Of the 104 witnesses mentioned in the CBI charge sheet, the statements of 16 have been recorded. The victim’s elder brother is currently giving his statement in court. Hearings have grown increasingly acrimonious and things came to a head on March 5. The lawyer for the family, Seema Kushwaha said a drunk lawyer interrupted her during arguments and others barged into the courtroom and threatened her. “Seema, stay in your seema (boundary), they told me,” she said. She lodged a complaint and asked the high court to shift the trial. On August 26, the high court refused the request. Kushwaha has appealed to the Prime Minister and home minister for additional security. The defence case rests on three prongs: Establish that the victim and accused Sandeep had a relationship, question the lack of medical evidence, and blow holes in the dying declaration of the victim – which the CBI used to indict the four men. “They shared 105 calls. The girl’s brother says he didn’t see the murder happen, the mother says she was at a distance. Where is the medical evidence?” asked Munna Singh Pundhir, who represents the four accused. “They remain in jail only due to media.” Kushwaha rubbished this and pointed out that the girl had mentioned “zabardasti” on September 14, named the accused on September 19 before saying “balatkar” on September 22 -- without the police acting on it. “The medical examination was done eight days later, and after many changes of clothes. Moreover, the change in rape laws after 2013 don’t need semen to establish rape. These are all distraction tactics.” 4 The victim family’s refusal to obey to social hierarchies by fighting the case has galvanised the Thakurs and other upper castes. They agree on one thing: that the family brought a bad name to the village. “Before the murder, the upper castes in the village were divided and would fight among themselves. Now, they have united to fight because this is their honour,” said the sister-in-law. The village chief, Narendra Sisodia, said the villagers were united in seeking justice but cautioned that if anyone other than Sandeep (it’s a popular theory that he committed the crime and the others have been framed) was punished, or if the men were given the death penalty, the region will erupt in protest. “We are Thakurs, we will support them,” he said. Sisodia was one of the organisers of a controversial upper-caste mahapanchayat days after the crime in favour of the accused. Sandeep’s father, Narender, pointed to a 2001 case filed by the victim’s grandfather against his family for criminal intimidation, hurt and under the SC/ST Atrocities Act. That case was settled in 2015. “Has anyone seen the murder happen? Has anyone asked them if they did it? They’re out to destroy us,” he said. The village is split into two contrasting worlds: The upper castes believe nothing is amiss and it is only a matter of time till the Thakur men are acquitted. They say the region has never seen any caste disturbance, and take pride that they share space with the Valmikis. “We even invite them for our events,” said a young villager. Among the four Dalit families, however, there is despair. They say their children are hit when they take animals out for grazing, and threatened with police cases. They avoid local shops. “They say once the faujis (forces) leave, we’ll barge into our homes and thrash you,” said a woman neighbour, also Valmiki. A young Dalit boy said he is abused with slurs every time he ventures out of the house. His mother, a distant relative of the victim, said the children are often told they’ll be killed. The victim’s family has sold six of their seven buffaloes because they can’t go out and collect fodder. They live on the ₹25 lakh received as compensation, because they can’t hold down jobs due to court dates and stigma. Their kin say they are not allowed in local temples, are asked to stand away from the others at village shops, and their turn at the water pumps comes last. Villagers often refer to them as “basera” (settlers). “No one came to see us, know about our daughter. Now, even the other Dalits are scared of the villagers because they’re dependent on lands (largely owned by Thakurs and other upper castes),” said the victim’s father. The family feels that the tragic circumstances that upended their lives in October last year haven’t changed much -- the upper castes still control village life, the Valmikis are still vastly outnumbered, and though some policemen were suspended, the political and administrative set-up is still bereft of influential Dalit people. “The initial focus on Hathras ensured that things moved but over the past year, the pace has slowed, the trial is sluggish and things are back to being difficult for the family. There is hardly any improvement in the condition of local Dalit women, and the power structure continues to be dominated by the upper castes,” said Manjula Pradeep, director of the Dalit Human Rights Defenders Network.There is a sense of fragile security for now – thanks to 35 men and eight CCTV cameras – but they know that one day the CRPF will leave. “We have put our future at stake but at least our future generations will be treated better,” said the father. The sister-in-law offered less hope. “We know we will never be safe. Their mindset will never change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-rape-a-year-on-still-living-in-fear-buried-under-social-stigma-101631551530968.html

Then, it begins creating, funding, arming and legitimising groups which are committed to the politics of violence and terror. This State, once again as a matter of conscious policy, exports this terror to both the east and west of its borders. When international pressure builds up to crack down on such groups, the State pretends to do so — while covertly, and not so covertly, continuing to back its proxies. Eventually, to its west, the proxy wins. The world is exasperated, but then this State projects itself as the only player with the leverage to tame the violent impulses of its own proxies, which it helped put in power in the first place.

US special envoy on climate, John Kerry, lauded India’s leadership for setting a target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, while nudging New Delhi to commit to net-zero carbon emission goals. Mr Kerry’s visit, the second this year, comes on the heels of a string of high-profile visits to New Delhi, ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), which begins on November 1. The recently released Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change report said the world will miss its target of keeping global warming to under 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels. This threshold will be exceeded in the next two decades, resulting in a higher frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. India is seen as the world’s third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the US, though with far lower emissions per capita than the other two countries.
