25-09-2021||Mumbai||OBC reservation: Maharashtra government undecided over approaching SC||A day after promulgating an ordinance to provide up to 27% reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBC), the Maharashtra government is still undecided over approaching the Supreme Court (SC) as the state election commission already clarified that they have declared the bypolls in six zilla parishads (district councils) on the Apex Court directives and any change in it can be made with its directives only.Meanwhile, Chhagan Bhujbal, a senior NCP minister in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, said if the government doesn’t want to do anything then we will approach the court for OBC reservation through their outfit.Bhujbal is a food and civil supplies minister in the MVA government and heads an outfit — Akhil Bhartiya Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad (ABMPSP). It has held agitations for OBC reservation after SC scrapped the reservation.“No one has the right to interfere once the elections are declared. The Supreme Court in one of its verdicts has made this very clear. It won’t make any difference even if the state government decides to approach the Apex court. The ordinance can be implemented for the upcoming election in local bodies,” said a senior minister, wishing not to be named.“The state government is yet to decide the next course of action but if they don’t, then we will approach the Supreme Court,” said Bhujbal, who is also an OBC leader.State rural development minister Hasan Mushrif did not respond to calls and text messages.The state government on Friday issued an ordinance that provides up to 27% reservation to the OBC community in rural local bodies. But the issue could not be resolved as the state election commission has refused to implement the ordinance for the bypolls in six districts to be held on October 5. It has also told the state government that it will not be possible for them to provide reservation to the OBC community in the bypolls as they are holding them on the Apex court directives.The ordinance issued by the rural development department stated that the combined reservation quota comprising Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and OBC will not breach the 50% ceiling as mandated by the Supreme Court. For urban local bodies, it is in the process of promulgating an ordinance for OBC reservation in urban local bodies with approval from Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said they wrote to the state election commission for implementing the ordinance from the bypolls itself but they replied in negative. “Soon after the cabinet decision, we wrote to the state election commission requesting to consider the fresh reservation quota for holding bypolls in the backdrop of the ordinance. We told them if not considered then it may antagonize the OBC community, which may lead to a law and order situation in the state but they said they are unable to consider it at this stage and are following SC orders,” Kunte told HT.“The commission further assured to consider the amendment for OBC reservation if the Apex court issues fresh directives,” he added.On March 4, the Supreme Court scrapped the 27% OBC reservation in the local bodies elections and directed the state to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which reservation for the community could be fixed. It also allowed the state election commission to hold local bodies polls, which is scheduled to be held on October 5 without OBC reservation.State BJP unit asked the state government to approach the Apex court to postpone the bypolls. “By completing all the legal process, the MVA government should approach the Supreme Court to postpone the bypolls scheduled on October 5,” said Chandrashekhar Bawankule, general secretary, state BJP unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/obc-reservation-maharashtra-government-undecided-over-approaching-sc-101632594080831.html

The authority is communicating with the state government in this regard,” said Sanjiv Mittal, chairman of the Noida authority.The Noida authority had in January this year decided to ban the sale and purchase of plots and flats on group housing land allotted under the scheme in 2011. It also put a ban on issuance of commencement certificate to allow construction on new realty projects in sectors 79, 150 and 151, where land was allotted under the scheme. The authority took the decision after it realised that the most of the developers has hardly developed any sports facilities and flouted rules. According to authority officials, around 32,000 housing units have either been built or are under different stages of construction. “Model code of conduct is expected to be put in place in December this year as assembly polls are scheduled in February next year. After that, no new decision will be taken. It means the Sports City will continue to trouble buyers and realtors,” said a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media.Developers said that over ₹50,000 crore is at stake in these projects. “The Sports City is a mega project. We request the UP government to not delay it as it will cause a huge loss of business and may spell trouble to investors or homebuyers,” said Subodh Kumar, secretary (for west UP) of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), a developers’ group.Homebuyers are also disappointed with the authority. “The authority has stopped registry in these societies. If there were issues, why did it allow the realtors to build projects at the first place. We are planning to move the high court over the issue,” said Ashok Vardhan, founder general secretary of Sports City foundation, a residents’ group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidas-sports-city-scheme-fate-of-32k-housing-units-hangs-in-balance-101632593540665.html

The Varanasi tourism department had made a plan to connect the two corridors through the Ro Ro boat service, disclosed regional tourism officer, Keertiman Srivastava, adding that the two Ro-Pax boats, MV Swami Vivekananda and MV Sam Manekshaw, which arrived in the city over 10 months ago, were anchored in the Ganga here. Both the ships have been introduced for Ro Ro boat service which has already been started upto Chunar in Mirzapur. At a time, 200 people may travel by each ship. Mirzapur is around 70 km off Varanasi. After seeing Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi and offering prayers to Baba Kashi Vishwanath, the religious tourists interested in visiting Vindhyachal Corridor will board Ro Ro boat or ship. Devotional numbers will be played on the music system to create a devotional ambience on the ships during the journey. It will also give an opportunity to the religious tourists or pilgrims to enjoy a panoramic view and idyllic surroundings on either side of the Ganga between Varanasi and Vindhyachal. As the MV Vivekananda boat or MV Sam Manekshaw boat reaches Vindhyachal, it will be anchored at the ghat and pilgrims will go to the Vindhyachal Corridor where they will offer prayers to Maa Vindhyavasini and visit Kali Khoh and Maa Asthtbhuja Temple before boarding the boat for the return journey. Srivavastava said, “The journey by ship will be a unique experience for the pilgrims.” He said a tour package was being designed and would be ready soon. There was a plan to offer snacks like fried potatoes, puri-sabji and fruits to the pilgrims during the journey, he said. The RO-PAX (Roll-On-Roll-Off-Passenger-ship) boat is a double-ended ferry that sails at an average speed of 15-17 knots (31.48 kmph). Kashi Vishwanath Corridor is a project worth over 900 crore, likely to be ready by November. Over 75% of the work has already been completed. Vindhyachal Corridor is an ambitious project of the UP government led by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The project, worth about ₹128 crore, is likely to be completed in 2022 or in early 2023. A 50 feet wide Parikrama path (circumambulation path) will be built around Maa Vindhyavasini Temple as part of the Vindhyachal Corridor. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had laid the foundation of the Vindhyachal Corridor on August 1. Both the projects are aimed at adding facilities for the pilgrims. Just as the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor will ensure the visibility of the spires of the Kashi Vishwanath temple from the Ganga ghats of Varanasi, devotees will be able to see the Vindhyavasini Temple from the banks of the Ganga in Mirzapur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/boat-cruise-to-link-kashi-vishwanath-corridor-with-vindhyachal-101632593481064.html
25-09-2021||Noida||Centre gives in-principle approval to medical device park in Greater Noida||The Central government has given in-principle approval for a medical device park proposed in Sector 28 near the Noida International airport at Jewar, which is set to bring massive business opportunities and create jobs in the health sector in the region, said officials from the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) on Saturday. Arvind Kumar, under secretary with the government of India wrote to Alok Kumar, additional chief secretary, infrastructure and industrial development department, Uttar Pradesh government, and asked for a detailed project report for the medical device park to be submitted by December 23 this year. “We convey in-principle approval to the setting up of a medical device park on 350 acres of land on Yamuna Expressway as per the scheme guidelines of ‘Promotion of Medical Device Park’. The steering committee of the government decided that now the DPR is required to be submitted in 90 days time...,” said the letter dated September 24. In-principle approval means that the Yeida is expected to get over ₹1,000 crore in funding and other benefits from the Central government, said officials of Yeida.Yeida is all set to launch a plot and shed scheme under the project, touted to be one of the first medical device parks in the country, for setting up industrial units at the park that will emerge as a hub of manufacturing medical devices, such as ventilators, PPE kits, X-ray machines and other products. Arun Vir Singh, CEO of Yeida, said, “It is a big achievement that we have got the approval from the Central government for setting up the medical device park. It will be the first such park in the country and the work on the DPR is already underway. We will submit it within the stipulated time and plan to launch the plot and shed scheme around Dussehra.” In November 2020, Yeida had earmarked 350 acres of land for the medical device park and also sent a proposal to the state government. The state government had given in-principle approval to the project and decided to start work immediately as it will boost businesses in the region, said officials. The authority is expecting the Central government and private firms to invest ₹5,250 crore for the project once it is executed, said officials.Under the scheme ‘promotion of medical device park’ (launched as a follow up to an order issued by the ministry of chemicals, fertilizers and pharmaceuticals on July 27), the Uttar Pradesh government, on August 4, appointed Yeida as the implementing agency to execute the project. Subsequently, Yeida roped in Kalam Institute of Health Technology (KIHT), Visakhapatnam, to prepare the detailed report of the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/centre-gives-in-principle-approval-to-medical-device-park-in-greater-noida-101632593063572.html

PK Kaushik, project director, NHAI, who took over the project last month, said that the previous deadline of July 2021 could not be met due to the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns and ban on construction to control pollution. “An assessment of the work carried out on the project has been done and we have set a new deadline of June 2022 to complete this work. All efforts would be made to ensure the project is completed,” he said. The review and subsequent deadline revision come in the backdrop of Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari directing officials to expedite work on the project during a review of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. According to NHAI officials, work on Phase 2 of the Sohna Road, beyond Badshahpur and Sohna, is 70% complete while the work on an elevated road between Subash Chowk and Badshahpur is 55% completed. “We will focus on monitoring the work and hold regular meetings to ensure pace of work does not slow down,” Kaushik said. The first part of the project, across 21.66 kilometres, comprises an underpass (Rajiv Chowk to Subhash Chowk) and an elevated road (Subhash Chowk to Badshahpur). The second part involves the expansion of a 12.72-kilometre road from Badshahpur to Sohna, which will involve the construction of flyovers and underpasses at major crossings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/nhai-sets-june-22-deadline-for-sohna-road-project-101632591562980.html

Results of the autopsies are awaited.According to residents, two of the deceased, Jamshed (45) and Shahid (22), had initially entered the borewell to repair it but they could not exit the well. Two others who entered the borewell to rescue them also got stuck and died. The borewell was 12-15 feet deep, they said.Shahid and Jamshed were cleaning the well and digging to push a pipe inside it. At one point, the pipe got stuck and Jamshed, who is a borewell mechanic, entered the narrow well. “A rope, which was used to climb down, was wet and it appears that the first person who went inside the well slipped and became unconscious due to poisonous gas. In order to rescue him, others also went inside but could not come out,” Talim Ahmed, a resident of Neemka and a high court lawyer, said.When the first two persons failed to climb back up, two others, Zakir (25) and Yahya (19), also entered the well. “There was panic among the people after all the four persons failed to come out of the well. We feared the worst and no one else was ready to go inside. So, we used ropes and tools to get them outside the well. We rushed them to Civil Hospital in Punhana,” Arshad Hussain, a resident of Neemka, said.According to the police, a preliminary investigation revealed that the borewell was built on a private farm outside the village and the motor used to pump out the water was not working. The landowner had called the workers to clean the well. Prima facie, it appears the four persons died due to suffocation but exact reasons will be known after postmortem, they said.Narender Bijarniya, the superintendent of police for Nuh, said that the matter is under investigation and the initial probe reveals that the victims died due to suffocation. “We will get the exact reasons of death after post-mortem examination,” he said.The bodies will be handed over after the autopsy, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-suffocate-to-death-after-inhaling-poisonous-gases-inside-borewell-in-nuh-101632591561851.html
25-09-2021||Gurugram||Bandhwari landfill: Four acres for WTE plant to be cleared by November||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has set a November target for clearing the remaining four acres needed for operating a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at the Bandhwari landfill, officials said on Saturday.According to Sunder Sheoran, the executive engineer of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) wing of the MCG, around 0.2 million metric tonnes of legacy waste is to be cleared from the four acres. Any waste accumulated at a landfill or vacant plot for longer than a year is generally considered legacy waste.Sheoran said that on Wednesday, the MCG allocated work to a private contractor for clearing the legacy waste.“We are aiming to start the groundwork from next week. Our target is to clear all legacy waste from the four acres needed for the WTE by November. A contractor has been shortlisted for the project, following approval from the Haryana government and a work order has already been issued,” Sheoran said.Sheoran said that as per the agreement, the contractor will need to implement extensive use of “movable” waste segregating machines to clear the legacy waste.“The pattern in which the legacy waste has accumulated over the four acres is such that it cannot be cleared through fixed trommel machines. Movable machines are needed that can reach the summit of the heaps of garbage and start clearing it from there. The contractor has been directed to use only such equipment for the task,” Sheoran said.MCG officials said that the entire project of clearing the waste is expected to cost around ₹15 crore.Around 1,800 tonnes of daily waste is dumped at the Bandhwari landfill from Gurugram and Faridabad. With the plant non-operational since 2013 following a fire, 2.5 million tonnes of legacy waste has accumulated at the site in the past eight years.At the start of this year, National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed the MCG to start treating the legacy waste or face sanctions, following which the WTE project gained momentum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bandhwari-landfill-four-acres-for-wte-plant-to-be-cleared-by-november-101632591560493.html
25-09-2021||Gurugram||Bandhwari landfill: Six acres cleared for WTE plant, work to start imminently||After clearing legacy waste from six acres at the Bandhwari landfill, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has directed its concessionaire to start the process of setting up a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at the site. Officials said that four more acres, required for the WTE plant, will be cleared by November.Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG, said, “Clearing legacy waste at the landfill is being carried out on a large scale. The setting up of the WTE is aimed at expediting this process. We have cleared adequate space to start the construction of the WTE plant and are in the process of clearing more area to facilitate its full construction.” A letter issued by MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja to MCG’s concessionaire, Ecogreen, last week states that six of the 10 acres for setting up the WTE plant have been cleared through treatment of legacy waste.“Out of 10 acres proposed land for WTE, six acres land have been cleared by treatment of legacy waste and by taking other measures. Now, this six acres is being handed over to you (Ecogreen) for construction of WTE and remaining four acres will be reclaimed and handover to you shortly,” a letter sent by Ahuja to Ecogreen, a copy of which is with HT, stated.In the letter, Ahuja directed Ecogreen to take over the six acres immediately to “start the work of construction of WTE plant without any delay.”Officials of Ecogreen said they are waiting for a formal letter from the MCG on the matter.Sanjeev Sharma, spokesperson, Ecogreen, said, “We are yet to receive any formal letter on the matter from the MCG. However, both the MCG and Ecogreen have been working together towards ensuring the WTE project can be started at the earliest possible timeline.”During a meeting with Ecogreen representatives in June, Ahuja had set the company an October deadline for starting work on setting up the Bandhwari WTE project.The memorandum of understanding (MoU) for setting up the WTE plant was signed in August 2017 by Ecogreen, the Haryana government, MCG, Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF), and the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB). Despite getting clearances from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) in December 2019 for setting up a 15 megawatt (MW) capacity WTE, the project has been stuck due to lack of space at the landfill.Although the government had given environmental clearance for the setting up a 15 MW WTE plant at Bandhwari in November 2019, the proposed expansion of the plant to 25 MW had evoked a strong reaction from citizens, including environmentalists, doctors, and residents of villages near the landfill during a public hearing held on August 31 by the HSPCB.A public hearing is a prerequisite for obtaining environmental clearance from the ministry of environment, forests, and climate change (MoEF&CC) for setting up a WTE project. For the 15 MW project, a public hearing was conducted in March 2018.“The MCG needs to show photographic or video evidence about the action they carried out with the legacy waste cleared from the six acre. There needs to be proper accountability on whether the cleared waste was scientifically treated or simply shifted to a location outside the city,” Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bandhwari-landfill-six-acres-cleared-for-wte-plant-work-to-start-imminently-101632591380398.html
25-09-2021||Other||Owaisi flays SP, Cong for silence on Maulana Kaleem’s arrest, other issues||The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief, Asaduddin Owaisi, has hit out at the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress for keeping mum on the recent arrest of Muslim cleric Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui in Meerut.Addressing a public meeting at Islamia Intermediate College in Old City area, on Saturday, Owaisi urged Muslims to support former MP Atiq Ahmad and his kin who are expected to contest from different constituencies and AIMIM candidates in the upcoming state elections in Uttar Pradesh.The UP Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) had arrested well-known Islamic scholar Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui from Meerut on September 22 for allegedly running a conversion racket. A local court had then remanded Siddiqui to judicial custody till October 5.“The SP and Congress are silent on the arrest of Maulana Kaleem out of a fear of losing their votes of other communities. The SP and Congress have been using Muslims for their own gains but have done nothing for their equal representation in politics and jobs. They remain silent on various issues of Muslims and have continued to betray them for the last 60 years. The SP and Congress leaders themselves remain silent on injustices to Muslims and claim that my statements on such issues benefits BJP,” Owaisi said.Flaying the BJP for playing communal politics, Owaisi said that while Atiq Ahmad, Mukhtar Ansari, Azam Khan and hundreds of Muslims are languishing in jail, cases against BJP leaders accused of Muzaffarnagar riots have been withdrawn. Even chief minister Yogi Adityanath withdrew criminal cases against himself. The BJP government demolished the house of ex-MP Atiq and many other Muslims as part of a crackdown on the community, he said. Moreover, the recent anti-conversion law introduced by the BJP government is also highly biased, he alleged.The rights of not only Muslims but also of Dalits, OBC, tribal community members are under threat, the AIMIM chief said while urging these communities to support and vote for his party in the upcoming elections. Commenting on Atiq’s letter from the jail read by his wife, Shaista Parveen, Owaisi said that he was against injustice to anyone in the country. “Atiq Ahmad and his family are suffering but the Samajwadi Party who used him for several years did not speak for him. It is time that Muslims vote for AIMIM without fearing that their vote to the party may benefit BJP. Muslims should support AIMIM similar to how the Yadav community supports Samajwadi Party and dalits support the BSP,” he said.Earlier, members of a saffron organisation blocked Shastri Bridge to stop the fleet of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi from entering the city. Over two dozen activists raised slogans against Owaisi demanding him to go back. Cops at Jhunsi police station soon reached the spot and asked the activists to clear the road. Police resorted to mild force to disperse them when they refused. Owaisi who was coming from Varanasi then proceeded to MIC college for the scheduled public meeting.SP used me for years: Atiq in letterPRAYAGRAJ: Mafiosi-turned-politician and former MP Atiq Ahmad’s wife, Shaista Parveen, read a letter by Atiq addressed to the people of Prayagraj at the rally. In the letter, Atiq alleged that the Samajwadi Party used him for many years for political gain and sent him to jail when elections were nearing. Samajwadi Party wants Muslim leaders who do not raise a voice for the community. “I helped the Samajwadi Party gain ground in the region and helped it by all means possible,” Shaista read. Through the letter, Atiq demanded 22% Muslim representation in police and other jobs. He accused the BJP of not allowing the AIMIM chief to meet him at Ahmedabad Jail.He admitted to mistakes having been committed by him, his relatives and associates. “I agree that some of my relatives harassed people but I was not aware of their acts. They even betrayed me and I apologise for all the wrong doings. I urge people of Prayagraj and other places to support the AIMIM in the upcoming elections and boycott other parties who pretend to be secular,” Atiq wrote in his letter.PHOTO CAPTION: (Pix by:)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/owaisi-flays-sp-cong-for-silence-on-maulana-kaleem-s-arrest-other-issues-101632590420295.html
25-09-2021||Lucknow||Noise pollution by modified bikes: Lucknow bench of HC pulls up authorities||The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has expressed displeasure over the lackadaisical attitude of the authorities concerned in taming the noise pollution caused by modified silencers, hooters and pressure horns of two-wheelers. The high court took suo-motu cognizance of the noise pollution caused by modified bikes on July 20 this year and directed state authorities to take stern action, in accordance with the law, to check the menace. A division bench of justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and justice Abdul Moin on September 22 said: “We have gone through the said affidavits. The said affidavits are mere eyewash because the authorities have not indicated the concrete steps taken by them pursuant to the cognizance taken by the court and have not responded to the suggestions given by the Amicus Curiae.” On September 14, the court had directed additional chief secretary (Home) and the DGP to file personal affidavits pointing out steps taken to check noise pollution caused by pressure horns of modified bikes. During the hearing of the case, Gaurav Mehrotra, Amicus Curiae, appointed by the court, apprised that noise pollution was being caused through modified silencers, hooters and pressure horns and nothing concrete had been done by the authorities concerned in this regard to check the menace.“This Court is prima facie of the view that all the officials who have been impleaded in the present PIL for controlling noise pollution and to crack down on such vehicles causing noise pollution through modified silencers, hooters and pressure horns have miserably failed in their duty and no concrete action has been taken in this regard and thus should be summoned in person,” observed the court. However, on the request of additional chief standing counsel, advocate HP Srivastava, who was representing the state government, the court allowed additional chief secretary (Home), additional CS (Transport) and the director general of police to file personal affidavits indicating actions taken to control the menace of pressure horns. “In case no concrete action is taken, the court would be compelled to summon the officer(s) to appear in person before this court for not having complied (with) the specific directions issued by this court. The respondents would also look into the suggestions given by the Amicus Curiae and give their response,” said the court. The court fixed September 29 as the next date for hearing the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/noise-pollution-by-modified-bikes-lucknow-bench-of-hc-pulls-up-authorities-101632589459997.html
25-09-2021||Noida||Six arrested in Greater Noida for smuggling, selling marijuana in NCR||The Special Task Force (STF), Noida and Surajpur Police on Friday seized over 250 kilograms of marijuana and arrested six persons in Greater Noida. They said the suspects would bring narcotic products from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh and sell them in the national Capital region (NCR). Raj Kumar Mishra, additional superintendent of police, Noida STF, said that the police received information that the suspects would be transporting a huge quantity of marijuana from Lucknow to Surajpur on Friday. “The suspects had come in a Mahindra pick-up and a Maruti Swift Dzire in Surajpur. They were transferring the marijuana packets from the pick-up van to the car when the police raided them. The police recovered 250kg marijuana in 48 packets from their possession,” he said. Police identified the suspects as Firoz Khan, 35, from Ghaziabad; Amit Sahni, 30, Sachin Kumar, 28, and Sonu, 25, from Sonipat in Haryana; and Jitendra Kumar, 30, and Mahesh Yadav, 32, from Banda in Uttar Pradesh. During interrogation, Khan revealed that he worked as a vegetable seller in Ghaziabad. “He said his cousin Sadique alias Guddu is involved in smuggling marijuana. The police arrested Guddu a few months ago in Chhattisgarh; he is presently in judicial custody,” Mishra said. Police said that Khan and Guddu visited Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh five years ago and bought marijuana. “They sold marijuana in the NCR. Khan then involved some other people and started smuggling marijuana from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh,” he said. The market price of the seized marijuana is around ₹1.25 crore, the police said. Police have registered a case against them under sections 18 and 20 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. “The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/six-arrested-in-greater-noida-for-smuggling-selling-marijuana-in-ncr-101632589099730.html
25-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Officials take stock of pollution near air quality monitoring station||Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) officials inspected the area near the continuous ambient air quality monitoring station (CAAQMS) at Sanjay Nagar on Saturday and said they will resolve issues pertaining to the high pollution levels recorded at the station.UPPCB officials said that the monitoring station at Sanjay Nagar has recorded high readings for the pollutants PM10 and PM2.5 in the past, which affects the ambient air quality of the Ghaziabad district.The district has four monitoring stations at Vasundhara, Indirapuram, Sanjay Nagar, and Loni. Of the four, the last two usually record high pollution levels, which further add to Ghaziabad’s pollution level index.“Initially we tried to relocate the monitoring station at Sanjay Nagar to another location, but the plan could not materialise. A team of officials, therefore, inspected the location and decided to chalk out a blueprint to remove issues that increase pollution levels around the monitoring station,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB.The CAAQMS is located at the building of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital, which is at a distance of a few kilometres from residential, commercial, and industrial areas.Despite this, the station provides high readings in terms of Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 and PM10.On Saturday, officials said they found that roads near the hospital need repair; a private bus stand nearby is surrounded by loose soil and needs to be fixed; a vacant plot belonging to the fire department needs to be equipped with a boundary wall, among other issues.“We have asked the Ghaziabad development authority to map vacant plots in the area. The corporation has decided to repair the roads and landscape the area wherever required. Other issues which crop up due to construction work of the regional rapid transit system (RRTS) project will remain till the project is completed,” Sharma added.The work for the RRTS project is taking place on the Delhi-Meerut Road, which is an estimated aerial distance of about two kilometres from the site of the CAAQMS.In terms of pollution, Ghaziabad is listed among the 16 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh with high pollution levels.Cities are declared non-attainment if, over a five-year period, they consistently do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for PM10 or NO2 (nitrogen dioxide).Officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation said that different departments will work to clean the area.“We will bring all respective agencies on board and some works will also be taken up by the corporation. We hope that the pending issues near the site will be resolved before the onset of the winter season,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-officials-take-stock-of-pollution-near-air-quality-monitoring-station-101632588739755.html
25-09-2021||Pune||PMC mulling triple-decker flyover at Sinhagad road||PUNE: The design of the proposed flyover between Rajaram bridge and Funtime cinema on Sinhagad road is likely to be altered in favour of a three-deck structure in keeping with Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari’s suggestion.During the foundation stone-laying ceremony on Friday, Gadkari had instructed the PMC to consider changing the flyover’s design to at least a double-deck. “The PMC is investing a lot of funds in this flyover. If the municipal corporation adopts the new technique we have introduced in NHAI, there will be a three-layer flyover in the same cost. The first two layers can be used for private vehicles whereas the third layer will be for the elevated metro. I would construct a multilayer flyover in the same budget,” Gadkari had said.After the Union minister’s announcement, officials of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) – which is in charge of the flyover - said that they are now contemplating adopting the technique being used by NHAI as suggested by Gadkari. The first two decks will be for private vehicles whereas the third deck will be an additional provision for the elevated metro line in future, they said.Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said, “The PMC has now approved Rs135 crore for this flyover which is between Rajaram bridge and Funtime cinema. If by spending a little more than the current provision, we can get a multilevel flyover, we will definitely check that option. I will call a meeting with the municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar and our engineers for the same and we will discuss it.”“Although the work order has been given, the actual construction of the flyover on the ground has not yet started. If before starting the work, we can check the possibility of going for a new design, I don’t think there would be any issue. We can adopt all these changes,” Rasne said.PMC additional engineer and in-charge of the proposed flyover, Srinivas Bonala, said, “We will definitely check regarding the new technique with NHAI. As NHAI has approved a multilayer flyover at Katraj as part of its own project, we will communicate with the same consultant. If the cost is more or less the same and we can get a multilayer flyover in that, we will definitely consider it. We will communicate for the same.”While the PMC’s earlier plan was to build a single-deck flyover within 36 months, the changes, if any, could delay the work on Sinhagad road, which is already grappling with heavy traffic, often resulting in chaos. Meanwhile, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said, “Gadkari called me in the morning on Friday and requested me to come 15 minutes earlier as he had something on his mind. Gadkari suggested that necessary changes be made in both the Sinhagad and Katraj flyovers. Gadkari discussed the idea with me and I think it is good to go for a multilayer flyover in the same cost.”Earlier, Gadkari had instructed the NHAI as well to consider a double-decker flyover at Katraj after which NHAI is now revising its plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-mulling-triple-decker-flyover-at-sinhagad-road-101632588679699.html
25-09-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: DPR for multi-modal transport project gets board’s approval||The Greater Noida authority on Saturday approved the detailed project report (DPR) of a multi-modal transport project and a logistic hub that has been proposed on 478 hectares of land in Bodaki village during its 123rd meeting at its main administrative building in Knowledge Park-IV. The DPR will now be sent to the state government for approval, said officials. “The work on these mega projects will start once the UP government gives the green signal,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO of the Greater Noida authority.The project will provide world-class modes of conveyance for the growing population in the catchment zone and also cater to the upcoming developments in Uttar Pradesh and the sub-region of the NCR and thus, help in decongesting Delhi, said officials. The mulit-modal transport hub will have a railway terminal, international busterminal and Metro connectivity. The railway line is already passing through Bodaki and is connected to the Metro via the Aqua Line of Noida Metro. The Indian Railways has already given its approval for the railway terminal at Bodaki, from where trains to East UP, West Bengal and Bihar will be available. Currently people from Noida and Greater Noida have to go to Delhi to travel by train to these states.“The multi-modal transport hub and logistic hub will be developed in the next five years. A 3km Metro Line will have to be built to connect the Noida Metro’s Aqua Line with Bodaki. Once it is developed, this area will have world-class connectivity and boost growth in the region,” said Bhooshan. The board also approved six new electric sub-stations in Sector Knowledge Park-V, Ecotech 8, 10, 11, Amarpur and Jalpura. These sub-stations will be in the range of 220KV to 400 KV, said officials.The authority will develop eight new industrial sectors as the demand for land for setting up industries is increasing in the city after work began for the Noida international airport at Jewar. The BPO and IT-enabledplot owners can get the registry of their property done by March 2022 as they could not complete the formalities due to Covid-19 this year. It has adopted UP data center guidelines 2021 to boost data centric business in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-dpr-for-multi-modal-transport-project-gets-board-s-approval-101632588319662.html
25-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Dengue cases double in nine days, tally highest since 2017||The number of people infected with dengue fever has crossed 200-mark so far this month in the district, with the last 100 cases reported in the past nine days, according to figures of the district health department. The district took 15 days to reach first 100 cases on September 15, the data showed. On Saturday, Ghaziabad, that saw its first dengue case this year on September 1, reported 17 new cases, taking the tally to 222 in the district. Health department officials said the trend will continue and cases are likely to subside in the last week October. A 45-year-old woman, a resident of Sanjay Nagar, was suspected to have died of dengue but the hospital, where she was admitted, was not able to provide a report confirming the infection. “The woman got admitted to the hospital on September 19 and later put on ventilator support in ICU. She died on September 24 with cause of death as cardiac arrest and sceptic shock. The hospital has been asked to provide a dengue confirmatory report, but it has not been able to provide the report yet. We also asked the state officials, but they said that it will not be treated as death due to dengue without a confirmatory report from the lab,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer.In the past nine days, the district has also reported 10 cases of scrub typhus, taking the tally to 39, while it added two more malaria cases (total 15) during the same period. Scrub typhus is caused by a bacterium called Orientia tsutsugamushi and the disease spreads to people through bites of infected larval mites. “The cases of dengue have increased while the cases of scrub typhus have shown a declining trend. With anti-larvae and fogging activities going on extensively, we have been able to curb malaria cases to a large extent. Since the monsoon season is still on with frequent rains, it is likely that the cases of dengue and malaria will subside by the end of October,” said Gupta. “We may continue with our fogging and anti-larvae drives in the first two-three weeks of October,” Dr Gupta added. Officials said the dengue cases reported so far in Ghaziabad are the highest since 2017 when the district had recorded a total of 232 such cases. According to the data, the rate of hospitalisation of dengue patients is 76.09%, while it is 87.17% in cases of scrub typhus. Experts said that the cases of dengue seem to have reached their peak and likely to subside as the monsoon activity reduces in coming weeks. “We can say that the dengue cases have almost reached their peak. However, this year frequent rains and subsequent waterlogging in several parts of the district have complicated the situation,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). “Besides, cases of viral fever continue to emerge. It has been over one month that such cases have kept on coming,” Dr Agarwal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-dengue-cases-double-in-nine-days-tally-highest-since-2017-101632587959584.html
25-09-2021||Other||High Court stays UPHESC order compelling contractual employees to join as outsourced employees||The Allahabad High Court on Friday directed the state government and UP Higher Education Services Commission (UPHESC) to file their replies on a petition alleging that the commission was compelling its contractual employees to join as outsourced employees of a contractor engaged subsequently by the commission. The court while staying the September 2, 2021 order of UPHESC asked the state government and the commission to file their replies in the case within 2 weeks and also listed the case after the expiry of two-week period. Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra passed the above order on a petition filed by Mahaboob Ali who was engaged as a computer operator/clerk on contractual basis by the commission since 2011. The court also directed that the petitioner be allowed to continue in the employment of the commission in the manner as was being done earlier during the pendency of the petition. Advocate Tanisha J Monir appearing for Ali argued, “Petitioner was working satisfactorily for the last 10 years. However, on September 2, 2021 an order was passed by the commission which compelled the petitioner to join as an outsourced employee of a contractor.” “Having been directly engaged as a contractual employee, the commission cannot compel the petitioner to continue in employment through an outsourced agency. There was no requirement whatsoever, of re-styling the petitioner as an outsourced employee if he was indeed an employee appointed on contractual basis, which clearly goes to show the malafide intention of the commission to deprive the petitioner of his right to seek regularisation and other allied benefits,” argued Monir. The court observed,” Prima facie this court finds no good ground for the commission to compel the petitioner to function as an outsourced employee of a contractor engaged subsequently by the commission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-court-stays-uphesc-order-compelling-contractual-employees-to-join-as-outsourced-employees-101632587899681.html
25-09-2021||Mumbai||ED issues second summons Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers have issued a second summon to Maharashtra cabinet minister Anil Parab asking him to remain present before the agency’s officials on September 28 for questioning in connection with former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s bribery-cum-money laundering case. Shiv Sena leader and state transport minister Parab was first summoned by the anti-money laundering agency on August 31. But the minister had then sought some time as he needed to attend some already scheduled public functions. It is pertinent to note that the agency, in its recently filed charge sheet against Deshmukh’s two close (arrested) aides, had stated that the suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze in his statement has claimed that he has overheard someone saying that Parab received crores of rupees through Nagpur’s deputy regional transport officer (RTO) Bajrang Kharmate as a bribe for the transfers of 10 DCPs in Mumbai last year. Sources said that ED is trying to collect strong evidence against Parab and former home minister Anil Deshmukh to prove the allegations of bribery in transfer and postings of government officers. Earlier the ED questioned Bajrang Kharmate, one of the officers, against whom an RTO officer had complained, for seven-and-a-half hours. Kharmate is believed to be a close aide of Parab. His name is said to have cropped up in the statements of some witnesses in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case against Deshmukh. His phone has also been scanned by the investigators. Earlier in September, ED had raided some places linked to Kharmate in Pune and Nagpur and had also recorded statements of a few witnesses. The money laundering case against Deshmukh was registered after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against him on April 21. Deshmukh had in the past said that the allegations against him are false. The Central agency has alleged that while serving as the Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze — who has now been dismissed and is in Taloja jail for his alleged role in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases — collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”. Later, through hawala channels, the money was sent to two brothers in Delhi who operated bogus companies, said the agency. It claimed that the two brothers later diverted the money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, an educational trust controlled by the Deshmukhs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-issues-second-summons-maharashtra-transport-minister-anil-parab-101632587659707.html
25-09-2021||Mumbai||WHO model for measuring emissions incorrect; may need to revise guidelines for cookstoves: Study||The World Health Organisation (WHO) may need to revise its cookstove-based guidelines for emissions from biomass fuels as the existing model for measuring emissions can overestimate the same, according to a new study by researchers from Johns Hopkins University (JHU), USA. This means that the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) may also need to revise its methodology to estimate the emission rates necessary for standardising improved cookstoves. In a recent paper, researchers at Bloomberg School of Public Health, department of environmental health and engineering, JHU, estimated the air exchange rates determined from real-time measurements of PM2.5 concentrations in kitchens and living room areas in residences in rural Bangladesh. The findings, which are also relevant to rural India, have been published in the December 2021 volume of the peer-reviewed journal Building and Environment.Household air pollution impacts approximately 41% of the global population, according to multiple researchers. WHO estimates that 4.3 million people die every year from exposure to indoor air pollution, with 1.7 million of these deaths occurring in the South-East Asian region. Emissions from cookstoves are significant contributors to indoor air pollution.Fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, is an air pollutant suspended in the air that is released from burning of biomass fuels. When present in high levels in the air, PM2.5 can be very harmful to human health.“The air exchange rate (AER), or the rate at which outdoor air replaces indoor air is a critical parameter for evaluating the quality of ventilation in an environment,” said Darpan Das, a post-doctoral fellow at JHU and the first author of the paper titled ‘Estimating residential air exchange rates in rural Bangladesh using a near field-far field model’.In 2014, WHO issued guidelines had recommended an annual average indoor air quality concentration of below 35 μg/m, based on air exchange rates. For decades, the measurement for estimates of air exchange rates from PM2.5 emissions and concentrations have been done on the assumption of a one-compartment model. Such a model assumes that the indoor environment is a homogenous, instantaneously mixed zone. This model is referred to as the well-mixed room (WMR) model of a room of a certain volume, through which the ventilation airflow rate is constant. The air entering the room has a contaminant concentration. There is also a contaminant source within the room that is generating the particulate contaminant at a constant rate.“The WMR model as the name suggests assumes a uniform concentration throughout the room. It gives a reasonable estimate of exposure intensity for individuals who are not positioned close to the emission source. However, spatial monitoring of kitchen indoor environments air indicates that concentration is higher near the cookstove source than at distant points in the kitchen or other rooms. While it is common to use a WMR model for estimation of ACH in rural households, this assumption is only valid for conditions in rooms that are far away from the cookstove source (e.g., living rooms) and not necessarily for the kitchen, especially very close to the cookstove,” said Das, who has now joined as a scientist at WHO collaborating centre for occupational health located in Edinburgh, Scotland.In this paper, the researcher shows that the situation is better represented by a two-compartment model. This change results in dramatically lower estimates of the air exchange rates through the residence, and these lower values, in turn, result in very different values for the required emission rates of fine particles from biomass-based cookstoves.A one-compartment model or well-mixed room model is where the indoor environment is a homogeneous single mixed zone. As opposed to the single zone model with a WMR assumption, the two-compartment model used by the researchers in the study conceptually divides the indoor space into two zones — kitchen and living room.“The air exchange rate estimated using a one-compartment model is unrealistically high and >20, whereas a two-compartment model yields more realistic values <1. The findings of the present study indicate that the two-compartment model is a better representation of concentrations of pollutants emitted by cookstoves near the source and leads to better estimates of the air exchange rates than the one-compartment model,” Das added. The project was funded by the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences and Johns Hopkins National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Education and Research Centre grant.Das said, “This paper will have potentially significant policy implications for indoor air quality in developing nations. While the one-box compartmental model is appropriate for estimating exposures farther away from emission sources, a 2-box model may be more appropriate for distinguishing between exposures of the cook versus other occupants in the house, as well as estimating ventilation rates in the house.” The revised methodology can be used by WHO to devise the emission rate targets for cookstovesAnkit Gupta, senior scientist, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Mumbai, who was not a part of the study, said, “The AER in rural kitchens is one of the most significant parameters which is less researched while we discuss the dose-exposure of individuals. The individuals’ exposure largely depends upon AER, which is being used to arrive at disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and health burdens in developing countries. It is the right time that we generate the right data sets resulting in an appropriate model for effective decision making on rural kitchen interventions.”Srinidhi Balasubramanian, former postdoctoral research associate, University of Minnesota and an incoming assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, who was not a part of the study, said, “Reducing the health burden from household air pollution is one of the biggest environmental challenges today. We need improved methods to quantify the emissions and impacts of pollutants from indoor sources such as cookstoves. This study presents a way forward, through the use of a two-compartment model instead of a one-compartment model to better model air exchange rates in different microenvironments such as the near-to-source kitchen and the far vicinity living spaces. Such results will definitely be valuable in developing guidelines for low emissions cookstoves. I also see value in using the methodology towards studying indoor air quality in spaces such as hostels, schools, and perhaps even to study the airborne transmission of diseases.”How emissions are currently measured:One compartment model or well-mixed room model is where the indoor environment is a homogeneous single mixed zone. Most studies have estimated air exchange rates using this model in rural households.What this study uses:The two-compartment model is also known as the near field far-field model (NF:FF). As opposed to the single zone model with a WMR assumption, the NF-FF conceptually divides the indoor space into two zones — kitchen and living room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/who-model-for-measuring-emissions-incorrect-may-need-to-revise-guidelines-for-cookstoves-study-101632587539542.html

25-09-2021||Mumbai||Politicising rape incidents for mileage is disgusting, Shiv Sena slams BJP||Days after the Dombivli rape incident came to the fore, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana defended the police force saying it took prompt action without worrying about the political connections of the accused in the case. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece also attacked Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for politicising the rape cases to gain political mileage and termed such politics as disgusting. “When the rape cases come to the fore, the political parties make an issue out of it to gain the political mileage. This type of politics is disgusting,” the editorial said. It said that the Opposition must understand the two rape cases, referring to the Saki Naka incident and the Dombivli case where a 15-year-old girl was raped by 32 accused over nine months. “As soon as the case came to light, the police gave assurance to the girl and got her to file a complaint. The police carried out their duty well and the Dombivli incident is serious... Without worrying about the pressure that the accused are from the powerful background and have strong political connections, the police immediately arrested the accused. Why is the Opposition party (BJP) turning a blind eye and engaging in mudslinging on the government and the police?” the editorial asked.The editorial further added that had the girl complained earlier the picture would have been different. “The Dombivli victim was subjected to the perverse exploitation for nearly eight months by 32 people. The sexual exploitation started from her acquaintance and the girl remained quiet. Had the girl knocked the doors for justice earlier, the picture would have been different,” the mouthpiece said.Further slamming the BJP, the editorial questioned the silence of the BJP leaders on the alleged molestation of a woman BJP worker in the BJP corporators office in Borivli and said it shows the double standard of the party. “While the Dombivli case was being investigated, a BJP office-bearer molested a woman party worker in the BJP corporator’s office in Borivli. In this case, all the BJP leaders are keeping quiet and not uttering a word and they, who shed their tears in the cases of Sakinaka and Dombivli, did not shed tears in the case of the Borivli incident. It shows their double standards,” remarked the editorial. As a policy, the Maharashtra unit of the BJP does not comment on Saamana editorials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/politicising-rape-incidents-for-mileage-is-disgusting-shiv-sena-slams-bjp-101632587299380.html

In June, 1,191 people were detained for travelling using fake essential workers identity cards. Around 533 passengers were detained in August, while 240 passengers were detained in September for travelling using fake essential workers identity cards.According to railway authorities, there is a reduction in the number of people trying to commute with fake identity cards as many citizens have completed their second vaccination dose and 14 days period. “We witnessed the decrease in August as well when train services resumed for the general public, but in September the number has gone down significantly. We appeal to passengers to commute only through valid tickets and have their vaccination certificates with them to produce during inspections,” said a senior Central Railway official. Local train services resumed for fully vaccinated passengers on August 15. Passengers have to register themselves by showing their vaccination certificate through the online or offline system at the suburban railway stations. After verification, the passengers can get their monthly pass from the railways booking office.Nearly 3.5 million passengers are travelling daily by the suburban railway network in September.Around 2.2 million passengers travelled by local trains daily on the Central Railway, while 1.3 million passengers travelled on the Western Railway this month. Nearly 1.5 million passengers travelled on Central Railway and 1.1 million passengers on the Western Railway in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/drop-in-number-of-commuters-using-fake-identity-cards-in-mumbai-local-trains-101632587120613.html
25-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra minister orders probe as recruitment exams for 6,200 vacant posts cancelled||The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is facing ire after it postponed recruitment exams to fill up over 6,000 vacant posts in the state health department at the eleventh hour. The recruitment exams were scheduled on Saturday and Sunday to fill up vacant positions for nurses, technicians, ward boys among others that fall under Class ‘C’ and ‘D’ categories. However, they were cancelled on late Friday evening, which led to aggrieved reactions.State health minister Rajesh Tope blamed the firm which had been outsourced the work for failing to complete the preparations well in time. He apologised to the students and said that the next schedule for examinations will be declared in the coming days. He also promised action against the firm after conducting a probe.The exercise for filling up the vacant positions was started as part of the state’s preparations for the potential third wave that may hit by December or January.Nearly 800,000 applicants have enrolled for the recruitment examinations for filling up 6,205 vacant posts for Class C and D categories. The vacant posts under Class C category comprise staff nurses, auxiliary nursing midwives, pharmacists, laboratory technicians, X-Ray technicians, laboratory assistants and others while Class D category posts include ward boys, sweepers and other supporting staff, the officials said.The health minister said, “The examinations were postponed owing to the incompetence of the firm — Nyasa Communications Private Limited (NCPL) — which failed to complete the preparations till Friday evening. I also personally visited a school (exam centre) at Selu in Parbhani district to review exam preparations and found that seating arrangements were made for 600 to 700 applicants, where 1,000 applicants were expected to appear from there.”“The firm told us they won’t be able to complete the preparations and applicants will have to face difficulties during examinations. After discussing the issue with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, we decided to postpone exams for a few days as there were many discrepancies in the seating arrangement, training of invigilators among others. I want to apologize to all those who had to face hardship due to the decision,” Tope said.NCPL is part of a list of empanelled firms prepared by the state information technology (IT) department. As per the procedure, the departments will have to select the firms from the empanelled list of firms for holding recruitment examinations.The health minister clarified as the health department their role was limited only to set up question papers, the rest of the preparations that include exam centres, hall tickets, seating arrangement, exam supervisor, their training among others was with the outsources firm.The firm failed to complete the preparations on time. The matter will be investigated and action will be taken accordingly, Tope told reporters on Saturday.Former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis demanded action against the guilty. He said that the students are very upset with the mess created over examinations. “During his social media interaction on Facebook, the health minister clearly said that exams will be conducted on Saturday. Following this, students (staying far off from exam centres) left their homes to appear for examinations that were suddenly cancelled on Friday evening. I am unable to understand the functioning of this government. It also cannot shrug off its responsibility in the name of an outsourced firm,” Fadnavis told reporters.Pravin Darekar, leader of Opposition in the legislative council alleged the state health department changed tender conditions to ensure NCPL is appointed. “It is a major scam, which got exposed. All those responsible for it such as health minister, health secretary, director, IT minister, minister of state and IT secretary should be investigated by either CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation), CID (crime intelligence department) or retired justice,” Darekar demanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-minister-orders-probe-as-recruitment-exams-for-6-200-vacant-posts-cancelled-101632587000116.html

25-09-2021||Kolkata||Army asked to remain on standby as West Bengal gears up for another spell of heavy rains||The West Bengal government has asked the army to remain on standby even as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned of heavy rains in south Bengal triggered by two back-to-back systems – Cyclone Gulab and a cyclonic circulation - mid next week.Officials from the IMD’s regional office in Kolkata said that as Cyclone Gulab is expected to hit somewhere between south Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh on Sunday evening it won’t have much impact on south Bengal barring some rain in the coastal districts. “But we are expecting another cyclonic circulation just after the cyclone passes over. It is likely to intensify into a low-pressure system and hit the West Bengal coast on September 29 triggering heavy rain in south Bengal districts,” said an IMD official in Kolkata. While the coastal district of East Midnapore is expected to receive heavy rain in one or two places on Sunday, on Monday West Midnapore and South 24 Parganas may also receive some rain. The cyclonic circulation, once it intensifies into a low pressure and hits the coast, would trigger heavy rain in several districts – Kolkata, East Midnapore, West Midnapore, South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Hooghly and Howrah. The IMD has issued an orange warning, which is the second-highest category of warning after a red warning, for September 28 and 29. The government has been asked to remain prepared. Following this, the state’s chief secretary held a meeting with top officials of various departments, such as police, the power supply corporation and the civic body among others at the secretariat. “As of now, we are not evacuating anyone as this is not a cyclone. But if required we would do so. The army and the NDRF have been asked to remain on standby as there could be heavy waterlogging. The districts in south Bengal received heavy rain earlier this week and some areas are still inundated. We are keeping relief materials ready including dry food, water pouches and medicines,” said a senior official of the state’s disaster management department. Over the past one week, some districts received more than three times excess rain over the climatic normal. Kolkata received the heaviest September rain in 14 years. More than a dozen people were killed due to electrocution in water-logged areas in various districts. At least 120,000 people had to be evacuated from two districts. The Kolkata Police have set up a unified command centre at its headquarters. Officials from the fire brigade, public works department, power supply corporation, city’s civic body and police would remain stationed at the centre. At least 22 teams have been formed. Officials said that special care is being taken for Bhabanipur in south Kolkata where bye-elections are scheduled on September 30. “Heavy rains are expected. But even then, I would request you to go to the booth with an umbrella and wearing a mask to cast your vote. Don’t waste a single vote,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The Trinamool Congress supremo is contesting from Bhabanipur to retain her chief ministerial berth. Counting of votes would be held on October 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/army-asked-to-remain-on-standby-as-west-bengal-gears-up-for-another-spell-of-heavy-rains-101632586282036.html

The 21 Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and their infrastructure will soon integrate with the NTA. This follows recommendations by principal economic advisor Sanjeev Sanyal of the union ministry of finance and its approval by the Union Cabinet.A letter to this effect has been sent to Railway Board by deputy secretary, cabinet secretariat, C Chandrashekhar and which, in turn, has sent the same to all zonal railways of Indian Railways, including Prayagraj-headquartered North Central Railway (NCR), confirm NCR officials.The Railway Board has been asked to keep informed about the progress made in terms of implementing the recommendations on 5th of every month. Following this, all 21 RRBs spread across the country, including the one in Prayagraj, would cease to exist, they say.The missive says: “The recommendations made by the principal economic advisor mentions that Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB) was established in 1998 to coordinate and streamline the working of various railway recruitment boards. Given that the government has set up a National Testing Agency which would conduct a common preliminary examination for various recruitments in the central government, there is no need of separate RRBs.”“It is therefore recommended to integrate the 21 RRBs and its existing infrastructure under NTA’s apex authority. The railway may conduct its exam via the NTA. There may be a small digital office in railway to coordinate with NTA,” adds the letter a copy of which is with HT.Chief public relations officer (CPRO), NCR, Shivam Sharma said, “A letter has been sent to all the zones of IR, including NCR, by the Railway Board and we are studying the contents.

Zonal general secretary of NCR men’s union, RD Yadav, said, “The government is fast moving towards massive privatisation of the Indian Railways. RRBs were made functional to maintain total transparency in the recruitments in IR and now as these entities are being closed down, it will simply open a gate for corruption.” “North Central Railway Men’s Union will oppose this proposal in every possible way,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/national-testing-agency-to-conduct-railway-exams-soon-101632585440463.html

A resident of Silchar town, Hasanuzzaman is the only student from Assam to make it to the recently declared merit list of UPSC 2020 examinations. He has secured 283rd rank in UPSC which is considered to be one of the toughest examinations globally. Ahmed Hasanuzzaman Choudhury is a student of Kendra Vidyalaya, Silchar. He completed his higher secondary education at National Public School in Guwahati in 2012. After completing B-tech from Jamia Milia Islamia University in 2017, he started preparing for UPSC in Delhi. He joined Jamia Millia Islamia’s Residential Coaching Academy(RCA) run by the Centre for Coaching and Career Planning. He appeared for the mains examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission in January 2021, followed by personality tests in August and September 2021. Hasanuzzaman’s father Jakir Ahmed Choudhury has retired as chief general manager of Assam Electronics Development Corporation. His grandfather is a retired judge. Hasanuzzaman is the third and youngest child in the family. His elder sister, Dr Salma Fedous Choudhury is a gynaecologist presently working in Silchar Medical College and Hospital. His eldest sister is working as a software engineer in Hyderabad.Talking to Hindustan Times on Saturday, Ahmed Hasanuzzaman Choudhury said, “Our family always motivated us to get a proper education. I have two elder sisters, one of them is an engineer and the other is a doctor. While studying engineering in Jamia, I started dreaming about UPSC. My father always supported my decisions. When I chose not to join a job in a private company and continued preparing, he stood by my side.”Hasanuzzaman is also the second person ever from Barak Valley part of Assam to succeed in UPSC. Talking about the lack of success stories in Barak Valley he said, “We do not start early, students in our area start thinking about UPSC once they complete the graduation. While in other states, students start preparing since they are in school. This attitude gives them more success while we fall behind.” Hasanuzzaman informed that apart from the methods taught in Jamia’s residential coaching, he preferred self-motivation and self-preparation. “There is a three-layer examination process in UPSC and you can fall short in any of them. It demotivates many students and this was one of the toughest challenges for me also. After two unsuccessful attempts, I was also facing challenging moments. But I was focused to crack the UPSC examination. My family members supported me. I wanted to become an IAS officer but my first goal has been achieved.”He opted for Political Science and International Relations as optional. While he was preparing for UPSC, he enrolled in Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) to study Political Science. “A master degree in Political Science helped me in my optional preparation,” he said. Hasanuzzaman’s father Jakir Ahmed Choudhury said, “I have two daughters and one son. I never discriminated and tried to give them proper education. As a government employee, I always wanted my kids to crack the UPSC examination. When my son expressed his desire to start preparing for that, I was happy. Today I am proud and I want my son to serve society as a better human being.” Deputy commissioner of Majuli district of Assam, Bikram Kairi, who is also a resident of Barak Valley and the first person to crack UPSC examination from this area, said, “After 6 to 7 years we have another student who has successfully passed the UPSC examination. This also shows that we have talented students but we do not have the proper platform to nourish them. I hope, with this success, Hasanuzzaman keeps motivating more students to try.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/our-kids-don-t-start-preparing-early-assam-s-only-student-who-cracked-upsc-this-year-101632584419047.html

25-09-2021||Mumbai||No decision on reopening of schools, theatres and religious places in Mumbai yet: Mayor||Although the Maharashtra government has announced reopening of schools, places of worship, cinema theatres, auditoriums in October, Mumbai civic authorities are taking a cautious approach. A final decision on reopening of schools, religious places and theatres in Mumbai will be taken by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) next week after carefully studying the local situation of Covid-19, said mayor Kishori Pednekar on Saturday. Civic officials are watching the situation in the aftermath of the Ganesh festival and planning to complete vaccination of teachers through a special drive before taking a decision on reopening. Also, the BMC on Saturday sealed Byculla women’s jail premises after 39 inmates were found infected with Covid-19. Civic officials said they initially received complaints that a few inmates were down with fever after which three Covid cases were detected. Post this, a fever camp was set up in which 36 more cases of Covid-19 were detected. The state government on Friday announced reopening of schools for those above Class 8 in the city from October 4, followed by religious places from October 7. On Saturday, the state government also announced reopening of theatres and auditoriums from October 22. Pednekar told HT: “The fear regarding the third wave of Covid has considerably reduced due to vaccination, and we have to lift restrictions so normal life can begin. At the same time, we have to be careful and follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. No decision on reopening of schools, religious places and theatres has been taken for Mumbai yet. A final call will be taken next week by the BMC.”Pednekar added, “Several factors will have to be kept in mind when we decide about reopening of schools since it involves safety of children. We know that the state government has taken careful decisions, but we will take a final call about Mumbai next week.”Civic officials said they will have to consider the impact of festival season before taking the decision. Mumbai is in the middle of festival season. The Ganesh festival is just over, while Navratri festival is coming early next month. Lots of people step out for festivals. Mumbai has a significant number of people who went to their native places in Konkan and other parts of the state for Ganpati festival. Some of them could already be infected with Covid when they return to the city. The crowds that were seen at markets and some public places may have triggered spread of the epidemic. As such, the civic officials will be monitoring the situation till the first week of October. For past few days, the daily caseload in Mumbai is between 400 and 500, while the current weekly positivity rate is around 0.06%. Both these factors will be considered, while taking decision on reopening of schools and places of worship, they said. Meetings have already begun to decide on the reopening of schools from classes 8th-10th.Meanwhile, the civic body announced special drive to vaccinate teachers before reopening of schools. Pednekar said about 70% of the teachers have already been vaccinated. For the remaining teachers, the BMC plans special vaccination drives. For this reason, the BMC has also decided to hold a special all women vaccination camp on Monday. Under this plan, all female teachers can also go to any public vaccination centre and get vaccinated for free. This will be followed by vaccination for those 18 years above age students and teachers. On Wednesday, a special drive is being organised for those due for second dose.Meanwhile, the city reported 455 cases and five deaths, taking the tally to 740,760 and toll to 16,079. On Saturday, 40,911 tests were reported in the city, meaning a daily positivity rate of 1.10%. The city’s recovery rate is 96% with 716,941 recoveries. The mortality rate is 2.17 and there are 5,276 active cases. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task-force, said, “As the second wave has settled now there is systematic relaxations being given by the state government. We have realised that after Ganesh festival, too, there has not been a major spike yet. The situation looks good with our vaccination, too, happening at a good pace and based on these parameters, mindful unlocking is happening.”Dr Joshi added, “We still have to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and have to follow the strictly framed standard operating procedures (SOP)’s for mindful relaxation. For reopening of school also, our paediatric taskforce have framed very strict SOP that has to be followed for reopening of schools.”In the Byculla jail case, assistant municipal commissioner E ward (under which Byculla prison falls) Manish Walunju said that on September 17 the local health post was informed about multiple fever cases inside the jail. “It was then decided to hold a fever camp on September 19 for the first time. We did a repeat camp later.”According to BMC officials, over 120 Covid tests were conducted of all the inmates as well the support staff in the premises from which total of 39 inmates tested positive. The inmates have been quarantined at Patanwala municipal school in Mazgaon area which has especially been taken over as a Covid care centre by the authorities.Further, one of the inmates also included a pregnant woman who has been admitted to GT hospital as a precautionary measure. A BMC official said, “We suspect that someone who may have been admitted into the jail recently may have brought in the virus. The premises has been sealed by the authorities, and a definite source cannot be attributed in such scenarios.” Meanwhile, in a similar incident a month ago, 22 children, including staff members, were tested positive at St Joseph’s School at Agripada. This followed by around 18 children from Mankhurd Children’s Home testing positive between August 25 and 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-decision-on-reopening-of-schools-theatres-and-religious-places-in-mumbai-yet-mayor-101632584239441.html

25-09-2021||Chandigarh||Farm protests hit political graffiti artists in Punjab||Out of work since the pandemic outbreak, debt-ridden painter Jasvir Singh Kalyan, 48, of Moga had his hopes high with the Punjab assembly elections round the corner, but he was in for a rude shock as protesting farmers allegedly barred him from drawing political graffiti on village walls and along highways. “I have three family members to feed. Out of work since the Covid-19 outbreak, I am under ₹1.5 lakh debt and have no other source of income,” says Kalyan, who finally got election campaign work from the Shiromani Akali Dal and Bahujan Samaj Party alliance.“First, my son Gurpreet and I started making graffiti in villages, but the protesting farmers stopped us. Then, we started work along highways, but the farmers again stopped us,” says the painter, who is among scores of graffiti artists who have written a letter to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, seeking protection of their income source. “During normal days, we hardly earn ₹10,000-12,000 per month. It is only during the elections that we earn up to ₹30,000 per month,” says Daljeet Singh, 53, another graffiti artist from Moga. “Usually, we get work for painting advertisements of coaching and immigration centres, but due to Covid-19, even that did not come our way. Therefore, election campaigns are our only hope,” he says.A Ludhiana-based contractor, who did not wish to be named, says election campaigns through wall paintings and graffiti are like the harvest season for painters. “The poor painters wait for five years for this, but now they are being barred from earning their livelihood,” he says. However, farm leaders deny that there has been any decision on barring painters from making political graffiti. Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary, BKU (Ugrahan), says: “If any one of our union members is found stopping the painters, we will take action against him. We request painters to share names and numbers of such union members.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-protests-hit-political-graffiti-artists-in-punjab-101632582919414.html
25-09-2021||Pune||Pune district consumer forum orders DRM to compensate commuter for theft inside coach||PUNE The Pune District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ordered the divisional railway manager (DRM) Pune to pay Rs9.43 lakh as compensation to a commuter whose gold ornaments were stolen from inside a second air-conditioned (AC) coach. The commission has also directed the DRM to pay an additional Rs35,000 to the commuter as compensation towards mental agony and litigation costs.The complainant, identified as Manoj Hiralal Malu of Mukundnagar on August 25, 2016, had filed a complaint in this regard under section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, alleging deficiency in services on the part of the railways. Malu sought relief in the form of the railways being directed to pay him Rs9.43 lakh as compensation for the gold ornaments that were stolen along with Rs50,000 towards mental agony caused and Rs15,000 towards the cost of lodging the complaint.Malu in his complaint stated that he had to attend a domestic function namely, a wedding ceremony in Hyderabad from May 11 to May 15, 2015 due to which he and his wife Kavita travelled to Hyderabad in the Mumbai-Hyderabad Express with reservation for the said journey. After attending the function in Hyderabad, they began their return journey to Pune on May 15, 2015 by train 17032 in the second AC coach. Malu said that they took three trolley bags, two handbags and some sweet boxes with them in the bogey. Over the course of the journey, they engaged in some general conversation with one co-traveller. The train arrived at Pune station the next morning on May 16, 2015 and they went home with their bags and belongings. Upon opening one of the trolley bags however, the gold ornaments kept inside were found missing. Unable to find the ornaments, Malu on May 19, 2015, lodged a complaint (which was duly acknowledged by the Pune railway police station) detailing the 14 missing pieces of jewellery collectively worth Rs9.43 lakh. Malu later intimated the Pune railway police station that he had forgotten to include some more ornaments that had been stolen which were thereafter incorporated in the FIR. Malu told the police that he suspected that five persons had stolen the pouch of gold ornaments from his trolley bag which had no lock. The Pune railway police station on October 22, 2015, informed Malu that his complaint had been found true upon enquiry but the accused had not been found due to which the complaint was being closed.According to Malu, he also submitted a letter dated June 1, 2015, to the DRM Pune stating that despite travelling in the second AC, his ornaments were stolen. It was the responsibility of the DRM to ensure that no intruders entered the reserved compartment as he had paid a large sum for the tickets just to be able to enjoy a safe and secure journey. In his letter, Malu said that being a consumer of the railways, the DRM should have taken strict measures to ensure his safety, especially since he had purchased second AC tickets. There was a deficiency in services on the part of the railways, he alleged.In a written response, the railways submitted that the consumer commission had no jurisdiction to decide this case. “Nowadays it has become a fashion for the public at large to approach the forum for any act though not cognisable by it. The railway administration is providing transport facilities to the public at large through the largest network extending from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and the railways are a large public utility undertaking in India. The railway administration has provided all amenities and facilities for the benefit of passengers such as the hooks provided below the seat to tie their luggage,” read the railways’ statement and demanded that Malu’s complaint be dismissed and that a fine of Rs1 lakh be slapped on him.However, the consumer commission in its order by president Umesh Jawalikar and members Kshitija Kulkarni and Sangita M Deshmukh, stated, “There is a deficiency on the part of the opposite party (railways) as intruders entered the reserved compartment and made up a false story. Unauthorised persons provoked the complainant to keep the luggage near the door of the compartment due to which the jewellery of the complainant was stolen. Hence, the complainant is entitled to get an amount of ₹943,000 on account of the gold ornaments that were stolen from inside the compartment. The complainant is also entitled to get compensation of Rs20,000 towards mental agony and Rs15,000 towards cost of the complaint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-consumer-forum-orders-drm-to-compensate-commuter-for-theft-inside-coach-101632582860324.html

Although caste plays such a discriminatory role in our socio-economic life and confines privileges into only a few hands, no reliable and wide-ranging data is available for more than fifty per cent of our population,” he has written in his letter.The RJD leader urged the non-BJP leaders that as the decadal census has been delayed due to the pandemic, “we must urge the Union government to include within the delayed 2021 census the caste census as well, before the exercise begins”.“The census of India must deliberate upon the flaws and gaps in the way it conducted the first Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) in 2011 with help from experts. This will ensure that the error ridden process which rendered the data useless according to the Census of India itself can be corrected. This would also prevent a colossal waste and a fraud on the most disadvantaged people of our country from occurring again,” he said.The letter has also been marked to other CMs like Uddhav Thackeray, MK Stalin, Naveen Patnaik, K Chandrasekhar Rao and Jaganmohan Reddy.On Friday, Yadav had served a three-day ultimatum to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to reveal his plan after which the RJD would decide its future course of action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/castebased-census-tejashwi-writes-to-non-bjp-leaders-to-rally-support-101632581658817.html

He also dismissed editorials in Saamna as inconsequential, saying it no longer is the publication of Balasaheb Thackeray.Fadnavis was in Navi Mumbai on Saturday to attend the 88th Annasaheb Patil Jayanti Mathadi meet organised by the Mathadi leader, Narendra Patil, in which Central Minister Bhupendra Yadav was also present.Commenting on the last-minute cancellation of the health department recruitment exam, Fadnavis said, “The students are very upset at the regular cancellation of exams. As for this exam, the health minister had himself said on Facebook Live that it will not be cancelled, and no one should believe in rumours. The students left their homes, spent money and after coming for the exam, they learned the night before about the cancellation.”He claimed that the admission letters from two different states were also creating confusion. Fadnavis said, “I have also received information and complaints from students that dalals have entered the scene. These middlemen are offering jobs for ₹5 lakh to ₹15 lakh payment. The government needs to inquire and take corrective action, or else we shall agitate for the students. There are scams all over. How many more scams will there be? Shall we call it a scam government?”On the state government’s redevelopment policy for Mumbai, he said, “Ease of doing business means fewer windows and doors, less corruption and faster work. This is the opposite of what should happen.”He claimed that the decision to open schools and temples, though delayed, is welcomed.Dismissing comments in Saamna against him and BJP, he said, “Don’t understand why the media takes up its editorials and makes stories all day? They write anything and have no standard at all. Their views keep changing. They need to introspect. This Saamna is no more Balasaheb Thackeray’s Saamna. Please do not ask me about Saamna editorials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fadnavis-calls-present-mva-a-government-of-scams-101632579814120.html

They claimed that most of the people were vulnerable and might get infected going to the centres.“A friend who was 78-year-old was infected after the first dose when the cases in Kalyan-Dombivli were at their peak. He was hospitalised and succumbed to the infection. There are several such cases, making it important to start home vaccinations,” said Dattatray Marathe, president, senior citizen association, Lokgram, Kalyan (E).“We are ready to coordinate with the civic body and such beneficiaries who want to get the vaccine at their homes,” added Marathe.Sudhakar Yevatkar, a 45-year-old resident of Pisavli village in Kalyan who is suffering from kidney ailment and is disabled, claimed that he can’t go to the centre to take the dose.“Right now, I am not planning to take the vaccine because of my kidney ailment. However, if I want to go someday, I won’t go to the centre as it is very risky. I cannot walk to the centre and I am scared of getting infected in the crowd. There is no one to look after my family,” said Yevatkar, who runs a vegetable shop and looks after his wife and two children. He claimed that home vaccination would be beneficial to him.Mangesh Pawar, president of Swarajya Apang Sanstha, Kalyan, claimed that there are several disabled persons who are not willing to go out and get their doses.“Some are not able to walk while some others fear going to the centres. If the civic body can help them with home vaccine, it will be very convenient for such citizens,” said Pawar.Sayali Shinde, a 36-year-old disabled citizen from Kalyan who resides in Waldhuni, said, “I cannot walk and I live with my mother and a child. I have not taken my dose yet. I have not thought of going to the centre and taking the dose. I went through an operation on my leg and the treatment is on. Once I recover, I want to take the vaccine but I don’t want to go to the centre. It will be good if the dose is given at home.”The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) presently has vaccination facilities at its civic centres, private hospitals and also mobile facilities in some areas.Out of the 13 lakh eligible beneficiaries, the KDMC has so far vaccinated 7.15 lakh beneficiaries with the first dose and 3.35 lakh with the second.

25-09-2021||Lucknow||Most of my work actually did happen during pandemic: Himanee Bhatia||After quitting a corporate job, Himanee Bhatia opted for a full-time acting career. She moved to Mumbai in 2019 but within a few months the lockdown was imposed. “I was like…is it a wise decision to leave behind a flourishing career and take a plunge into acting? As Paulo Coelho wrote in one of his books — ‘And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it’. This actually happened with me and most of my work has happened during pandemic,” says the young actor. Telling us more about her work she says, “I played a corporate consultant who interviews R Madhavan in the OTT series Decoupled, I did Zoya Akhtar’s series Eternally Confused and Eager for Love where I got to essay a negative role. I also played lead in an episode of the web show Jiggy Who besides, many other sketches. My short film Blink is also due to release soon.” Bhatia adds that after lockdown her hosting career picked up. “I hosted actors like Abhishek Banerjee, Namit Khanna, Akshara Pardasany and many more. In this period, I shot for two OTT series, short films and multiple sketches for leading YouTube channels,” she shares. Earlier, working as a risk and legal consultant with a multinational company Bhatia always wanted to explore more in life, she tells, “The day I got promoted I quit my job and this happened due to my short film Act Normal which deals with mental health. Since I strongly connected with the topic, I wrote the script and acted in it. It did quite well and reached to global audience.” Bhatia is a trained dancer and has been modelling since school days. “I won the college pageant We The Diva and started getting ads soon after. After quitting my job, I joined Akshara Theatre Group and did many plays as a lead. Then I started auditioning and landed into acting and anchoring projects. My first big assignment was season one of series Neighbour’s Kitchen.” Bhatia is currently penning her debut novel that will be a romantic comedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/most-of-my-work-actually-did-happen-during-pandemic-himanee-bhatia-101632578358354.html

The money and a toy pistol have been recovered from the men’s possession. The second employee, Prince Singh, of Shivaji Nagar, has no involvement in the crime, police have said. The other two accused are Satnam Singh alias Sandy, 27, of Tapa of Barnala, and Sandeep Singh alias Seepa, 24, of Raikot. Sandy is brother-in-law (wife’s cousin) of Gagandeep. Ludhiana police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said the accused had been hatching this robbery conspiracy for over 20 days.Gagandeep, a bouncer, had joined the firm in February and was employed to collect cash from business partners of the firm and deposit the money at the 5th floor of the complex.On Friday, according to the plan the three accused had hatched, Seepa followed Gagandeep and the other employee and before they could board the lift, he flashed a gun and Gagandeep, who has a licenced pistol with him, handed over the bag to him, without offering any resistance. They did not raise alarm or give a chase to the robber, who fled with his accomplice Satnam Singh, waiting outside the complex on a motorcycle.“The bouncer offering no resistance was suspicious. We rounded up Gagandeep and questioned him, following which he confessed to the crime. He led us to Sandeep, who was arrested from Raikot with ₹10 lakh and Sandy, of Dhilwan of Tapa of Barnala, was arrested with the rest ₹25 lakh,” the police commissioner added.“During questioning, the accused told police that they had met in a gym where Gagandeep had shared the details of his job, which involved dealing with huge amounts of cash. They hatched a conspiracy and rehearsed the sequence before executing the crime,” he added.A case under Sections 379-B (theft) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 25, 54 and 59 of Arms act has been registered against the accused at Division Number 6 police station. POLICE TO PROBE HAWALA ANGLE ALSOPolice commissioner Bhullar added they will also probe the Hawala angle in the transaction of huge amount. “Our first priority was detection of the crime and arrest of all the accused. Now, we will probe other angles,” he said.“We will inform the income tax department to ensure that no black money is involved in any of the transactions of the firm. To date, the firm owner Deepak Arora has not produced any document to authenticate the involvement of so much money,” he added.DESIRE TO GET RICH OVERNIGHT LED TO CRIMEPolice claim the three accused, who had no criminal record till yesterday, were fuelled by a desire to get rich overnight. Gagandeep had spent his childhood in Devigarh of Patiala in the house of his parental grandparents and studied there. He was a sports enthusiast and loved cycling in school. He dropped out after Class-12 and joined a gym, to later work as a bouncer. Satnam, alias Sandy, has a postgraduate degree and owns a gym in Raikot.

25-09-2021||Dehradun||Opposition expresses ‘serious concerns’ over Uttarakhand govt order on ‘demographic change’||Bharatiya Janata Party-led Uttarakhand government’s order to form district-level committees to check on “demographic changes” in certain areas has resulted in a political storm in the state ahead of the next year’s state assembly elections. Both the Opposition parties, Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), are now accusing the BJP of “communal politics” ahead of next year’s polls.In an official statement issued on Friday, the government “expressing serious concerns” over demographic changes in certain areas of Uttarakhand and “attempts being made to vitiate communal harmony in state”, stated that it had directed the state director general of police, all district magistrates and senior superintendents of police to constitute district-level committees, prepare a list of “outsiders” with criminal background involved in “illegal land deals.”The statement stated that “due to unprecedented rise in population in certain areas of the state, the demography of those areas has been majorly affected. And due to this demographic change, members of certain communities are forced to migrate from those areas. Also, there are possibilities that the communal harmony in those areas may be disturbed.”Congress party has expressed “serious concerns” over the government’s move. Its national general secretary and former chief minister Harish Rawat advocated a study on the “rate of population rise” to bring a solution to issues of illiteracy, malnourishment and others however, cautioned against “targetting a particular community under its garb.”“In the states of southern India, the rate of population growth is lower than the national one. But the rate is high in states where issues like illiteracy and malnourishment are more, especially in the poor class irrespective of the religion.”“If the government takes appropriate steps to control this, then we have no objection to that. But if it is done to target any particular community and area, then it is a matter of serious concern. And, if it is done to take some political benefit using the administration, then the seriousness of the matter increases more. We are against it,” said Rawat who is also the president of the party’s election campaign committee in the state. The AAP, which is the new entrant in the state assembly elections in Uttarakhand, meanwhile, accused the BJP of “working on the lines of Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)”Party’s working president and a retired inspector general from Uttarakhand police, Anantram Chauhan, while attacking the government said, “The move is nothing but divisive politics by ruling BJP ahead of the upcoming assembly elections.”“Every citizen has a right to live anywhere in the country... It’s his fundamental right. But if the government is targeting one community with this move by terming them outsiders, it should remember that many people of Uttarakhand live in big cities like Delhi and Mumbai. With such a move, it is following the footsteps of MNS which does the politics of Maharashtrawad targetting people of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh which is not at all appreciable,” said Chauhan.Chauhan also blamed both BJP and Congress for the “misgovernance in the state for the last 21 years.”“If there is a situation where the crime has increased due to settling of criminal elements in the state, then for that only BJP and Congress is responsible which ruled the state by taking turns since its formation. It is all because of their misgovernance. Once, AAP comes to power, the situation will be improved,” said Chauhan adding that, “The move is completely election-centric.”Political experts too termed it a politically motivated step by the government ahead of assembly elections.“The order has been given by the government only months before the state assembly elections. It simply signifies that the BJP wants to take political benefit by playing the communal card on the party’s national agenda. It is being done to demonise one community and polarise the society before the polls,” said political analyst SMA Kazmi.The BJP, meanwhile, refuted the allegations and termed it a step needed for national security.“It is a good decision to identify outsiders and figure out what they are up to. This exercise is meant to ensure such elements are identified and unable to disturb the communal harmony of Dev-Bhoomi,” said party state vice president Devendra Bhasin.He added, “Also, the order is also for the people of other countries living illegally in Uttarakhand after getting forged voter ID cards and other government ID proofs. Being a border state, the step is a much needed one... It is not at all a political move.”............||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/opposition-expresses-serious-concerns-over-uttarakhand-govt-order-on-demographic-change-101632576739899.html

Till now, eight cases have tested positive, though none in the last one week.The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has also sent a notification to all private hospitals, nursing homes and laboratories to report all epidemic cases to the local supervising authority to keep a tab of all suspected dengue and malaria cases in the city.The civic body has also warned in the notification that if they failed to report, appropriate action would be initiated under the Maharashtra Nursing Home Registration Act.Medical health officer, NMMC, Dr. Pramod Patil, said, “The increase in the number of suspected cases is a sign that we are monitoring every patient closely for the symptoms. Along with preventive measures, we are emphasising on timely reporting of the cases to give the right treatment at the right time.”NMMC has sent a Google sheet to all private hospitals, nursing homes and laboratories in the city to inform all monsoon-related water-borne and vector-borne diseases daily. “The Google sheet includes details of the patient and the diagnosis to help the civic body in knowing the daily trend and timely intervention can be taken,” Patil said.Of the 288 suspected dengue cases, 279 have been found to be negative and eight have been found to be positive, the highest since 2019. In 2019, till September, there were three positive cases out of the 147 suspected ones while in 2020, none were found positive from the 27 suspected cases.“When we get a suspected case, we get the samples and admit the patient first and then we conduct the antigen test. If the antigen test is positive, we send the samples ahead to NIV in Pune for confirmation. Once NIV confirms it, only then it is dengue,” NMMC assistant municipal commissioner, Sanjay Kakade, said.Fogging, introduction of guppy fishes into stagnant water bodies, spreading awareness, checking the breeding spots of mosquitoes and destroying them are all being taken up by the corporation to prevent the vector-borne diseases.“Residents should ensure that there is no stagnant water in their houses and report any kind of illness at the earliest without going for any over-the-counter treatment. If the treatment is delayed, the complications could increase,” Dr Patil said.Meanwhile, 20 have tested positive for malaria from the 62,497 samples checked. In a week, 2,177 people with symptoms of malaria were reported and checked, of which only one was found positive. In 2020, the dengue and malaria reporting was relatively less due to the pandemic and the majority of the staff being deployed for Covid duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/66-new-suspected-dengue-cases-in-navi-mumbai-nmmc-notifies-hospitals-to-report-on-cases-101632576198232.html
25-09-2021||Mumbai||Resilience building should be done at all levels, say experts||When two people suffer from the same kind of trauma, how does one cope with it faster and in a better way than the other? The reason is resilience. The importance of resilience-building was discussed in an online conference on Saturday where national and international experts dissected the link between trauma, addiction and suicides. “Resilience is the core aspect that helps one recover from trauma of any kind,” said senior psychiatrist Dr Avinash De Sousa who spoke at the event. “Resilience building should be done at all levels — for healthy individuals, for someone who is experiencing trauma and those who are already dabbling with psychiatric problems,” he said, emphasising the ways to build resilience, which include social support, optimism, self-belief, emotional awareness and a sense of humour. According to De Sousa, resilience is a fairly new concept that has been talked about for the past decade. He cited one definition of resilience as the capacity of the system to tolerate disturbance without collapsing, to withstand shock and to rebuild itself when necessary. He also cited the Mumbai train blasts in 2006 as an example of resilience. “The people in the city were back in the local trains the next day. It was a good example of community resilience,” he said. The two-day conference organised by the Indian Association of Private Psychiatry (IAPP) and Safe Space concludes on Sunday. President of IAPP Dr Anukant Mittal highlighted the strong connection between trauma, addiction and suicides. “People are finding newer methods to seek solace and seek escape from this world. This is worrying,” he said expressing concern about suicides among the youth as well as the geriatric population. According to Mittal, the Covid-19 pandemic has also worsened the scenario further, with many papers talking about the increase in suicides or the attempts among healthcare workers and mortuary staff who have been constantly exposed to the trauma of seeing a large number of deaths. “We need more people and personalities to talk about their plight, about how they were close to ending everything and what helped them cope,” he said adding that we should be signalled when anyone shows the signs of hopelessness, helplessness and worthlessness and make an intervention by starting a conversation. Saturday’s conference also saw equal rights activist Sheetal Bhan talking about her personal story and the journey towards healing. She highlighted the importance of therapy and how psychiatrists should be more open about referring to therapy before starting medication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/resilience-building-should-be-done-at-all-levels-experts-101632576137483.html

The transaction happened around 12:30pm on Thursday in Chinchwad. The complainant realised that the women had handed her soil in a cloth packet instead of the promised gold. “The complainant is a cleaning worker and lives in Wakad. The women had covered their faces while speaking with her,” said sub-inspector Navnath Kudale of Chinchwad police station. The women approached the senior citizen while she was near the jewellery shop. One of them told her that the other woman had a lot of gold beads but she did not have any cash and needed the money in order to travel to Solapur, according to the complaint. The two then took the woman under a tree and offered her five tola (10 grammes) gold beads and asked her to hand over the gold she was wearing and some cash. The woman went to an ATM in Chinchwad and withdrew ₹19,500 in cash. To compensate for the 50 grammes gold that she was falsely promised by the two women, she gave her mangalsutra (necklace) worth ₹20,000 and gold earrings along with the cash. The women then handed over a bundle of clothes bound together to the complainant and told her that the gold beads were in it. After the women left, the complainant realised that the bundle had soil in it and not gold, according to her complaint. A case under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Chinchwad police station against the two unidentified women. In September 2020, two isolated incidents were recorded of similar nature - one with a 70-year-old victim in Sadashiv peth and another with a 65-year-old victim in Pulgate area. In both the cases, the women were approached by women who cited an emergency and offered lucrative deals in exchange for the complainant’s existing jewellery. While the 70-year-old gave away necklace worth ₹9,000, the 65-year-old a chain worth over ₹10,000. In January, a 39-year-old jeweller in Hadapsar lost gold and cash worth close to ₹50 lakh to tricksters who claimed that the sand they had would turn into gold upon heating. After handing over 4kg of such sand, the men took ₹30 lakh cash and close to 500 gramme gold from the jeweller and fled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/60yearold-woman-duped-of-cash-jewellery-with-promise-of-gold-in-exchange-in-chinchwad-101632574998008.html

However, defunct streetlights have been a major problem on this road. The PWD had long been requesting the NMMC to take care of the streetlights in their jurisdiction.Sanjay Desai, city engineer of NMMC, said, “In a recent meeting with the PWD officials, we confirmed that we will take over the maintenance of streetlights on the highway between Vashi and Belapur. However, several streetlights are not working on that stretch at present. It has not been decided who will take care of that pending work. A decision in that regard will also be taken soon and then we will take full responsibility for the streetlights.”Another senior NMMC officer said that the civic body had asked for the advertisement rights from PWD on that stretch in return for the maintenance of the streetlights. However, PWD refused to give that.A PWD officer from Navi Mumbai said that all formalities of transferring the responsibility of the streetlights to NMMC will be completed by next month.“We have also asked the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) to take over the maintenance of the streetlights in their jurisdiction (from Kharghar to Panvel). However, it has not responded yet,” the officer said.GK More, 55, a resident of Sanpada, said, “It is very risky to drive there at night as the streetlights are not working at several places. We hope that the NMMC will change the scenario now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nmmc-to-take-responsibility-of-maintaining-streetlights-on-sion-panvel-highway-in-navi-mumbai-101632572777537.html

He was found dead inside a room at Baghambari Gaddi Math on September 20. The CBI is probing his death.“The general consensus among the representatives of the 13 monastic orders is that the meeting of the ABAP be held on October 3 or October 5, just before the 16th-day rituals of the Mahant’s death,” said a senior seer privy to the matter.ABAP’s meetings in Prayagraj usually have been held at Baghambari Math premises for the past many years but the next meeting will not be taking place here as most seers believe that no such event should be conducted in the Math before the Shodashi rituals. The next meeting of ABAP could be held either at Shri Panchayati Akhada’s Manahirwani Ashram at Daraganj or Shri Panchayati Udaseen Akhada premises at Kydganj (both in Prayagraj), the seer said.ABAP general secretary and Juna Akhada patron Swami Hari Giri said, “Plans are afoot to hold a meeting of ABAP before the Shodashi rituals of Mahant Narendra Giri. Many important points are up for discussion,” he said. Mahant Narendra Giri was elected ABAP president in 2014 soon after the Kumbh-2013 on the banks of the Sangam. It was during his tenure as the Akhada Parishad chief that the Kumbh-2019 was held in a grand manner. Narendra Giri was re-elected to the post in October 2019 during a meeting in Haridwar.After the untimely demise of Mahant Narendra Giri, most saints want a new ABAP chief to be elected on priority as preparations for Kumbh-2025 in Prayagraj need to start at least two-three years in advance. The senior saints at the ABAP meeting would need to take a call on whether to appoint a new Akhada Parishad chief from Prayagraj or go for a saint from some other district or state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/akhada-parishad-to-hold-key-meeting-next-month-discussion-on-next-chief-likely-101632572599038.html

We are now replacing those poles with the new ones which are made of galvanized iron (GI). These poles are stronger than the old ones.“Our work is now under way in Vashi, Koparkhairane, Belapur, Airoli and other places. We are replacing more than 5,000 electric poles in this drive and we hope to finish the work within a month. We are not replacing 30% electric poles as those are made of galvanized iron (GI) and we installed them 10 to 15 years ago.”It may be recalled that a 35-year-old biker died after an electric pole fell on him on Palm Beach Road in Sanpada on May 16. “That pole fell due to strong wind causing the death of the biker who was passing by that area,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nmmc-to-replace-25-year-old-old-electric-poles-with-new-ones-across-navi-mumbai-101632571042138.html

25-09-2021||Mumbai||Dombivli sexual assault case: WhatsApp group under police scanner||A WhatsApp group that the Dombivli gangrape survivor and some of the accused were part of has come under the scanner of the Manpada police after an obscene video of the survivor was allegedly posted on this group earlier this year, officials said. The survivor registered a case on Wednesday night, wherein a total of 33 young men eventually came to be named as accused, alleging intimidation, blackmail and prolonged sexual abuse from January to September this year. The police have so far arrested 27 accused and also sent two more, who are minors, to the juvenile remand home in Bhiwandi.According to people familiar with the matter, the survivor, in her statement, has said that one of the accused posted her obscene video on the group when she refused to meet him in May this year.“Ever since they got access to the video recorded in January, in which the main accused was sexually assaulting the victim, the accused had repeatedly been calling the victim. They would ask her to come to various locations, where several of them would force themselves on her. On May 16, one of them called her up and made a similar demand. When she refused, he posted her video and the main accused on a WhatsApp group named ‘Friends’, of which the victim was also a member,” an officer with the Manpada police said.The survivor has said in her statement that action had the desired effect and she agreed to meet the accused. Subsequently, he picked her up from near her residence on his motorbike and took her to Rabale in Navi Mumbai, where she was allegedly forced to drink alcohol and was sexually assaulted by seven of the accused. The survivor has said that after this instance, she became so unwell that she had to be admitted to the hospital and given a saline drip.The police have obtained details of all the members of the WhatsApp group in question. They will be making inquiries with other members of the group as well as the group administrator to find out if any of them, other than the accused, knew the survivor’s plight, people cited above said.The officer said that the survivor had refused to meet the accused on this particular occasion because earlier in the same month, they had forcibly restrained her for nearly an entire day, leading to her parents filing a Missing Person’s Complaint.“The survivor was finding it increasingly difficult to come up with convincing lies to explain her frequent absences from home, and at the same time was terrified of the videos being made public if she did not bow down to the demands of the accused,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dombivli-sexual-assault-case-whatsapp-group-under-police-scanner-101632568637553.html

A task force of all the planning authorities under Thane District Collector will also be formed to resolve the issue of potholes and traffic.

On Tuesday evening, a 23-year-old Mumbra resident died after skidding on a bad stretch along Ghodbunder Road. Shinde said, “Parking lots will be made available at the outskirts of the city to park the heavy vehicles that enter the city during the day. Also, a task force of all the planning authorities in MMR region along with the PWD and MMRDA officials will be formed under Thane Collector to work to find solutions for pothole-free roads.”Mahesh Singh, 19, who resides in Kharkar Ali, Thane, said, “Not just the roads in the city but the highways connecting the nearby cities too are riddled with potholes. The flyovers are in pathetic condition. While the Thane civic body was prompt in taking action against the civic officials, the other planning authorities too should fix responsibility to avoid such shoddy work every monsoon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tmc-chief-suspends-4-civic-engineers-for-bad-roads-potholes-in-thane-101632568586009.html

A pilot scale of 100kg in Pune city area was successfully implemented by collaborating with Pune-based companies, viz. APPL Industries Limited, SKYi Composites, Harsh Deep Agro Products, Urmila Polymers, Jai Hind Autotech, who produced value-added products. The feed material (PPE kits) was collected and decontaminated by Passco Environmental Solutions, a waste management company located in Pune. CSIR-NCL secured all regulatory approvals needed from Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to complete this pilot trial.The technical journey of CSIR-NCL, aided by Reliance and CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum (CSIR-IIP) Dehradun, with funding from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, mainly involved converting the decontaminated PPE waste (mainly comprising PPE suits/overalls) into an easily processable and upcycled agglomerated form (pellets or granules). It was ensured that the polymer pellets show the right attributes necessary for successful conversion to produce non-food applications, including high-performance automotive components.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bitsnbytes-know-about-business-events-in-pune-101632568576817.html
25-09-2021||Mumbai||NCB arrests brother of Arjun Rampal’s girlfriend in drugs case||The Mumbai unit of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), along with their Goa counterparts, arrested Agisilaos Demetriades, brother of Bollywood actor Arjun Rampal’s girlfriend, in a drugs case.The agency has seized small quantity of charas from him, which was meant for personal consumption. A local court sent him to judicial custody, the agency said on Saturday. The central anti-narcotics agency’s Mumbai and Goa units are jointly carrying out aggressive operations in Goa for last two days. “During the drive, the NCB made three NDPS cases, involving different drugs like charas, LSD, MDMA/ecstasy and arrested four peddlers. Agisilaos’s arrest is in connection with one of the three cases. Small quantity of Hashish (charas) has been found from his house in Pernem, north Goa, on Friday. He was produced in a local court that remanded him to 14-days judicial custody,” said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director, NCB Mumbai.This is the third NDPS case against Agisilaos. Earlier, the South African national was booked in two cases. One case is connected to the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput ,while another is related to Kshitij Prasad, former executive producer of Dharmatic Entertainment, who was arrested last year by NCB in a case involving recovery of cocaine from a Nigerian national in Mumbai, Wankhede added.Rampal was, too, questioned twice in December last year by NCB in a drug-related case that has seen several Bollywood names crop up.“I’m as shocked and taken aback as you are with this latest development today. It’s unfortunate that my name is being unnecessarily dragged in every publication though I have no association whatsoever. As far as my family and I are concerned, my direct family and I are law-abiding citizens. And while the incident involves a person who is a relative of my partner, I have no other connection or relationship other than that with this person. I request the media to not make headlines using my name as we are NOT related and this is causing hurt and confusion for my own family and the people I have a professional relationship with. I have faith in our legal system and whoever is on the wrong side on the law, should be treated as the judiciary deems fit. My trust is in the system in these matters. Let the law take its course and kindly refrain from attaching my partner’s and my name to something we have nothing to do with. I appreciate all your support and humbly request you to be honest and sensitive in this regard,” said Rampal in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncb-arrests-brother-of-arjun-rampal-s-girlfriend-in-drugs-case-101632568336965.html
25-09-2021||Pune||Pune Startup Mantra: 4Fin has raised $1.1 million in pre-seed round||PUNE A startup that has not yet launched has effectively, not started-up. Yes, 4Fin has raised $1.1 million in pre-seed round through Curesense Therapeutics, investors behind biotech company Mylab. Yes, 4Fin founders Ajit Sinha and Amit Tewary, both senior former bankers, are more than aware of what it takes to be “profitable” in the lending space. Yes, 4Fin is based in Pune.But, the CTO of this credit-embedded marketplace cannot be named till October, which is when the 4Fin service goes ‘live’. All we can reveal is this developer,; as per Sinha and Tewary, has created financial tech solutions for banks in 15 countries.The fintech space in India, like 4Fin, is just kicking off, at least in terms of moving the market place online.Traditional bankers still rule the lending space, especially at the lower end of the fiscal food chain.Any one of these phrases by the founders of 4Fin might seem like the hundreds of “spam” messages that flood our inboxes every day: “Accessibility of loans for customers at affordable rates”; “capability of disbursing the loan the same day”; and of course, “very, very high probability of getting a loan”.“We are into bottom-line lending, but volume-wise we want to be top-line,” is the first line of the chorus, followed by, “A credit-embedded marketplace for all your crucial needs in life”.The line that underpins all the above is: “Lending is not about giving money, but is all about collection”.The marketAs per 4Fin data, there are 500 million smart phone users in India and 620 million internet users Household debt to GDP ratio in India is at 37 per cent. The corresponding figure for the US is 80 per cent, Malaysia is 76 per cent and China is 62 per cent.The industry size, banking with a specific intent on lending, is at $612 billion with an 18 per cent growth rate. As much as 73 per cent of small-ticket loans originate outside Tier 1 cities.Given that startups like Capital Float (Bengaluru), MoneyOnClick (Bengaluru) and Rupify (Bengaluru) are already in the space, what would distinguish 4Fin from the rest?The 4Fin pitchFirst and foremost is “omni-channel access for any kind of support,” says co-founder Sinha. “It’s never a fixed model like conventional banking. Since, we have to do the loans fast, we rely lot on data. We will be very agile and robust.”Lending is easy, collection is toughDecades of experience in lending has provided great learning to the duo, who agree that lending is easy, but collection is tough. Says Sinha, “As a lender, I have to assess the market, dealers, manufacturers and risk is involved when you give money as working capital. Lending is not about giving money, but is all about collection. Either you recover the money or the asset. So, the value of the asset should be at least equal to the outstanding amount.”Says Tewary, “Lending keeps changing every decade. A lot of changes have happened after Covid-19. The advantage of using fintech was there pre-Covid, but now its necessity has increased multi-fold. Customer acquisition has become easier due to online transactions. This change is rapid. However, customer care has taken a hit.”4FIN – loan in a few hours4Fin focusses on facilitating small loans to support expenses for health, education, electric two-wheelers among other basic necessities. 4Fin aims to make finance more accessible in Bharat (semi-urban and rural parts of India), offer personalised loan products and support its customers with its model of ‘4Fin Mitras’, designed to act as social-driven customer care.4Fin has developed an in-house loan origination system, loan management system, debt services management, artificial intelligence-based algorithms for credit assessment and e-stacks for end-to-end automated processing. These solutions reduce turnaround time for approval and disbursal of loans, facilitating faster decision making and ensuring accessibility of loans for customers at affordable rates.Says Sinha, “There can be genuine people whose credit history might have been affected due to some delayed monthly instalment payments in the past, and they may be unable to get loans from banks. Through our platform we will do a real matching. So, any customer coming to our platform will have a very, very high probability of getting a loan. We will give the best possible two or three offers, which a customer has the option of selecting. We have developed kind of tech stack that gives us the capability of disbursing the loan the same day.”The Mitra effect4Fin founders believe that customer support will be a big differentiator in the lending space and hence, they have decided to onboard 4Fin ‘Mitras’ (friend). It will be the “Uberisation” of trusted service providers on a freelance model. The Mitras will be connected through an app and upon query or request the nearest Mitra will reach the respective customer.Says Tewary, “A big challenge in any online mode of business is that people feel lost in the customer care segment. Opening branches is a very expensive process for customer service. Hence, we are on-boarding ‘Mitras’ who, along with the technology team, will provide customer support. We will give the requisite training to the Mitras and they will be working with us on a case-to-case basis. They will be paid on a contractual basis and hence, will not be an economic burden. At the same time, it will solve all problems on the customer side. We are giving our customers an omni-channel access for any kind of support.”Credit-embedded marketplaceA 4Fin app and virtual and real credit cards are in the offing, claims the founders. “We are creating a credit-embedded marketplace for some critical products in areas like education, health and electric vehicles. We will not go into the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) space. At present, we are doing lot of tie-ups and hence, possibly, we can offer our customers the best rates (discounts and lower interest rates) for electric two- wheelers from a particular company. Our range of lending will be from Rs50,000 to Rs5 lakh. Most expenses for any individual are covered in this range. We are into bottom-line lending, but volume-wise we want to be top-line,” they stated. Oh, the “heartfulness” factorAjit Sinha and Amit Tewary, both senior former bankers with rich experience in wheels and inventory funding; and retail lending respectively, founded 4Fin in July 2021. Sinha came to Pune in 1998 for his MBA education and met Tewary in 2008 when they were working as colleagues in a bank. Says Tewary, “I was heading the rest of Maharashtra region for retail lending, while Sinha was heading Western India for the wheels division. After a few years Sinha started his own consultancy and mentored many organisations, while I drifted more towards fintech. We both followed a meditation practice called “heartfulness” which kept us connected. We regularly interacted about the potential in the fintech space and decided to start 4Fin.”“Two more co-founders (names withheld) are joining soon,” Tewary added. Says Amit, “We want to reach out to the people. Beyond the top 25 cities of India, almost all regions are unbanked. However, generation of a lead does not necessarily mean we will be giving loan. Defaulting on loans is our problem (not the Mitras problem). 4Fin Mitras will get money on the transaction while the portfolio behaviour is our concern. Initially we are moving with our EV dealer partners and hence, dealers will be our Mitras. Our products will stabilise phase-wise till January or February 2022.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-startup-mantra-4fin-has-raised-1-1-million-in-pre-seed-round-101632568216971.html
25-09-2021||Mumbai||24 tigers were killed in Maharashtra in last 3 years||Nagpur takes pride in being called the Tiger Capital of India but the big cats are seemingly not safe in the five tiger projects in Maharashtra’s Vidarbha region. As per state wildlife department, 24 tigers and 57 leopards have been killed since 2018, mostly in acts of poaching. Abhay Kolarkar, the RTI activist, who sought the details from Maharashtra wildlife wing, said 20 out of the 24 tigers and 45 out of the 57 leopards were poached in the state since January 2018. All these tiger deaths, including those poached, have been in the Vidarbha region. Five out of the state’s six tiger projects in Maharashtra are in Vidarbha region. They are Melghat (Amravati), Tadoba (Chandrapur), Pench (Nagpur), Bor (Wardha) and Navegaon-Nagzira (Bhandara). Sahyadri is Maharashtra’s only tiger project outside of Vidarbha and is spread over Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Ratnagiri districts. As per the RTI response, 15 out of 24 tiger deaths were reported between January 2020 and September 8, 2021, indicating that the Covid-19 induced nationwide lockdown, beginning March 2020, and subsequent restrictions might have aided in the poaching activity.Maximum of the poached tigers were from Chandrapur district, home to the famous Tadoba tiger sanctuary. Of these, four each were reported in Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) division and Bramhapuri forest division and three in Umred-Karhandla Tiger Reserve.All the 57 leopards were killed between January 2018 and September 3, 2021 in various parts of Maharashtra. Of these, 45 were poached, and there was a seizure of leopard skin in one case. The Maharashtra wildlife warden and principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Sunil Limiye said the department was committed to tiger conservation and these incidents were a setback. “We are strengthening our vigil and additional steps will be taken to make sure that we protect the tigers and leopards in all the tiger reserves of the state,” he said.

25-09-2021||Mumbai||Monsoon diseases: Leptospirosis has killed more people than malaria and dengue in six years in Mumbai||Leptospirosis — a bacterial disease that spreads through the urine of infected animals such as rats and cattle — has emerged as the biggest killer among monsoon diseases. Data gathered from the civic body shows that 70 people have succumbed due to leptospirosis over the past six years. In comparison, dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, has killed 55 people and malaria has killed 38 people during the same period. The leptospirosis infection is caused by bacteria leptospira that can enter the human body through cuts, abrasions or open wounds. The cases of leptospirosis are typically during monsoon and after flooding events, when people are forced to wade through water. However, doctors say that a few sporadic cases are reported throughout the year from areas with overflowing sewers, water accumulation, and a general lack of cleanliness. Since 2015, the city has recorded 1,576 cases of leptospirosis, according to civic data. However, this data captures patients who were admitted only in the civic-run hospitals. A large number of patients could be treated in private hospitals and on an outpatient department basis as well. “Mortality in leptospirosis is generally seen when patients seek medical advice very late,” said Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine at the state-run JJ Hospital. “One of the severe impacts of leptospirosis is swelling in the liver, which may worsen in cases of late diagnosis. Also, patients with existing comorbidities can have a severe impact,” he said adding that since June this year, he has treated around 40 patients with leptospirosis. Once confirmed with the infection, patients are treated with the antibiotic drug doxycycline. The civic body also advises taking the drug as a prophylactic if someone has waded through floodwater. “But there is absolutely no awareness about it among the people,” said Shaikh. “Many patients who come to us have no clue about what leptospirosis is. There is a dire need for awareness in the communities,” he said. Physician Dr Gautam Bhansali said that leptospirosis also becomes fatal in cases where patients have extremely low platelet count, which puts them at the risk of bleeding. “Due to Covid, patients are seeking medical help as soon as they develop symptoms like fever. It has helped in early diagnosis of other diseases like leptospirosis,” he said. Bhansali has seen four cases of leptospirosis this monsoon season. The pediatric department of civic-run LTMG Hospital in Sion which caters to people from Dharavi and nearby areas has seen a spurt in cases this year. In 2020, the department had recorded 43 leptospirosis cases in all. This year, the number has touched 62, three months before the year-end. The department has also recorded six leptospirosis deaths among children this year. “The children that we lost were all brought in extremely late to the hospital,” said Dr Radha Gulati Ghildiyal, head of the paediatrics department at the LTMG hospital. “Majority of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and had a history of wading through water,” she said. The civic data, however, has counted only four leptospirosis deaths in Mumbai this year so far. The other deaths are currently under the review of the death committee. Hindustan Times had sought 10-year data on monsoon related diseases however the civic body said that the data between 2011 and 2014 was currently unavailable. Data collated from previous reports show that Mumbai had recorded 135 cases of leptospirosis in 2010, 141 in 2011 and 151 in 2012. The city had recorded 18, six and two deaths due to bacterial infection respectively. Cumulative data for 2013 and 2014 was not available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/monsoon-diseases-leptospirosis-has-killed-more-people-than-malaria-and-dengue-in-six-years-in-mumbai-101632566836894.html

However, Parab did not show up and sought a time of two weeks. His close aide and Regional Transport Office (RTO) officer Bajrang Kharmate was also summoned by the ED in the same money laundering case on September 6.The Maharashtra transport minister has also faced allegations from the former assistant inspector of Mumbai Police Sachin Vaze. Vaze, who is accused in cases of Antilia bomb scare and Mansukh Hiran’s murder, alleged that Parab instructed him to collect ₹50 crore from a trust facing an inquiry to close the probe.Senior Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab has also been in a squabble with leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), including Kirit Somaiya and Union minister Narayan Rane.

25-09-2021||Mumbai||Refusal to marry no ground for rape: HC||The Bombay high court’s Aurangabad bench has quashed a rape case against a 33-year-old man saying he cannot be prosecuted for changing his mind after a long relationship and refusing to marry a woman he was in a relationship with. “From the narration in the FIR (First Information Report) and the material collected during the course of the investigation, it is clear that the applicant had genuine desire to marry the victim,” said a division bench of justices Sunil Deshmukh and Nitin Suryavanshi.“However, later he changed his mind and decided not to marry her. Merely because he resiled from his promise to marry, no offence punishable under Section 376 of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) in the facts of the present case is made out against the applicant.”According to the 30-year-old woman’s complaint in the case, the two had physical relations. She said the man on multiple occasions promised to marry her. She said her relatives approached the man with a marriage proposal but were asked to wait due to the Covid pandemic. They last year registered the rape against the 33-year-old for allegedly exploiting the complainant physically and mentally under the false promise of marriage.The man moved the high court for quashing the case, contending that the physical relationship was consensual. He said his subsequent refusal to marry the woman was no ground for the rape charge.The prosecution maintained the woman’s consent was obtained under the false promise of marriage and since the beginning, the applicant had no intention to marry her.The court accepted the stand of the accused. It said the statements of the woman’s relatives showed the man intended to marry her. “However, later he changed his mind,” said the bench. “Considering these aspects, it cannot be said that the applicant had given a false promise of marriage to the victim and obtained her consent for establishing physical relations... It appears that the consensual physical relations were the outcome of their love affair.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/refusal-to-marry-no-ground-for-rape-hc-101632552615206.html

25-09-2021||Patna||Muslim majority opposed Jinnah’s 2 nation theory, most in Bihar: AMU teacher||With the renewal of a public debate over the two-nation theory-- given by Mohammad Ali Jinnah-- an Aligarh Muslim University teacher said that the majority of Muslims in India, especially in Bihar, used to oppose the divisive theory which was a major factor in the united India’s partition.“Things need to be cleared now as many people, even the intellectuals, seem to believe that the two-Nation theory was the aspiration of general Muslim population in our country at that time. On the contrary, the majority of Muslims were not in favour of division of the country,” Dr Mohammed Sajjad from the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) said in Patna on Friday.Speaking at an online session of the Bihar State Archive, Sajjad said demonstrations and protest meetings were held widely in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and West Bengal, however, “the resistance to the theory was strongest in Bihar.”The AMU teacher further said that various Muslim groups played a major role in protests against the divisive policies of Muslim League. “Public meetings were held and strong protests were also expressed in the journals and books published at that time,” he said.He cited a book, Talash-e Manzil, written by prominent Muslim leader from pre-Independence days, Shah Mohammed, which stated that the majority of Muslims were against Jinnah’s two nation theory. “And to condemn this theory before the Lahore conference, many of the nationalist Muslim groups held a conference in Delhi in April 1940. Mohammed also wrote that before the Lahore Conference, Muslim League had made heavy propaganda in support of the two nation theory using religious spots and groups,” Sajjad said.He also said that an Urdu weekly called Naquib, published by Imarat-e- Sharia, was strongly opposed to the theory. “In its edition on April 14, 1940, Maulana Abdul Mohsin Mohammed Sajjad raised a difficult question before Jinnah. Maulana questioned the rationale behind Jinnah’s hue and cry over alleged torture of Muslims in Hindu dominated areas and his desire to create Pakistan, where Hindus could live in Muslim-dominated areas,” the AMU teacher said.He added that the Momin Conference-- which started in Bihar’s Rohtas in 1925-- was also dead against the two nation theory.“It never approved Muslim League’s catch line, ‘Islam Khatarei Mein Hai’. And in April 1940, it held the Bihar State Momin Conference to oppose Jinnah’s two nation theory and declared the slogan, ‘Islam Khatarei Mei Hai’ as Kufra,” he said.Dr Imteyaz Ahmed, former Patna University history teacher, said that the two nation theory should not be considered as the wish of the majority of Muslims in the country. “In Bihar, it was opposed even at the village level. People used to hold meetings to oppose it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/muslim-majority-opposed-jinnah-s-2-nation-theory-most-in-bihar-amu-teacher-101632551414829.html

He often entered other people’s houses and broke the container [carrying homemade butter]. Had the society then been like today, the ‘bal leela’ would have never happened,” said principal magistrate, juvenile, Manvendra Mishra.The matter related to a village in Harnaut block of Nalanda, where a boy during a visit to his maternal grandmother, entered his aunt’s house in the neighbourhood and ate all the sweets stored in the fridge and also stole a mobile phone from the house and was later found playing with it outside the house. When she found out, the boy’s aunt handed him over to the police.The court said that “one would have to be tolerant and large-minded in matters related to children and understand the reasons behind their deviation for the society to be able to itself take steps to rectify such small offences.”The court said police should have acted sensitively and realised that there was no need to lodge an FIR in this case. “Registering the matter in the daily case diary would have been sufficient,” the court said. It also directed the child protection unit to ensure that the boy in question was not harassed.During counselling, the boy told the magistrate that his father, a bus driver and the sole bread earner for the family, had been bed-ridden due to serious spinal injury after an accident. He said his mother was ill too but unable to afford treatment due to their poverty. The boy promised never to repeat the mistake.Senior advocate cum child activist Krishna Deo Mishra said he welcomed the decision of the board. “All juvenile boards must follow these rules concerning children,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/court-reminds-cops-of-krishna-bal-leela-frees-boy-accused-of-stealing-sweets-101632543313885.html

25-09-2021||Pune||Other states should emulate Maharashtra's cordial political culture: Gadkari||Hailing the "cordial political culture" of Maharashtra, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Friday that it should be emulated by leaders in other states of the country. The BJP leader was speaking here at the launch of a book penned by Marathi film-maker Ramdas Phutane who is also known for his witty verse on politics. "Maharashtra has a tradition of cordial relations between leaders of various parties and it should be emulated by other states too," Gadkari said. "Once (Samajwadi Party leader) Mulayam Singh asked me how was it that I and Sharad Pawar were seen together at Murli Manohar Joshi's felicitation in Parliament though we are from rival parties. I told him that in Maharashtra, politics happens only during elections, afterwards we become friends," he said.Even when the BJP was in opposition in the state, leaders like Sharad Pawar (then in Congress) and Sushil Kumar Shinde treated them with respect, Gadkari said. "I am indebted to (Congress leader) Datta Meghe who was a minister but treated us with great respect at a time when no one gave importance to us," he said. On the other hand, leaders of DMK and AIADMK in Tamil Nadu or those of SP and BSP in Uttar Pradesh are usually not on talking terms with each other, he said.Speaking later at a function at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI), Gadkari applauded the contribution of the institute, and said had it not submitted documentation about the ancient Ram temple in Ayodhya to the Supreme Court, it would have been difficult `to build a new temple'. Noted archaeologist Dr G B Deglurkar was given the first Sir R G Bhandarkar Memorial Award during the program. Gadkari also said that our ancestors did not record history and the British wrote history of India as per their convenience. "Unfortunately, we continued to work further with that history as our base," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/other-states-should-emulate-maharashtra-s-cordial-political-culture-gadkari-101632534304113.html

According to reports, the ‘mashal rally’ will begin at 6pm from Sadar Bazar area of the city and end at Sohna Road. Farmers participating in the rally will be marching with lanterns and urge citizens to express solidarity with their protests by spreading awareness on how the new agricultural laws “pose a threat” to them.The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) expressed hope that as many as 200 people might be joining the rally. A member was cited as saying that farmers are “anna daatas” (providers of food) and that it is imperative people join them in their cause against the contentious agricultural laws.Also Read | ‘Please focus on our concern’: Rakesh Tikait tweets to US President Biden ahead of meeting with PM ModiFarmers across India have been protesting at different sites since November 26 last year against three farm laws enacted by the central government: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The farmers demand that the three laws are repealed and a legal guarantee provided to them on minimum support price for crops. However, the government has consistently maintained that the new laws are pro-farmer. Although farmer leaders – under the banner of the SKM and the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) – have held several rounds of talks with the central government so far, there have been no real breakthroughs and the impasse still remains.The SKM, an umbrella body of more than 40 farm unions spearheading the farmers' agitation, has called for the Bharat Bandh (nationwide strike) on September 27 (Monday) as a widespread push to protest the three agricultural laws. Asking the people of the country as well as political parties to “stand with farmers in their “quest to defend principles of democracy and federalism”, the SKM said that the Bharat Bandh is being observed against the “anti-farmer Modi government” to mark the completion of 10 months of their “historic struggle”.Also Read | Bharat Bandh: Bank union extends support, farmers' stir completes 300 daysThe Bharat Bandh will be held from 6am to 4pm on Monday, during which all government and private offices, educational and other institutions, shops, industries, and commercial establishments as well as public events and functions will be closed throughout the country.All emergency establishments and essential services, including hospitals, medical stores, relief, and rescue work, and people attending to personal emergencies will be exempted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-farmers-to-hold-mashal-rally-today-ahead-of-sept-27-bharat-bandh-101632526776236.html
25-09-2021||Delhi||Armed with just batons, forest guards say ill-equipped to take on bootleggers||A day after four forest officials on patrol at the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary were attacked by over two dozen men, suspected to be liquor smugglers, senior forest officials said this was the second such attack in the past three months and that they were ill-equipped to stop these attacks in the absence of proper protective gear and weapons.On Thursday night, the four foresters were beaten up, threatened, and their vehicles damaged by the gang of suspected bootleggers. On the same day, Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, for the first time, issued a uniform code for the city’s forest department. However, the notification only makes provision for “a cane stick/polycarbonate baton” for forest guards to perform their duties.In June this year, the department’s ecological task force, which is tasked with protecting land reclaimed from encroachers and carrying out plantation, was attacked by around 20 men in Dera Mandi in south Delhi. Foresters say such attacks have become frequent of late.Senior forest officials said the south division recently procured some protective gear, including batons and armour suits, to stave off encroachers, but the department needs more manpower and weapons to take on smugglers and trespassers.“The kind of tasks that our teams undertake often result in them receiving violent threats and coming under attack. Encroachers and smugglers who want to use forest lands for illegal activities do not shy away from violence. What can a lone forester with a baton do if people surround him with knives and guns? In other states, the forest department is as powerful as the state police department -- they have uniforms, weapons and even have the power to arrest culprits. In Delhi, we are toothless,” said a senior forest official, requesting anonymity.Deputy conservator forests (south division) Amit Anand said after Thursday’s attack the department is discussing with Delhi Police the possibility of joint patrolling in the Asola sanctuary. “We have written to the police to see if we can conduct joint patrolling in the sanctuary from now. We have got reports that these smugglers are now moving around with desi kattas (countrymade firearms) and while we are not compromising our patrolling during the day, at night, the risks are far higher,” Anand said.A petition filed before the National Green Tribunal in December 2020 highlighted that in 2019, five incidents of threats and assaults on forest officials were reported. In one such incident, a group of nearly 200 people surrounded a forest office and threatened to kill a ranger.Anand said Thursday’s attack was in “retaliation” to the forest department’s crackdown on liquor smuggling from Haryana to Delhi via the Asola sanctuary. Since the outbreak of Covid, which resulted in Delhi liquor shops remaining shut for a long time owing to lockdowns and curfews, cases of bootlegging increased from across state borders, especially in areas near the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary.The smugglers started using the forest routes to bring in large quantities of liquor from Haryana, forest officials said.Foresters said smugglers have carved out dirt paths through the forest to connect illegal liquor vends in Haryana to Sangam Vihar in Delhi, from where the contraband is distributed to other localities. Since liquor is cheaper in Haryana as compared to Delhi, this is a viable business for many bootleggers in Sangam Vihar, forest officials said.However, over the last year, the forest department started cracking down on these smugglers by scouting their routes and increasing patrolling. In the past two months, the department seized a large number of alcohol crates and liquor-laden vehicles during patrolling.Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of wildlife protection NGO, Wildlife SOS, said, “...when movement of vehicles and people is allowed in a sanctuary, it not only poses a physical risk to animals, but also disturbs their movement and foraging patterns. Most wild animals are nocturnal and generally use the same route, and are impacted by human activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/armed-with-just-batons-forest-guards-say-ill-equipped-to-take-on-bootleggers-101632528003829.html

25-09-2021||Chandigarh||Doorstep garbage collection: Chandigarh MC told to cover entire city by October end||UT adviser Dharam Pal has directed the municipal corporation to initiate door-to-door garbage collection through its motorised vehicles in the entire city by October 31. The direction came during a review meeting on the targets set by the National Green Tribunal on solid waste management in the city. The adviser also directed MC to speed up bio-mining of 5 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of legacy waste at the Dadumajra dumping site. The work was to be completed by May, but till now only 2 lakh MT waste has been removed. “Since the beginning, my focus has been on sanitation and garbage management in the city. We will be strictly following timelines on different solid waste management issues. I have asked the MC to complete the coverage of door-to-door garbage collection and submit an action taken report,” said Pal. There are 2.5 lakh households and commercial establishments from where MC has to collect garbage. “Our aim is to complete the takeover process in the entire city by October 31. Currently, we have covered over 80% of the city areas. There are pockets in villages, 10 areas in rehabilitation colonies and around 200 markets areas which are still to be covered. 100% door-to-door coverage will also help in improving Swachh Survekshan rankings,” said Anindita Mitra, MC commissioner. Since starting the takeover from cart-based collectors in December last year, MC has already deployed around 400 twin-bin vehicles. While around 400 were recently purchased at a cost of around ₹40 crore, 100 were earlier deployed in MC villages. Within a couple of weeks, MC plans to deploy 100 more such vehicles in areas that were left out earlier, and also allocate more vehicles where there is a shortage. Teething troubles continue eight months onEight months into the takeover, MC’s garbage collection continues to remain mired in problems.Residents complain MC vehicles don’t turn up at regular times, and garbage collectors don’t pick up garbage from doorstep, particularly, from the first and second floors. The garbage collection charges have also led to confusion among the residents. Recently, MC also faced flak for inflated garbage collection charges bills. MC is collecting garbage charges through water bills. Residents, in some cases, received bills more than three times the regular bills. “The working the material recovery facilities also depends on the coverage of the door-to-door garbage collection. Also, the segregation of the garbage, which is currently at 65%, also depends largely on the effectiveness of this system,” said a MC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/doorstep-garbage-collection-chandigarh-mc-told-to-cover-entire-city-by-october-end-101632522438833.html

25-09-2021||Chandigarh||Four years after convict’s death, Chandigarh police lodge murder FIR||Over four years after the death of a murder convict at Burail Jail, police have registered a murder case after an inquest probe established that he died of strangulation.Mohan Lal was sentenced to life term in an April 1999 murder case and was incarcerated at the Model Jail, Burail, Chandigarh. A heart patient, he was advised bypass surgery, but refused to undergo the operation when he was sent to GMCH, Sector 32, on January 10, 2017.On the night of February 17, 2017, he was again rushed to the hospital with high blood pressure, but he died after 30 minutes. While jail authorities maintained that he died of cardiac failure, the subsequent autopsy report, ordered by court as part of inquest proceedings, reflected that the deceased’s body had several injuries and fractured ribs. Further probe was conducted by Gaurav Dutta, judicial magistrate first class, Chandigarh. A preliminary report had said, “The present situation is very dicy due to variation in ocular as well as medical evidence. Medical evidence suggests that death may have been caused due to multiple contusions on the neck. Fracture of ribs was not medically fatal.” Eventually forensic experts ruled out poisoning and the court held, “Now, it is crystal clear that after the final opinion of the medical evidence regarding cause of death is asphyxia, consequent upon manual strangulation in a pre-existing case of chronic ischemic heart disease.” The judicial magistrate stated in his report that though the court visited the jail and recorded all possible ocular evidence, no clue as to the culprit could be deduced. Therefore, a murder investigation be initiated by police.‘Ribs may have broken during resuscitation measures’Deposing before the judicial magistrate, the jail’s senior medical officer, Dr Neena Chaudhary, had said the injuries on ribs may have been caused during resuscitation measures, and those on the neck may have occurred due to panic removal of a beaded necklace that the deceased was wearing.He was not given proper medicine: Kin Lal’s wife, Chandrawati, and sons Suresh Kumar and Kanhaiya, during the inquiry into his death, had said that he was ill for some time and police were not giving him proper medicine. Co-prisoner Rajbir, hailing from Haryana, said he and Mohan Lal were lodged in Model Jail, Burail, for the past 16 years.He said Lal had also suffered multiple heart attacks. Jail authorities had deposited money for his treatment. But due to fear, he was not undergoing surgery for his heart ailment. Sometimes, he would not even take his medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-years-after-convict-s-death-chandigarh-police-lodge-murder-fir-101632522431427.html
25-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh PGIMER to resume walk-in OPDs from September 27||For the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in March 2020, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has decided to resume the walk-in physical consultation facility at its out-patient departments (OPDs).From September 27, patients can simply walk in to the institute’s New OPD, between 9.15am and 11 am, and can get registered at the respective registration counters. Prior appointments for physical OPDs through tele-consultation and official website will also continue. Earlier, the summer OPD registration timings were 8am to 11am.“In view of declining Covid cases in Chandigarh and its neighbouring states, we have decided to resume walk-in OPDs. Registration will be open for two hours only to avoid overcrowding and spreading of Covid-19 infection,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.Dr Ram said, “Covid test of every patient visiting the OPD is not possible. But we will ensure that people are wearing face masks and sanitising their hands, besides maintaining social distancing.” Number of online appointments increasedSince the suspension of walk-in consultation and online appointments in March last year, the institute had been providing OPD services through tele-consultation. From June 21 this year, physical consultations resumed, but only after prior appointment through tele-consultation.On September 6, the institute also restarted the online appointment facility, but with a cap of 30 patients per department to ensure adherence to Covid protocols.On Friday, PGIMER also decided to allow 50 patients per department and 100 for three major departments —opthalmology (eye), hepatology (liver) and internal medicine. “Since the pandemic began, PGIMER has been providing all emergency services round the clock, along with essential general OPD services for obstetric, cancer patients and other semi-urgent conditions. The institute had earlier started tele-consultation services, and physical OPDs in a phased manner from June, while the only motive was to prevent exposure of patients with comorbidities to coronavirus,” said Dr Ram.Patient care derailed amid pandemicDespite PGIMER’s measures to provide non-Covid care amid the pandemic, patients have been regularly complaining about difficulty in securing appointments for physical consultation and elective surgeries due to the tedious procedures.Before the contagion started, over 10,000 patients visited PGIMER’s OPDs daily. But now, only 2,000 to 2,500 are being called in per day after tele-consultation and online appointments.Also, while over 200 elective surgeries were being conducted every day at various departments before Covid, only around 100 are being performed now, since the process resumed in June this year, despite the huge pendency.Walk-in OPDs also available at GMCH, GMSHWalk-in OPDs are already operational at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16. Around 2,000 patients are getting OPD facilities at GMSH-16 daily, while the number is around 1,500 at GMCH-32.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-pgimer-to-resume-walk-in-opds-from-september-27-101632522132479.html

Keeping in view the upcoming procurement season, the CM had detailed discussions with the Union food and public distribution secretary Sudhanshu Pandey at the former’s office. The CM was accompanied by his deputy Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa.Pandey informed Channi that the Centre has already taken a decision to procure paddy in Punjab according to the existing norms. The CM said for future the revised norms should only be finalised by taking all the stakeholders, including the Punjab government, farmer unions, arhtiyas and mills into confidence as imposing these unilaterally would mean a great setback to the state. The CM said the Centre has fixed a procurement target of 170 million tonne paddy even as the state agriculture department estimates 191 MT paddy production this season. Expressing concern over the slow movement of grains in the state’s godowns, the CM asked the Union secretary to tie up with the railways to get the warehouses vacated so that additional space could be created for the storage.

25-09-2021||Chandigarh||One-third of cotton area in Punjab under pink bollworm pest attack||Nearly one-third (33%) of a total of 3.25 lakh hectares of area under cotton cultivation in Punjab is presently under attack of the pink bollworm pest, officials of the state agriculture department said. Adding to the worries of cotton growers and the agriculture department, the pest is spreading its tentacles rapidly as it is above economic threshold level in many districts, especially Mansa and Bathinda. It means there are more than six adult pink bollworm insect present in a leaf. Economic threshold is a level at which monetary returns remain higher than the cost of controlling the pest. The state government has ordered special girdwari (assessment) to ascertain the damage to the cotton crop after the pest attack. Agriculture experts fear that the pest attack has entered a phase wherein it would not only reduce the crop yield but will also result in huge financial losses to farmers. Several farmers in Bathinda and Mansa have ploughed their standing crop as it got completely damaged due to the pest attack. State agriculture commissioner BS Sidhu said the department will provide all logistical and technical support to the farmers to control further infestation of pink bollworm. “We are monitoring the situation closely,” he said. Agriculture director Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said the exact damage could be ascertained only after special girdwari ordered by the state government. “The pest attack is scattered. For instance, it has largely affected health of the crop in a village, but there is minimal impact in adjacent areas,” Sidhu said. Officials are carrying out field surveys on a regular basis to gather first-hand information on the pest attack impact so that corrective measures could be taken, he added. Sangrur chief agriculture officer Jaswinderpal Singh Grewal said 2,600 hectare area in Sunam and Lehragaga sub-divisions is under cotton cultivation. “The pest has not crossed economic threshold here as yet. But it is spreading from one field to other at a rapid speed which is a cause of worry,” he said.First major attack since 2015An official said it is the first major pest attack on cotton crop in the state since 2015 when a severe whitefly attack was reported. The crop had witnessed extensive damage as nearly 75% of total area faced pest attack. The cotton yield had reduced to 197kg per hectare than 544kg per hectare in 2014. The cotton production witnessed a steep fall from 13.47 lakh bales to 3.86 lakh bales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/onethird-of-cotton-area-in-punjab-under-pink-bollworm-pest-attack-101632516610447.html
25-09-2021||Chandigarh||Dengue outbreak poses new challenge for Punjab health department, experts blame wet weather||At a time when cases of Covid-19 infections have come down significantly in Punjab, an outbreak of dengue has become a new challenge for the health authorities in the state. According to official figures, about 2,000 confirmed cases of dengue were detected in all districts of the state till Friday. Hoshiarpur has reported the highest number of cases at 403, followed by Amritsar (384), Muktsar (328) and Bathinda (250) districts.Most of the cases were reported in the last three weeks, say health officials. However, no mortality due to dengue has been reported.Officials said mosquito-infested spots were found in several posh localities, including accommodations of senior government officials. Dr Gagandeep Singh Grover, state programme officer for vector-borne diseases, attributed the spurt in dengue cases to unexpected rainfall in the last one month. Field surveillance has revealed that in most cases, dengue mosquito larvae were found in the households, Grover said.“The community has a crucial role to play in controlling the outbreak of the disease. Since weather was exceptionally wet for the last month or so, stagnant water at various places turned breeding spots for mosquitoes,” he added.He said the death of a Patiala resident is being analysed if it was due to dengue.Last year, a total of 8,435 confirmed cases of dengue were reported in Punjab whereas the number was 11,000 in 2019.“In view of the expected higher rate of dengue infection this year, we have increased the number of laboratories to 39 from last year’s 30,” said Grover. Muktsar civil surgeon Dr Ranju Singla said the dengue infestation was maximum in small towns of Malout (170) and Giderbaha (124) while district headquarters has only 9 cases. Bathinda civil surgeon Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon said, “Climatic conditions till mid-November are conducive for dengue larvae. It can be controlled by keeping the surroundings dry besides covering one’s body to protect from mosquito bite,” said Dhillon.In Bathinda, the health department has decided to convert Covid ward to admit dengue patients. “As we are getting 1-2 Covid patients in a day, Covid ward will be shifted to another place. We have ample facilities, including testing and blood units, to treat dengue patients,” said Dhillon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dengue-outbreak-poses-new-challenge-for-punjab-health-department-experts-blame-wet-weather-101632516490384.html

A senior home department official said Gupta, a 1987-batch IPS officer, has applied for one-month leave which is yet to be sanctioned by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who also holds the home portfolio. If the state government sanctions Gupta’s leave, the charge of the DGP office will be given to some other senior IPS officer for the time being. Gupta applied for leave on Thursday, it is learnt. For the new DGP’s appointment, the government has to follow the procedure laid down by the Supreme Court. The state will have to send a panel of senior officials to Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) which will shortlist three names for the job. Sources in the chief minister’s office (CMO) said the state government wants to give charge to the officer seen as the strongest probable for the list to be shortlisted by the UPSC which adopts points-based system after analysing service record and experience. Since Channi took charge as chief minister, the issue of appointment of the new DGP has come for discussion but those involved in the decision-making process failed to reach consensus on one name. A senior official said the new dispensation was about to issue orders to give charge of the DGP to 1986-batch IPS officer S Chattopadhyaya on Thursday evening. But the process was immediately stalled when a camp took up the matter with the All India Congress Committee (AICC). On Friday also, hectic lobbying was on between various groups for the appointment of the new DGP. S Chattopadhyaya, 1987-batch officer VK Bhawra and IPS Sahota of 1988 batch are said to be frontrunners for the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-dgp-dinkar-gupta-applies-for-leave-amid-suspense-over-appointment-of-top-cop-101632516252461.html

25-09-2021||Chandigarh||BKU thanks Punjab CM Channi for support, but says won’t share stage with political parties||The Bharatiya Kisan Union has welcomed Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s support to the farmers’ stir but maintained that their stage will not be shared with any political party. The BKU also refuted allegations that their protest against the Centre’s farm laws is being funded by opposition parties. “First and foremost, this is not a protest run by any political party or the opposition. It is a farmers’ movement against the three new anti-farmer laws brought by the BJP-led government,” Saurabh Upadhyay, a BKU spokesperson told PTI. “There is no doubt that the current opposition is weak. We thank the new Punjab chief minister for supporting the protest. However, we are not going to share our stage with any political party,” Upadhyay said. Soon after his swearing-in as the Punjab CM, Channi, who replaced Capt Amarinder Singh after a power tussle within the Congress, had on Monday extended support to the stir. The BKU, whose members and supporters led by national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait are encamped at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border since late November also refuted allegations of its agitation being funded by opposition parties. “If the Congress had funded the protest, then why had former Punjab CM Amarinder Singh asked farmers to go to Delhi instead of pitching tents in his state. He had said that the protests were hurting Punjab,” Upadhyay argued. “Our protest is being organised in every state irrespective of political party affiliations. We have staged demonstrations in UP, Delhi and even in Congress-ruled Rajasthan,” he said. The farmers’ stir on the three Delhi border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur will be completing 10 months on Sunday. On the future course of action, Upadhyay said the movement is being led by the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) and the BKU has been an integral part of it. “A Bharat Bandh has been called on September 27. The top priority is to ensure the success of this bandh. After this, the SKM will take a call on the future course of action for the protest. The BKU will continue its fight for the farmers,” he added. Hundreds of farmers encamped at the three border sites of Delhi are demanding that the three contentious farm laws be repealed and a legal guarantee provided to them on minimum support price for crops. Tikait has been leading the protest at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border. The Centre, which has held 11 rounds of formal dialogue with the farmers, has maintained that the new laws are pro-farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bku-thanks-punjab-cm-channi-for-support-but-says-won-t-share-stage-with-political-parties-101632515950325.html

25-09-2021||Other||HT Readers’ take: End the wait for non Covid patients||Private hospitals minting moneyAmid the suspension of OPD services by PGIMER, private hospitals are minting money by charging exorbitantly for tests and consultation. Some of the hospitals charge almost 10-fold the amount charged by PGI. It is surprising that even after a year-and-a-half of the pandemic outbreak, PGIMER’s OPDs remain closed. DS Banati,MohaliDon’t neglect non-Covid patientsPersons suffering from chronic diseases are suffering due to the closure of OPDs by government hospitals as private consultations cost a fortune. It is prudent to make arrangements for the impending third wave of the pandemic, but at the same time, authorities must not neglect other patients. Hospital administrations must work out modalities to resume OPD services in a safe manner. Kidar Nath Sharma, via emailTele-consultation lacks reach Medical and paramedical staff have done a commendable job during the first and second waves of the pandemic. It is now time to focus on other patients, particularly those from poor and rural backgrounds, who may not have been able to access teleconsultation services or private healthcare facilities. Subhash Chugh, via emailAffordable healthcare must be accessible Suspension of OPD services and elective surgeries during the peak of the pandemic left many high and dry. Government-run hospitals, such as PGIMER, are crucial in providing affordable healthcare to those who can’t shell out heavy consultation charges of private doctors. It is thus imperative that non-Covid services must be resumed at the earliest. Vineet Gandhi, ChandigarhTelemedicine no match for in-person diagnosisIt is high time that Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) resumes OPD services and elective surgeries as it caters to patients from at least six states. Telemedicine services cannot match in-person diagnosis. Doctors should rise to the occasion and get the authorities to resume the services at full scale before another wave strikes. Pardeep Sapra, via emailNormalcy in all walks, why not in hospitals?When normalcy has returned to all other walks of life, why can’t hospitals resume healthcare services in a phased manner. Though private hospitals gave resumed most services, with SOPs in place, the government ones have been lagging behind. It is understandable to be cautious amid the looming threat of a third wave, but non-Covid patients must not be neglected. PGIMER and other hospitals must resume their services, beginning with critical patients. Prior registrations can be made mandatory to avoid unnecessary crowding.Surinder Paul Wadhwa, MohaliImperative for timely diagnosis, treatment It is imperative to open walk-in OPDs for patients, who have not been able to receive timely treatment after pandemic outbreak, to avoid further deterioration of their health. The poor have suffered the most as going to expensive private hospitals is not an option for them. The walk-in patients should be asked to provide their vaccination certificates or get themselves tested on site. Such measures would reduce the risk of Covid infection and spread.Gurnoor Grewal, ChandigarhMore delays will increase patient loadPGIMER must live up to its reputation and lead the way in resuming OPD services for patients. The over-cautious approach in anticipation of a third wave will harm non-Covid patients whose health condition may worsen in the absence of affordable healthcare that only government-run institutions can provide. Currently, Covid cases are low so doctors can shift their attention to other patients in need of care. More delays in reopening OPDs will only increase the patient load.SC Luthra, ChandigarhRethink healthcare delivery systemsThe Covid-19 crisis seemingly provides a sudden glimpse into a future world, one in which digital has become central to every interaction. Now is the time to rethink healthcare delivery and adopt operations management strategies with demonstrated success that are most promising. This will allow us to be better prepared for future waves of the Covid-19 pandemic.Khushboo Singla, MohaliStreamline patient inflow for safetyPost Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research must resume OPD services but certain steps must be taken to avoid the risk of infection spread. Online tokens must be issued to streamline patient visits. Only one attendant must be allowed to accompany a patient so as to avoid unnecessary crowding. All Covid protocols, such as wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing and regular hand sanitising, must be strictly followed to avoid infection spread once the services are restored. Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliChronic patients need regular careWith a gradual decline in Covid cases over the past few days, it would be advisable to resume OPDs and elective surgeries in government hospitals and PGIMER. Senior citizens are more likely to have chronic health problems. Due to the closure of OPDs, the condition of many patients has worsened. Patients with serious ailments such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, need regular medical care. Resuming the services in government hospitals will provide relief to the common man as private hospitals are looting the public. To cut short the patients’ waiting time, the OPD timings must be increased. Vijay Malia, ChandigarhNon-Covid patients took a backseat for longFor the last several months, the world, especially our medical professionals, have been focused on fighting the pandemic. While Covid patients were treated on priority, the others had to take a backseat. However, now as the Covid cases are going down, it is time to shift focus on other ailments. At such a crucial juncture, when we are looking at a possible third wave in the coming months, we should not let our guard down. Hence, hospitals must impose all Covid protocols, such as maintaining social distancing, following mask norms, and proper hygiene while opening up OPD services. If we take adequate measures to check infection spread, we can treat all patients while keeping patients and doctors safe from the virus.Usha Verma, ChandigarhCrucial time for hospitals to prepare for third waveWhen the pandemic started last year, hospitals worldwide diverted their resources to battling Covid. This resulted in resource constraints. Further, clinicians and non-Covid patients deferred “non-urgent” visits, evaluations, diagnostics, surgeries and therapeutics due to fear of infection. With another wave still on the cards, hospitals must be on the stand by to deal with it. So, this would not be the right time to scale up non-Covid services. Ishita Nara, via emailNo more delays for non-Covid patientsIt is reassuring to know that Covid cases have started declining in the city. In view of this, all government-run hospitals, including the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, must be reopened at the earliest. Any further delay in treatment for non-Covid patients may push us into a health crisis. While it was important to suspend these services in the initial months of the pandemic when the world was facing and unknown, invisible enemy, it is time that all institutions work out modalities to restore normalcy, be it schools, hospitals or workplaces. Kundan Lal, MohaliClear non-Covid backlog, prepare for third waveAs the pandemic is relatively under control, it is the right time for open hospitals to restart routine OPD check-ups and elective surgeries. People have postponed their routine visits for chronic ailments since long and they need to be addressed now. There is a backlog of elective surgeries that need attention. At the same time, in view of the threat of a third wave, a parallel system should be put in place to cater to Covid patients so that in case there is sudden surge in cases, the system should not collapse. We should make use of the time to put our healthcare system back in place.Mukesh Wadhwa, via emailPhased reopening must to avoid healthcare crisisThough the threat of the third wave still looms large, we must not forget the economically weaker sections who cannot afford treatment at private hospitals or avail of services such as online consultation, online appointment booking etc. For their ease, it is critical that government-run hospitals resume their services in a phased manner to avoid a health crisis. OPDs at GMSH-16 and GMCH-32 are already functional, so there is no reason for PGIMER to not do the same. Subhash Nagpal, ZirakpurNot all are tech savvy for tele-consultationWith a visible drop in Covid-19 cases, it is the right time for Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research and other institutions to gradually open and then scale up outpatient department treatments and elective surgeries. While it may not be possible to go back to the pre-pandemic ways, the hospital can still take some measures to alleviate the patients’ suffering while also keeping infection at bay. Though PGI has decided to resume OPD services on appointment basis, all patients are not able to avail it as they are unable to get prior appointment online. If the hospital resumes the services to a certain extent, patients of chronic diseases such as liver-related issues, diabetes, hypertension, heart-related disorders can avail of treatment before their condition deteriorates. To prevent the overcrowding in outpatient departments, inflow must be streamlined at the entry point and distancing measures must be taken.Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurCovid situation seems under controlIn the initial months of the pandemic, shutting down walk-in OPDs was inevitable. Teleconsultations came to the rescue then. But now that the Covid situation is under control, walk-in OPDs must be made operational as non-Covid patients have been suffering in silence for months on. To avoid risk of infection, strict SOPs must be put in place. But we certainly cannot turn a blind eye to the pain of non-Covid patients. SS Arora, MohaliCan’t put off non-Covid treatment foreverLots of surgeries and treatments have been put off during the first and second waves. Many patients themselves avoided visiting hospitals for fear of contracting the virus. They have suffered silently and are perhaps the invisible casualties of the pandemic. While we have the count of Covid infections and deaths, we have no idea about how many died and endured pain due to diseases other than the Covid, in the last over 18 months. With a large part of the population already vaccinated, and Covid cases also remaining low, it is now a good time to shift focus on non-Covid patients before the third wave hits. We don’t know how long the pandemic will continue, so we can’t put off non-Covid treatments forever.Karan Gaba, via emailResume services but avoid overcrowdingWith Covid-19 infection count falling to single digit in the tricity, it is certainly the time for hospitals to concentrate on OPD and elective surgeries. But at the same time, care should be taken to avoid overcrowding at OPDs as we are still facing a threat of the third wave. A multi-pronged approach is required for this. While the entry may be controlled by taking temperature by infrared scanners etc. rather than elaborate testing procedures, the basic approach should be to strengthen the primary and secondary healthcare system in the tricity so that people don’t reach Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research as their first port of call for medical attention. Telemedicine facilities need to be strengthened. Universal affordable healthcare shouldn’t simply remain a mission statement, it needs to be achieved in concrete terms.Lt Col GS Bedi, MohaliAll lives precious, deny treatment to noneAfter the pandemic outbreak, the administration had to take urgent steps to prevent the spread of the virus. At the time, it was important to suspend other operations to focus on the pandemic. All three government hospitals in the city stopped admitting non-Covid patients. But it has been over a year-and-a-half, and the world has learnt to live with the pandemic. Now, the pre-pandemic show must go on. For this, it is important to restore all medical health services, including walk-in OPDs. Each human life is precious. So treatment must be made available with any discrimination- Covid or non-Covid. Telemedicine consultancy must continue to reduce footfall in hospitals but all facilities must be restored with proper standard operating procedures. Col SK Aggarwal (retd), PanchkulaNo patient should suffer due to lack of medical facilitiesAs Covid cases have decreased, government must make arrangements to treat non-Covid patients. They should resume the OPD services and elective surgeries and gradually scale it up in a phased manner. Patient inflow must be controlled. Besides, government hospitals can use any vacant building in the city for these services. For surgeries, patients must be given priority after giving due consideration to their health condition. No patient should die or suffer due to non-availability of medical facilities.Avinash Goyal, ChandigarhLet no one sufferIt is high time that hospitals are opened for the general public. The situation is currently under control as far as tricity’s Covid status is concerned. There are people who are suffering due to problems other than Covid and were not given full attention in terms of medical help. Out patient departments at government-run hospitals should be opened with strict protocols, such as masking, distancing and hand hygiene. Let no one suffer.Garv Bhupesh, PanchkulaPoor have suffered due to suspension of servicesThe poor have suffered the most, mentally as well physically, due to non-availability of medical, oupatient department services and surgeries at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research and other government hospitals. With the pandemic situation showing a slight improvement in the tricity, it is a good time to resume these services for the benefit of the poor, who can’t afford the exorbitant costs of private hospitals. However, Covid norms such as wearing masks, hand sanitising and social distancing must be strictly followed at the hospitals to avoid risk of infection.Col TBS Bedi (retd), MohaliTime to focus on non-Covid patientsWith Covid cases on the decline, non-Covid services must now be opened up since these patients are also suffering. While resuming the services, strict precautions should be observed. There should be clear demarking of the Covid and non-Covid wards and doctors to avoid spread of infection. Prior online appointments and teleconsultation services can help reduce footfall in hospitals. We must not forget that all patients are equally important. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhReader of weekResume OPD services with SOPs in placeFor the past several months, many patients with serious ailments had to suffer as government hospitals discontinued their OPD services amid the escalating Covid situation. All major hospitals, including the PGIMER, must resume walk-in OPD urgently for the benefit of such patients. They should also take care to ensure that Covid protocols are not violated at any cost, to pre-empt chances of the looming third wave. Ramesh K Dhiman, ChandigarhExperts’ takeAlleviate patients’ painNon-Covid patients have already suffered a lot. Since infections are now declining, it is high- time to resume walk-in OPDs and elective surgeries.Dr VK Nagpal, medical superintendent, GMSH, Sector-16.Risk of infectionCovid cases are fluctuating daily. As per experts, complacency in following protocol can invite the third wave in October. If we start walk-in OPDs now, infection can spread easily. Dr AK Gupta, dean (research)-cum-medical superintendent, PGIMER.Safety measuresFor crowd management, steps, such as increasing OPD hours or mandating prior registrations, can prove useful. Count of elective surgeries’ must be increased as it is done in an OT where crowd management is not a problem.Dr KK Talwar, former PGIMER directorScreening & vaxPreference may be given to vaccinated persons at OPDs. Also, proper screening and Covid-safety protocols may reduce the risk of infection and help hospitals scale up non-Covid health services. Dr Rajesh Gulia, acting CEO, Mayo Hospital, Mohali Partial restoration This is the right time for PGI to start walk-in facilities but with a cap on crowding. Full-fledged resumption can increase risk of infection but partial resuming of services will give some relief to the poor patients.Dr Sudhir Garg, medical superintendent, GMCH-32.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ht-readers-take-end-the-wait-for-non-covid-patients-101632515470602.html

25-09-2021||Chandigarh||Old storm sewer lines causing road cave-ins in Ludhiana||Heavy rainfall, and dated storm sewer lines have caused major road cave-ins in Dugri Phase 2 over the last three years. Heavy rainfall on Thursday caused the brick storm sewer lines, which were installed four decades ago, to rupture at four points and cause two-major road cave-ins in close proximity to houses, including one belonging to former Mayor Harcharan Singh Gohalwaria. Similar incidents were also reported in 2019 and 2020. Fortunately, the foundation of the houses was not damaged or the cave-ins took place in a green belt. The antiquated sewer line starts from 200-feet Road in Dugri and continues till the CRPF colony near the Canal Bridge.A resident, Gagan Singla, said the old storm line was made of bricks and gets damaged during the rainy season. “This time, the line got damaged at a distance of a few meters from my house, and in the last two years, a portion just adjoining our house had caved in. We had to place sandbags to stop soil erosion from the foundation of our house,” he said.Former mayor Gohalwaria has demanded that the lines be replaced at the earliest as the foundation of the nearby houses may be damaged, if frequent incidents are reported. “A demand for the same had been raised by residents earlier too, but nothing was done,” said Gohalwaria.An MC official, requesting anonymity, said the sewer lines are old and are not able to cope with rising pressure. Old incidents Decades old storm sewers are also present on the Kaka Marriage Palace Road, Saggu Chowk, Model Town Extension and major cave-ins have also been reported in these areas in the past. The line on the Kaka Marriage Palace has caved-in three times in the last three years. The same line had also got damaged in 2011, claiming a truck driver’s life. In 2013, a 80-ft crater had been formed near the Dhami Eye Hospital after the sewerline collapsed. A major portion of Ishmeet Singh Road near the Model Town Extension cremation ground had also caved in after the old storm sewer line was damaged.  ₹80 crore project hanging fireAuthorities had claimed that a ₹80 crore project will be launched to repair the lines under the Smart City Project. However, it has been two years and the project is yet to see the light of the day.MC superintending engineer Ravinder Garg said the project was in the pipeline and they were awaiting higher authorities’ approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/old-storm-sewer-lines-causing-road-cave-ins-in-ludhiana-101632514633020.html

The complainant, Jaspreet Kaur, 22, of Lakha village, said her husband of six months, Sukhdeep Singh, in-laws, Inderjit Kaur, and Charanjit Singh, and another relative, Gorkha, had started harassing her soon after her visa was rejected. Jaspreet had cleared her IELTS test and had married Sukhdeep on March 20. She wanted to go abroad and her in-laws had promised that they would bear the expenses for sending her abroad, provided she arranged a spouse visa for her husband. “My Visa application was rejected by the Australian Embassy. Later, I applied to Canada, but to no avail. However, after my visa was rejected, my in-laws started harassing me for dowry and my husband started demanding a divorce,” she said. On Thursday, the accused assaulted her and also stabbed her with a sharp edged weapon. Hearing her cries, their neighbours intervened and rushed her to hospital. Assistant sub-inspector Kuldeep Kumar, who is investigating the case, said an FIR had been registered under Sections 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code has been lodged against the accused at the Hathur police station.

25-09-2021||Chandigarh||Channi again in Delhi to discuss ministries, Jakhar meets Rahul||Amid talk of induction of half-a-dozen fresh faces, the Congress high command on Friday held another round of deliberations with chef minister Charanjit Singh Channi in Delhi to give a final shape to his ministry even as it is considering former state president Sunil Jakhar for an “important role” ahead of the state polls. Channi was again summoned by the central leadership for discussions barely hours after he arrived in Chandigarh from the national capital following a series of meetings with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and All India Congress Committee general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal, among others, that carried on till 2am. The newly appointed chief minister, who reached here in the morning, left for the national capital at 4.30 pm – his third flying visit to Delhi in four days – and had another late-night meeting with them to decide the names of cabinet ministers and their portfolios, said sources. The appointment of new director general of police and advocate general was also on their agenda. A number of party leaders, including former ministers, MLAs, MPs and heads of frontal organisations, also reached Kapurthala House where Channi is staying this time. Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat was also in touch with him. Jakhar’s one-on-one meeting with Rahul Earlier, Jakhar had a one-hour meeting with Rahul who is learnt to be considering him for an “important role” with less than five months to go for the assembly elections. The two leaders first had a one-on-one meeting in which they discussed preparations for the upcoming state polls, cabinet expansion and the former state chief’s role in the government and the setup for the elections, sources said, adding that Venugopal also joined them later and Jakhar looked happy after the meeting. While efforts were still on to convince him to join the cabinet with an important portfolio, there is talk in the party circles that he may be asked to head the campaign committee. Jakhar, a Hindu face, was a front-runner for the chief minister’s post with Rahul’s backing after Capt Amarinder Singh resigned following months of internal strife. His name was more or less final at one stage, but a section of party leaders, including Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Ambika Soni and some MLAs, pressed for a Sikh chief minister. Later, the party offered him the deputy CM’s post and two central leaders spoke to him, but he declined. Channi and his two deputy chief ministers — Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni — had taken oath on Monday and they then, along with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, went to Delhi to discuss the expansion the next day. “The high command is being extra cautious and taking feedback from senior leaders to give due representation to all regions and balance the caste and religious equations to avoid any complications later. Also, turf wars and personal grudges of leaders are delaying things,” said a senior party legislator who is camping in Delhi for the past two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-again-in-delhi-to-discuss-ministries-jakhar-meets-rahul-101632512950417.html

The inflow from both cities will have to be stopped to prevent pollution of the rivulet,” said the official.7 ponds to be rejuvenatedSeven water bodies in the city’s villages will be rejuvenated.

25-09-2021||Kolkata||BJP hits at Kolkata cop who stopped its protest, says he molested Tibrewal||Kolkata: Hours after the Kolkata Police booked Bengal’s top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and Priyanka Tibrewal, the party candidate against Mamata Banerjee in the Bhawanipore assembly bypoll, for Thursday’s agitation near the chief minister’s home, the opposition party on Friday complained to the Election Commission allegedly that Tibrewal was molested and beaten up along with other leaders by Akash Magharia, deputy commissioner of police (south).Magharia led the police team on Thursday evening when chaos prevailed near Banerjee’s south Kolkata residence at Kalighat as the BJP staged an agitation with the body of Manas Saha, a district leader, alleging that he died of injuries inflicted by Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers in May.BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar, Lok Sabha members Arjun Singh and Jyotirmoy Singh Mahato, and Tibrewal were booked by the Kalighat police station for unlawful assembly, rioting and use of criminal force to stop public servants from discharging duty.In a letter to EC, the BJP accused Magharia of dragging and pushing Majumdar and said “the same officer molested and inappropriately manhandled Priyanka Tibrewal and some women.”The BJP demanded that Magharia should be removed from election duty immediately and face departmental proceedings.Magharia said the allegation was baseless. “It is in the public domain...You can see the video footage. I have not even touched her. I was standing quite at a distance,” the police officer told news agency PTI.Later, the chief minister also reacted to the agitation at a campaign meeting that she addressed for 40 minutes on Friday.“Some incident took place after the election. But this (the death) is not related to it. I heard there was a surgery later on. The man died of surgery. Any such incident is sad, whether it is in my party or in some other party. When I was in Nabanna (the state secretariat) yesterday, they tried to take the body to my home. Just look at the audacity. These people will otherwise run if someone box their ears,” Banerjee said and moved on to other issues.Around 15 minutes later, she again referred to Thursday’s incident. “You are taking a dead body to my home. What will happen if I send a dead dog and leave it outside your house? Will that be good for you? Do you think I don’t have the machinery? It will take me a second to drop a dog’s rotting carcass outside your home. The stinking smell will not let you eat anything for ten days,” said Banerjee without naming any BJP leader.Her reaction triggered a strong reaction with Union minister Smriti Irani, who was in Kolkata to campaign for the BJP, alleging that Banerjee called Manas Saha a dog “How can Bengal elect a woman who does not even show respect to the dead and call him a dog?” Irani said at a meeting.Priti Saha, the wife of the deceased, reacted too. “What kind of a chief minister do we have? How can she call my husband a dog?” she told the media.Saha, who unsuccessfully contested the Magrahat West assembly seat in the March-April elections, was allegedly assaulted by TMC workers after the results were declared on May 2, the BJP said. Saha died in hospital on Wednesday after months of treatment. BJP leaders blocked the road near Gopal Nagar when the police stopped them from moving towards the chief minister’s home with the hearse. The police stopped the BJP from staging an agitation and removed Majumdar and the others who sat on the road, blocking traffic. In its complaint to the EC, the BJP said, “The procession, maintaining Covid guidelines and restrictions, was peacefully proceeding when a large number of police personnel resorted to unprovoked aggression and started charging towards the funeral procession.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-hits-at-kolkata-cop-who-stopped-its-protest-says-he-molested-tibrewal-101632512410019.html
25-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: An alley in Old Delhi||The wall’s blue colour has faded unevenly. In some places, the patches look like a clear blue sky. In other places, they look as if the sky were shrouded over with smog. The blue though doesn’t cover the entire wall, and soon gives way to large expanses of bare ochre-coloured bricks. While cobwebbed windows and twice-locked doors stand as the wall’s gloomier centrepieces.This wall runs along a side-alley in Old Delhi’s Jatwada that passes under an arched gateway and disappears into a private residence.This afternoon, absolute silence is reigning here. Even the pigeons are quiet. One of the large windows framed into the wall has its panes made of wood instead of the customary glass, as if it were purposely forbidden for the inhabitants to look at the world outside. The other much smaller window is even more tragic: it is blocked with concrete.The structure isn’t of an old vintage—these bare bricks on the wall are seen across the city and its suburbs—but the arches, the doors and the windows illustrate graceful sensibilities of a bygone architecture. On lingering long, you notice in a part of the still-painted wall that some of its surviving blue has peeled away, exposing the bricks underneath. And now a startling discovery—the naked section is composed of the slimmer lakhori bricks, the building material of the Walled City’s older mansions. This suggests that the wall, mostly consisting of modern-day bricks, was originally very old and was renovated/rebuilt at a later date, and not with the same material. The little portion of lakhori remnants is clearly an overlooked leftover, which shows that while much of the tangible past has been uprooted with time, some traces of it are accidentally conserved within the present.The lane faces Masjid Anarwali—a mosque named after a pomegranate tree. Turns out the tree no longer survives. And yet, that pomegranate’s recollection continues to live in an existing landmark. Paired with the neighbouring wall, both these edifices aptly contain the essence of the contemporary Walled City—old memories embedded in new concrete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-an-alley-in-old-delhi-101632511966396.html

This agitated the farmers and the number of protesters had increased within a few minutes.The protesters surrounded vehicles of the BJP leaders outside the venue and the windshields of two SUVs were allegedly damaged. However, there were no reports of injury to anybody.In an interaction with the media, Kurukshetra superintendent of police (SP) Himanshu Garg said paramilitary forces were also called in and the situation was under control.Later, MP Nayab Saini accused the Congress party of instigating the protesters. He said such “hooliganism” in the name of protest cannot be accepted and there were Congress supporters among the protesters.BJP’s OBC Morcha leader Karan Dev alleged that the protesters attacked the car in which he was travelling with the MP and the MLA.He said stones were pelted on their vehicles. “The protesters were Congress workers and will be identified so that strict action can be taken against them,” he said.On the other hand, the protesters accused Nayab Saini of trying to create division among people by holding such meetings.Soon after getting reports of the meeting of BJP’s OBC Morcha at Saini Dharamshala, the farmers reached the venue and chanted slogans against the BJP leaders.Amid heavy police deployment, the farmers continued their protest and police struggled to control the farmers when the BJP workers reached to attend the meeting.Some protesters slammed the BJP leaders for conducting the meeting in the dharmshala of a particular community.“We are also from the Saini community and this dharamshala belongs to all. But the politicians are trying to create a rift between farmers on the basis of caste and religion by conducting their meeting at the dharmshala of one community,” alleged a protester.The Kurukshetra SP said the situation is being evaluated and an FIR will be registered accordingly. On damage to the vehicles, he said some damage to vehicles was reported but it will become clear once a formal complaint is received.This is for the second time that the Kurukshetra MP’s vehicle was attacked. On April 6, the windshield of Nayab Saini’s car was damaged during a protest by the farmers in Shahbad and later, four people were arrested on various charges, including attempt to murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-mp-mla-face-protests-from-farmers-windshields-of-two-vehicles-damaged-101632512231353.html

The expedition comprising of personnel from the Indian Army’s base in the border district of Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand had left to scale the peak to commemorate the Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations during which they came across the body of the mountaineer. Satopanth Peak which is 7075 metres high is the second highest peak in Gangotri National Park situated in the Garhwal Himalayas in the state. A senior army officer who didn’t wish to be named citing the protocol and is privy to the development said, “The expedition comprised 25 personnel who had gone to scale the peak on September 12.” “While they were en-route braving rugged terrain and inclement weather, they came across the remains of the body. We believe that it is the mortal remains of one of our mountaineers who was part of another expedition of the Indian Army which had gone to scale the same peak in 2005. During that expedition, some of the mountaineers went missing. We suspect he is one of them,” he said. The officer said that the expedition members collected the mortal remains and brought it down to Gangotri base on Thursday. “However, we couldn’t ascertain his identity and handed the body to the local police for the same. Once, it is done, we will hand it over to his family members with all the military honours which he deserves,” said the officer. Superintendent of Police, Uttarkashi, Manikant Mishra while confirming the development said, “After receiving the body from the army, we had sent it to hospital for post-mortem examination.” Mishra added, “The police will also conduct a DNA test to ascertain its identity and inform the army authorities accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/army-personnel-find-body-of-missing-mountaineer-from-2005-expedition-in-uttarakhand-101632512109872.html

The woman, P Viji, and her husband going on a motorbike encountered the elephant at a hairpin bend at Sankarpandiamettu, at least 22 kms away from hill destination Munnar. Her husband said both panicked after seeing the elephant on the road and he tried to take a U-turn but the bike skidded and both fell on the road. The elephant charged at them and stomped Viji fatally. But the husband escaped with minor injuries. Police said both are tea plantation workers in Munnar and they were returning to their work after meeting their relatives in Theni district of Tamil Nadu. According to statistics of the Kerala forest department from 2010 to 2020, 173 people die in man-animal conflicts. The highest number of deaths were reported in 2016 – 33 – and the lowest in 2015, of six. Among 173, 120 died in elephant attack. In the same period, 64 elephants also died after being hunted, electrocuted, hit by speeding vehicles and from explosives. The state’s most conflict-prone areas are Wayanad, Palakkad and Idukki districts, said the report. Wildlife experts say jumbo straying can be contained by managing elephant corridors intact. They say one of the main reasons for elephant attack in Idukki district is encroaches along Anamalai-Periyar tiger reserve elephant corridor. They say shrinking of their habitat and corridors force many elephants to foray into human settlements. “We need a healthy co-existence of both. If we respect the need of both we can lower tension between two,” said Dr P S Esa, a leading wildlife expert. Kerala has a robust forest cover, 29% of the total area and it has a healthy wildlife population, 190 tigers and 5706 elephants. But at the same time forest encroachment is also rampant in many parts of the state. Wildlife experts say jumbo straying can be contained effectively by leaving elephant corridors intact.

He also directed the director general of police (DGP) to provide necessary help to the local administration.Despite the ban, such constructions have continued to crop up in villages as reported by the Hindustan Times on September 22.The Punjab New Capital Periphery Control Act restricts constructions in the periphery of around 16km (controlled area) of the city, which covers the areas outside the lal dora. The Punjab and Haryana high court has also imposed restrictions on construction for protection of the Sukhna Catchment Area. UT adviser Dharam Pal said, “We will enforce the ban more comprehensively and strict action will be taken against violators. I have reiterated to the district officials to take necessary steps to put a stop to such constructions outside the lal dora.” Constructions outside the lal dora had again started to mushroom after the UT administration earlier this year had indicated regularisation of illegal constructions outside the lal dora.In January this year, former UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had directed UT officials to bring a comprehensive policy on the issue.The administration has roped in the Indian Institute of Human Settlement (IISH), Bengaluru, to formulate a land pooling and aggregation policy.A comprehensive land pooling policy is in the works, which will allow land development rights to the villagers.

The hate crime triggered widespread outrage in the country, and for long, became an example of the stringent caste barriers in India and police inaction in dealing with such crimes. Out of the total 15 accused named in the case, justice S Uthamaraja of the Cuddalore district special court found 13 guilty – 11 family members and 2 local policemen -- under the SC/ST Act, and acquitted two others. The court in its order said that there is nothing honourable in ‘honour killings’. “In our opinion honor killings, for whatever reasons come within the category of rarest of rare cases deserving punishment. It is time to stamp out these barbaric, feudal practices, which are a slur on our nation. This is necessary as a deterrant for such outrageous, uncivilised behaviour. All person who are planning to perpetrate ‘honour’ killing should know that the gallows await them.”The case dates back to May of 2003, when a 25-year-old Dalit man, S Murugesan, and D Kannagi (22) – of the locally powerful Vanniyar community – eloped and secretly got married in a sub-registrar’s office in Vriddhachalam, Cuddalore. Fearing for their safety, the couple did not stay together but found refuge separately in their relatives’ houses in the district. According to the charge sheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2009, their families tracked them down in July. Murugesan was first found by Kannagi’s family members, hung upside down and tortured to reveal the whereabouts of Kannagi. The convicts then took the couple to a cremation ground in the village, forcibly fed them poison – including pouring it into their ears and nose – and set them ablaze in the presence of villagers. “The judge said that this was a caste-based and barbaric killing,” said G Sugumaran, secretary of the Federation for People’s Rights – an NGO which helped Murugesan’s family with the case proceedings such as to file a case in court seeking a CBI probe, seeking CBI’s chargesheet, which was in English to be translated to Tamil and challenging the arrest of Ayyasamy and Gunaseakaran who Murugesan’s family members-- the court acquitted on Friday.Amidst anger over the case, there were also allegations that Vriddhachalam police failed to take action despite being approached by Murugesan’s father Samikannu and younger brother Velmurugan after the killings.Activists rallied for justice and filed a public interest litigation (PIL) with the Madras high court that the local police were trying to protect the upper caste accused. In 2004, the high court ordered the CBI to take over the case and the agency filed a 665-page charge sheet five years later, naming 15 accused on the basis of an investigation involving 81 witnesses. Trial for the case began in the special SC/ST court in Cuddalore in 2017, and proceedings were completed this April. On Friday, Kannagi’s brother D Maruthupandian (49) was sentenced to death by the court, which also asked him to pay a penalty of ₹4.56 lakh. He was charged for his role as the main conspirator of the crime. Those given life sentences are Kannagi’s father C Duraisamy (68), a second brother D Rangasamy (45) and other relatives of Kannagi -- K Kandavelu (54), K Jothi (53), R Mani (66), R Dhanavel (49), V Anjapuli (47), K Ramdoss (52), N Chinnadurai (50). All of them were also asked to pay a penalty of ₹4.15 lakh each. Former deputy superintendent of police Chellamuthu and inspector Tamilmaran of the local police station were also awarded life sentences, along with a penalty of ₹1.15 lakh each for foisting false cases 3 (2) (1) under SC/ST Act against Samikannu and other relatives.Ayyasamy and Gunaseakaran, Murugesasn’s relatives, were acquitted.Murugesan’s father Samikannu broke down after the verdict was announced on Friday. “They (police) hit me...” he told reporters in Cuddalore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/18-years-after-hate-crime-1-gets-death-12-sentenced-for-life-in-tamil-nadu-101632511329621.html

The immediate grievance is in the State Election Commission failing to respond to several suggestions put forth by the petitioning party to such commission in respect of the forthcoming elections to local bodies. To the extent that the suggestions require some measures to be taken by the SEC, as were taken in course of the immediate previous local bodies’ elections, the SEC should ensure that such measures are put in place.

The chief minister also congratulated the health secretary, officials and medical professionals and staff who made the scheme a success.The Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam healthcare scheme provides treatment for non-communicable diseases and those with infirmities. Women public health workers, women health volunteers, physiotherapists and nurses provide healthcare to those aged 45 and above.Stalin who launched the International Week of Deaf People, on the occasion, became nostalgic saying former chief minister M Karunanidhi laid the basis for celebrating his birthday to benefit the people. “Kalaignar (as Karunanidhi was called) wanted to celebrate his birthday in a manner that could benefit the people, especially the poor. He launched numerous welfare initiatives including the beggars’ rehabilitation programme, Kannoli scheme (to provide free spectacles), abolished hand-pulled rickshaw replacing them with cyclerickshaw,” the chief minister said. Kalaignar (who is Stalin’s father) had launched the CM’s Comprehensive Health Insurance scheme and brought the cochlear implant under this scheme. “Like him, I too celebrate my birthday by spending time and sharing cake with the children of the Little Flower School for the Deaf. My family members accompany me during such occasions,” he said.He said his government’s aim is to create jobs, feed the hungry masses and also alleviate the conditions of the physically challenged and the shelter-less.About 135,572 people have been provided with cochlear implant at a cost of ₹108 crore under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme. About ₹10 crore has been earmarked this year for the purchase of modern equipment for all government hospitals to continue the scheme, he said.Also, the chief minister unveiled a plaque to create awareness on the presence of a 150-year-old surviving baobab tree brought from Madagascar by the British. This 65-foot-tall giant tree is close to the anatomy block of the Madras Medical College here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dmk-taking-schemes-to-doorsteps-tamil-naducmstalin-101632511209737.html

Vidhu Shekhar, 28, was among the top scorers in the UPSC examination. With an all-India rank (AIR) 54, this alumni from La Martiniere College, Lucknow, proved there’s no short cut to success. In 2018, Vidhu cracked the UPSC exam with a rank of 173 and got into the Indian Revenue Services (IRS). The next year, he scored an AIR of 191 but attempted the exam again, hoping for a better rank.“Short-term goals, consistency, and strong will power are key ingredients for scoring well in the UPSC examination. I studied for 6-8 hours daily,” he said. Vidhu did B Tech in information technology from IIIT Allahabad in 2016 and joined a tech firm as software engineer and started preparing for civil services. Currently, he was undergoing training at NADT (National Academy of Direct Taxes), Nagpur. “Family played the most important role in my life,” shared Vidhu. His father, Dr Nishith Rai was earlier the vice-chancellor of DSMRU while his mother is a home-maker. He also added that technology played a major role in his success and he relied on it to a great extent. During the pandemic, he prepared from his home in Lucknow. “The pandemic didn’t affect my studies much as I preferred online classes and test series, but a lot of mental stress was caused due to the fear of getting infected by the virus,” revealed Vidhu.Shivakshi Dixit, 25, of Lucknow was first introduced to the world of civil services by her mother, who is a teacher. She told Shivakshi that it needs sheer dedication and hard work to qualify the civil services exam. Shivakshi qualified the state PCS exam earlier this year and secured AIR 64 in the civil services exam.“The key is having faith in hard work. This was my second attempt at the civil services exam. In the first attempt, I couldn’t even qualify the prelims exam but decided to give it another shot,” said Shivakshi. An alumna of La Martiniere Girls’ College, she completed her graduation in commerce from a Delhi University college before starting preparations for the civil services exam.Isha Singh, 26, another Lucknowite and alumna of La Martiniere Girls’ College cleared the civil services exam and was selected for Indian Police Services by scoring an AIR 191. Singh, who graduated from the National Law School Bangalore in 2018, said: “My motivation to enter the services was to serve the people. I love to work on issues regarding human rights and justice.” She is a third-generation police officer in her family. Her mother, Abha Singh (lawyer, activist, bureaucrat) was also in the services. Her father, YP Singh, was an IPS of the Maharashtra cadre. “Your basic goal should be to serve the country and to take the country to the next level,” Isha advised current IPS aspirants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/civil-services-exam-results-out-three-cheers-for-lucknow-101632510971302.html

25-09-2021||Chandigarh||Proposed Sufi FM channel yet to become reality in J&K||More than a year has passed since a letter was issued by home secretary Ajay Bhalla to launch an FM channel to check radicalisation of Kashmiri youths and counter Pakistan’s propaganda following abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A, but no exercise has been initiated by the Prasar Bharati to set up the radio channel in Jammu and Kashmir. The proposal also aimed to promote Sufism in the UT. On June 10 last year, home secretary in his letter to the then secretary of the information and broadcasting ministry, Amit Khare, had mooted a proposal to start a new Sufi FM radio channel ‘at the earliest’. Bhalla had requested Khare to examine the matter at topmost priority and issue necessary instructions at the earliest under intimation to the home ministry. On June 25 last year, the then I&B secretary Khare in turn had sent a written communiqué to the Prasar Bharati CEO, Shashi Shekhar Vempati, enclosing the letter of the home secretary. “Please accord topmost priority to the matter and take steps to start the radio channel at the earliest under intimation to the ministry,” reads Khare’s letter to Vempati. HT has access to both the letters. An official of the I&B ministry, who insisted to remain anonymous, said, “At a time when Pakistani media is running smear campaigns against India and Pakistani PM Imran Khan is calling Kashmir its jugular vein, abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A besides Taliban capturing power in Afghanistan, the Prasar Bharati has chosen to maintain a stoic silence to counter enemy propaganda to such an extent that it did not follow the orders and inputs of even home secretary to check the growing radicalisation in the border region.” “The separate and exclusive Sufi FM radio channel in J&K was mooted to counter growing radicalisation and promote Indian ethos,” he added. Prasar Bharati CEO Vempati said, “Prasar Bharati produces a diversity of programming in national interest through Doordarshan channels and All India Radio stations across India, including J&K. Efforts are also being made to include Sufi-based programming in services of strategic or national interest and programmes will go on air shortly on the same.” He, however, didn’t specifically respond to Sufi FM radio channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/proposed-sufi-fm-channel-yet-to-become-reality-in-jk-101632510909880.html

The drone was spotted at 3.35am by troops of the 103 Battalion of Border out Post (BoP), Dharma, near Khalra. As soon as it was detected, Border Security Force (BSF) personnel fired 12 rounds towards it, but its handlers, somehow, got the machine to return. “No recovery has been made in the area yet,” BSF officials added.Notably, the KLF operatives arrested on Thursday were also coming from the India-Pakistan border near Khalra in a car. A search of the car had led to the seizure of two Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), apparently to be used as Tiffin Bombs, two hand grenades and three .9mm pistols. Police said they suspect that a drone from Pakistan had dropped the seized arms and explosives for the use of the three arrested men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-after-seizure-of-weapons-drone-seen-along-indo-pak-border-in-tarn-taran-101632510729898.html

Gadkari was in a city to do groundbreaking of flyovers at Sinhgad road and Katraj chowk. Gadkari said, “It was a long pending issue related to the extension of Lohegaon airport. In the first phase of development, various works were completed but the Air Force was not ready to hand over 13 acres of land for it. Recently, the Air Force submitted a demand to hand over land for them at Chandigarh. In that meeting, I asked the Air Force that we would give you land at Chandigarh and in compensation the Air Force should hand over land at Pune.” Gadkari said, “As I am the chairman of infrastructure projects in the country, the proposal would be placed before me. The Air Force has given in-principle approval to take land at Chandigarh and hand over 13 acres land in Pune. Now the process for it would start and I would give official approval very soon.” Gadkari said, “After getting 13 acres of land, Pune airport’s capacity would almost double.” “Establish ‘New Pune’ around Pune-Bengaluru expressway” Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari has appealed to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to help set up a “New Pune” on the proposed Pune-Bengaluru expressway. Gadkari said, “Pune has become very crowded. Now we must think about “New Pune”. The Maharashtra government and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) can do this project jointly. We would purchase land along this expressway and establish the new city. We can give connectivity of Metro and other transport modes to “New Pune” with existing Pune. To do sustainable development, we must think on such projects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/iafgives-in-principle-approval-to-hand-over-13-acres-for-lohegaon-airport-101632510129850.html

The doctors, who initiated the process on the order of the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court, said the entire process was successful and the girl was safe.“It took more than 24 hours for the abortion process to complete. It was a risky affair since the abortion was carried out in the second trimester, but it went off successfully,” Dr SP Jaiswar, medical superintendent of QMH. The girl was scheduled to be discharged by the late evening hours of Friday.“The entire process went off successfully,” said Mohammed Haider, a corporate lawyer and social activist who helped the girl in lodging an FIR and for obtaining pregnancy termination permission from the court. He said he had also approached the District Legal Service Authority (DLSA), demanding compensation for the rape survivor.“We have moved an application under the victim compensation scheme before the DLSA, Lakhimpur Kheri that has a provision of compensation amount up to ₹3 lakh. This will certainly help the minor in leading a normal life and to meet day-to-day expenses,” added Haider. He said that they have also arranged for the month-long supply of nutrition supplements and food in order to give stability to the minor who is still in a state of trauma. The girl, who hails from a village in Lakhimpur Kheri, was allegedly raped by her relative. The pregnancy was discovered on August 9, 2021 after she suffered severe stomach ache. It was found that she was 16 weeks and three days’ pregnant. The FIR was lodged in the matter and the perpetrator was arrested and sent to jail on August 12.On September 2, a social activist from the state capital, who was contacted by the victim’s mother, filed a writ petition before the Allahabad high court demanding termination of the pregnancy. On September 6, 2021, the court ordered the Lakhimpur Kheri chief medical officer to carry out a physical examination of the victim and submit his report in a sealed envelope before the court. On September 14, 2021, the court ordered pregnancy termination, presuming that the continuance of the unwanted pregnancy shall “constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the victim”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/14yearold-rape-survivor-s-pregnancy-terminated-on-court-orders-101632510069600.html
25-09-2021||Chandigarh||High court notice to HP chief secy over demolition of Mandi school building||The Himachal Pradesh high court on Friday issued notices to chief secretary, principal secretary (education), Mandi DC and deputy director (higher education) in a petition alleging destruction of the building and playground of Vijay Senior Secondary School in Mandi by the state government. A division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua passed these orders on a petition taken up suo motu as a public interest litigation on a letter addressed to the chief justice by one student of the Vijay Senior Secondary School. The petitioner has alleged that during the lockdown, the state government demolished the school building, playground and stage besides covering the vacant space, which “gave the school a congested feeling”. He has alleged that big shopping malls are proposed to be constructed there, which would benefit “few rich persons and political leaders”. He has claimed that the existence of a playground is projected as one of the prerequisites for opening a private school, but here the government itself has destroyed the playground. Local residents, media and social organisations are not coming forward due to fear of the government, he added. A primary school was being run in the building, which was also closed a few years ago and now the government is illegally plotting to shut the senior secondary school, he alleged. The petitioner has said that poor, orphaned and migrant children are studying in the school and the students are being “mentally pressured” by officials with threats of spoiling their results and are also being given various allurements. He has alleged that if immediate respite is not provided by taking action in the matter, there is the possibility that some students may commit self-immolation in order to save the school. He has also mentioned that former chief justice Swantanter Kumar has also studied in the said school. The court directed the respondents to submit their replies before next date and posted the matter after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-notice-to-hp-chief-secy-over-demolition-of-mandi-school-building-101632510009566.html
25-09-2021||Mumbai||Prosecution failed to make out a case against Chhagan Bhujbal, kin: Court||A special anti-corruption bureau (ACB) court, which discharged Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Chhagan Bhujbal along with seven others on September 9, in its detailed order observed that after taking into account the material available on record and hearing both the sides, it required to hold that the prosecution had not made out a prima facie a case against the accused Chhagan Bhujbal, his son Pankaj, nephew Sameer, the then public work department (PWD) secretary Deodatta Marathe, Mumbai Educational Trust (MET) employees Tanveer Shaikh, Iram Shaikh, Sanjay Joshi and Geeta Joshi.The case dates back to 2005 when Bhujbal was the Public Works Department (PWD) Minister who allegedly gave a contract without inviting tenders to KS Chamankar Enterprises. The ACB had registered a case in the matter in 2015 after the Bombay High Court had observed there was prima facie evidence and ACB can register FIR if a case of corruption is made out. The ACB had registered a case against eleven people alleging that a developer was favoured for a project under which an RTO land in Andheri was to be handed over for a project in lieu of construction to the tune of ₹100 crores at Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi and RTO building in Tardeo.Earlier the court had discharged five accused in the case — Arun Deodhar, Krishna Chamankar, Pravina Chamankar, Pranita Chamankar and Prasanna Chamankar.Additional sessions judge, HS Satbhai who discharged the eight accused in a detailed 106 pages order observed from the material available on record, though a suspicion against the accused has been shown by the prosecution, the same has been satisfactorily explained by the accused through their counsels Prasad Dhakepalkar and Sajal Yadav.None of the ingredients constituting the alleged offences punishable under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and under sections of the Indian Penal Code are found, so that a trial can be held against the accused.The judge further observed the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, speaks about obtaining a pecuniary advantage for himself or others by corrupt or illegal means. As discussed there is nothing on record that suggests that the accused did certain things by corruption or illegal manner to cause the benefit to the developer or any other person or that they have acquired any benefits for themselves. The prosecution has failed to establish that the accused obtained for themselves any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage by abusing their position as public servants.The court further wrote that the whole episode was a contract between the developer and the State Government. Since it was a contract between two parties the developer constructing some buildings for the state government, against the consideration in terms of FSI, it was but natural that while entering into the contract, both the parties were keenly interested in protecting their own interest, while negotiating the terms and conditions of the contract.At this stage of framing of charge, it is necessary to find out that are their sufficient grounds for prosecuting the accused. While making that exercise, it is from the court to sift the material, which is produced and relied upon by the prosecution. The sifting is not to be meticulous. What is required is that the court must be satisfied that with the materials available, a case is made out for the accused to stand trial? A strong suspicion suffices. But the strong suspicion must be premised on some material that will help the court to formulate an opinion that the accused have committed an offence. The judge should not act as a trial judge but should weigh the evidence and form an opinion on whether prima facie a case has been made out. Excerpting the case of grave suspicion which the accused is unable to explain, the judge empowered to discharge the accused.The allegations against one of the accused Devdatta Marathe then PWD, secretary, Mantralaya, Mumbai that he should have checked the preliminary report of estimate/assessment of the construction to find out the profits and loss of either party to the contract. Being a public servant, he must be working under certain rules to that effect. But prima facie no such rules are made available to establish that the preparation of estimate was against the provisions of those rules.The feasibility report was presented before the committee twice from May 2006 to August 2006, the committee even had chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh who was then the chief minister as a member.The estimates and reports were shared with every department over 100 communications were made on it. For re-developing the areas Anna Nagar Housing Society and Kasam Nagar Housing Society, KS Chamankar was appointed in 1998, by the SRA, there was no role of Chhagan Bhujbal in appointing KS Chamankar Developers.The court has also stated that though Bhujbal carried out a meeting on 13th July 2001, asking others to decide about giving building the RTO building on a non-slum plot he did not give any specific directions to favour any developer. However, the NOC given by RTO took 22 months and was finally given 26th May 2003, this show there was no personal interest of the accused in the matter he had called the meeting as several others had written to him.The court further observed that it is alleged that Bhujbal on 29th of March 2006, called a meeting of PWD, Home and SRA officials and overlooked the objections raised by Finance and PWD department to the said proposal but after going through the minutes of the meeting it is clear that not only favourable but unfavourable things also were discussed in the meeting. It is not the prosecution story that Bhujbal asked anybody to hide anything unfavourable about the proposal, but he indeed kept everything before the Cabinet Ministers to decide on it.The court also observed that the first meeting was taken by Bhujbal on 29th July 2001, and the second directly on 29th March 2006, there is no material to show that the accused took a direct part in awarding the contract to the developer K S Chamankar. It cannot be said that the accused conspired developer in the year 2001, when he was not the PWD minister but called a meeting, and further the conspiracy was accomplished in the year 2006 when he was the PWD minister. It was not anticipated by the accused in 2001 that he would win elections as Member of Legislative Assembly and will be given a portfolio of PWD minister.The Transport department had already taken an opinion of MHADA on the said proposal which had said it was beneficial for Transport Department and the RTO may give a NOC to the developer. The court also observed that no favours or illegality have been granted by the accused to the developer to get the contracts nor he has paid any kickbacks/quid pro for it.It was also observed in the month of August that the ACB had registered the FIR in hurry. Most of the calculations in the matter were made by Narendra Talegaonkar who was the ACP with ACB; he was neither an architect nor an engineer and he was no expert to do calculations related to said matters.The ACB had registered an FIR against all the accused on June 11, 2015, much before the appointment of an architect who is an expert on such matters who was officially appointed on June 30, 2015. The architect had submitted a report on June 9th, 2015, but prior to it on June 4th a sanction was asked to register an FIR in the case where points of the report were mentioned.The court further said that the PWD report came in December 2015, which said that there was no illegality in the contract and the feasibility report was prepared as per prevailing rules and practices followed in PWD however the FIR was already registered by then by the ACB on June 11, 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/prosecution-failed-to-make-out-a-case-against-chhagan-bhujbal-kin-court-101632509950762.html

Of the 8.53 million eligible beneficiaries, 81.43% have got the first dose. Pune is one of the only two districts in the state that have crossed the 10 million milestone with Mumbai administering 12.12 million Covid vaccines while Pune administering 10.06 million vaccines as of Friday evening. The highest percentage of second dose beneficiaries or those who are fully vaccinated are from PCMC area, followed by PMC and then rural Pune as the high presence of vaccination centres in city areas along with government centres drives the vaccination numbers. Of the total vaccination centres in the district, 1,013 are private and 898 are government. Of these, 795 private centres are from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), 156 PCMC and 65 are from rural. Of the total government centres, 388 are from Pune city, 93 from PCMC and 417 from rural Pune. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, district immunisation officer, said, “If the supply remains consistent, we can introduce more centres and increase our vaccination drive even more. More people are now convinced that vaccination does indeed immunise people against Covid. The supply has been better in the last couple of weeks. If it continues, we would be able to reach halfway with regards to fully vaccinated people within the next few weeks and then in the next 3-4 months or by yearend hopefully all eligible beneficiaries would be fully vaccinated with both the doses in the district. Along with government’s support in providing consistent supply, private players in Pune also contributed and we could catch up the 10 million mark.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/over-36-fully-vaccinated-in-pune-district-81-partially-inoculated-101632509770552.html

Instead, a committee representing the common concerns and demands will take up the matter to the government, for bringing about a change. Tomorrow (Saturday), we will take a call on the best possible way to form the committee,” Ahuja added.The RU, comprising a dozen RWAs, was established on Sohna Road in 2019. It emerged as the first pan-city group in Gurugram during the second wave of Covid-19 in April this year. 59 RWAs had joined forces to support one another with essential supplies and medical aid for infected persons in their housing complexes as the healthcare infrastructure was overburdened. Coming under the banner of the RU, the association had set up Covid-19 care centres, arranged vaccination camps in residential areas, arranged for regular oxygen supply, and ensured timely collection of biomedical waste, after receiving the administration’s approval for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-rwas-to-focus-on-inter-society-sports-events-during-first-meet-today-101632509769501.html

The department issued the directions after a delegation of 100 residents called upon the district town planner, enforcement, and sought relief against the decision of the department to restore the site to its original condition, which effectively means the property could be demolished. DTCP officials said that they issued restoration notices to the developers, property dealers and owners of the land who constructed the flats without any permission from the competent authority and in complete violation of law. RS Bhath, district town planner, said that they sought details of ownership and sale of flats to establish the involvement of people who fraudulently constructed flats and duped gullible buyers into buying these illegal properties. “The department will take action against the builders and property developers for illegal construction. As far as buyers are concerned, we will first issue them notices, give them a proper hearing and recommend a series of actions to the headquarter in accordance with the law. We don’t want to harass the homebuyers but violation of rules will not be allowed,” he said. The department also said that homebuyers in the city should conduct due diligence and, in case of confusion, check with DTCP before buying a property. Around 100 Sai Lane residents, who visited the DTCP office, submitted that they bought the property only after developers got the registry done. Regular power connections, water and sewage connections were issued and there was no hint of any fraud, said Rajesh Vij, general secretary, Sai Lane residents welfare association. “Most of the people are middle class and they took loans to buy these flats when they went on sale in 2018. Proper registries were carried out and we paid the stamp duty and other taxes as per law. The people are worried about the future but today [Friday], we were assured that justice would be done and no unilateral action would be taken,” said Vij, adding that the colony has 135 flats and all are occupied. He also said that they will co-operate fully with the authorities and share all the details required to conduct the probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-seeks-details-of-sai-lane-flats-in-gurugram-after-residents-seek-relief-101632509649530.html
25-09-2021||Mumbai||Dip in active cases: Maharashtra sees 3,286 fresh Covid cases||Maharashtra recorded 3,286 fresh Covid-19 cases pushing the count to 6,537,843 on Friday. The tally of active cases was further reduced to 38,491 as 3,933 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours. It is the lowest since February when the active cases dipped to 37,516 on February 3.State also recorded 51 casualties. The death toll now stands at 138,776. Satara reported the highest toll with seven deaths.As the active cases went lowest in the last seven months, the state government has decided to reopen all the religious places from October 7 after a gap of five months, except for those that fall under containment zones. The decision was declared by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday.The religious places were shut down in April after the second wave of Covid-19 started in the state in mid-February. After the first wave, they were started in November last year.This is in addition to the state government’s decision to restart physical classes in schools in the state from October 4. It has been decided that the offline classes will be allowed for Class 8 to 12 in the urban areas and Class 5 to 7 in rural areas of the state. It has also issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the same on Friday.Amid the threat of a potential third wave, Maharashtra is yet to show any sign of a rise in Covid-19 cases. In the past 24 days, it has recorded 88,033 cases. The daily average cases of this month have come down to 3,668. It is much less than the previous months 5,043 and 8,092 cases recorded in August and July respectively, in the corresponding period.According to health experts, the impact of the festivals will be seen only after a period of two weeks and a third wave may hit the state by December or January. To be prepared for the situation, the state government on Friday directed all the liquid medical oxygen manufacturers and refillers to ensure their storage is maintained at 95% of full capacity from September 30 until further orders.“All liquid medical oxygen (LMO) manufacturers and refillers in the state shall ensure their storages are maintained at 95% of full capacity by September 30 and will continue maintaining storage at this level till further order. To achieve this, LMO manufacturers shall ensure that their plants run at full LMO production capacity,” stated an order issued by the chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday.“District collectors shall ensure that all LMO storages in the district (both public and private hospitals) shall be maintained at the maximum possible technical feasible level. This activity may be taken up immediately… The authorities concerned shall be competent to take appropriate actions for any violations of the directions… Public health department in consultation with the medical oxygen and drugs department should adjust non-medical oxygen used as medical oxygen needs start rising,” it added further.The state was caught unaware during the second wave of Covid-19, leading to shortage of oxygen and beds.With 446 cases on Friday, Mumbai reported a total 740,305 cases to date. It also recorded six fatalities taking the toll to 16,074.In the past 24 hours, the state tested 172,870 samples and had a positivity rate of 1.90%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 11.31%, according to the data issued by the state health department.The state also vaccinated 522,923 doses on Friday and has administered a total 77,461,343 doses to date, according to the data available on Co-Win portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dip-in-active-cases-maharashtra-sees-3-286-fresh-covid-cases-101632509589454.html
25-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC completes 3D mapping of Worli in first of its kind project in Mumbai||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has prepared a three-dimensional (3D) development plan and the master plan of the Worli area called a 3D geospatial city model. This is a detailed digital 3D map that covers every parameter of the area, with a 360-degree digital panoramic view. The area covered under the project is 10 square kilometres, encompassing Worli’s entire G/South ward.This will help the civic body in multiple development ventures and policy interventions in the area, infrastructure planning, natural disaster management, citizens’ safety, environment analysis, and assessment of public amenities.The initiative was inaugurated by Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, who also represents the Worli Assembly constituency, on Friday. It was undertaken by BMC in partnership with Genesys. Announcing the completion of the project, BMC tweeted on Friday, “Mapping The Future! Using state-of-the-art tech supported by @Genesys_Int, BMC has completed an intricate digital 3D mapping of Worli in @mybmcWardGS. This initiative, inaugurated by Cabinet Minister @AUThackeray, will help in progressive planning & coordinating action on the ground.”In a statement from the G/South ward, BMC said, “We live in a 3D world, planning and development activities encompassing urban governance, city infrastructure upgrades, etc, are still being carried out on 2D maps. To meet the demands of cities in the 21st century, it is imperative that urban governments are able to visualise their cities in 3D for getting comprehensive 360 [degree] views, undertake simulations and conduct detailed analysis on the data, etc. all of which is inefficient and close to impossible on archaic 2D maps.”The 3D geospatial city model will help with change detection analysis, insights on unauthorised and illegal settlements, classification on building types, detailed infrastructure planning of roads, bridges, flyovers, in comparison to alternate infrastructure designs. BMC will also be able to find project-affected persons accurately, by overlaying the 3D model of the proposed project on the existing 3D model of the city. The imaging will help the civic body in urban flooding monitoring and mapping as well.The 3D geospatial model was created using high-resolution aerial drone imagery and mobile street imagery vehicles mounted with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors.“This aerial data coupled with 3,600 high-definition street view imagery was then fused to create a true-to-life Geospatial Map resulting in a comprehensive 3D Digital Twin,” BMC said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-completes-3d-mapping-of-worli-in-first-of-its-kind-project-in-mumbai-101632509530751.html
25-09-2021||Mumbai||89% Covid bed availability in Mumbai, BMC says we are in comfortable position||Amid a spike in daily Covid-19 cases reported in the city over the past two weeks, the bed availability in the city remains at 89%, indicating that the situation is under control. Out of around 16,000 beds in dedicated Covid centres and hospitals, over 14,000 beds are vacant.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials maintained that the city is in a comfortable position compared to what was feared due to possible third wave, however, it will not be correct to call that city is in a safe zone.According to BMC, there are 16,207 beds in dedicated Covid-19 health facilities and hospitals in the city, of which 14,468 are available. In the case of oxygen (O2) beds, 779 of the 8,287 beds are available, followed by 1,680 ICU beds being vacant out of a total 2,204 intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Further, 916 ventilators were vacant out of a total 1,285.The data of BMC reveals that 15 Covid care centre (CCC)-1 quarantine facilities are available in which 5,929 beds are available, followed by 3,119 beds available for quarantine purposes in 15 CCC-2 facilities of the BMC.According to BMC officials, the city is in a much better position than what was anticipated owing to the fear of Covid-19.Suresh Kakani had told HT earlier this week, “I would say we are in a better position where I would add a comfortable position but not in the safe zone. The period till October 5 is crucial by which we will understand what the spread pattern of Covid-19 will be post Ganesh festival.”Meanwhile, on Friday, the city reported 446 cases and six deaths, taking the tally to 740,305 and toll to 16,074. On Monday, 36,536 tests were conducted in the city, meaning a daily positivity rate of 1.22%.The city’s recovery rate is 96% with 716,491 recoveries.

25-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram authority identifies 98 points to install recharge wells to catch rainwater||The Gurugram metropolitan development authority (GMDA) has identified 98 points across the city to install recharge wells to catch rainwater and decrease runoff, officials said during a residents’ advisory council meeting at the GMDA office in Sector 44 on Friday.The move came after the residents raised the issue of severe waterlogging in different parts of the city during the monsoon. “During the meeting, many residents raised the issue of waterlogging in the city, to which solutions are being worked out regularly. Earlier, we had decided that the green belts in the city would be lowered so that the rainwater percolates down to the ground. Now, we have identified 98 points across the city where recharge wells -- which are reverse-borewells -- will be installed so that the rainwater that accumulates on the surface can go down and recharge the groundwater level,” said a senior GMDA official during the meeting.The recharge wells, which pump water back into the ground, will be installed in low-lying areas so that water accumulated around it and from nearby localities can be pumped in through pipes attached to recharge the groundwater level. Some of the areas identified by the authority include parks in sectors 9, 4, 10, and 23 among other locations. These are also among areas which report maximum waterlogging, said the officials.Meanwhile, the chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA, Sudhir Rajpal, also held a review meeting with Jal Mitras working as representatives of various sectors and RWAs in Gurugram to streamline and improve water supply in the city. Pipelines laid for water supply in the city have been connected to different underground water tanks, which can be monitored online through the Jal Mitra application, using supervisory control and data acquisition.During the meeting, residents also said that water supply has improved in areas like Essel Tower, Sector 16 Canal Colony, Mehrauli Road, Maruti, and Malibu Town. “The water supply must improve further, making it convenient for the consumers. In case of blockage of water supply, people should be informed through the application in advance. It needs to be made consumer-friendly. New water supply pipelines will also be laid in sectors 112, 113 and 114,” said Rajpal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-authority-identifies-98-points-to-install-recharge-wells-to-catch-rainwater-101632509411152.html
25-09-2021||Pune||Pune may see fewer Covid curbs next week||Pune: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has hinted more Covid lockdown relaxations in the coming week. After the weekly Covid review meeting on Friday in Pune, Pawar said the decisions related to more relaxations would be taken in the next week’s meeting in consultation with people’s representatives and officials. Though most of the Covid curbs have been eased, theatres and multiplexes remain closed and restaurants and bars are allowed to operate till 10 pm. “Covid situation is under control now. We were cautious this time as a spike in Covid cases was reported after the Ganesh Visarjan,” said Pawar. Pawar suggested that colleges could be reopened with fully vaccinated staff and students. “College students are above 18 years. If they are fully vaccinated and the Covid situation is under control by the first week of October then colleges could be restarted in phases,” said Pawar. He said that swimming pools would now be reopened for fully vaccinated people. The minister emphasised the use of masks and instructed authorities to strictly implement the Covid preventive norms. ‘Will request Centre to reduce 84-day gap between two vaccine doses’ Ajit Pawar said that after consultation with the state cabinet, a request would be made to the Centre to reduce the gap of 84 days between the two doses of Covishield. He said that with increase in vaccine availability the dose gap could be reduced. “Many are facing problems logging into the portal before completion of 84 days. Healthcare and frontline workers took the second dose after 28 days of the first vaccine. In some districts vaccine doses are available but beneficiaries’ turnout is less. Earlier, when the vaccine supply was less, the gap between two doses was increased,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-may-see-fewer-covid-curbs-next-week-101632509409478.html

It is the district health department’s priority to include these migrant kids in the drive... The World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed apprehensions about the impact of the polio in Afghanistan, after the change of power in the country. So, the health department will give polio doses to these children,” Yadav said.Yadav on Friday conducted a meeting in this regard, and also issued guidelines to all the private hospitals in Gurugram for the same. “India has been a polio-free country since 2014, but the roots of this disease are still frozen in Afghanistan. So, we have also changed the current age group for administering polio doses to the Afghan children in India... Polio doses will be given to all Indian children between zero and five years, and to Afghan children between zero and 15 years,” he added.In August 2021, the WHO said that Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to “remain endemic for polio, with high transmission of wild polio virus (WPV) and circulating vaccine derived polio viruses-2 (cVDPVs-2)”. According to the WHO, Afghanistan reported 11 wild polio cases and 261 circulating VDPV-2 cases in the past one year. “The migration of Afghan nationals, and the evacuation of Indian citizens from Afghanistan have enhanced the risk for the importation of wild poliovirus or vaccine-derived polioviruses into India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugramhealth-department-to-give-polio-doses-to-afghan-refugee-children-till-15-years-101632509170921.html
25-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s south civic body flags off 1st dialysis centre in Kalkaji hospital||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has operationalised its first dialysis centre in the Poornima Sethi Colony hospital in Kalkaji on Friday. The Kalkaji centre, a 10-bed facility which has been developed on a public-private partnership (PPP) with assistance of Nipro medical corporation, will charge patients ₹1400 for each dialysis session.SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan said that the facility will deploy single-use dialyzers and kits which are usually available at much higher rates in the private hospitals. He added that similar centres will come up in other municipal colony hospitals. “The unit will use single-use dialyzer and consumables for better results and to prevent infection to the patient undergoing dialysis,” he said.Suryan pointed out that kidney patients may require two-three dialysis sessions in a month which normally costs ₹6,000- ₹7,000 per session in private hospitals. He claimed that the new dialysis centre at Kalkaji will greatly benefit many, especially those from economically weaker sections. “We will set up more such centres with the help private operator in municipal health care facilities,” he said.Ramesh Bidhuri, the BJP MP from South Delhi who inaugurated the facility, said that the number of diabetic patients is on the rise. “Nearly 2.2 lakh new diabetes patients with end-stage renal disease are now surfacing every year in India which translates to [a need for] an additional 3.4 crore dialysis [sessions] every year. Since the facilities of dialysis are becoming overcrowded, such new dialysis centres will help in facilitating patients seeking treatment,” he added.SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharati said that the civic body is improving health care services for all residents. “The unit houses ultra-modern dialysis machines with Japanese technology and German double pass RO to give ultra-pure dialysis water, ensuring high quality dialysis. The process will help in minimising chances of infection in the patients undergoing dialysis,” he said.A senior municipal official overseeing the hospital administration department said that the colony hospitals in Tilak Nagar and Kalkaji are being prepared in anticipation of the third wave. “We have both the plans ready. In case the third wave of novel coronavirus surfaces, we will use these facilities to run Covid centres. Otherwise, we have plans to run an ICU in the ground floor of the Tilak Nagar hospital with a maternity and paediatric centre on the first floor. Kalkaji hospital can be used as a 40-bed Covid hospital. Oxygen plants have been installed in both these locations,” official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-south-civic-body-flags-off-1st-dialysis-centre-in-kalkaji-hospital-101632509110713.html
25-09-2021||Pune||Only 0.22% get infected after both Covid vaccine doses in Pune||Pune: The decreasing trend of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the district continues as the positivity rate and fatality rate see a steady drop. Post Ganpat celebrations a surge was anticipated, however, with massive vaccination drives being conducted and administration testing more people, the spurt in Covid cases seems to be less than estimated. As per the latest state health department data on breakthrough cases and Covid positives, only 0.22% people have been infected after both doses and 0.18% after first dose of the vaccine. The vaccination numbers as opposed to the mortality figures shows that as the number of vaccinated people is increasing the number of absolute deaths has fallen while the fatality rate has remained a constant 1.7% as per the state records. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state advisor for Covid-19 said, “World over, there is evidence that vaccination has brought down the number of symptomatic cases which is why the number of reported Covid cases after vaccination is below 1% because only those who have symptoms get themselves tested. As the severity of the symptoms is coming down so is the death rate falling. It has been over five days since we saw the crowd erupting on the streets for Ganesh Visarjan, but the numbers of new cases and deaths have been less than anticipated. However, there is still more than 50% of the population that is not yet fully vaccinated and more than 20% of the entire population that is yet to be vaccinated, which are the kids and so we need to bring down the chain of infection as much as possible.” As per the latest data on post vaccination infection, after first dose of Covid vaccination, 4,593 people in PMC, 4,073 people in PCMC and 4,155 from rural Pune got infected with Covid which is about 0.18% of the total number of people who have got their first dose. In addition, 3,893 people in PMC, 2,043 people in PCMC and 1,070 in rural Pune got infected after the second dose which accounts for only 0.22% of the total number of beneficiaries who have been fully vaccinated in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/only-0-22-get-infected-after-both-covid-vaccine-doses-in-pune-101632509109426.html

25-09-2021||Delhi||At Delhi govt school principals’ meet, focus on ways to improve blended learning||Preparing digital educational content in local languages, recording audio lessons for those with limited internet data, introducing rotation and flipped learning, upgrading internet facilities in schools, and the need for more IT assistants in schools -- these were some of the matters related to blended learning that were discussed by government school principals during an ongoing leadership programme.The discussions have been organised as a part of the monthly cluster leadership development programme for government school principals by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT). The September session focuses on “building an understanding of possibilities in blended learning and roles”, understanding the new initiatives by Directorate of Education, and building a ”space of listening with teachers”. Both principals and mentor teachers took part in the discussions.Reflecting on the lessons from the Covid-19 crisis, principals said since the pandemic has given the push towards online learning, schools are likely to continue with the practice in the post-pandemic era as well. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, head of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Sector 8, Rohini, said, “Covid allowed us to adopt online learning practices and going forward, we plan to continue these because they provide students a means to learn at their own pace. They can refer to the content at their own pace. These practices have also improved self-learning among students who are much more comfortable with finding learning content online and using them for coursework.”Jha, however, pointed out a concern as well– lack of access to data and internet among government school students who mostly come from economically weaker sections of society. “Our students have either feature phones or low-end smartphones which don’t have enough memory space. Storing the content becomes a problem. Our teachers often switch to audio notes while explaining worksheets as they occupy lesser space,” he said.Going forward, he plans to introduce more learning content in “local languages” so that students find the content easier to grasp. “We have been putting out videos and plan to do so more frequently in local languages so that students can connect with teachers at a greater level,” he said.Several principals from areas such as Mayur Vihar, Dwarka, Sangam Vihar, Jafrabad, Najafgarh, Ramesh Nagar also said while it was challenging to adopt online learning given their meagre resources, it will benefit students who are going to graduate into an increasingly digital world.Leena Asthana, principal of Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School no.4 in Molarband, said she has been encouraging her teachers to have their own YouTube channels where they can post learning content.“Many of my teachers already have YouTube channels. They take offline classes for students at school and record or livestream those classes using their phones and tripods. Students who cannot attend school for various reasons can refer to these lessons. We also use the flipped classroom and rotation learning for our smart classes. In order to continue with blended learning, we need to upgrade internet facilities in school to offer high-speed internet to teachers and students. Our current broadband connection does not cover all classes and teachers face network issues. Schools will also need to provide more IT assistants as well for troubleshooting,” she said.Government school principal Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of Vice and Principals’ Association of Delhi and one of the CLDP facilitators, said a lot of teaching days are lost in Delhi to pollution and extreme temperatures during summers and winters. Online learning will be useful on such days, he said.“Online classes cannot be an alternative for in-person teaching. We realised this when students returned to classrooms recently. However, a few technological tools such as smart boards and multimedia computers with projectors can supplement classroom learning. Often, teaching days are lost to extreme temperatures in summer and winter, or to pollution.

This came amidst a rise in the flu and fever cases in Gurugram, following a prolonged monsoon and frequent waterlogging in the city, they added.For this survey -- which will run till September 30, 2021 -- health workers go door-to-door to check whether any resident is down with fever or viral infection, or has dengue or malaria symptoms.Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “In such a survey, medical staff visit door-to-door under every primary health centre, and check whether any person has symptoms of dengue, malaria, or viral fever, with samples taken for confirmatory tests on the spot itself. It is also checked if patients have already taken a test for platelets, and if they need to be referred to a medical centre.”Similar surveys were conducted in the district in July and August this year. Earlier, the department had screened around 7,000 people with fever.The health department has increased surveillance for dengue and malaria in the district in the past few weeks, said the officials, adding that the district has reported 18 dengue cases and two malaria cases this year, compared to 51 cases reported in 2020.On September 15, 2021, the state health department asked all the districts to step up the surveillance by increasing sample collection for dengue and malaria at out-patient departments (OPDs) and flu corners at primary health centres and community health centres, and conduct testing on the people daily to avert an outbreak. All multi-purpose health workers have also been instructed to carry out source reduction and anti-larval measures in both urban and peri-urban areas, especially in districts adjoining the national capital region (NCR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/third-rapid-fever-survey-in-gurugram-amid-dengue-malaria-scare-101632508869414.html
25-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi high court grants bail to organiser in Jantar Mantar hate slogan case||The Delhi high court on Friday granted bail to Preet Singh, one of the organisers of the event at Jantar Mantar where communal slogans were allegedly raised last month, saying his custodial interrogation in the hate speech case is not required any longer.“The petitioner has been in custody since August 9, 2021. The petitioner is no more required for custodial interrogation. It is, therefore, directed that the petitioner be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of ₹50,000 with two surety bonds of the like amount subject to the satisfaction of the learned trial court/duty magistrate,” said justice Mukta Gupta.The judge has asked the accused not to leave the country without the court’s permission.The court said that as per the record, during the Jantar Mantar event on August 8, the accused had left the venue at around 2pm, noting that “the main provocative words/slogans were shouted by the co-accused at around 4pm”.It said that at this stage, it is not appropriate to express any opinion on whether the “words spoken by the petitioner make out an offence under IPC section 153A (hate speech)”, adding that it will be examined at the stage of charge or during trial.“The interview by the petitioner was not an isolated interview and was part of simultaneous conversation with a number of speakers. Further large numbers of people gathered at the spot due to the petitioner co-organising the protest, and therefore the petitioner would be liable for any offence committed in furtherance of the common object of the assembly,” the order said.Singh, who was remanded in judicial custody on August 10 after his arrest, is accused of creating enmity between different groups and inciting the youth to propagate against a particular religion at a rally at Jantar Mantar here on August 8.Singh, seeking bail through his lawyer Vishnu Shankar Jain, had argued that a demand of a “Hindu Rashtra” did not amount to promoting enmity between religious groups.On August 27, the trial court had refused bail to Singh, saying that prima facie, there had been active participation by the accused in his individual capacity and also as the main organiser of the event itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-grants-bail-to-organiser-in-jantar-mantar-hate-slogan-case-101632508815090.html

25-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt will cooperate with railway station revamp project: CM Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that the Delhi government will cooperate and coordinate with other agencies, primarily the Union ministry of Railways, in a project aimed at the redevelopment of the New Delhi Railway Station.Kejriwal’s statement came hours after Delhi’s lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal chaired a project review meeting with the chief minister and senior officials in Central government agencies, public works department and Delhi Development Authority (DDA), among others.“This is a very important project, especially considering the fact that Delhi is the national capital, and New Delhi railway station is the most crucial railway station in the country. I assure complete cooperation on behalf of the Delhi government to the Railways and all concerned agencies. I hope this project gets completed quickly so we all can see New Delhi railway station become one of the most beautifully developed railway stations soon,” said a statement issued by the CM’s office.New Delhi railway station is the largest and second busiest railway station in the country and handles approximately 4.5 lakh passengers daily and approximately 160-170 million passengers annually, noted the statement.It further said that the redevelopment project will cover 200,000 square metres and will, among others, involve setting up new pick up and drop zones in view of traffic situation and convenience of passengers; building 40-storey twin towers to house a hotel, offices, retail shops, restaurants and other facilities; a multi-level car parking; and new roads based on fresh designs.“Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal reinforced his support for the redevelopment of the New Delhi railway station and said that the Delhi government is committed towards the steadfast redevelopment of the country’s most important railway station. The New Delhi railway station will be redeveloped and upgraded into a world class facility, after which it will boast of splendid beauty. Keeping in mind the convenience of the passengers, various facilities will be developed at the railway station,” said a statement issued by the CM’s office.It further said, “The redevelopment of New Delhi railway station and its surrounding areas shall create state-of-the-art amenities and facilities for passengers, new community space for public, smooth and congestion free connectivity to the station, and most modern commercial areas. The architectural expression of the proposed station is envisaged to carry a signature style, which is relatable to both historic and modern Indian culture to give it a unique identity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-will-cooperate-with-railway-station-revamp-project-cm-kejriwal-101632508809433.html
25-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram civic body to reconstruct old office in Civil Lines from October||Work on reconstructing the old municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) office in Civil Lines will commence from the next month, said officials on Friday. This came as the condition of the MCG office, opposite Civil Hospital, has been deteriorating, especially over the last six years, they added.The roof of the MCG office has collapsed at least thrice this year, following heavy rainfall and thunderstorms. Also, rainwater enters offices of the second-floor departments through cracks/gaps in the building, and the walls are either cracked or paints are peeling off. Virtually, the office does not even have a parking space.To resolve these issues, the MCG in June 2021 prepared a ₹30.10 crore proposal for reconstructing the building, administrative approval of which was granted by the Haryana government on Tuesday.The project work order has been issued, and a two-year deadline has been set for the contractor to complete the project, said MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja. “Administrative approval from the Haryana government has been procured, and the project work order has also been issued. We are planning to start the reconstruction work from October,” he said.According to MCG officials, privy to the matter, the two-storey MCG office will be revamped with a commercial space at the ground floor, along with a citizen facilitation centre (CFC) where the people can make payments for licence, property tax, and water bill among others. Besides the ground floor, two other floors will also be reserved for commercial spaces, and five floors for offices.The main direct public dealing at the old MCG office is for the issuance of birth and death certificates, similar to other offices of the civic body. In addition, internal proceedings for zone 1 and 2 are planned, approved, and sanctioned from this office.“Once reconstructed, the old MCG office will become a zonal office, similar to its office in Gurugram Sector 42 where the MCG’s zone 3 departments are based, also making space for both zone 2 and zone 1 offices temporarily. The zone 4 office will be based in Sector 34,” said a senior MCG official, requesting anonymity.The zone 1 departments will operate from Sector 14, near Vyapar Kendra on MG Road, once the MCG’s main office is set up there, and the MCG office in Civil Lines will solely cater to zone 2 related work. The MCG is also planning to build a 10-storey office -- its headquarters -- in Sector 14, the MCG official added.Since its establishment in 2008, the Civil Lines office was the MCG headquarters till 2015. However, the Sector 34 office became its headquarters in 2015 when the civic body shifted most of its departments there. “After most of the offices were shifted to the Sector 34 office, the Civil Lines office became an afterthought. Symbolically, it is an office, but largely, it is just a glorified CFC with view departments and a joint commissioner’s office. The entire building is crumbling. The ceiling has partially collapsed thrice this year. Rainwater enters offices during monsoon, and even the office staff does not get any space for parking their vehicles,” said an official from the Civil Lines MCG office.According to the official Gurgaon district gazetteer, a class II municipal committee was formed in the city in 1950 and it was upgraded to a class I municipal committee in 1969. Though the gazetteer mentioned the presence of a municipal office park in the city around that time, it did not specify the location of the municipal office.The Civil Lines office was built a few years after the formation of the municipal committee, around the time the Civil hospital -- on the opposite side -- was constructed in 1977. However, this could not be verified, said MCG officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-civic-body-to-reconstruct-old-office-in-civil-lines-from-october-101632508751297.html
25-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC stays arrest of Supertech MD till October 4||The Delhi high court on Friday stayed till October 4, the arrest of Supertech’s managing director Mohit Arora on the condition that the real estate developer pays ₹50 lakh to an aggrieved home buyer within a week.On September 20, the national consumer commission sentenced Arora to three years in jail for not refunding a homebuyer after the firm’s failure to hand over possession of his house in Uttar Pradesh’s Yamuma Expressway Industrial Development Area (Yeida) for several years.The commission on Monday issued an arrest warrant against Arora, while directing that its order shall come into effect after seven days if the builder fails to deposit around ₹1.79 crore by then.Challenging this order, Supertech went to the high court, arguing that the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) acted out of its jurisdiction and did not give the company a chance to present its case.Justice Amit Bansal of the Delhi high court, however, asked Supertech and Arora to prove their bonafides before their petition could be entertained further.“Accordingly in order to show bonafide, the petitioner is directed to pay ₹50 lakh within a week. Statement of accounts to be laid before the court… The sentence will be stayed till the next date of hearing,” the judge said in an oral order.The court stayed the arrest till October 4, but did not stay other parts of the NCDRC’s order.Arora said the company was exploring all options, including making a refund as per the NCDRC order as well as seeking stay from the high court.“Since the stay order has been issued by the high court, we will proceed with the case before the high court,” Arora said.The money ( ₹1.75 crore) is to be paid to Brigadier Kanwal Batra (retired) and his daughter Aakriti Batra, who together bought a villa in Supertech’s Upcountry project, offered by the builder in December 2013 at a cost of approximately ₹1.03 crore, which the builder promised to deliver in August 2014.Supertech could not give possession of the villa for want of clearances, nor did it comply with the commission’s 2019 judgment to refund the money with interest despite undertakings.The development comes days after the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of two 40-storey residential towers of Supertech’s Emerald Court project in Noida over grave violation of building norms, which, the court said, was a result of “nefarious complicity” between the Noida authority and the builder.During the hearing, senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, representing Supertech, argued that the NCDRC order was beyond the provisions of section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act and there was no provision it which casts vicarious liability on the MD to make him liable in criminal or civil matter in case of default by the company.“He isn’t personally responsible but has been attributed vicarious liability whereas there is no provision of vicarious liability for offences of other parties.“When a company is in default, there is no provision to say any MD or some other director will be vicariously liable. Stature must confer that jurisdiction. None of this has been examined but merely on grounds of non-compliance he has been sentenced. The exercise of jurisdiction by the Commission is purportedly wrong and gives the maximum without a trial,” he argued.Appearing for the complainant, advocate Shailesh Madiyal, counsel for the home buyer Kanwal Batra’s argued that the company was in repeated default of the NCDRC order and has gone back on its undertaking to the forum.The counsel said every time the company gives an undertaking to NCDRC and then fails to turn up the next time and warrants have to be issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-stays-arrest-of-supertech-md-till-october-4-asks-him-to-pay-aggrieved-homebuyer-50-lakh-101632508630597.html

The untidy spot is located near the nullah that witnessed strong currents during the flash floods and IT engineer Salim Shaikh (45) and CA student Victor Sangle (26) were washed away at the Bhairoba nullah bridge in September 25, 2019. The area is frequented by people to answer to nature’s call. According to Ganga Satellite Society chairman Rajesh Mishra, despite repeated complaints to the civic authorities, when things on ground did not change, residents Anu Bir, Colonel Amit Rai (retired) and Mishra decided to take up the task of cleaning the area. “We approached Colonel Suresh Patil (retired) of Green Thumb Environment Protection Group and began the beautification work. The challenges were manifold but the picture started changing when cleanliness drive began on September 11. First, the ground-levelling work was done followed by plantation of bamboo trees at the sides giving the area a new look. Once regarded as a filthy area, the spot now looks clean and beautiful,” he said. Mishra is also the managing director of Vulkan Technologies Private Limited, which has funded the the green project through CSR initiative. The work was carried under the supervision of Green Thumb founder-president Lt Col Suresh Patil (retired), Col Laxman Sathe (retired) and Col Rai. The debris removal and ground-levelling were carried out with the help of bulldozer; installation of six floodlights and deployment of round-the-clock guards to check dumping of waste and using the area for nature’s call. Lt Col Patil said, “Through citizens’ support an unclean area has been transformed into a green hub and steps have been taken to ensure it remains so in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-turn-wanowrie-s-dumping-spot-near-bhairoba-nullah-into-garden-in-pune-101632508629524.html

Passengers have demanded this decision be revoked, a sentiment echoed by Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol. “This is a good service started by PMPML within the peth areas to travel to a short distance for just ₹10. But when I got into the bus, the conductor asked for my Aadhar card, which I was not carrying. He told me to get down from bus. It is unfair. PMPML is getting their ticket money, so they should not stop passengers from travelling on this bus,” said Madhusudhan Paranjpe, a commuter and senior citizen. In July this new bus service was launched by the public transport body under which 50 midi-sized buses with a seating capacity of 24 people started to ply the old parts of the city. For any given distance the ticket fare is ₹10. “I have spoken with the PMPML officials to cancel this decision of asking for the Aadhar card while boarding the bus. Passengers can then freely travel around the city without their Aadhar cards in these buses,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-aadhar-card-needed-to-ride-pmpml-s-punyadasham-buses-soon-mayor-101632508572240.html
25-09-2021||Noida||Noida: Five arrested for snatching car using a toy gun||Four days after a 50-year-old Indirapuram resident was robbed of his Hyundai i-20 car in Noida’s Sector 62, police on Friday arrested five persons, including a BTech student, from Sector 57 in the case. Apart from the stolen car, police have recovered two stolen motorcycles, a knife, five mobile phones and a toy gun that was used in the crime.Police said all the suspects are residents of Delhi. The suspects were identified as Kartik Wani, 22, a resident of Mayur Vihar Phase 3; Vikas, 20, a resident of Pandav Nagar; Shivam Valmiki, 30, from Kalyanpuri; Yuvraj Khatri, 24, from Shakarpur; and Abhishek Sharma, 22, from Geeta Colony.According to police, Wani, a B-Tech second-year student, is the mastermind. He had invested ₹8 lakh in a private firm and lost the money. He then ganged up with four accomplices and decided to rob commuters, said police. The incident took place on the night of September 20 when victim Vilas Nirmal, a resident of Shakti Khand in Indirapuram, was returning home from his office in Noida’s Sector 62. “When I reached near D-Park in Sector 62, five persons on two motorcycles signalled me and said that the car’s bumper had fallen. As soon as I stopped the car to check it, they held me at gunpoint and snatched the vehicle,” he said. The suspects also took away ₹11,000 in cash and Nirmal’s mobile phone. Nirmal, a driver with a private firm, said he had bought the car last year. A case was registered against unknown persons under Section 392 (robbery) of IPC at Sector 58 police station on September 20.“We scanned footage from over 250 CCTV cameras and identified the suspects. Today we got information that the suspects were moving in the stolen car near Sector 57 in Noida. A police team reached the spot and arrested them,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida. Police said that the suspects were planning to escape to Rajasthan to sell the car.Police recovered a toy gun that was actually a pistol-shaped cigarette lighter and an air gun from their possession. The DCP said that the suspects had used these two guns to threaten the victim. Based on their interrogation details, police conducted a search at their hideout and recovered two stolen motorcycles used in the crime.“Wani contacted Khatri, who ran a mobile repairing shop, and they first started snatching mobile phones. Wani is also an expert in unlocking a smart phone. On September 20, they came to Sector 62, and tried to first stop a Hyundai i-10 car saying that the car’s bumper had fallen. But that car sped away. The suspects played the same trick and Nirmal was trapped. They snatched the car and fled to Delhi,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional DCP, Noida.The suspects were produced in a local court that sent them to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-five-arrested-for-snatching-car-using-a-toy-gun-101632508569402.html

25-09-2021||Delhi||Seventh round of sero survey starts in Delhi||Delhi on Friday began collecting samples for its seventh round of serological survey to ascertain the proportion of population that might have immunity against the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. The 28,000 samples will be collected by district teams in 10 to 15 days, administration officials said. “The collection of blood samples for the sero survey started on Friday. We have already prepared a schedule for the collection and should finish it within 10 to 15 days,” said a senior official from New Delhi district, asking not to be named. The data for the current survey is being collected digitally. Another official from the east district said on condition of anonymity, “We faced no problems in using the app; everything went smoothly.” The survey, which was initially scheduled to take place over the first two weeks of August, was later postponed to the last week of August, and then again to September last week. It is not immediately clear why the survey was postponed twice, with state health officials declining comment on the matter. Hindustan Times reported on Wednesday that a portion of the samples will be, for the first time, also tested to calculate the levels of neutralising antibodies that directly target the virus.The last round of the sero survey was conducted in April, just as the second wave of the pandemic swept through the national capital, and had to be stopped midway due to rising cases of Covid-19. But of the 13,000 samples that were already collected before the survey was suspended, nearly 56% returned positive for antibodies. The results were similar to those obtained in the sero survey in January that estimated the exposure after the November surge in cases. Serological surveys are used by epidemiologists to determine the prevalence of a disease in a population. The testing kits currently in use reveal whether a sample has IgG antibodies against one of the proteins of the virus. They indicate whether the antibody level is high or low, and are called semi-quantitative. The seventh survey will conduct a more expensive test to determine the exact levels of the antibodies in a subset of the samples.The seventh survey is being conducted at a time nearly three out of four of Delhi’s adult population have received at least one dose of a vaccine against Covid-19, and one in three have been fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-begins-collecting-samples-for-7th-sero-survey-to-detect-presence-of-covid-antibodies-101632508330613.html

25-09-2021||Delhi||AAP claims Delhi’s north MCD stopped online classes in primary schools||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday alleged that around 70,000 children dropped out of primary schools in the city as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led north Delhi Municipal Corporation failed to provide online classes to primary school students and fired teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic.While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD). Delhi goes to the municipal polls next year. “The BJP-ruled north MCD stopped giving education to primary students in the pandemic. They fired 687 teachers. Around 70,000 students have dropped out of school due to the BJP-ruled MCD not providing education to children of classes 1 to 5. The north MCD says teaching children during the pandemic will harm them,” said AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj in a press conference.He further said, “For the last one and a half years, the north MCD has not been providing primary education. Imagine what would have happened to those children? All the private schools in Delhi are providing education to young children, but the north MCD has stopped it.”The BJP dismissed the allegations and blamed the AAP government for not clearing dues with the civic bodies which, they said, forced them to sack contractual teachers.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Mr Saurabh Bhardwaj should know that north MCD primary schools, like all primary schools, have not been opened for physical attendance, as the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has not yet allowed physical attendance for primary school students. In almost all north MCD schools, online classes are being regularly conducted. As far as the matter of 667 teachers is concerned, these were contractual employees whose salary is ₹35,420 per month covered under the Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan. The annual salary bill of these 667 contractual teachers is ₹23.62 crores out of which 25% is paid by Central government while 75% is to be paid by the Delhi government. The Kejriwal government stopped paying the salary of these contractual teachers in May 2020 after which north MCD had no option but to suspend their contracts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-claims-delhi-s-north-mcd-stopped-online-classes-in-primary-schools-101632508269523.html

Later, convinced that he had been abducted and killed, they registered an FIR for abduction and murder on September 22.“Tyagi kept telling the family that Reshu was upset and may have gone somewhere on his own. He tried to dissuade the family from filing a police complaint. During the investigation, villagers told us that other members of the Tyagi family had died mysteriously,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).Police said they arrested Tyagi and two others on Thursday in connection with Reshu’s murder, and during questioning, Tyagi admitted that he also got his older brother Sudhir Tyagi killed in 2001 using contract killers. He then told the rest of the family that Sudhir had abandoned them.“Tyagi said after he got Sudhit killed, he married his sister-in-law (Sudhir’s wife) the same year. He told us that he then murdered both of Sudhir’s daughters. He said he poisoned and killed the youngest daughter, aged 8 years, in 2006, while the oldest one, aged 16 years, was poisoned to death in 2009, and her body dumped in a river,” the SP said . “Tyagi said he also killed the eight-year-old son of his other brother Brijesh in 2013 by strangling him and dumping his body in a river. In August, he committed the fifth murder, that of Brijesh’s 24-year-old son Reshu,” Raja said.The police said Tyagi allegedly told the family that the girls had died of insect bites, and also convinced them that the boy had run away from home.“In all previous cases, he exerted his influence over the family and did not allow FIRs to be lodged. He told us he wanted to control of the ancestral property (estimated to be worth about ₹15-20 crore), and so he killed all heirs. He said he wanted his only son to inherit the property after him,” Raja said.Speaking to media persons at the Muradnagar police station, Tyagi said, “We have about 16 bighas of land and other property in the name of my wife, who was earlier married to my older brother Sudhir. I killed his daughters to avoid the expense of their weddings. I wanted my only son to inherit all the property.” Brijesh said the entire family is yet to come to terms with the shocking revelations.“I never expected that my brother would murder our family. He was taking care of the entire family and we never suspected anything... My wife is in a state of shock; we now know both our sons were murdered. I believe he may have wanted to kill me as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-admits-to-killing-5-of-his-family-over-20-yrs-to-secure-property-for-son-101632508211240.html

The topic of discussion was the eco-conservation of the Taljai hill, a proposal for which has been prepared by the Pune municipal corporation (PMC).Also present at the meeting were environmentalist Ketki Sathe Kulkarni, architect Sarang Yadwadkar, Ravindra Sinha, from Mission Groundwater and corporator Subhash Jagtap. The PMC proposal is based on a sanction of ₹13 crore for the development of forest and greenery on the hill.“We want to preserve the hills which are the lungs of Pune. This is not only for Taljai, it is for all the hills in Pune,” said Sahakar nagar resident Amit Shahane.The Sahakar nagar residents listed out various problems, including the loss of the existing natural bio- diversity, the threat to wildlife, water percolation and ground-level water levels. An increase in traffic was also a major concern.Indranil Sadalge, another resident, said, “We will take a consensus from experts and then will send our ideas to the respective authorities, including the state government. Our main concerns are the environment, and traffic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sahakar-nagar-residents-unite-under-taljai-bachao-abhiyan-to-save-pune-city-s-hills-101632508209463.html
25-09-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal exhorts Punjab, Haryana to provide bio-decomposers to farmers||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday that like Delhi, all agrarian states should provide bio-decomposers free of cost to farmers in their states to control the problem of stubble burning.On Friday, Kejriwal initiated the process of making bio-decomposer solution in collaboration with Pusa Institute at Kharkhari Nahar, ahead of the harvest season when farmers start setting fire to their fields to get rid of the residual stubble.“Now, there is a solution for stubble management; from making the bio-decomposer solution to spraying, it costs less than ₹1,000 per acre. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has also ordered all the states to use bio-decomposer so that the problem of stubble burning can be eradicated,” said Kejriwal while addressing the media.Every year, Delhi’s air quality nosedives during winter due to large-scale stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. The change in wind direction carries the fumes from the stubble fire from the agrarian states to Delhi, deteriorating it’s air quality.Data provided by the Delhi government shows that last year, around 300 farmers in the Capital sprayed bio-decomposer on 1,950 acres of farmland. “This year, 844 farmers in Delhi are going to spray the solution on about 4,200 acres of land,” said Kejriwal.Senior Delhi government officials said the bio-decomposer solution is being prepared in collaboration with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Pusa in the horticulture department’s nursery at Kharkhari Nahar, from where it will be supplied to farmers across the city free of cost.“Last year, the Delhi government, in collaboration with the Pusa Institute, developed a unique solution for stubble management. We have prepared a bio-decomposer spray which is very efficient. Earlier, farmers would burn the stubble left in their fields after harvesting. Now, the stubble decomposes within 15-20 days of spraying the solution and turns into a fertiliser. Earlier, stubble was a liability for us when it was burnt, but now, once it decomposes, it turns into an asset,” Kejriwal added.Environment minister Gopal Rai also stressed the need for state governments to work together to find a solution for stubble decomposition in order to fight pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-exhorts-punjab-haryana-to-provide-bio-decomposers-free-of-cost-to-farmers-101632508089251.html

25-09-2021||Delhi||Gogi vs Tillu: Delhi gangsters’ bond that ended in bloodshed||The life of gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi,30, shot dead by his rivals inside the Rohini court on a rainy Friday afternoon, is one of dreams, friendship, student politics, money, guns, and gore.Gogi was once a teenager who excelled in sport (volleyball and athletics), represented his schools at several competitions, and got admitted to Delhi University (DU) on the sports quota. There, he and his closest childhood friend, Sunil Maan, got sucked into student politics. Maan is now better known as gangster Tillu Tajpuria in police records.The two went on to become deadly rivals, and for more than a decade, their names can be found together in police files and case papers that detail how they have fought a bloody turf war that spilled blood on the streets of Haryana and the national Capital.Had the two not stepped into he world of student politics, their paths would not have crossed, and their names may not have been in Delhi Police’s most wanted list. Perhaps Gogi would not have been inside court number 207 at Rohini on Friday, where two gunmen, dressed as lawyers, waited for him and then shot him dead.
25-09-2021||Delhi||From police vans to courts, no place off-limit for gangs in Delhi||New Delhi From courtrooms to prison cells, police vans to hospitals, no setting is off-limits for gangsters as they go about settling scores in the national capital. According to Delhi Police records, there are at least 8-10 prominent gangs -- involved in extortions, land grabbing, murder, among others -- across the city that are at war with each other to establish supremacy in their respective areas. Records show that before Jitender Maan alias Gogi, and Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuria, started gang wars on the city’s streets, two other gangs – one led by Neeraj Bawana and Nitu Dabodia – were engaged in similar fights. Among the several murders as a result of this gang rivalry was the killing of two gang leaders of the Dabodia gang – Paras Vikram and Pradeep Bhola -- by Bawana while they were heading to Tihar prison in a jail van after attending a court hearing in August 2015.Just months later, in December 2015, two other gangs in northeast Delhi -- one led by gangster Krishen Pehalwan, alias Cheenu Pehalwan, and another by Abdul Nasser – had a similar shootout inside the Karkardooma court complex. Pehalwan survived the attack but a police constable, who was escorting him in court, had died.Police records show that one of Delhi’s first and better-known gangsters, Pehalwan was from Dichaon, a village in Najafgarh. Pehalwan, who later turned a small-time politician and is currently in jail, has accused police of framing him in false cases in the past. During the 1990s, Pehalwan’s gang was engaged in a turf war with another gang led by his friend-turned-foe Anoop Balraj, from the neighbouring village of Mitraon, in which about a dozen lives were lost.Later, Pehalwan’s gang had also had a bitter rivalry with another gang, led by Udaiveer Kala, over a property dispute. Police have in the past said that Kala’s father was allegedly murdered by Pehalwan’s gang in 2007. Police officials said the rivalry ended eight years later with the murder of Pehalwan’s brother, Bharat Singh, who was an MLA at the time, at a farmhouse in Najafgarh. Officers in the crime branch said that some of the gangs that are at still at war across the city include those led by Manjeet Mahal (currently in jail) and Kapil Sangwan; Cheenu Pehalwan (currently in jail) and Abdul Naseer; Hashim Baba (currently in jail) and Ravi Gangwal (currently in jail). Former Delhi police officer, LN Rao, who was the DCP of the special cell until his retirement in 2015, said police must crack down on the city’s gangsters.”Police must gather evidence and use laws like MCOCA (Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act) against all gangsters who are running organised crime syndicates. Using these laws will make it difficult for them to come out on bail easily. Police have to act sternly against such men,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gogi-killed-in-shootout-from-police-vans-to-courts-no-place-off-limit-for-gangs-in-delhi-101632507789466.html

The number of deaths due to fatal road mishaps has also risen.As many as 150 deaths due to accidents have been reported this year, between January and September 23, while last year, a total of 143 deaths were recorded. “This year the number of road accidents and deaths has increased in the city and there are several reasons. First of all, the relaxations on curbs, and then speeding. Newly added roads as in villages merged in the PMC jurisdiction have also seen many mishaps. While most accidents were on the Pune-Solapur and Pune- Ahmednagar highways, the Katraj- Dehu road bypass say several mishaps,” said Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (traffic). “Most deaths this year were two-wheeler riders, as many as 90 bikers died. There are multiple deaths recorded in some of the accidents. No major accidents in the old part of the city like the peth areas were reported this year,” added Shrirame. As per the Pune traffic police, 30 people died on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, 13 deaths were reported on the Pune-Ahmednagar highway, 15 deaths were recorded on the Pune-Solapur highway under the Hadapsar division. Atul Namekar, secretary of Sinhagad Road - Warje residents association said, “There are often accidents seen on this Katraj-Dehu road bypass which connects several residential areas.

25-09-2021||Delhi||‘Hope police’s visits reduce’: Some relief, little surprise in Gogi’s village||When the family of alleged gangster Jitender Maan, alias Gogi, heard the news of him being gunned down in the Rohini court on Friday noon, it was the culmination of their fears over several months when they believed that rival gangs were “conspiring” with the police and jail authorities to eliminate him.On Friday evening, as around 15 of Gogi’s relatives and friends sat on charpoys and plastic chairs in a dark courtyard at Gogi’s home in outer Delhi’s Alipur village, they refused to believe that Friday’s attack was purely the handiwork of a gang, allegations that officials called baseless. “No one will believe that such a big gangster could be killed inside a courtroom under such high security without any cooperation from authorities,” said Gogi’s cousin, Ravinder Maan. Maan and others in that courtyard said that Gogi “surrendered” last year with the sole aim to escape being killed in a police encounter. “He thought the jail was safest for a person like him,” said Maan.The family said that he was moved from Tihar Jail number eight to jail two around five months ago to “snap his ties” with his associates lodged in the same jail. “We even stopped finding out when he would be produced in court,” said another relative who asked not to be identified.His family said they were also disappointed he was produced for court hearings in person, instead of over video-conferencing.Sandeep Goel, director general of Delhi prisons, called the allegations baseless. “He was kept in a high-security ward. We keep changing inmates’ jails, especially high-risk prisoners. Court productions, whether physical or by video-conferencing are according to production orders,” said Goel.Gogi’s family said the last relative to meet him was his mother, who visited him in Tihar on September 2. “He did not express any concerns about his safety to his mother. She gave him R7,000 to manage his expenses in jail,” said a third relative.Gogi’s family alleged that the police had a reason to get him killed. “They worried that he would seek revenge for Fajja’s encounter,” said Maan about Gogi’s associate Kuldeep Maan alias Fajja who escaped from police custody in March before he was killed in an encounter days later.A senior police officer, who asked not to be named, outrightly denied that the Delhi Police had any role in Gogi’s killing. “Such allegations are usual after criminals are killed, but there is no truth to it,” said the officer.In Alipur village, locals avoided venturing around Gogi’s home. But for the small gathering in the courtyard, the lanes around were largely deserted and there was little to suggest it was Gogi’s home. “There are just a dozen people at a gangster’s home on the day he died. No one wants to be associated with us or be seen around us,” said the third relative.The word about his killing, however, spread across the village. “Hopefully the police’s visits to this village will reduce now,” said a village resident who asked not to be named.His family said that they always believed that luck was on Gogi’s side and that he would beat death.“Gogi’s gang is over. His death shows no one can take on the authorities,” said Maan even as neither he, nor others in the little gathering, made any attempts to portray him as innocent of the charges against him.Gogi’s family said they were vulnerable to attacks from rival gangs now, but insisted that no retaliation should be expected from his gang.“No one is left to take revenge,” Maan said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gogi-killed-in-shootout-hope-police-s-visits-reduce-some-relief-little-surprise-in-gangster-s-village-at-his-killing-101632507552598.html
25-09-2021||Delhi||Gogi killed in shootout: A yr ago, HC flagged need to raise police deployment||The high court registry in September last year informed a division bench that there was a need to augment the police deployment at the Rohini Court complex due to the increasing security requirement.The submission was made in an affidavit in connection with a plea seeking enhancement of security at the seven district courts of the city. The registry also noted that the court complex lacked adequate numbers of security cameras.“The matter was taken up in the Building Maintenance Committee, Rohini Courts and the Committee gave approval for installation of CCTV cameras. The matter was sent to government of NCT, Delhi, for administrative approval and financial sanction. The same is still pending with GNCTD since 25.07.2017, and repeated follow up/reminders have been sent in this regard,” the document read.The Delhi government did not respond to requests for commentThe affidavit was filed on September 4, 2020, in response to a PIL seeking adequate security measures for the courts citing several past incidents.The security measures at the city’s court complex has now come into stark focus, after the courtroom murder of notorious gangster Jitender Maan, also known as Gogi.The plea, filed by Kunwar Gangesh Singh had sought directions to enhance security of various district courts across Delhi to mitigate the sort of incidents witnessed and reported in the last few years.The petition filed through advocate Richa Singh had also sought stricter rules and regulation along with implementation, saying it was essential for safety of all people present in court premises that safety mechanisms be brought at par with the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court.In response to the petition, the Delhi high court filed an affidavit stating that out of the seven district courts, only Dwarka had a pass system like the high court. At the rest of the courts, the matter was still under consideration.The matter is currently pending adjudication in the high court as only urgent matters are being heard in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.Soon after Friday’s incident, lawyers said they were scared for their safety asked Justice Subramonium Prasad at the Delhi high court to issue notice to the city police commissioner.Justice Prasad, while expressing concern, said, “We as the High Court have to first ensure things are right. Let me see. Let me ascertain, let’s see what’s happening”.High court sources said that enquiry reports have been received from all the district judges of the trial courts and the matter is under active consideration.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa also said that the incident of daylight murders in the courtroom in Rohini is extremely shocking especially when the courts are presumed to be high security zones.Advocate L K Verma, a practicing lawyer, said all lawyers should be given an identification card which they should hang around their neck when they enter into the court premises. He also said that lawyers need to co-operate with the security agencies and allow them to frisk them for safety purposes.As a mark of protest, the Co-ordination Committee of All Delhi Bar Association has called for abstinence from work to condemn the incident and revise security norms inside all the seven district courts premises in the national capital.The Rohini court Bar association also held several meetings to review the security system.The New Delhi Bar Association said the entire legal fraternity was “shocked” due to a “serious security lapse” causing an incident of firing and killing inside Rohini Court Complex.“The incident has raised a serious security concern for lawyers, judiciary, staff, litigants and public in general. The issue of security inside the court complex must not be compromised and hence, be taken up at highest possible priority,” said Nagendra Kumar, secretary of NDBA in a circular.Chairman of Bar Council of Delhi, Rakesh Sehrawat sought action against those responsible for security at the Rohini district courts premises and said nothing can be more shameful than what happened today.In a statement, the Rohini Bar Association said that it held a meeting where it was decided that the security checks should be strictly enforced on the entry and exit gates throughout the day. The communication said that it was further decided that members/advocates/court staff and litigants shall co-operate with the security checks on the gates by showing their ID cards and also allow their vehicles to be checked thoroughly as and when demanded by the security personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gogi-killed-in-shootout-a-year-ago-hc-flagged-need-to-raise-police-deployment-at-rohini-court-101632507318599.html

25-09-2021||Delhi||UPSC: At least 5 among top 20 are DU graduates, credit varsity for their success||At least five of the top 20 candidates to clear the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) civil services examination (CSE), 2020, graduated from Delhi University and credited the varsity for their success in clearing the competitive exam. Four of them cleared the exam in their first attempt and the fifth candidate cleared the exam in her second attempt.The toppers are from among 4.82 lakh aspirants who took the prelims this year and are among the 761 candidates who have been recommended by the commission for appointment to various administrative services.Satyam Gandhi, 22, who secured rank 10, graduated from Dyal Singh College last year. Hailing from Dighra village in Bihar’s Samastipur district, the political science student said his experience in DU enabled him to achieve this success.“After spending 18 years of my life in Bihar, I came to Delhi and DU helped shape my personality. The university teaches you things beyond scholarly activities and I learned from my teachers and peers. Though it was my grandfather’s dream to have a collector (district magistrate) in the family, I was motivated to get into civil services after an internship with the Ranchi administration. I realised that I wanted to contribute towards the development of rural areas,” Gandhi said. His father works as a clerk in Bihar and his mother is a home maker.Another DU graduate Ria Dabi, whose sister Tina Dabi topped the UPSC exams in 2015, secured the 15th rank this year and said her experiences at Lady Shri Ram College for Women as an undergraduate student of political science helped her gain a wider perspective.“This is a prestigious job where one gets to work for the welfare of the country and everyday problem of the masses. Ever since my sister got selected, I had a stronger motivation to crack the examination. Tina constantly guided me on how to prepare and which books to read, and also gave me moral support when I got too stressed. DU proved a good experience as we met a lot of students from different colleges during inter-college activities. It provided a wide perspective on how people think and how administration works,” said Dabi, who graduated in 2019, and wants to work on field of education.Like Gandhi and Dabi, another DU graduate Sarthak Agrawal, 25, also cleared the exam with rank 17 in his first attempt. Agrawal, who graduated from Shri Ram College of Commerce in 2017, went on to do his MPhil in Economics from Oxford University, England. He worked in London for a few months before returning to India when the pandemic struck. An alumnus of DPS Vasant Kunj, the 25-year-old was also the all-India CBSE topper in 2014.“Even though my training was in economics and it was quite academic, I realised that one can do much more as an IAS officer to improve development outcomes. I have worked in the education sector and would love to contribute in that direction,” he said.Yash Jaluka, who secured the fourth rank and hails from Jharkhand, did his undergraduate studies at the Kirori Mal College and postgraduation from the Delhi School of Economics (DSE). “I want to work in Jharkhand and focus on better implementation of government schemes. We do have a lot of schemes and improving governance systems will be my priority. DU was hugely influential; I saw what a good public university can do as we had students from all financial backgrounds studying there and excelling in their field of study. DSE was particularly helpful in my exam preparations,” he said.Mamta Yadav, 24, who graduated from Hindu College in 2017 and pursued BSc physics, secured the fifth rank this year in her second attempt. “Many seniors from Hindu College had cleared UPSC and the exposure helped us in understanding in what the role entails. People in DU are from different backgrounds so one can speak to teachers, researchers, and others while deciding on a career path.”Two toppers are also graduates of IIT-Delhi. Arth Jain, 24, who ranked 16th and studied mechanical engineering at IIT-Delhi, graduated in 2019. He said he was inspired by his father who is an IPS officer. Shashwat Tripurari, 23, who secured the 19th rank, also graduated from IIT-Delhi and studied civil engineering at the institute in 2018. He is currently working as an IPS officer after clearing the CSE last year.Of all candidates who cleared the exams this year, 545 are men and 216 women. The top 25 candidates comprise 13 men and 12 women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/upsccse-2020-at-least-five-among-top-20-are-du-graduates-credit-varsity-for-their-success-101632506229116.html
25-09-2021||Delhi||Gang war in courtroom: Gogi among 3 shot dead||Gunmen dressed as lawyers killed notorious gangster Jitender Maan, alias Gogi, in a shocking and sensational shooting inside a courtroom in Delhi’s Rohini before police shot dead the two assailants. At least three dozen rounds were fired by the shooters and the police team that responded. Eyewitnesses said the judge Gagandeep Singh was seated when the shooting began in front of him. The judge and roughly a dozen others in the courtroom escaped unhurt, and the police said that the casualties were limited to the trio, but a few eyewitnesses said that one woman was injured by shrapnel.Pranav Tayal, the deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) said the three men – Gogi and the assailants – succumbed to the gunshot wounds at the crime scene. “As Gogi was hit, the Delhi Police staff present there on escort and other duties responded in a controlled, calibrated manner and in the counter fire, both the assailants received gunshot wounds and were immobilised,” Tayal said.The shooters are alleged to be members of the gang led by his friend-turned-rival Sunil Maan, better known as Tillu Tajpuriya. The two shooters, identified by police as Rahul Tyagi and Jagdeep (also known as Jagga), were focussed on shooting Gogi instead of the police team that shot them dead, eyewitnesses said. People present at the court complex said premises was full of police, which made the attack a significant security lapse. “There were at least 30 police personnel, in uniform and plainclothes, in and outside this courtroom. It appeared the attackers knew there was no escape after the killing,” said RK Jha, an eyewitness lawyer.Once close friends, Gogi and Tajpuriya turned bitter foes as they rose through the world of crime. For the last decade, both of them ran rival extortion gangs targeting people in outer Delhi and parts of Haryana.Their rivalry has erupted in gunfights, and at least 10 of their associates have died in the past. Police said Gogi managed to escape from police custody while being produced in a court in Haryana in 2016, and stepped up his rivalry against Tajpuriya before being arrested by the Delhi Police’s special cell last year. The most wanted criminal in Delhi until his arrest, Gogi was accused of being involved in over 30 crimes spanning murder, attempt to murder, extortion, possession of illegal arms, carjacking and land grabbing.In March this year, Gogi’s associate Kuldeep Maan, also known Fajja, escaped police custody while being taken to GTB Hospital for treatment. Fajja was eventually gunned down by police in Rohini, and a number of police personnel accompanying Gogi to court was increased.On Friday, a jail van with 10 police personnel from the Third Battalion and Gogi left Tihar Jail around 10.45am and reached the court in 45 minutes. He was placed in the lock-up while his documentation process was carried out. At the court premises, another 15-20 policemen from the special cell and Rohini district police waited in plainclothes. “Gogi remained in the lock-up until he was summoned. We took him through a separate and secure route till the courtroom,” said a senior officer with the Third Battalion, which escorts prisoners to and from jail.Around 1pm, Gogi was brought to the courtroom, about 30 minutes after another gangster Gogi once knew but was also at odds with (he too is known as Sunil Maan) was produced in the same courtroom in connection with an attempt to murder case of 2010 in which both were co-accused. Eyewitnesses said there were about 15-17 people, including the judge, policemen and lawyers, in the courtroom at that time. “A few minutes after Gogi was brought in, he was being produced before the judge when two men who were dressed like lawyers suddenly pulled out guns and fired at him from behind. Gogi turned around in response, but ended up getting shot repeatedly in his chest and other parts of his body,” said another eyewitness lawyer, Sunil Tomar, adding that the judge moved into his chamber soon after.While the number of bullets received by Gogi will be known after autopsy, eyewitnesses said he was shot at least half-a-dozen times. DCP Tayal said a case was registered in connection with the shootout and investigation has been taken up in accordance with the guidelines of the Supreme Court and National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Joint commissioner of police (northern range) is looking into the incident and is also conducting a review for further strengthening the court security. Chief Justice of India NV Ramana spoke to the chief justice of Delhi high court over the incident and advised him to talk to both police and Bar to ensure the functioning of courts is not effected, said people in the knowledge of the matter. The issue of safety and security of court complexes and judicial personnel is already under the consideration of the Supreme Court in a batch of petitions. In the wake of violence on Friday, the matter may get prioritised next week, added the people cited above. Chinmoy Biswal, spokesperson for the Delhi Police, said the police team immediately launched a counter offensive to kill both suspects. The shootout lasted several minutes during which policemen took shelter behind the court walls to fire from outside. A video of the shootout showed a policeman appeared to be firing inside the courtroom before turning around to point his gun at the public – suggesting the police anticipated more assailants. Sounds heard from another 23-second video suggested that at least 10 rounds were fired in that brief period.In Alipur village, where Gogi’s mother lives, residents spoke about the attack in hushed tones and avoided venturing near the gangster’s home. “This gang is over. Even Gogi’s close associates will move to other gangs,” said a resident Praveen, who did not give his full name.In the courtyard at Gogi’s home, a small group of men sat silently on charpoys and plastic chairs. Most of them believe that the Delhi Police’s special cell “allowed” the attack to happen. “After Fajja’s encounter, the special cell expected Gogi to seek revenge,” said Ravinder Mann, his cousin.The Aam Aadmi Party said the courtroom murder reflects the Delhi Police’s “incapability” in managing law and order. “This is very shocking. No such case of gang war inside the court room has happened anywhere in the country. There are cases of violence that have happened inside court premises and vicinity of courts, but never inside a courtroom, in the presence of a magistrate and lawyers. This is a big security lapse, especially when we are told that the police had inputs about a potential gang war. It exposes that the Delhi Police is incapable of ensuring safety. By bypassing all rules in the rule book, the central government has appointed one of its favourite officers as commissioner. We request the Delhi High Court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter and initiate probe against officials who are responsible for the lapse,” said AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana said a security review of the court premises will be carried out. “Our officers acted swiftly and shot the two gunmen. The investigation of this case will be done by the crime branch. The officers will check the background of the people involved in the case. The person who died was involved in many heinous cases. Police will probe all aspects of the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gang-war-in-courtroom-gogi-among-3-shot-dead-101632505448512.html

The police officer was first thrashed by a mob that gathered after the girl complained to her mother before he was formally placed under arrest for the child’s sexual abuse.The officer, identified as Krityanand Paswan, was also booked under Bihar’s prohibition law after a breath analyzer test concluded that he was under the influence of alcohol.Paswan was the station house officer (SHO) of Katihar’s SC/ST police station and has been suspended with immediate effect, Katihar superintendent of police (SP) Vikash Kumar said. He was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days by a district court on Friday.Kumar said two First Information Reports (FIRs) have been lodged against him; the first in connection with molesting a minor girl and the second, for consumption of alcohol.”“The SHO was taken into custody soon after the complaint was lodged by her mother at the additional town police station under various sections including POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act,” Kumar said.The incident reportedly took place on Thursday evening when the minor was on her way back home with her grandmother but the precise circumstances of the crime are still unclear. According to one version, the officer was able to lure the child away from her grandmother and molested her behind the bush.Once home, the child complained about the officer to her mother, who went to Paswan to figure out the details. “As I tried to seek information about the incident, the SHO under the influence of alcohol turned abusive” the mother alleged.Scores of local residents who heard about the incident reached Buddhu Chowk in the town where the SHO along with other policemen was on duty. Soon, they started thrashing him, some with sticks and rods. Later, the local police station officers rescued Paswan from the crowd and took him to the town police station where he was placed under arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-inspector-molests-6-yr-old-is-thrashed-by-public-before-arrest-cops-101632496868118.html

It made no additional borrowing during the pandemic,” Sitharaman said at a press conference in Chandigarh. The Union finance minister was on a day-long visit to Haryana to attended a seminar in Panchkula organised by the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as part of its 20-day long ‘Sewa and Samarpan’ programme coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 71st birthday.The BJP’s central leadership is visiting BJP-ruled states to attend the functions kicked-off on September 17. During this campaign concluding on October 7, the Haryana BJP has planned to hold 71 blood donation camps and plant 71,000 saplings, besides conducting seminars on 71 big ticket policies and programmes of the Centre.According to the Union finance minister, one immediate indicator of Haryana “managing its fiscal affairs in a balanced and objective way” was during the Covid-19 pandemic when the state didn’t utilise its additional borrowing capacity that the Centre had increased.Stating that each state has its own strengths and challenges, Sitharaman said there is no harm in borrowing additionally because the states have activities for which they need funds.“But Haryana is one state which did not utilise its additional borrowing capacity that we gave... Haryana is managing its fiscal matters well,” she said, pointing out that during her meeting with Khattar, she as a matter of ‘curiosity’ touched the issue of Haryana not opting for additional borrowing.Responding to a question, the Union finance minister said she could see clearly “the good signs of revival of economy”. The revenue collection (both GST and direct taxation) going up is an indicator of revival, she said.The half-yearly target of revenue collection, she said, has already been achieved. The GST collection in the region on an average is somewhere over ₹1 lakh crore per month, she said.“These are not small indicators and not some sporadic indicators either... they clearly show that the economy is on a sustained path of revival,” Sitharaman added.Will extend all possible help to Punjab: FMOn Punjab accusing the Centre of adopting a “biased” funding formula (60:40 sharing ratio) while releasing funds under the Border Area Development Programme (BADP), the Union minister dismissed the allegations, saying there are some guidelines for deciding the ratio of border area funds.“We are not punishing Punjab... it is being done on recommendation of the finance commission. I want to assure that I will do all that is possible to help Punjab,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-made-no-additional-borrowing-during-covid-pandemic-fm-101632478629723.html

Reports said the men had kidnapped a local businessman and his son. In its earlier regime too, the Taliban were notorious for their extreme punishments and their public display, the aim of which is to deter similar crime.Here are the punishments that the Taliban are known for> Execution was for convicted murderers. Reports said that the victim's family were asked to kill the convicted murderers usually by a single shot to the head. The victims could also accept 'blood money' and allow the culprit to live.> As evident from the bodies hanging, the punishment for kidnapping will also be death. In recent weeks, men have been packed into a truck with their hands tied and were paraded around subjecting them to humiliation. > Faces have been painted and stale bread have been hung from the necks of some criminals, though their crime was not known, reports said. This is the practice of public-shaming culprits. > In the earlier regime, for convicted thieves, the punishment was amputation of one hand.> For those convicted of highway robbery, a hand and a foot were amputated.Apart from these, the Taliban inflicted some exceptional punishment during its earlier regime. A women's thumb was reportedly chopped off because she was wearing nail polish. Public execution was also held.So, what changes?Taliban leader, in charge of the prisons, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi said these punishments are 'essential' for security. Other countries stand to interfere in these issues and the Taliban are not commenting on their law and order system. The one-eyed and the one-legged Taliban leader said this time judges will adjudicate cases though the principle will be Sharia law. All punishments will remain the same.Turabi was notorious for his punishments and the band of men who used to ensure that those punishments are delivered immediately. Reports said when the Taliban took power in 1996, he screamed at a woman journalist, ordering her to leave the room full of men. One man objected and was slapped by Turabi.At that time, he used to rip music tapes from cars, forced men to wear turbans in all government offices and his enforcers routinely beat men whose beards had been trimmed.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kidnappers-body-hung-in-public-view-punishment-that-taliban-are-bringing-back-in-afghanistan-101632588226185.html

The Taliban, which rules the country as Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, have launched an investigation.Reports claim that the person killed was a member of Taliban. The incident took place when a Taliban convoy hit a roadside mine.Though no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, an affiliate of Islamic State (ISKP) is believed to be behind it. The terror group has claimed the attacks on Taliban earlier too.The ISKP is headquartered in eastern Afghanistan.On Thursday, unidentified gunmen, believed to be from ISKP, shot and killed four Taliban members inside a car. Locals in the Farmi Hada area discovered the dead bodies with their hands tied.On Wednesday, several explosions and an armed attack occurred in Jalalabad again, resulting in the death of five people, two of whom were Taliban.Earlier this month, three people were killed and 19 others injured in an explosion in Jalalabad. The next day, a bomb went off in the same city in the area of the bus station.Two civilians died, and one Taliban supporter was wounded in that blast. The ISKP took responsibility for the explosions for those blasts too.Taliban members continue to maintain enhanced security measures on the major roads within the city limits of Jalalabad.The Taliban have battled with the Islamic State since its emergence in Afghanistan in 2014. The burgeoning ISKP has claimed responsibility for most recent attacks, including the horrific bombing outside the Kabul airport that killed 13 US service personnel and 169 Afghans during last month's chaotic evacuations.The ISKP has adopted many of the Taliban's tactics of urban warfare that marked their own successful guerrilla campaign in the 1990s.While Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has downplayed the threat, saying that Islamic State had no effective presence in Afghanistan, commanders on the ground do not dismiss the threat so lightly.ISKP is believed to draw many of its fighters from the ranks of the Taliban or the Pakistani version of the Taliban, known as the TTP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-vs-iskp-in-nangarhar-s-jalalabad-one-killed-in-blast-101632581023513.html
25-09-2021||World||UK expected to relax visa rules, here's why||Britain is expected to announce plans to issue temporary work visas to truck drivers to ease an acute labour shortage that has led to fuel rationing at hundreds of gas stations and long queues to fill up - with pumps running dry in some places.As retailers warned of significant disruption in the run-up to Christmas, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said it was looking at temporary measures to address the shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers.Newspapers reported that the government would allow up to 5,000 foreign drivers into Britain on short-term visas, a measure that logistics companies and retailers have demanded for months but which the government had previously ruled out.The UK's Road Haulage Association (RHA) says Britain needs 100,000 more drivers if it is to meet demand.Shortages of truckers have been caused partly by Brexit and COVID-19, which put a stop to driver training and testing for about a year."We're looking at temporary measures to avoid any immediate problems, but any measures we introduce will be very strictly time limited," a spokeswoman for Johnson's Downing Street office said in a statement.Downing Street declined to give further details.Ministers have cautioned against panic buying, and oil companies say there is no shortage of supplies, merely problems delivering the fuel to gas stations.However, there were long lines of vehicles at filling stations as motorists rushed out to fill up, and some forecourts closed as their supplies ran out.The issue came to the fore after BP said it had to close some of its outlets due to the driver shortages, with Shell and ExxonMobil's Esso also reporting problems with supplies.EG Group, which runs 341 forecourts across Britain, said on Friday it would impose a purchase limit of 30 pounds ($41) per customer for fuel due to the "unprecedented customer demand"."I regret what we're seeing at the forecourt," Huw Merriman, chairman of parliament's transport committee, told BBC TV."I was out on my bike ... and came past my BP garage and it was chaos. As soon as the message gets out there might be a fuel shortage, people understandably react."One police force said long queues were a potential hazard, blocking roads for emergency vehicles.Downing Street said the country had "ample fuel stocks"."The public should be reassured there are no shortages," the spokeswoman said. "But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary COVID-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country."The fuel issue comes as Britain, the world's fifth-largest economy, also grapples with a spike in European natural gas costs causing soaring energy prices and a potential food supply crunch.Other countries across Europe as well as the United States are also dealing with truck driver shortages, and industry figures have warned there was no guarantee that a change to the visa process would see foreign drivers coming to Britain."We'll have to see if we can attract people for a short period of time," Merriman said.Britain says the long-term solution is for more British drivers to be hired, with the RHA saying better pay and conditions are needed to attract people into the industry.But retailers have warned that unless the government acts to address the shortage in the next 10 days, then significant disruption is inevitable in the run-up to Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-expected-to-relax-visa-rules-here-s-why-101632571362188.html

We have a lot to do here’: Bill Gates explains why he is not ‘trying to escape planet earth in a spaceship’||Bill Gates, during his recent appearance in an American late night talk show, was asked about his thoughts on billionaires investing in space travel and in response, he said that he has become obsessed with eradicating diseases here on earth rather than with space.James Corden, the host of the Late Late Show with James Corden, hosted Gates in his show earlier on September 23 to talk about the climate crisis. However, what started as a casual joke, ended with a response from Gates, which the host called the “classiest burn.”Corden opened the talk by thanking Gates for being the “one billionaire who is not trying to escape planet earth on a spaceship at the moment.” When asked about why billionaires were “obsessed with” space travel at the moment, Gates’ reply was “I don’t know. I have become obsessed with things like Malaria and HIV and getting rid of those diseases and I would probably bore people at cocktail parties talking about diseases. Space? You know, we have a lot to do here on earth.” During the remainder of the interview, Gates called upon being optimistic and the combined efforts of all people to tackle the climate crisis.The reference by Corden in his question to Gates is apparently to the recent space flights by billionaires Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and Richard Branson, Virgin group’s founder back in July. Also another billionaire Jared Issacman led the Inspiration4 mission, which has been described as “world’s first all-civilian orbital mission to space.” The flight was on a Dragon capsule and a SpaceX rocket built by another billionaire Elon Musk. While the contributions of these missions to space exploration has been largely appreciated, it has also received some criticism.Earlier in the week, United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres during his opening speech at the UN general assembly called out the gap between the rich and the poor with “billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on Earth.”However, Bezos and Musk have both defended their decisions and acknowledged the criticism at them. Bezos said that his critics were “largely right” and said “We have to do both. We have lots of problems here and now on Earth and we need to work on those and we also need to look to the future, we’ve always done that as a species and as a civilization. We have to do both,” the Guardian quoted him as saying earlier in July.Meanwhile, Musk, who is yet to go into space, has said, “I think we should spend the vast majority of our resources solving problems on Earth. Like, 99% plus of our economy should be dedicated to solving problems on earth,” in a Netflix documentary about Inspiration4. “But I think maybe something like 1%, or less than 1%, could be applied to extending life beyond earth,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/space-we-have-a-lot-to-do-here-bill-gates-explains-why-he-is-not-trying-to-escape-planet-earth-in-a-spaceship-101632572036222.html
25-09-2021||World||Taliban hang dead body from crane in main square of Afghanistan’s Herat city: Report||Despite repeated assurances of respecting human rights, the Taliban hanged a dead body from a crane in the main square of Afghanistan’s Herat city, The Associated Press reported on Saturday citing a witness. The report suggests that the Sunni Pashtun fighters brought four bodies to the main square of Afghanistan’s third-largest city and moved three of them to other squares for displaying in public.After bringing the body to the main square, the Taliban announced that the four were caught in a kidnapping attempt and killed by police, according to the witness named Wazir Ahmad Seddiqi. The Taliban are yet to make any official announcement related to the public display of killings. However, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi, who was responsible for the enforcing of Taliban’s harsh interpretation of Sharia law during their previous rule, said that they will carry out executions and amputations again, reported AP.The Islamists fundamentalists have reestablished the dreaded 'Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice' which ordered some of the most brutal killings from 1996-2001. It was notorious for enforcing the stricter interpretation of Sharia law and punishing the violators in a manner contradictory to international laws on human rights.A Taliban official recently told the New York Post that the new regime will punish the violators as per the “Islamic rules”. Explaining the provision for punishment, Mohammad Yusuf, who claims to be responsible for the “central zone” of Afghanistan, said that a person intentionally committing murder will be killed but there might be other kinds of punishment if the murder is not intentional.Yusuf said that the hands of thieves would be cut off, while those involved in “illegal intercourse” will be stoned, reported New York Post. Flogging, stoning, amputating even publicly executing people were common in Afghanistan during the Taliban’s rule from 1996-2001. While the Islamist hardliners are attempting to project a different face, the international community is closely monitoring the reports of killings and abuses since the Taliban.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-hang-dead-body-from-crane-in-main-square-of-afghanistan-s-herat-city-report-101632569732801.html

Amongst those Mujahideen groups were al Qaeda, were various groups from all over the world..these were considered heroes," Imran Khan said."Come 1989, the Soviets leave. So do the Americans.. Pakistan was left with 5 million Afghan refugees. We were left with sectarian militant groups which never existed before. And a year later, Pakistan was sanctioned by the US. We felt used," Imran Khan said.Imran Khan says world should give Taliban more time, US misunderstood Haqqanis"Fast forward 9/11. Pakistan is needed again by the US because now they are invading Afghanistan and that can't happen with the logistical support of Pakistan. What happens after that? The same Mujahideen that we have trained that fighting for occupation was a sacred duty, they turned against us. We were called collaborators," the Pakistan PM said.
25-09-2021||World||Iceland goes to polls as its government fights to retain majority||Iceland votes on Saturday in an election that could see its unprecedented left-right coalition lose its majority, despite bringing four years of stability after a decade of crises.With the political landscape more splintered than ever, the process of forming a new coalition could be more complicated than in the past.Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir, whose Left-Green Movement had never led a government before, is seeking a second mandate but a large number of parties could get in her way.Opinion polls suggest a record nine parties out of 10 are expected to win seats in the Althing, Iceland's almost 1,100-year-old parliament.That makes it particularly tricky to predict which parties could end up forming a coalition."It is challenging for the politicians but I think for democracy it is better to have everyone at the table," Thorsteinn Thorvaldsson, a 54-year-old voter, told AFP on the eve of the election."When I was younger it was simpler, there were four parties, now we have 10. But it is interesting," he said.With 33 of 63 seats, the outgoing coalition is a mix of the conservative Independence Party, the center-right Progressive Party, and the Left-Green Movement.'Different opportunities'Some opinion polls suggest the current coalition will manage to secure a very narrow majority but others say it will fail."Because there are so many parties, I think there will be a lot of different opportunities to form a government," Prime Minister Jakobsdottir told AFP in an interview this week.While she is broadly popular, her party is hovering around 10-12 percent in the polls and risks losing several seats.During her four-year term, Jakobsdottir has introduced a progressive income tax system, increased the social housing budget, and extended parental leave for both parents.She has also been hailed for her handling of the Covid crisis, with just 33 deaths in the country of 370,000.But she has also had to make concessions to keep the peace in her coalition, including a promise to create a national park in central Iceland which is home to 32 active volcano systems and 400 glaciers.This is only the second time since 2008 that a government has made it to the end of its four-year mandate on the sprawling island.Deep public distrust of politicians amid repeated scandals sent Icelanders to the polls five times from 2007 to 2017.'Free-for-all'The Independence Party, which polls credit with around 20-24 percent of votes, also risks losing seats but is expected to remain the largest political party.Its leader, Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, is a former prime minister who comes from a family that has long held power on the right.He is eyeing the post of prime minister.Benediktsson has survived several political scandals, including being implicated in the 2016 Panama Papers leak that revealed offshore tax havens, and is standing in his fifth election."I'm optimistic, I feel supported," he told a campaign rally this week, insisting his party would continue to be "the backbone of the next government".But there are five other parties all hot on his heels, credited with 10 to 15 percent of votes.They are the Left-Green Movement, the Progressive Party, the Social Democratic Alliance, the libertarian Pirate Party, and the center-right Reform Party.

25-09-2021||World||China welcomes release of Meng Wanzhou, quiet on release of two Canadian ‘spies’||China on Saturday welcomed the release of Huawei chief financial officer (CFO) Meng Wanzhou from home detention in Canada but remained all but silent on the release of two Canadians from Chinese jails in what appeared to be a surprise quid pro quo settlement between the two countries.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian wrote “welcome back” on his Twitter-like Weibo page while quoting a line from the official news agency, Xinhua, on Meng Wanzhou’s release. “Through unremitting efforts of the Chinese government, Meng Wanzhou has already left Canada on a charter flight organised by the Chinese government,” the Xinhua news agency reported.“Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese business executive who had been arbitrarily detained for more than 1,000 days in Canada, shared her thoughts and expressed her appreciation on a Chinese-government charter flight bringing her home,” Xinhua said.Another senior Chinese diplomat Liu Xiaoming tweeted, “Welcome home. Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.”Chinese state media turned Meng Wanzhou’s release into a victory for China and the ruling Communist Party of China, publishing quotes from Meng during her return flight in which she repeatedly thanked the party.“It is pitch dark outside. I am in the sky over the Arctic, heading home,” Meng Wanzhou said in comments widely circulating in Chinese social media on Saturday. “I will soon return to the embrace of the motherland.”“Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, my home country is becoming stronger and more prosperous day by day. Without a strong motherland, I won’t have my freedom today,” she said.Meng Wanzhou described the motherland, the party and the government as the shining light that has lit up “the darkest moments” of her life and led her on the long journey home.Meng Wanzhou also expressed gratitude to her family, colleagues and every well-wisher. “Despite all twists and turns, this returning journey is the sweetest journey home,” she said, according to Xinhua.In a commentary on the release, national broadcaster CGTN said: “The detention of Meng Wanzhou should never have happened - and a similar situation should never happen again. International arrest warrants should be used for criminals, not for pawns in the political game of thrones. Business or even international ties of any sort between nations cannot function if business executives are targets for bogus charges to help pursue political goals.”A report in the Global Times said the cases of Meng Wanzhou and the two arrested Canadians were different - and hence the simultaneous release should not be interpreted as “hostage diplomacy”.The tabloid wrote the story quoting Canadian media. “On the same day Meng flew back home, Canadian media outlets reported that two Canadians - Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor - left China on a plane back to Canada,” the Global Times report said.“Kovrig was accused of using an ordinary passport and business visa to enter China to steal sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017, while Spavor was accused of being a key source of intelligence for Kovrig,” state media had reported in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-welcomes-release-of-meng-wanzhou-quiet-on-release-of-two-canadian-spies-101632559515837.html
25-09-2021||World||EU proposes universal charger for mobiles: The reason and why Apple is unhappy?||The European Union is pushing for the adoption of a universal charging cord for mobile devices that could end the hoarding of different cables to just find the right one. The European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, proposed a legislation on Thursday that would mandate USB-C cables for chargingThe move is not just to bring cheer to the people who have to search through a heap of cables to find that one cord that would fit their phone, but to reduce the carbon footprint too. The EU wants to cut down on the 11,000 metric tons of electronic waste thrown out every year by Europeans.The move, however, has been criticised by tech giant Apple, which used its own lightning port for iPhones and some other devices.What the EU is proposing?The draft rules call for having a 'universal' charger for devices. It also advocates standardising fast charging technology and giving consumers the right to choose whether to buy new devices with or without a charger. The EU estimates that the move will save consumers 250 million euros (USD 293 million) a year.The European Commission cited a study which said that the typical EU resident owns at least three chargers, and use two regularly. The study also said that still, 38% of people report were not being able to charge their phones at least once because they couldn’t find a compatible charger.Is this a sudden move?No. The EU has been trying to cajole the industry into adopting a common standard for more than a decade, but there has been no success so far. So this time, the bloc is pushing the issue with a proposed legislation.“Chargers power all our most essential electronic devices. With more and more devices, more and more chargers are sold that are not interchangeable or not necessary. We are putting an end to that,” Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said on Thursday.What do the new rules entail?Companies will get two years to adapt to the new rules once they take effect. The rules would apply only to electronics sold in the European single market's 30 countries, but, like the EU's strict privacy regulations, they could end up becoming a de facto standard for the rest of the world.Apple speaks out against the proposed moveApple said it shared the European Commission's commitment to protecting the environment but questioned whether the proposals would help consumers.“We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,” the company said in a statement.What are the different charging standards prevalent today?Charging of devices was revolutionised by Universal Serial Bus (USB), which simplified computer connectivity. Initially, the USB-A took the world by storm. But in recent years, users have to choose from micro USB, mini USB, USB type-C and the lightning port used by Apple.While USB-A, which is found on virtually every desktop PC and older laptops, have more internal pins. Type-B, mini and micro reduced the pins but the speed of transferring data increased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-proposes-universal-charger-for-mobiles-the-reason-and-why-apple-is-unhappy-101632559116819.html
25-09-2021||World||Will Taliban get a chance to speak at UNGA? Global body says rules apply||The Taliban are unlikely to get a go at Saturday’s United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting of world leaders as the global body has said that Afghanistan's currently recognised UN ambassador, Ghulam Isaczai, is listed as a speaker for the country. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told the Associated Press that as of Friday Isaczai, who represents former president Ashraf Ghani's now-ousted government, is the final speaker.Reuters reported earlier this week that the Taliban have asked to address world leaders at the UNGA in New York and nominated their Doha-based spokesperson Suhail Shaheen as Afghanistan's UN ambassador. Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi wrote to UN secretary general Antonio Guterres on Monday, asking to speak during the annual high-level meeting of the UNGA, the agency reported citing the letter. The Taliban have challenged Isaczai’s credentials, saying that they are now in charge and have the right to appoint ambassadors. Muttaqi said in his letter to Guterres that Ghani was “ousted” as of August 15 and that countries across the world “no longer recognise him as president.” Muttaqi said Isaczai therefore no longer represents Afghanistan.Also read | Taliban govt remains non-inclusive and all-male after Sept 21 expansionAP reported that the UNGA committee, which decides on credentials challenges, has not met. It added that the nine-member committee’s meeting is highly unlikely over the weekend. UNGA spokesperson Monica Grayley said on Wednesday that the committee generally meets in November and will issue a ruling “in due course.” So, Isaczai will remain the Afghan envoy until the credentials committee takes a decision. He is currently scheduled to address the final day of the meeting on September 27. However, it was not immediately clear if any country might object in the wake of the Taliban letter.“We have all the requirements needed for recognition of a government. So we hope the UN, as a neutral world body, recognise the current government of Afghanistan,” Shaheen told The Associated Press on Wednesday.Also read | Taliban cabinet has no 'actual' power and that's why they are fighting: ReportThe Taliban have said they want to be recognised internationally and also financial help to rebuild the war-torn country, but their new interim government poses a dilemma for the United Nations as well as other countries. Several of the Taliban ministers, including Muttaqi, are on the UN's so-called blacklist of international terrorists.Also read | Taliban defence minister miffed with fighters taking selfies in govt officesReports said that the UNGA credentials committee could also use Taliban recognition as leverage to press for a more inclusive government that guarantees human rights, especially for girls who were barred from going to school during their previous rule, and women who weren't able to work. The United States, Russia, China, Bahama, Bhutan, Chile, Namibia, Sierra Leone and Sweden are the members of the committee.The UN refused to recognise their government when the Taliban last ruled from 1996 to 2001 and instead gave Afghanistan's seat to the previous, warlord-dominated government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was killed by a suicide bomber in 2011.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-taliban-get-a-chance-to-speak-at-unga-global-body-says-rules-apply-101632557784971.html

Both the countries issued a joint statement after a first in-person bilateral meeting under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden.In the statement, the two countries affirmed that they stand together in the shared fight against terrorism and will take concerted action against designated terrorist groups."The leaders reaffirmed that the United States and India stand together in a shared fight against global terrorism, will take concerted action against all terrorist groups, including groups proscribed by the UNSCR 1267 Sanctions Committee, condemned cross-border terrorism, and called for the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks to be brought to justice.

25-09-2021||World||Counterterrorism key issue in Narendra Modi’s meetings with US, Quad partners||India and the United States bilaterally and then with their Quad partners Australia and Japan on Friday strongly denounced “cross-border terrorism”, usually a pointer to Pakistan; the use of terrorist proxies and emphasised the need to cut logistical, financial and military support to terrorists.Counterterrorism along with free and open Indo-Pacific, the fight against Covid-19 and climate change emerged as key common issues of concern and discussion for the two platforms that met one after the other at the White House on Friday.US President Joe Biden hosted his first bilateral summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then the first ever in-person summit of the Quad, joined by Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga. The American and Japanese leaders ended the day with their own separate bilateral meet.At the India-US bilateral summit, the two sides agreed that the issue of terrorism remains very important. “Counterterrorism efforts in cooperation between the two countries will be given a lot of emphasis,” foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said briefing reporters on India’s participation in the two meetings. “Both sides denounced any use of terrorist proxies and emphasise the importance of denying logistical financial or military support to terrorist groups, which could be used to plan, or launch terror attacks.”The India-US joint statement said “the two leaders reaffirmed that both countries stand together in a shared fight against global terrorism, and will take concerted action against all terrorist groups, including groups proscribed by the UNSCR 1267 Sanctions Committee, condemned cross-border terrorism, and called for the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks to be brought to justice”.Pakistan’s continued support of terrorism came up in the context of Afghanistan, and its continued support for a “certain approach” that was not seen seem to be conducive to the international community’s expectations of what Afghanistan should be like.Pakistan’s support of terrorism was brought up by US Vice-President Kamala Harris, unprompted, during her discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.As a long-time victim of terrorism, most of it emanating from across its western border, India has made counterterrorism key foreign policy objective. It has been a part of the India-US dialogue for years now. And, it became on Friday a key element of the Quad agenda at India’s insistence.“I think we are looking at fairly strong language with regard to the Quad’s commitment on terrorism and the need to counter terrorism, anywhere in the world,” the foreign secretary said, speaking to India’s role in making counterterrorism an issue for the Quad as well. “It reinforces the Quad’s thinking on this issue, and the need to combine efforts to, to deal with this common scourge,” he added.The Quad joint statement said: “We denounce the use of terrorist proxies and emphasised the importance of denying any logistical, financial or military support to terrorist groups which could be used to launch or plan terror attacks, including cross-border attacks.”At the Narendra Modi-Joe Biden bilateral meeting, the two sides also discussed the need to reinvigorate trade talks, enhance cooperation on defence production, intensify joint efforts on fighting the Covid-19 pandemic through vaccines, climate change, people to ties, which included H-1B visas for specially skilled workers and other issues that the two sides are engaged in at the same time.The India-US agenda is so exhaustive that President Biden said the summit meeting should have been allocated two days, Shringla said. It went on for 30 minutes overtime.At the historic first in-person summit, the Quad announced the launch of several new initiatives such as a fellowship for 100 students in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields annually, a working group to enhance cooperation between the four countries on space, a new infrastructure partnership, formation of a Green-Shipping network, establish a clean-hydrogen partnership; publish a Quad statement of principles on the use of technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/counterterrorism-key-issue-in-narendra-modi-s-meetings-with-us-quad-partners-101632548894588.html
25-09-2021||World||Chinese media hails release of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou from detention in Canada||Chinese state media on Saturday described Huawei heiress Meng Wanzhou’s surprise release from detention in Canada as “exciting news” and a “landmark deal” in first reactions from Beijing after she reached an agreement with the US justice department that allows her to return to China.Chinese state-run media said that Meng Wanzhou’s release from her home detention in Vancouver could ease “frozen” China-Canada ties. Meng Wanzhou is the elder daughter of billionaire Ren Zhengfei who in 1987 founded Huawei, the largest telecom equipment maker in the world.The US had alleged that Meng Wanzhou, who is Huawei’s chief financial officer (CFO), had misled HSBC bank over the nature of Huawei;s ties with a company called Skycom. It had put HSBC at risk of violating US sanctions against Iran, Washington had alleged.Following the deal on Friday, Meng Wanzhou was expected to be back in China as early as Saturday night, the Global Times said. “In a video footage seen by the Global Times, a GPS tracker ankle bracelet that Meng has worn for over two years has been removed, and she addressed the public after the hearing, showing gratitude for the Canadian judge and court upholding the rule of law,” it said.Meng Wanzhou, according to the Global Times report, appeared virtually in an American federal courtroom in Brooklyn on Friday, and reached a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in a case of federal charges against her for bank and wire fraud.“Under the terms of this agreement, Meng will not be prosecuted further in the US and the extradition proceedings in Canada will be terminated,” according to a statement of William Taylor, one of the lawyers who represent Meng Wanzhou. “Over the past three years my life has been turned upside down. It was a disruptive time for me as a mother, as a wife,” Meng Wanzhou told reporters and supporters on the steps outside the Vancouver courtroom after the hearing, according to a Reuters report.China had accused Canada of arbitrarily detaining Meng Wanzhou, and acting as an accomplice of the US, despite violating no Canadian law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-media-hails-release-of-huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-from-detention-in-canada-101632546794208.html
25-09-2021||World||Prisoner swap: Canada releases Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, China frees 2 Canadians||Huawei’s chief financial officer (CFO) Meng Wanzhou, who had been in detention in Canada since December 2018, left the country for China on Friday after a judge discharged her in a case for extradition to the United States following the American department of justice agreeing to a deal with her.In a day of fast-changing developments, hours later there was a quid pro quo settlement as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that two Canadians, including a former diplomat, who were detained in China and charged with espionage following Meng Wanzhou’s arrest in Canada, had been released and were on their way back to Canada.The day started with Meng, daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, making a virtual appearance before a Federal district court in Brooklyn, New York. The US justice department in a statement said she had “entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) and was arraigned on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, bank fraud and wire fraud”.Acting US assistant attorney general Mark Lesko for the justice department’s National Security Division said the DPA would be “end of the ongoing extradition proceedings in Canada, which otherwise could have continued for many months, if not years”. Under the plea deal, Meng Wanzhou agreed to a statement that constituted an admission of deceiving a financial institution in an effort to bypass sanctions imposed by the US on the regime in Iran. “In entering into the deferred prosecution agreement, Meng has taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution,” said acting US attorney Nicole Boeckmann for the eastern district of New York.By the afternoon, British Columbia Supreme Court associate chief justice Heather Holmes discharged the extradition proceedings against Meng Wanzhou, CFO of the Chinese telecommunications company. “Sorry for the inconvenience caused,” Meng Wanzhou told reporters outside the Vancouver court after the case was dropped. While she said the long-running case had been “disruptive” for her personally, Meng Wanzhou expressed her appreciation of the court “for their professionalism and the Canadian government for upholding the rule of law.” Canada’s department of justice thereafter stated she was “free to leave” the country.Within hours, she was aboard a special Air China flight that left Canada for the Chinese city of Shenzhen.Late on Friday evening, Justin Trudeau announced that the two Canadians imprisoned in China, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig were on board a flight from China and returning to Canada. Addressing the media in Ottawa, he said, “These two men have gone through an unbelievably difficult ordeal. For the past 1,000 days, they have shown strength, perseverance, resilience and grace.”On August 11, businessman Spavor was sentenced to 11 years in prison by a Chinese court on charges related to spying.The case involving Meng Wanzhou and the two Michaels had led to a rapid schism in relations between Ottawa and China with Trudeau describing China’s actions in arresting the two Michaels as “hostage diplomacy”.Interestingly, after becoming PM for a third term following national elections on Monday, Trudeau had a telephonic conversation with US President Joe Biden where the fate of the two Michaels was among the subjects discussed.In what appeared to be an exchange of prisoners, the flight carrying the two Michaels left China at almost exactly the same time as the one with Meng Wanzhou aboard departed Vancouver.“It’s good news for all of us that they are on their way home to their families,” Trudeau said. He made the announcement after their flight had left Chinese airspace.China has denied Canadian charges that they were “arbitrarily detained” as an act of “coercive diplomacy”, but the sequence of events on Friday evening will buttress Ottawa’s argument.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prisoner-exchange-canada-releases-huawei-executive-china-frees-2-canadians-101632545414133.html

The Quad vaccine initiative was announced in March and comprises the manufacturing of a billion doses with partners chipping in with funding and logistics, as reported earlier by the Hindustan Times.“In line with our March announcement, and recognizing the continuing global supply gap, we will ensure this expanded manufacturing is exported for the Indo-Pacific and the world, and we will coordinate with key multilateral initiatives, such as the COVAX Facility, to procure proven safe, effective and quality-assured Covid-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries,” a joint statement read.To date, the Quad said it has delivered nearly 79 million doses in the Indo-Pacific region.The leaders welcomed Biological E Ltd production, including through Quad investments, of at least one billion safe and effective vaccines by the end of next year. “The Quad also welcomes India’s announcement to resume exports of safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines, including to COVAX, beginning in October 2021,” the joint statement added.Pointing out that the coronavirus pandemic, which struck last year, continues to cause global suffering, the Quad leaders committed to better preparations for the next pandemic. They also promised to build coordination for health-security efforts in the Indo-Pacific, and jointly carry out at least one pandemic preparedness tabletop or exercise next year.On the vaccination front, Japan will continue providing assistance to its regional partners to purchase doses through $3.3 billion of the Covid-19 crisis response emergency support loan. The Australian government, on the other hand, will deliver $212 million in grant aid to purchase vaccine doses for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, the joint statement said. It will provide $219 million to support last-mile vaccine rollouts and lead in coordinating Quad’s last-mile delivery efforts in these regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-to-pledge-1-2-billion-covid-19-vaccine-doses-globally-101632539010214.html
25-09-2021||World||At UNGA, Imran Khan tries to paint Pakistan as a victim of US ungratefulness||Prime Minister Imran Khan sought to cast Pakistan as the victim of American ungratefulness and an international double standard in his address to the United Nations General Assembly on Friday.In a prerecorded speech aired during the evening, the Pakistani prime minister touched on a range of topics that included climate change, global Islamophobia, and “the plunder of the developing world by their corrupt elites” — the latter of which he likened to what the East India Company did to India.It was for India's government that Khan reserved his harshest words, once again labeling Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as “fascist.” But the cricketer turned posh international celebrity turned politician was, in turn, indignant and plaintive as he painted the United States as an abandoner of both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan.“For the current situation in Afghanistan, for some reason, Pakistan has been blamed for the turn of events, by politicians in the United States and some politicians in Europe,” Khan said. “From this platform, I want them all to know, the country that suffered the most, apart from Afghanistan, was Pakistan when we joined the US war on terror after 9/11.”He launched into a narrative that began with the United States and Pakistan training mujahedeen — regarded as heroes by the likes of then-President Ronald Reagan, he said — during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. But Pakistan was left to pick up the pieces — millions of refugees and new sectarian militant groups — when the Soviets and the Americans left in 1989.Khan said the US sanctioned its former partner a year later, but then came calling again after the 9/11 attacks. Khan said Pakistan's aid to the U.S. cost 80,000 Pakistani lives and caused internal strife and dissent directed at the state, all while the U.S. conducted drone attacks.“So, when we hear this at the end. There is a lot of worry in the U.S. about taking care of the interpreters and everyone who helped the US,” he said, referring to Afghanistan. “What about us?”Instead of a mere "word of appreciation,” Pakistan has received the blame, Khan said.Despite Khan's rhetoric espousing a desire for peace, many Afghans have blamed Pakistan for the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan because of close links. The United Nations in August also rejected Pakistan's request to give its side at a special meeting on Afghanistan, indicating the international community's shared skepticism.In his speech, Khan echoed what his foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, told The Associated Press earlier this week on the sidelines at the UN: the international community should not isolate the Taliban, but instead strengthen the current Afghan government for the sake of the people.He struck an optimistic tone about Taliban rule, saying their leaders had committed to human rights, an inclusive government, and not allowing terrorists on Afghan soil. But messages from the Taliban have been mixed.A Taliban founder told the AP earlier this week that the hard-liners would once again carry out executions and amputated hands — though this time after adjudication by judges, including women, and potentially not in public.“If the world community incentivizes them, and encourages them to walk this talk, it will be a win-win situation for everyone,” he said.Khan also turned his ire on that same community for what he perceives as a free pass given to India.“It is unfortunate, very unfortunate, that the world’s approach to violations of human rights lacks even-handedness, and even is selective. Geopolitical considerations, or corporate interests, commercial interests often compel major powers to overlook the transgressions of their affiliated countries,” Khan said.He went through a litany of actions that have “unleashed a reign of fear and violence against India’s 200 million-strong Muslim community,” he said, including lynchings, pogroms, and discriminatory citizenship laws.As in years past, Khan — who favors delivering his speeches in his British-inflected English, in contrast to Modi's Hindi addresses — devoted substantial time to Kashmir.“New Delhi has also embarked on what it ominously calls the ‘final solution’ for the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” Khan said, rattling off a list of what he termed “gross and systematic violations of human rights” committed by Indian forces. He specifically decried the “forcible snatching of the mortal remains of the great Kashmiri leader, ” Syed Ali Geelani, who died earlier this month at 91.Geelani's family has said authorities took his body and buried him discreetly and without their consent, denying the separatist leader revered in Kashmir a proper Islamic burial. Khan called upon the General Assembly to demand Geelani's proper burial and rites.He said Pakistan desires peace, but it is India’s responsibility to meaningfully engage.Modi is set to address the UN General Assembly in person on Saturday, a day after a bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-unga-imran-khan-tries-to-paint-pakistan-as-a-victim-of-us-ungratefulness-101632543262728.html
25-09-2021||World||China was the elephant in White House, Quad up to the challenge||Although the Quad joint statement does not mention the word China, there was realism about Beijing’s actions and capabilities at the summit with US President Joe Biden keeping the focus on the challenges posed by a rising superpower. While it may not have been spelt out explicitly, the Quad summit is expected to become an annual event with all the partners deciding to deepen and expand the group agenda to other areas on the foundation of trust, resilience, and capability.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi being the senior member of Quad after being seven years at the helm of Indian affairs, the summit was not only seized of the challenges posed by China but also ready to meet them. The Quad meeting broke many a myth with President Biden totally Asia centric instead of the expected focus on Europe. The summit was no American cover-up for the perceived Afghanistan withdrawal fiasco, instead, Biden appeared very solid and in grip of the Indo-Pacific situation. According to key people, contrary to common belief, President Biden was hard-nosed and his administration a practitioner of realpolitik in protecting US interests against its adversaries.Even though the focus of Quad was directed at India’s northern neighbour, there were no illusions about India’s western neighbour Pakistan, but the Biden administration was still weighing the pros and cons of the relationship in the context of their use in Afghanistan.The Quad joint statement is quite categorical on both China and Pakistan (in the context of Afghanistan) without mentioning either by name as the group’s agenda goes far beyond these two countries. The statement recommits the Quad partners to promote free, open, rules-based order, rooted in international law and undaunted by coercion, to bolster security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. “We stand for the rule of law, freedom of navigation and overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, democratic values, and territorial integrity of states,” the Quad statement said.The Quad statement on South Asia is guided by the UNSC resolution 2593, passed under the Presidentship of India on August 30, 2021. “We denounce the use of terrorist proxies and emphasized the importance of denying any logistical, financial or military support to terrorist groups which could be used to launch or plan terror attacks, including cross border attacks,” the statement said while the Quad leaders stood up for Afghan people.By making ASEAN countries and European Union central to the Quad’s Indo-Pacific initiative, the group unlike China has no desire to alienate any future partner with the core group remaining the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-was-the-elephant-in-white-house-quad-up-to-the-challenge-101632542743515.html

Covid-19 deaths in the US have climbed to an average of more than 1,900 a day for the first time since early March, while the United Kingdom has seen 160,000 fatalities so far.The increasing number of infections have filled hospitals, complicated the start of the school year and delayed return to offices in the United States, reports AP. Experts in the US have said that the coronavirus disease is preying largely on a distinct group—the unvaccinated Americans.The seven-day average of US hospital deaths with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 is down 8.9 per cent from the recent peak on September 16, according to the data from the US department of health and human Services. As many as 24 people died in one week alone at CoxHealth hospitals in the US' Springfield Branson area. West Virginia has had more deaths in the first three weeks of September than in the previous three months combined. Georgia is averaging 125 dead per day, reports AP.According to data from Johns Hopkins University, now, nearly 64 per cent of the US population has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and yet, average deaths per day have climbed 40 per cent over the past two weeks, from1,387 to 1,947.Meanwhile, Britain reported 35,623 new Covid-19 cases and 180 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test, official data showed on Friday. The UK’s Office for National Statistics has said that there have now been 160,000 deaths registered in the country where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. However, the Covid-19 vaccine rollout continues to be an incredible success in the UK. As many as 93,350,658 Covid-19 jabs have been given out across the nation—48,705,771 were first doses and 44,644,887 were second doses—according to data.The latest data came as the UK's coronavirus reproduction number, also known as the R number, has fallen slightly to between 0.8 and 1, the latest government figures show. Last week, the R-value was between 0.9 and 1.1. The growth rate in England is now between minus 3 per cent and minus 1 per cent a day, meaning that the number of new infections is shrinking by between 1 per cent and 3 per cent each day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-see-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-experts-say-vaccine-push-must-101632535113380.html

Here's theme, history, significance||World Pharmacists Day is observed on September 25 each year to pay tributes to pharmacists for the role they play in improving global health. The purpose of the annual Pharmacists Day is to encourage activities that promote and advocate for the role of the pharmacist in improving health in every corner of the world. This year's theme, developed by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), is “Pharmacy: Always trusted for your health”. The theme was chosen to highlight the importance of trust in healthcare and the practice of pharmacy across diverse clinical settings.World Pharmacists Day: ThemeWorld Pharmacists Day this year is being celebrated with the theme – “Pharmacy: Always trusted for your health”. According to the International Pharmaceutical Federation, “Trust is a central part of all human relationships and a fundamental element of social capital. Trust is also essential to health care: there is a significant association between trust in healthcare professionals and health outcomes for patients.”Pharmacists say that when patients have higher trust in healthcare professionals, they respond better to treatment and show more beneficial medical behaviour with fewer symptoms, leading to an overall better quality of life.World Pharmacists Day: HistoryWorld Pharmacists Day was introduced in 2009 by the International Pharmaceutical Federation council in Istanbul. This is the 11th year of observing the annual Pharmacists Day across the world.September 25 was chosen as the date for World Pharmacists Day because it was on this very day in 1912 that the International Pharmaceutical Federation was originally established; thus it was only natural that the Turkish members of the council suggested in 2009 that September 25 be observed as World Pharmacists Day.World Pharmacists Day: SignificancePharmacy is the practice that links medicinal science with chemistry and as such plays a hugely important role in modern society. Pharmacists are tasked with the discovery, production, disposal, safe and effective use, and control of medications and drugs. Without pharmacists having an efficient knowledge of drugs, their side effects, mobility, and toxicity, the world would not have safe medicines and drugs to rely on.World Pharmacists Day urges the global community to recognise the importance that pharmacists play in society and spread awareness with activities that promote and advocate their role in improving world health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-pharmacists-day-2021-globe-pays-tribute-to-pharmacists-today-here-s-theme-history-significance-101632531322659.html

Biden announces ‘Quad fellowship’ for STEM career in US||In what comes as a highly-anticipated announcement for students of the Quad member countries, US President Joe Biden on Friday unveiled a new “fellowship” that would let them pursue higher studies and advanced degrees in “STEM programmes” in the United States. The announcement was made on Friday during the much-touted first in-person meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.“Today, we are also launching a new Quad fellowship for students from each of our Quad countries to pursue advanced degrees in leading stem programs here in the United States, representing an investment in the leaders, innovators, and pioneers of tomorrow,” Biden said in his remarks at the Quad Leaders' Summit in Washington.Also Read | Quad leaders agree to scale up collective strategic cooperationThe Quad member countries – in addition to the US – are India, Japan, and Australia. Students from these countries will now have better opportunities to pursue their dream careers in the United States in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Sponsored by private donors, 25 students from each of the four countries will be selected to pursue master’s and post-doctoral degrees in STEM fields at leading US universities every year.“When we met six months ago, we made concrete commitments to shared and positive agenda for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the US president was quoted as saying news agency ANI. “Today I am proud to say that we are making excellent progress,” Biden said. He added that the four world premiers share a common worldview and an outlook for the future – coming together to “take on key challenges of our age”.Also Read | It's Indo-Pacific in Quad, Afghanistan a priority in UNGABiden hosted the leaders of the four countries, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the White House.

25-09-2021||World||Canadians, arrested in China, released after Huawei CFO, US reach deal||Two Canadians detained in China on spying charges have been released from prison and flown out of the country, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday, hours after a top executive of Chinese communications giant Huawei Technologies resolved criminal charges against her in a deal with the US Justice Department.Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in China in December 2018, shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company’s founder, on a US extradition request. Many countries labeled China's action “hostage politics.”The deal with Meng calls for the Justice Department to dismiss fraud charges late next year in exchange for Meng accepting responsibility for misrepresenting her company’s business dealings in Iran. Trudeau called a news conference Friday night about an hour after Meng’s plane left Canada for China.The arrangement with Meng, known as a deferred prosecution agreement, resolves a yearslong legal and geopolitical tussle that involved not only the US and China but also Canada, where Meng has remained since she was arrested at Vancouver's airport in December 2018.The deal was reached as President Joe Biden and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have sought to tamp down signs of public tension — even as the world’s two dominant economies are at odds on issues as diverse as cybersecurity, climate change, human rights and trade and tariffs. Biden said in an address before the U.N. General Assembly earlier this week that he had no intention of starting a “new Cold War,” while Xi told world leaders that disputes among countries “need to be handled through dialogue and cooperation.”As part of the deal, disclosed in federal court in Brooklyn, the Justice Department agreed to dismiss the fraud charges against Meng in December 2022 — exactly four years after her arrest — provided that she complies with certain conditions, including not contesting any of the government's factual allegations. The Justice Department also agreed to drop its request that Meng be extradited to the US, which she had vigorously challenged, ending a process that prosecutors said could have persisted for months.Meng's attorneys said they fully expect the charges to be dismissed in 14 months. “We’re very pleased that in the meantime she can go home to her family,” said defense lawyer Michelle Levin.After appearing via videoconference for her New York hearing, Meng made a brief court appearance in Vancouver, where she has been out on bail and living in her mansion since her arrest. The court released her from all her bail conditions and she is now free to leave the country.Outside the courtroom, Meng thanked the Canadian government for upholding the rule of law, expressed gratitude to the Canadian people and apologized "for the inconvenience I caused.”“Over the last three years my life has been turned upside down,” she said. “It was a disruptive time for me as a mother, a wife and as a company executive. But I believe every cloud has a silver lining. It really was an invaluable experience in my life. I will never forget all the good wishes I received.”Shortly afterward, Meng left on an Air China flight for Shenzhen, China, the location of Huawei's headquarters.Huawei is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies. It has been a symbol of China’s progress in becoming a technological world power — and a subject of US security and law enforcement concerns. Some analysts say Chinese companies have flouted international rules and norms and stolen technology.The case against Meng stems from a January 2019 indictment from the Trump administration Justice Department that accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of US sanctions. The indictment also charged Meng herself with committing fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company's business dealings in Iran.The indictment came amid a broader Trump administration crackdown against Huawei over US government concerns that the company's products could facilitate Chinese spying. The administration cut off Huawei’s access to US components and technology, including Google’s music and other smartphone services, and later barred vendors worldwide from using US technology to produce components for Huawei.The Biden White House, meanwhile, has kept up a hard line on Huawei and other Chinese corporations whose technology is thought to pose national security risks.Huawei has repeatedly denied the US government’s allegations and security concerns about its products.Meng had long fought the Justice Department's extradition request, with her lawyers calling the case against her flawed and alleging that she was being used as a “bargaining chip” in political gamesmanship. They cited a 2018 interview in which then-President Donald Trump said he'd be willing to intervene in the case if it would help secure a trade deal with China or aid U.S. security interests.Last month, a Canadian judge held off on ruling whether Meng should be extradited to the U.S. after a Canadian Justice Department lawyer wrapped up his case saying there was enough evidence to show she was dishonest and deserved to stand trial in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadians-arrested-in-china-released-after-huawei-cfo-us-reach-deal-101632532789892.html
25-09-2021||World||Merkel era to end as voters gear up to pick new government on Sunday||Candidates to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany’s weekend election were hitting the hustings on Friday in a last-ditch bid for votes in a tight race, even as tens of thousands of activists including Greta Thunberg rallied to demand climate action.As Germany’s top parties were set to hold final rallies ahead of Sunday’s vote, the Fridays for Future youth marches made the case that the political class has let down the younger generation. “The political parties haven’t taken the climate catastrophe seriously enough,” Luisa Neubauer, who runs the group’s German chapter, said.She said Germany, as one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases, had an outsize responsibility to set an example, with time running out to reverse destructive trends. “That is why we are calling this the election of a century,” she said.The race has boiled down to a two-way contest between Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, the centrist finance minister, and Armin Laschet from Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats. Both were set to address crowds later in Cologne and Munich, respectively.Polls give Scholz a small lead of about 26% over Laschet at around 22%, with the candidate from the ecologist Greens, Annalena Baerbock, trailing in the mid-teens. Despite the urgency of the climate issue for a majority of Germans, particularly in the aftermath of deadly floods in western Germany in July, this has failed to translate into strong support for the relatively inexperienced Baerbock.Baerbock, who joined one of the Fridays for Future rallies in Cologne, told Die Welt newspaper that she hoped the protests would give her party “tailwinds” heading into the vote. “The next government has to be a climate government - that will only work with a strong Green party.”Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, plans to stand down as leader of Europe’s biggest economy after Sunday’s election, although she will remain chancellor during coalition talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-era-to-end-as-voters-gear-up-to-pick-new-government-on-sunday-101632529809584.html

Blinken said he would keep up talks with Le Drian.Israeli actions could lead to ‘one state’, rues AbbasPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has accused Israel of jeopardising the two-state solution with actions he said could lead Palestinians to demand equal rights within one binational state comprising Israel, the occupied West Bank and Gaza.Addressing the UN General Assembly via video link from the West Bank, Abbas said, “If the Israeli occupation authorities continue to entrench the reality of one apartheid state as is happening today, our Palestinian people and the entire world will not tolerate such a situation.”The Israeli government has consistently rejected accusations of apartheid.Iran says nuclear talks soon, gives no date yetIran will return to talks on resuming compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal “very soon”, foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told reporters on Friday, but gave no specific date.“The Islamic Republic of Iran will return to the table of negotiations. We are reviewing the Vienna negotiations files currently and, very soon, Iran’s negotiations with the ‘four plus one’ countries will recommence,” Amirabdollahian said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-and-france-meet-patch-up-to-take-time-101632529577464.html
25-09-2021||World||Harris calls upon Pak to act against terrorists on its soil||US Vice-President Kamala Harris on Thursday called upon Pakistan to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil to ensure they do not threaten the security of both the United States and India and underscored the need to closely monitor Islamabad’s support for terrorism.Harris’s remarks came during her meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that lasted over an hour and “reflected warmth and cordiality”. She accepted Modi’s invitation to visit India and said she had wanted to “go back”, reminiscing about her earlier visits and the time she spent there.The meeting with Harris was politically important for the Indian prime minister because Harris, a leading progressive in the Democratic party, had been severely critical of the Modi government’s controversial decision to abrogate Article 370 guaranteeing special status of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir and the enactment of the Citizenship Act that speeds up Indian citizenship for Hindus seeking refuge in India from repressive regimes.Other progressives who had been critical of these measures were Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. Additionally, the vice-president’s niece Meena Harris brought the Modi government further grief by endorsing celebrities who came out in support of farmers protesting a legislation that they feared would strip them of government protection.Harris did not bring up any of these issues at the talks, according to all available indications. However, she did note that democracies all over the world are under threat and that it is imperative that India and the US defend democratic principles and institutions within their respective countries and around the world.Harris and Modi made initial remarks before their bilateral meeting, in which they had reiterated the importance of the relationship between the two countries and had stressed shared concerns and priorities such as climate change and Covid-19 and the need to ensue a free and open Indo-Pacific.The two leaders had a short one-on-one interaction without aides and officials, before starting the bilateral, during which Harris, whose late mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris was born and raised in India, reminisced about her visits to India and the time she spent with her grandfather, said people familiar with the conversation. She expressed the desire to “go back”, it was said. She has accepted Prime Minister Modi’s invitation to her and first gentleman Douglas Emhoff to visit India, but there was no word on the timing.Pakistan came up at the bilateral meeting when the two sides were discussing terrorism. “The vice-president, suo moto (on her own) referred to Pakistan’s role in that regard,” foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told reporters at a news briefing.The vice-president further said there were terror groups that were working there. “She asked Pakistan to take action so that these groups do not impact on us security and that of India,” Shringla said, adding, “She agreed with the prime minister’s briefing on the fact of cross border terrorism, and the fact that India had been a victim of terrorism for several decades now; and on the need to rein in and closely monitor Pakistan’s support for such terrorist groups.”Pakistan was entirely absent from the readout of the meeting issued by the Vice-President’s office that spoke of the “strategic partnership” between the two countries, “collaborative efforts” in dealing with Covid, the need for “ambitious action” against climate change, ways to “build on the robust bilateral collaboration on space”, and the need to “strengthen democracy at home and abroad”. The readout did mention that the two leaders “supported expanding bilateral security cooperation in the face of modern threats, including terrorism and cybercrime”.Harris’s rebuke of Pakistan’s continued support for terrorism came shortly after another senior member of the Biden administration, secretary of state Antony Blinken expressed US appreciation of Pakistan’s role in continuing diplomatic engagement over Afghanistan and help in evacuating people, to his Pakistan counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi in New York.The US appreciates “the work that Pakistan has done to facilitate the departure of American citizens who wish to leave as well as others”, Blinken said ahead of their meeting on||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-calls-upon-pak-to-act-against-terrorists-on-its-soil-101632517083856.html
25-09-2021||World||Explained: How close is Iran to producing a bomb?||A 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is being eroded and efforts to revive the pact face a new challenge with the killing of Tehran's top nuclear scientist.The accord's restrictions on Iran's atomic work had one objective: to extend the "breakout time" for Tehran to produce enough fissile material for a bomb, if it decided to make one, to at least a year from about two to three months.Iran maintains that it has never sought nuclear weapons and never would. It says its nuclear work only has civilian aims.Tehran began breaching the deal's curbs last year in a step-by-step response to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions.This has shortened the breakout time but reports by the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which polices the deal, indicate that Iran is not moving ahead with its nuclear work as fast as it could.European states have sought to save the nuclear deal, pressing Tehran to comply even as Washington has tightened sanctions, and holding out hopes of a change in U.S. policy once President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.Biden was part of the U.S. administration under Barack Obama that negotiated the 2015 deal.WHAT HAS IRAN DONE TILL NOW?Iran has contravened many of the deal's restrictions but is still cooperating with the IAEA and granting inspectors access under one of the most intrusive nuclear verification regimes imposed on any nation.* Enriched uranium - The deal limits Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium to 202.8 kg, a fraction of the more than eight tonnes it possessed before the deal. The limit was breached last year. The IAEA report in November put the stockpile at 2,442.9 kg.* Enrichment level - The deal caps the fissile purity to which Iran can refine uranium at 3.67%, far below the 20% achieved before the deal and below the weapons-grade level of 90%. Iran breached the 3.67% cap in July 2019 and the enrichment level has remained steady at up to 4.5% since then.* Centrifuges - The deal allows Iran to produce enriched uranium using about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at its underground Natanz plant, which was built to house more than 50,000. It can operate small numbers of more advanced models above ground without accumulating enriched uranium. Iran had roughly 19,000 installed centrifuges before the deal.In 2019, the IAEA said Iran had begun enrichment with advanced centrifuges at an above-ground pilot plant at Natanz. Since then, Iran started moving three cascades, or clusters, of advanced centrifuges to the underground plant. In November, the IAEA said Iran had fed uranium hexafluoride gas feedstock into the first of those underground cascades.* Fordow - The deal bans enrichment at Fordow, a site Iran secretly built inside a mountain and that was exposed by Western intelligence services in 2009. Centrifuges are allowed there for other purposes, like producing stable isotopes. Iran now has 1,044 IR-1 centrifuges enriching there.HOW CLOSE IS IRAN TO HAVING A BOMB?The breaches lengthened the breakout time but estimates still vary. Many diplomats and nuclear experts say the starting point of one year is conservative and Iran would need longer.David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector who tends to have a hawkish position on Iran, estimated in November that Iran's breakout time could be "as short as 3.5 months", although this presumes Iran would use 1,000 advanced centrifuges that were removed under the deal.WHAT MORE WOULD IRAN NEED TO DO?If Iran accumulated sufficient fissile material, it would need to assemble a bomb and probably one small enough to be carried by its ballistic missiles. How long that would take exactly is unclear, but stockpiling enough fissile material is widely seen as the biggest hurdle in producing a weapon.U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran once had a nuclear weapons programme that it halted. There is evidence suggesting Iran obtained a design for a nuclear weapon and carried out various types of work relevant to making one.Tehran continues to grant the IAEA access to its declared nuclear facilities and allow snap inspections elsewhere.Iran and the IAEA resolved a standoff this year that had lasted several months over access to two suspected former sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-close-is-iran-to-producing-a-bomb-101632514862526.html
25-09-2021||World||'Highly objectionable': Taliban defence minister miffed with fighters taking selfies in govt offices||As the Taliban transition from insurgency to peacetime administration, the leaders have taken cognisance of reports of abuses in an attempt to present a conciliatory face to the world. The Taliban’s defence minister Mullah Mohammad Yakoob, son of Mullah Omar, issued a rebuke in an audio message over misconduct by some fighters after the US troops withdrawal from Afghanistan, Reuters reported."We direct you keep them out of your ranks, otherwise strict action will be taken against you," Yakoob said in a message for Taliban commanders. "We don't want such people in our ranks."There have been reports of reprisal by the Sunni Pashtun fighters against former government officials and civil society activists despite the promises of general amnesty to project themselves as different from the hardline Islamist administration that ruled from 1996 to 2001. Often with no obvious chain of command, Taliban fighters are reported to have meted out abusive treatment to some Kabul residents.Yaqoob, who oversaw the military operations of the Taliban during the insurgency, warned that such actions would not be tolerated, according to Reuters."As you all are aware, under the general amnesty announced in Afghanistan, no mujahid has the right to take revenge on anyone," he said.The audio message was tweeted by several Taliban Twitter handles and was widely shared on social media. However, it remains unclear which exact incidents Yakoob was referring to. There have been reports of infighting among different factions of the Taliban as some of them want to opt for a moderate approach while others don’t want to compromise.Yakoob has also taken note of some Taliban fighters crashing into government offices and taking selfies."This is highly objectionable as everyone is taking out mobile phones and taking snaps in the important and sensitive ministries without any reason," he said. "Such hanging out and taking snaps and videos will not help you in this world, and also in the hereafter."(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highly-objectionable-taliban-defence-minister-miffed-with-fighters-taking-selfies-in-govt-offices-101632513810510.html

During the opening remarks ahead of the first in-person Quad Leaders' Summit, PM Modi said the four nations met for the time after the disastrous Tsunami of 2004 to help the Indo-Pacific region and now they are meeting when the world is fighting against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“Today, when the world is fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic, we have come here once again as Quad for the welfare of humanity,” he said.The prime minister further stated that the Quad vaccine initiative will help Indo-Pacific nations. Noting the shared democratic values of Quad nations, PM Modi said he would be happy to discuss issues like supply chain, global security, climate action, Covid response or tech cooperation with his Quad counterparts.“In a way, our Quad will work as a 'force for global good',” he added. PM Modi's comment on the objective of Quad comes in the backdrop of China's criticism of the grouping. Earlier today, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called Quad “a closed, exclusive clique targeting other countries.” US President Joe Biden said that the concrete commitments by Quad leaders on a shared and positive agenda for free and open Indo-Pacific are making excellent progress. Speaking from the East Room of the White House, Biden announced a new Quad fellowship for students from each of our Quad countries to pursue advanced degrees in leading stem programs in the United States.Calling for a free and open Indo-Pacific, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the Quad a “very important initiative” by the four nations that believe in fundamental rights. “Till date, Quad has given its absolute cooperation in big sectors, be it regional challenges or Covid-19,” Suga said.While none of the leaders named China in remarks to reporters, each one of them stressed the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific.“We stand here together, in the Indo-Pacific region, a region that we wish to be always free from coercion, where the sovereign rights of all nations are respected, and where disputes are settled peacefully and accordance with international law,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-force-for-global-good-pm-modi-on-quad-leaders-summit-during-covid19-101632506759149.html
25-09-2021||World||‘Stronger, closer, tighter’: US heralds new India paradigm||US President Joe Biden on Friday said at a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the relationship between the two countries is “destined to be stronger, closer and tighter”, and the Indian leader rolled out a 10-year road map for growing ties based on Four Ts — talent, technology, trade, and trusteeship.The two were meeting for the first time since Biden took office, and it is one of the most crucial engagements for Prime Minister Modi who is on a three-day visit to the US.The President went on to express optimism about the relationship, saying that he has long believed — even back in 2006 — that by 2020, India and the United States will be “among the closest nations in the world”.The two leaders have spoken on the phone several times, and have participated in virtual meetings.They displayed an easy level of comfort with each other, which was visible immediately when President Biden began recounting a story he has told many times before -- of people in India with the same surname “Biden”. Modi took it forward this time and said that since Biden last told him about it, he got some research done into it and he now brought along some genealogy documents for the president.“Your leadership will certainly play an important role in how this decade is shaped. The seeds have been sown for an even stronger friendship between India and the US,” the PM told Biden.“Today we’re launching a new chapter in the history of US-Indian ties, and taking on some of the toughest challenges we face together, starting with a shared commitment to end the Covid pandemic,” Biden added.Biden said he and Modi will discuss what more can be done to end the pandemic and take on climate challenges that the world faces, and ensure stability Indo-Pacific, including with partners of the Quad, which was scheduled to hold its first in-person summit meeting later in the day.Afghanistan, economic cooperation and trade will also figure in their talks, officials said.Biden also said the relationship was more than a partnership between the two countries and included “family ties”, alluding to the four million Indian-Americans.Pointing to Mahatma Gandhi’s upcoming birth anniversary next week, the US president said people should be reminded that his “message of non-violence, respect, tolerance, matters today maybe more than ever”.In the morning, the US President tweeted about the upcoming bilateral and said: “I look forward to strengthening the deep ties between our two nations, working to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific, and tackling everything from Covid-19 to climate change.”Prime Minister Modi spoke of the decade starting 2021 as a transformative period for ties between the two countries.Modi then went on to unveil his four-Ts road map: He spoke first of the talent of Indian-Americans that Biden had referred to in his remarks.“When I look at the importance of this decade, and the role that is going to be played by this talent of the Indian Americans, I find that the people to people talent will play a greater role and Indian talent will be a full partner in this relationship,” he said.Technology, the second T, he said, will be the “most important driving force” and technology that is going to be for the service and for the use of humanity.Trade, the third T, will continue to assume importance in the relationship, the Prime Minister said, adding: “We find that the trade between our two countries are actually complementary”.“There are things that you have and there are things that we have, and then we in fact complement each other. I find that the area of trade during this decade, that is also going to be tremendously important,” he stressed.The fourth T: trusteeship, a concept advocated by Mahatma Gandhi, who, Modi said, “used to talk about the principle of trusteeship, trusteeship of the planet”.He added that the sentiment of trusteeship would assume increased importance globally and also in relations between India and the US.”Richard Rossow, head of India studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said though the public remarks had “less flash than President Trump’s public engagements with Prime Minister Modi, it reflects a return to normal diplomacy. Not simply for its sober, friendly tone, but also the fact that the leaders are focused on the global partnership. This appeared less transactional than recent summits. Of course, the public session has less importance than what might be announced after the formal bilateral later today.”He also noted that Biden did not use the remarks to “directly raise growing concerns in Washington about human rights interest in India. He reiterated our shared interest but did not turn this into a potential point of friction”.Atman Trivedi, a former Obama administration official who is now a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Center, said, “The two leaders meeting in person, separately and with the Quad, presents a rare opportunity to take advantage of the growing strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific, while working on the most consequential challenges of our times, from Covid-19 to climate change to cybersecurity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-meets-narendra-modi-says-ties-between-two-countries-destined-to-be-stronger-closer-and-tighter-101632507249311.html
25-09-2021||World||'Cutting hands off necessary punishment': Taliban say executions will return||One of the founders of the Taliban and the chief enforcer of its harsh interpretation of Islamic law when they last ruled Afghanistan said the hard-line movement will once again carry out executions and amputations of hands, though perhaps not in public.In an interview with The Associated Press, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi dismissed outrage over the Taliban’s executions in the past, which sometimes took place in front of crowds at a stadium, and he warned the world against interfering with Afghanistan’s new rulers.“Everyone criticized us for the punishments in the stadium, but we have never said anything about their laws and their punishments,” Turabi told The Associated Press, speaking in Kabul. “No one will tell us what our laws should be. We will follow Islam and we will make our laws on the Quran.”Since the Taliban overran Kabul on Aug. 15 and seized control of the country, Afghans and the world have been watching to see whether they will re-create their harsh rule of the late 1990s. Turabi’s comments pointed to how the group’s leaders remain entrenched in a deeply conservative, hard-line worldview, even if they are embracing technological changes, like video and mobile phones.Turabi, now in his early 60s, was justice minister and head of the so-called Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice — effectively, the religious police — during the Taliban’s previous rule.At that time, the world denounced the Taliban’s punishments, which took place in Kabul’s sports stadium or on the grounds of the sprawling Eid Gah mosque, often attended by hundreds of Afghan men.Executions of convicted murderers were usually by a single shot to the head, carried out by the victim’s family, who had the option of accepting “blood money” and allowing the culprit to live. For convicted thieves, the punishment was amputation of a hand. For those convicted of highway robbery, a hand and a foot were amputated.Trials and convictions were rarely public and the judiciary was weighted in favor of Islamic clerics, whose knowledge of the law was limited to religious injunctions.Turabi said that this time, judges — including women — would adjudicate cases, but the foundation of Afghanistan’s laws will be the Quran. He said the same punishments would be revived.“Cutting off of hands is very necessary for security,” he said, saying it had a deterrent effect. He said the Cabinet was studying whether to do punishments in public and will “develop a policy.”In recent days in Kabul, Taliban fighters have revived a punishment they commonly used in the past — public shaming of men accused of small-time theft.On at least two occasions in the last week, Kabul men have been packed into the back of a pickup truck, their hands tied, and were paraded around to humiliate them. In one case, their faces were painted to identify them as thieves. In the other, stale bread was hung from their necks or stuffed in their mouth. It wasn’t immediately clear what their crimes were.Wearing a white turban and a bushy, unkempt white beard, the stocky Turabi limped slightly on his artificial leg. He lost a leg and one eye during fighting with Soviet troops in the 1980s.Under the new Taliban government, he is in charge of prisons. He is among a number of Taliban leaders, including members of the all-male interim Cabinet, who are on a United Nations sanctions list.During the previous Taliban rule, he was one of the group’s most ferocious and uncompromising enforcers. When the Taliban took power in 1996, one of his first acts was to scream at a woman journalist, demanding she leave a room of men, and to then deal a powerful slap in the face of a man who objected.Turabi was notorious for ripping music tapes from cars, stringing up hundreds of meters of destroyed cassettes in trees and signposts. He demanded men wear turbans in all government offices and his minions routinely beat men whose beards had been trimmed. Sports were banned, and Turabi’s legion of enforcers forced men to the mosque for prayers five times daily.In this week’s interview with the AP, Turabi spoke to a woman journalist.“We are changed from the past,” he said.He said now the Taliban would allow television, mobile phones, photos and video “because this is the necessity of the people, and we are serious about it.” He suggested that the Taliban saw the media as a way to spread their message. “Now we know instead of reaching just hundreds, we can reach millions,” he said. He added that if punishments are made public, then people may be allowed to video or take photos to spread the deterrent effect.The U.S. and its allies have been trying to use the threat of isolation — and the economic damage that would result from it — to pressure the Taliban to moderate their rule and give other factions, minorities and women a place in power.But Turabi dismissed criticism over the previous Taliban rule, arguing that it had succeeded in bringing stability. “We had complete safety in every part of the country,” he said of the late 1990s.Even as Kabul residents express fear over their new Taliban rulers, some acknowledge grudgingly that the capital has already become safer in just the past month. Before the Taliban takeover, bands of thieves roamed the streets, and relentless crime had driven most people off the streets after dark.“It’s not a good thing to see these people being shamed in public, but it stops the criminals because when people see it, they think ‘I don’t want that to be me,’” said Amaan, a storeowner in the centre of Kabul. He asked to be identified by just one name.Another shopkeeper said it was a violation of human rights but that he was also happy he can open his store after dark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-official-strict-punishment-executions-will-return-101632417470285.html
25-09-2021||India||How Mysore cavalrymen led the charge in battle of Haifa||For the average Indian, the Teen Murti Bhavan in New Delhi is the former residence of India’s first prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. The building, however, derives its name from the Teen Murti (three statues) memorial designed by British sculptor Leonard Jennings, located at the road junction in front of the building. The Teen Murti narrates the story of India’s triumph in the Battle of Haifa, which was then a part of the Ottoman Empire, on September 23, 1918, during World War 1. The three statues depict the cavalries of three Indian princely states, Jodhpur, Hyderabad and Mysore (now Mysuru). The battle was fought alongside the British 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade to defeat the Ottoman soldiers and liberate a strategically important port town. The battle took place around two months before the end of World War 1. During the battle, the cavalrymen from Mysore, handpicked by Maharaja of Mysore Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, attacked the town and captured more than 1,350 soldiers. Haifa was a strategically important location for the Allied Powers – led by France, Britain, Russia, Italy, Japan, and the United States – as it had a deep-water harbour and an airfield. Haifa became one of the main supply bases and arms depots, serving the Middle East forces during the war. A large naval depot was established at Haifa Bay. When the Ottoman Empire captured this town, they made sure it was defended heavily as it was a major resupply point. And when the allies began the Sinai and Palestine campaign, recapture of the Haifa was a priority. According to records, the 5th Cavalry Division was assigned the task of capturing Haifa. Since the defenders of the city were well-entrenched, the initial attacks were not successful, which is when the Mysore and Jodhpur Lancers were called in to finish the job. The Mysore Lancers were a personal force of the Mysore Maharaja. After he pledged troops for the war, the lancers were his first choice, said R Ashok Urs, who studied the force. “The king donated ₹50 lakh and 700 soldiers from his cavalry as his contribution to the war. He even wrote a letter to his men telling them that it was their chance to prove that they were the best fighting unit in the world,” said Urs. In October 1914, the Mysore regiment left Bengaluru (then Bangalore) for the Middle East. A convoy of 36 ships carried the troops from India to the Suez Canal. On September 23, 1918, the task in front of the cavalry seemed impossible. Situated between the Kishon River and the slopes of Mount Carmel, the city was well-defended and was supported by artillery guns. While the Jodhpur Lancers were tasked to capture these artillery positions, the Mysore Lancers were ordered to attack the town from the east and north. The Mysore Lancers moved into position by climbing up a steep track to capture and disable the guns. The Jodhpur Lancers launched the main mounted attack on the rear-guard of the German machine gunners, which blocked the 3.2km road leading to the town. This was followed by the final push by both units. At the end of the bloody battle, the two regiments captured 1,350 German and Ottoman prisoners, including two German officers, 35 Ottoman officers, 17 artillery guns, including four 4.2 guns, eight 77mm guns, four camel guns as well as a 6-inch naval gun, and 11 machine guns. Eight cavalrymen from the Mysore Lancers lost their lives in the battle, while 34 were wounded. The Mysore Lancers returned home in 1920 after participating in other campaigns of the British armies. Post-independence, the Lancers units were merged with the Indian Army’s 61 cavalry. While the identity of the Mysore Lancers was lost after the merger, the Indian Army still remembers the history of the unit that did the impossible in World War I. In 2017, during his tour of Israel, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Haifa and renamed the Teen Murti Chowk to Teen Murti Haifa Chowk on his return. “We remember with pride those Indian troops who, one hundred years ago in Haifa, displayed valour, courage and heroism in the face of seemingly impossible odds,” he said during his visit. In a quiet corner on Bengaluru’s JC Nagar, another stature bears witness to the heroic acts of these brave cavalrymen from Mysore. The statue, which is otherwise a spectator to the regular traffic jams at the junction, is decked once a year when families of the soldiers come together to pay their respects. “It is a shame that brave lancers of the Mysore don’t find a mention in the history textbooks, even though they were heroes,” remarked Urs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-mysore-cavalrymen-led-the-charge-in-battle-of-haifa-101632594563442.html
25-09-2021||India||Gauri Lankesh murder case trial likely to begin in October: Officials||The murder trial of journalist Gauri Lankesh is likely to begin in October, officers of the special investigation team said on Saturday on condition of anonymity, more than four years after she was gunned down in Bengaluru. A local court has directed prison authorities to relocate all accused in the case to Bengaluru to begin framing of charges. “In view of the accused being placed in different jails and one or the other accused not being produced, the framing of charge is being deferred on one or the other reason. Hence, the accused who are placed in Ballari, Tumkur, Mysuru and Shivammoga jail are ordered to be brought to the central prison, Parappana Agrahara, Bengaluru for the purpose of framing charges,” read an order issued by the principal sessions court in Bengaluru.Lankesh, a journalist and activist, was shot dead on the night of September 5, 2017, in front of her Rajarajeshwari Nagar home in Bengaluru.As many as 17 accused in the case -- including murder accused Parashuram Waghmore and main conspirator Amol Kale -- are lodged in different jails in Karnataka and Maharashtra.In October, the Supreme Court is expected to give a verdict in a petition filed by Kavitha Lankesh, Gauri Lankesh’s sister, challenging the dropping of charges under the Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act 2000 (KCOCA) against one of the accused, Mohan Nayak, in the murder conspiracy. In August, a bench led by justice AM Khanwilkar of the Supreme Court had issued notice to the Karnataka government on the petition filed by Kavitha Lankesh, in which she appealed against the Karnataka high court’s decision in April to quash charges of harbouring the murder accused against Nayak.KCOCA is a law enacted by the state in 2000 to combat organised crime and terrorism. The law was modelled on the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA). According to police, if charges under KCOCA are dropped against Nayak, it could set a precedence for charges to be dropped against the other accused in the case as well. During the investigation, the SIT found that an unnamed organisation that recruited right-wing activists from various Hindutva organisations was behind the murder. The investigation into the Lankesh murder conspiracy also unearthed a link between the murders of rationalists MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare and Narendra Dhabolkar. According to SIT officials, the trial of the Lankesh case will have an impact on the investigations into the murder of the other rationalists, which have not progressed. In the initial days of the investigation, the SIT found a connection between the murders of Lankesh and Kalburgi, who was killed on August 30, 2015. The four bullets and cartridges recovered from Lankesh’s house matched with the slugs and cartridges in Kalburgi’s murder. Forensic labs found that the bullets were fired from the same gun.The Maharashtra SIT, which is probing the murder of Pansare, found that the same gun (CHECK) was used in the Lankesh and Pansare murders. The link between the murders of Lankesh and Dabholkar, who was killed on August 20, 2013, emerged during the later stages of the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauri-lankesh-murder-case-trial-likely-to-begin-in-octoberofficials-101632594560803.html
25-09-2021||India||PM Modi at UN: Come, make vaccines in India||Mourning the loss of lives lost due to the global coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday reiterated India’s commitment to start giving vaccines to needy persons in other countries, even as he gave a clarion call to manufacturers to “Come, Make Vaccine in India”. “For the last one-and-a-half years, the whole world is facing the biggest pandemic in 100 years. I pay homage to all those who lost their lives in such a terrible pandemic and extend my condolences to the families,” Modi said, addressing the high-level 76th United Nations General Assembly session here. India’s vaccine delivery platform - COWIN, is providing digital support for hundreds of millions of vaccine doses in a single day, he said. India had stopped the export of COVID-19 vaccines after the second wave of the pandemic hit the country hard in April this year. On Monday, India said it will resume export of surplus COVID-19 vaccines in the fourth quarter of 2021 under the ‘‘Vaccine Maitri’‘ programme and to meet its commitment to the COVAX global pool. “India, which lives on Sewa Paramo Dharma (service is the main duty), is engaged in vaccination development and manufacturing despite limited resources. I want to inform UNGA that India has developed the world’s first DNA vaccine, which can be administered to all people above the age of 12 years,” Modi said at the UNGA. “Another mRNA vaccine is in its late stages of development. Scientists in India are also engaged in the development of a nasal vaccine for Corona. Realising its responsibility towards humanity, India has once again started giving vaccines to the needy of the world. I also invite vaccine manufacturers from all over the world today to- Come, Make Vaccine in India,” the prime minister said. According to Johns Hopkins university data, the deadly virus has so far infected 231,154,501 people and killed 4,737,927 globally.

25-09-2021||India||US President Biden backs India’s UNSC permanent seat, entry into NSG||US President Joe Biden has reiterated America’s support for india’s permanent membership on a reformed United Nations Security Council and its entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group during his first in-person bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House.President Biden, in his talks with Prime Minister Modi, applauded India’s “strong leadership” during its UN Security Council Presidency in August 2021, according to the US-India Joint Leaders’ Statement issued after their meeting in the White House on Friday.“In this context, President Biden also reiterated US support for India’s permanent membership on a reformed UN Security Council and for other countries who are important champions of multilateral cooperation and aspire to permanent seats on the UN Security Council,” it said.President Biden’s support provides a big boost to New Delhi’s push for the reform of the powerful UN organ as India has been at the forefront of efforts at the United Nations to push for an urgent long-pending reform of the Security Council, emphasising that it rightly deserves a place at the UN high table as a permanent member.India in June asserted that the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) on UN Security Council reforms can no longer be used as a smokescreen, as the General Assembly decided to roll over the IGN work to the next UNGA session and agreed to include an amendment proposed by the G4 nations of Brazil, Germany, India and Japan.At present, the UNSC comprises five permanent members and 10 non-permanent member countries which are elected for a two-year term by the General Assembly of the United Nations.The five permanent members are Russia, the UK, China, France and the United States and these countries can veto any substantive resolution. There has been growing demand to increase the number of permanent members to reflect the contemporary global reality.During his meeting with Prime Minister Modi, President Biden also reaffirmed US support for India’s entry to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the joint statement said.The NSG is a 48-member grouping which regulates global nuclear commerce.Ever since India applied for the membership of the NSG in May 2016, China has been insisting that only those countries which have signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) should be allowed to enter the organisation.India and Pakistan are not signatories of the NPT. After India’s application, Pakistan too has applied for the NSG membership in 2016.China maintains that there would be no discussion on India’s entry into the NSG before reaching a specific plan on non-NPT members’ participation in the elite grouping, as it declined to give a timeline to reach a consensus among member states on this issue.President Biden’s support to India’s permanent seat in the UNSC assumes significance as last month, State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at his daily news conference that the US values “working with India at the United Nations, including in the context this month of the Security Council.” Responding to a question on whether the Biden administration thinks that India should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Price said that the US supports building a consensus for a “modest” expansion of the Council for both permanent and non-permanent members, provided it does not diminish its effectiveness or its efficacy and does not alter or expand the veto.“We believe that a reformed Security Council that is representative, that is effective, and that is relevant is in the best interest of the United States and all of the UN member states,” Price had said.In their talks on Friday, Prime Minister Modi and President Biden also welcomed the extension of the Statement of Guiding Principles on Triangular Cooperation for Global Development to leverage the combined capacities of India and the US to address global development challenges around the world, particularly in the Indo-Pacific and Africa, the statement said.They renewed their close relationship and charted a new course to advance the partnership between the world’s largest democracies They also affirmed a clear vision that will guide the US-India relationship forward, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uspresident-biden-backs-india-s-unsc-permanent-seat-entry-into-nsg-101632593962027.html

25-09-2021||India||Jignesh Mevani, Kanhaiya Kumar to join Congress on September 28||Ahmedabad Gujarat Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani announced on Saturday that he would join the Congress, along with former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leader Kanhaiya Kumar, in New Delhi on September 28.Setting at rest speculations, Mevani, who is an independent Dalit MLA from Gujarat, told HT over telephone, “Yes, Kanhaiya and I are joining the Congress party in Delhi on September 28.”The confirmation from the youth leader came following hectic parleys with Gandhi for over a month, people familiar with the development said.Asked why he had decided to join the Congress, Mevani said, “This would be explained at a press conference on that day.” On reports that the youth leaders would join the Congress in the presence of party leader Rahul Gandhi, he said: “That would be the party’s decision.” In 2017, Mevani was elected as an Independent from a reserved Scheduled Caste seat of Vadgam in North Gujarat’s Banaskantha district. Held by the Congress party, the seat was vacated for him.The Gujarat Dalit leader had recently inaugurated the state’s largest 13,000-litre oxygen plant by any elected representative, after a struggle in Gujarat high court, where he sought a direction to the state government to allow legislators to use their discretionary MLA funds for Covid care. The Congress later joined him with a similar petition, prompting the state government to give the nod for all 182 MLAs.People close to Mevani claimed that for over a year, he was weighing several options, including joining the Aam Aadmi Party of which he was earlier a spokesperson. He was also exploring national fronts of like-minded youth leaders.He was reportedly in constant touch with Kumar and Patidar leader Hardik Patel, the people cited above added. Leader of Opposition in the Gujarat Assembly Paresh Dhanani said, “All like-minded leaders and people are welcome in the Congress fold. Jignesh and Kanhaiya are natural allies of our party and the party vacated the Vadgam seat and wholeheartedly backed Jignesh.” Gujarat BJP spokesperson Yamal Vyas said, “It doesn’t matter to us who joins any Opposition party. We are always prepared to fight any election on the strength of our development works for the people.” Kumar had joined the Communist Party of India (CPI) ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and had unsuccessfully contested from Begusarai in Bihar against Giriraj Singh of the BJP.According to political scientist Ghanshyam Shah, “The overall political situation in this country is so unfortunate that individuals like Kanhaiya and Jignesh are unable to survive alone. These two are young idealistic politicians who are caught in a bind. Keeping political ambition and simultaneously fighting for ideology create contradictions going further.

CJI Ramana was emphatic that laws must match with practical realities, and said it is the duty of the legislature and the executive to do the needful. “The Legislature needs to revisit the laws and reform them to suit the needs of time and people. I emphasize, our laws must match with our practical realities. The executive has to match these efforts by way of simplifying the corresponding rules. Most importantly, the executive and the legislature should function in unison in realising the constitutional aspirations. It is only then that the Judiciary would not be compelled to step in as a lawmaker and would only be left with the duty of applying and interpreting the same,” CJI Ramana said. Speaking at the inauguration of a new building of the Odisha State Legal Services Authority at Cuttack, justice Ramana said that the notion about courts making the law requires to be dispelled, but the executive and the legislature need to step up. “At the end of the day, it is the harmonious functioning of the three organs of the State (legislature, executive and judiciary) that can remove the procedural barriers to justice,” emphasised justice Ramana, adding that the legal framework needs to be drastically altered to make the justice delivery mechanism people friendly. There have been some recent instances when the tussle between the government and the Supreme Court over legislative exercise has come to fore. The top court had on September 7 and 15 lashed out at the Centre for re-enacting the very same provisions for the administration of tribunals that were struck down by the court in July. It had commented that the Union government has “no respect” for the judgments of the top court and is “bent upon not honouring” the orders of the Supreme Court. Similarly, the Centre had in August 2018 brought a constitutional amendment to negate the Supreme Court ruling that had come in March that year that apparently diluted the rigours of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Meanwhile, at the event, the CJI also talked about the hurdles for a common man to access the justice delivery system, lamenting that even after 74 years of independence, traditional and agrarian societies that have been following customary ways of life, still feel hesitant to approach the courts. “The practices, procedures, language and everything of our courts feels alien to them. Between the complex language of the acts and the process of justice delivery, the common man seems to lose control over the fate of his grievance. Often in this trajectory, the justice seeker feels like an outsider to the system,” he said. Justice Ramana called it a “harsh reality” that often the legal system fails to take into consideration the social realities and implications and the system is designed in such a way that by the time all the facts and law are churned in the court of law, much gets lost in the process. “People might be bringing their problems to the courts, but what remains at the end of a day is yet another ‘case’... Our constitutional aspirations shall never be achieved until the most vulnerable sections can enforce their rights,” said the CJI. The CJI mentioned the important role that legal services institutions play and commended justice Uday U Lalit, executive chairman of the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), for putting the processes of providing legal aid and facilitating access to justice to the poor and marginalized and by increasing legal awareness in a “power-drive mode”. “If we want to retain the faith of our people, we need to strengthen not only the judicial infrastructure, but we also need to boost our outreach programs as well... The power and strength of any justice delivery system is derived from the faith of the people in it. The Bar and Bench need to work in conjunction to affirm the faith that a citizen has in the justice delivery system,” said justice Ramana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cjireform-laws-to-cut-judicial-interventions-101632593120643.html
25-09-2021||India||Nations backing terror must know it’ll hurt them too: PM||WashingtonPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday cautioned the UN general assembly about countries with “regressive thinking” that are using terrorism as a “political tool”, and called for efforts to ensure that no country takes advantage of the “delicate situation” in Afghanistan for its own selfish interests.Modi flew to New York from Washington after holding his first bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden in the White House and attending his first in-person Quad Summit.Addressing the UN general assembly in Hindi, Prime Minister Modi called for the protection of oceans and ocean resources from the “race for expansion and exclusion”, saying they must be used and not abused and they are a lifeline of international trade. He did not name any country, but this appeared to be a reference to China’s increasing aggression in the Indo-Pacific region.He also warned the world body about its own diminishing relevance and credibility, reiterating a theme that he called a “crisis of confidence” in 2020. He said several questions are being raised about the UN and other global institutions, and mentioned specifically the issue of the origin of the Covid-19 epidemic, which the World Health Organization is widely held to have bungled under pressure from the Chinese, and the ease of Doing Business ranking, which has been suspended by the World Bank over data irregularities.An investigation has revealed that World Bank employees changed their data to boost China’s ranking in the 2018 and 2020 “Doing Business” report.Saturday’s speech was Modi’s fourth at the UN general assembly and came after successful bilateral meetings with US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga in Washington DC. He also participated in a historic first in-person summit of the Quad group of countries that are focused on protecting the Indo-Pacific from Chinese expansionism.Without naming Pakistan, the Prime Minister said there are “countries with regressive thinking that are using terrorism as a political tool; these countries must understand that terrorism is an equally big threat for them”. Pakistan’s continued support of terrorism also came up for discussion at Modi’s bilateral and Quad meetings in Washington DC.Modi did not respond to charges and allegations leveled by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan in his speech to the UN general assembly on Friday, when the Indian leader was in Washington. Khan railed against India, alleging, among other things, a “reign of terror” against Muslims. In an official response, Sneha Dubey, a first secretary at the Indian mission to UN, dismissed Khan’s remarks, saying Pakistan was “an arsonist disguising itself as a firefighter”.On Afghanistan, the Indian PM said that it was “absolutely essential to ensure that Afghanistan’s territory is not used to spread terrorism, and for terrorist attacks”. He added once again without naming any country but pointing to Pakistan: “We also need to be alert and ensure that no country tries to take advantage of the delicate situation there, and use it as a tool for its own selfish interests”. Pakistan has made no secret of its continued support for the Taliban and has openly flaunted its influence on the new dispensation in Kabul.Modi called upon the world community to extend help to the people of Afghanistan to ensure, among other things, the rights of women, children and the minorities are protected. “We must fulfil our duty by providing them with this help,” he said.Reminding the assembly that the oceans are a shared heritage, Modi said that “we must only use ocean resources and not abuse them”. And because they are also the lifeline of international trade, the world “must protect them from the race for expansion and exclusion”.“The international community must speak in one voice to strengthen a rule based world order,” he added.Modi did not name any country, but Chinese aggression in the region appeared to be the subject of his appeal and warning. Beijing has unilaterally extended claims into the Indo-Pacific and has shown no regard for rules and regulations to settle its many maritime disputes.The Prime Minister put the world body and the other global institutions under the scanner, citing a warning by Indian historical figure Chanakya against not taking timely action: “When the right action is not taken at the right time, then it is time itself that causes the action to fail.”If the United Nations wants to remain relevant, he further said, “it will need to improve its effectiveness and enhance its reliability. Today, all kinds of questions have been raised about the UN”. He went on to cite the climate crisis, Covid-19 pandemic and “the proxy war” going on in many parts of the world.Pointing to questions raised in regard to the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic and ease of Doing Business report, the Prime Minister said: “Institutions of global governance have damaged the credibility they had built, which was a result of decades of hard work. It is essential that we constantly strengthen the UN, in order to safeguard global order.”India has been campaigning for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council as part of a wider reform of the world body.The Prime Minister began his speech by updating the assembly members about India’s progress on “the path of integrated equitable development”. He said India had brought 360 million people into the banking system; extended health insurance coverage to over 500 million people, giving them free treatment and access to quality health services; and built 30 million homes for the homeless. India has also launched a campaign to bring clean drinking water to those who don’t have access to it and is trying to give clean land and home ownership titles.“When India grows, the world grows; when India reforms, the world transforms,” the Prime Minister said, as translated into English.Modi also detailed India’s battle against the Covid-19 pandemic and its own search for vaccines and contributions to the global effort. He told the member countries that India has decided to resume exporting vaccines and invited manufacturers to make vaccines in India.The Prime Minister also spoke about India’s efforts on battling the climate crisis and the ambitious plan to produce 450 gigawatts of renewable energy and turn India into a hydrogen hub.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nations-backing-terror-must-know-it-ll-hurt-them-too-pm-101632593120025.html
25-09-2021||India||‘What’s the harm?’: Farooq Abdullah says India must initiate talks with Taliban||The National Conference president and the former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah, on Saturday reiterated the need to initiate discourse with the Taliban in Afghanistan to protect India’s investment in the war-torn nation.He told news agency ANI that India has spent billions on “different projects” during the previous Ashraf Ghani-led dispensation in Afghanistan. “Taliban is in power in Afghanistan now…We should talk to the current Afghan regime. When we’ve invested so much in the country, what's the harm in keeping relations with them?” Abdullah was quoted as saying.Accepting that terrorism is a global issue, Abdullah said that all “powerful nations have to collectively make sure that no nation is weak” in order to ensure that all countries are safe.He also threw light on who began or has been fueling global terrorism in what appeared like an indirect dig at the US and its president Joe Biden for its recent withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan – which eventually emboldened the Taliban and paved the way for the group to take over the country once again after two decades.“There is no doubt that terrorism is eating the whole world. But who started terrorism? Who attacked Iraq?... Who bombed Libya despite the UN's warning? Which is the terrorist nation that destabilised the other nations,” the NC leader told ANI.This isn’t the first time that Abdullah has been vocal regarding the Taliban’s presence in Afghanistan and pushed the central government to clarify its stand on the group. In the past, he said that the Taliban should try to build “friendly relations” with every nation and hoped that the group would deliver “good governance and follow Islamic principles” in Afghanistan.Also Read | Farooq Abdullah didn't 'back' Taliban: Party says after his Afghanistan remark gets 'twisted'His remarks come on the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his three-day visit to the US, addressed the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).

From that time, India started to field young diplomats to deliver the Right of Reply to Pakistani leaders. The message is India does not need senior diplomats to take of Pakistan Prime Ministers at the UN. Young diplomats are enough, an analysis by news agency PTI said.Eenam Gambhir, 2016 and 2017In September 2016, then First Secretary in the Indian Mission to the UN Eenam Gambhir delivered India's Right of Reply to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's UN General Assembly address. "The world has not yet forgotten that the trail of that dastardly attack led all the way to Abbottabad in Pakistan. The land of Taxila, one of the greatest learning centres of ancient times, is now host to the Ivy League of terrorism. It attracts aspirants and apprentices from all over the world. The effect of its toxic curriculum is felt across the globe."In 2017 too, Gambhir replied to then Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. "In its short history, Pakistan has become a geography synonymous with terror. The quest for a land of pure has actually produced 'the land of pure terror'. Pakistan is now Terroristan... Its current state can be gauged from the fact that Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, a leader of the United Nations designated terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, is now sought to be legitimised as a leader of a political party."Vidisha Maitra, 2019In 2019, Vidisha Maitra's speech received applause as she addressed Imran Khan and 'Imran Khan Niazi' from the UN floor.

Gen A A K Niazi. A sordid fact that the Hon’ble Prime Minister of Bangladesh reminded this Assembly about earlier this afternoon," she said.Mijito Vinito, 2020Last year, Mijito Vinito said Pakistan's "only crowning glory" that Pakistan can show to the world is terrorism, ethnic cleansing, majoritarian fundamentalism and clandestine nuclear trade.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sneha-dubey-is-not-the-first-these-young-diplomats-took-on-pakistan-at-un-101632583284359.html

He also mentioned Bharat Biotech’s ongoing work in developing the first intranasal Covid-19 vaccine.In matters of Afghanistan, PM Modi emphasised on the need to ensure that the war-gripped nation’s land is not used for terrorism against other countries.

Yes, democracy has delivered. Today is the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, the proponent of 'Ekatma Manav Darshan', meaning integral humanism or the development journey taken together, the expansion from self to universe.3.     I would like to inform the UNGA that India has developed the world's first DNA vaccine. This can be administered to anyone above the age of 12. An mRNA vaccine is in the final stages of development.

We must protect them from the race for expansion. The international community must speak in one voice to strengthen a rule-based world order.9.     Countries with regressive thinking that are using terrorism as a political tool need to understand that terrorism is an equally big threat for them. It has to be ensured that Afghanistan isn't used to spread terrorism or launch terror attacks.10.We also need to ensure that no country tries to take advantage of the delicate situation in Afghanistan & use it for its own selfish interests. At this time, people of Afghanistan, women & children, minorities need help. We must fulfill our duties by providing them with help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-terrorism-pakistan-what-pm-modi-said-at-un-top-10-quotes-101632579956250.html

Watch full speech||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called on the world to make science-based rational and progressive thinking the basis of their development programmes, saying regressive thinking and extremism are increasingly threatening the world. Speaking at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly, PM Modi said that India is promoting experience-based learning in a bid to strengthen the science-based approach.He also took a veiled dig at Pakistan for using terrorism as a political tool. The prime minister warned that such countries have to understand that terrorism is an equally big threat to them. Pakistan has been long accused of supporting the Taliban militarily, financially and with intelligence. Several reports suggest that Pakistan has been meddling in the government formation in Afghanistan and wanted the Haqqani Network to play a major role. But the rise of the Afghan Taliban can also provide momentum to Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, a terrorist group banned in Pakistan. Also Read | At UNGA, PM Modi sends tough message to Pakistan, asks for collective voice against expansionismIn his about 22-minute long address, PM Modi also touched upon the ongoing political and humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, saying the world needs to ensure that the war-torn country is not used to spread terrorism.The prime minister wrapped up his speech by quoting Rabindranath Tagore and said efforts of all is required to bring peace and prosperity to the world.Here's PM Modi's full address at UN General Assembly:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-talks-about-covid-afghanistan-terrorism-at-unga-watch-full-speech-101632579058747.html
25-09-2021||India||‘Proactive synergy among armed forces needed’: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday called for greater synergy among the armed forces in future military strategies and responses. While addressing the graduates of the 59th National Defence College (NDC) course during their convocation in New Delhi, Singh noted that the government’s bold approach on border disputes and terrorism has made India stronger. “Threats to internal and external security will no longer be tolerated. Our actions in Balakot and Galwan are clear signals to all aggressors,” the minister said.Singh mentioned that the world is currently witnessing destabilizing implications of terror, including the threat posed by radical forces attempting to gain legitimacy. Now, there is a greater realisation amongst nations to come together and combat terrorism, he said. The NDC, he said, can play a key role in fostering a common understanding among friendly countries against terrorism and finding long-term solutions to deal with it.Highlighting the uncertainty of current geopolitics, specifically in reference to the latest developments in Afghanistan, Singh said, “The only certainty about evolving geopolitics is its uncertainty. Changes in state boundaries may not be as frequent today. However, the fast-transforming structure of states and the influence that external powers can have on it is clearly evident.” The minister also emphasised the need to draw lessons from the situation in Afghanistan.“Injustice, however powerful, cannot and will not defeat the collective power of the goodness that is inherent to human existence. This sentiment is evident from an increasing number of world capitals which have lent their voice in favour of liberalism, inclusivity and respect for international norms of governance and behaviour,” Singh said.The minister urged the NDC to focus more on new and fast-emerging areas such as cyber, space, artificial intelligence and big data analytics. “The world has witnessed a rapid transformation in all these areas of scientific knowledge. This technological progression must be accompanied by its military interpretation within the strategic community,” he said. In addition, he reiterated the government’s resolve to achieve ‘Atma Nirbharta’ in the defence sector, saying that “no country that aspires to develop as a knowledge-based economy can sustain such reliance on defence imports.”Singh highlighted the relevance of NDC’s guiding principles —knowledge, wisdom and statecraft— in the rapidly changing regional scenario. “Knowledge allows us to understand the historical, social, geopolitical and economic realities of a country and a region. Wisdom helps interpret this factual understanding to facilitate far-sighted decision-making. And, statecraft brings to bear the understanding of strategic thought and culture to everyday realities. It facilitates decision-making in pursuit of long-term interests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/proactive-synergy-among-armed-forces-needed-rajnath-singh-101632579859717.html

25-09-2021||India||HT This Day: September 26, 1966 — Over 300 dead, 700 injured in Japan typhoons||More than 300 Japanese were dead or missing today after two typhoons within 24 hours hit central and western Japan. Police headquarters, gathering casualty figures from damaged prefectures, listed 174 dead, with the figure mounting, and 140 missing. More than 700 were injured. More than 4,000 homes were destroyed and 40,000 suffered from flood damage. It was Japan’s worst typhoon disaster in six years. By this evening both typhoons Ida and Helen-had lost most of their fury and been reduced to tropical storms. Ida hit just south of Tokyo last night with 68-mile an hour winds, swung north over the length of Honshu, the main island, then burst into the Pacific again late today. Helen struck Shikoku island today with 55-mile an hour winds, passed across the narrow waist of Honshu just south of Osaka then pushed into the Japan Sea. It was expected to curve eastwards and hit northern Honshu or Hokkaido early tomorrow. Ida struck central Japan at high tide last night and caused most of the deaths and damage. In a night of howling winds and driving rains, thousands of Japanese fled from their flooded low-lying homes for safer ground. The typhoon caused serious damage at Tachikawa, U.S. Air Force base, 20 miles west of Tokyo, add AP, AFP. Hardest hit were the provinces of Shizuoka on the Pacific seaboard and Yamanashi, south-west and west of Tokyo. In Saiko, Yamanashi prefecture at the foothills of Mount Fuji, 23 villagers were killed and 40 others were missing when two villages were entombed in a massive landslide. Defence forces and police were engaged in frantic rescue operations, digging into the mountainous heaps of earth for survivors.Elsewhere in the basin area of Yamanashi, a number of landslides and floods were reported destroying houses and roads. President Radhakrishnan has sent a message of sympathy to the Emperor of Japan on the loss of life and property caused by typhoons there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-september-26-1966-over-300-dead-700-injured-in-japan-typhoons-101632577398584.html
25-09-2021||India||India rubbishes Imran Khan’s references to J&K, says Pakistan using terror as state policy||India has rubbished Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s criticism of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir at the UN General Assembly and said the neighbouring country has misused global forums to spread false propaganda while openly using terrorism as an instrument of state policy. As in recent years, India fielded a young woman diplomat – Sneha Dubey, the first secretary at the mission to the UN in New York – to exercise the right of reply to respond to allegations made by the Pakistani premier at the General Assembly. Dubey described Pakistan as “an arsonist disguising itself as a fire-fighter”. India said in its response that Khan’s recorded video message to the General Assembly was another attempt to tarnish the image of the UN by bringing in India’s internal matters and to “spew falsehoods on the world stage”. “Regrettably, this is not the first time the leader of Pakistan has misused platforms provided by the UN to propagate false and malicious propaganda against my country, and seeking in vain to divert the world’s attention from the sad state of his country where terrorists enjoy free pass while the lives of ordinary people, especially those belonging to the minority communities, are turned upside down,” Dubey said. Pakistan, she added, has been globally recognised as a country that is “openly supporting, training, financing and arming terrorists as a matter of state policy”, and holds the “ignoble record of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN Security Council”. UN member states are also aware that Pakistan has an “established history and policy of harbouring, aiding and actively supporting terrorists”. The world has not forgotten that the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks in the US, Osama Bin Laden, got shelter in Pakistan, and that “even today, Pakistan leadership glorify him as a ‘martyr’”, Dubey said. “Regrettably, even today we heard the leader of Pakistan trying to justify acts of terror...We keep hearing that Pakistan is a ‘victim of terrorism’. This is the country which is an arsonist disguising itself as a fire-fighter,” she said. Pakistan’s policy of nurturing “terrorists in their backyard in the hope that they will only harm their neighbours” has affected the region and the world, and it has even tried to “cover up sectarian violence in their country as acts of terror”, she added. India’s response reiterated that the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh “were, are and will always be an integral and inalienable part” of the country, and this includes “areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan”. Dubey said: “We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.” Outlining India’s position, Dubey said: “We desire normal relations with all our neighbours, including Pakistan. However, it is for Pakistan to work sincerely towards creating a conducive atmosphere, including by taking credible, verifiable and irreversible actions to not allow any territory under its control to be used for cross-border terrorism against India in any manner.” India’s response also referred to Pakistan’s “despicable record” of having executed a religious and cultural genocide against the people of Bangladesh, and said the minorities of Pakistan, including Sikhs, Hindus and Christians, live in “constant fear and state-sponsored suppression of their rights”. “Dissenting voices are muzzled daily and enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings are well documented,” Dubey said, adding that pluralism is “very difficult to understand for Pakistan which constitutionally prohibits its minorities from aspiring for high offices of the State”. In his recorded message to the General Assembly, Prime Minister Khan had spoken about issues such as the need for a global dialogue to counter Islamophobia and steps to promote inter-faith harmony, but a majority of his address was focused on India and Afghanistan. He alleged that the “worst and most pervasive form of Islamophobia now rules India” and criticised the BJP government, referring to what he said were incidents of mob lynching and a discriminatory citizenship law. Khan was particularly critical of the Indian government’s handling of the Jammu and Kashmir issue, and referred to “illegal and unilateral measures” imposed since August 2019, including the jailing of political leaders, clampdown on the internet and suppression of protests. Khan said: “Pakistan desires peace with India, as with all its neighbours. But sustainable peace in South Asia is contingent upon resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.” He said Pakistan had reaffirmed the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in the hope that it “would lead to a rethink of the strategy in Delhi”. He added, “Sadly, the BJP government has intensified repression in Kashmir and continues to vitiate the environment by these barbaric acts. The onus remains on India to create a conducive environment for meaningful and result-oriented engagement with Pakistan...It is also essential to prevent another conflict between Pakistan and India.” While speaking on Afghanistan, Khan referred to a fake news item that said former US president Ronald Reagan had compared Afghan mujahideen to the “founding fathers of the US”. His remarks that Pashtun people in Pakistan’s tribal belt had “strong sympathies” with the Afghan Taliban and that Afghan refugees have affinity with the Taliban were widely criticised on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rubbishes-imran-khan-s-references-to-j-k-says-pakistan-using-terror-as-state-policy-101632574757969.html

25-09-2021||India||Centre denies permission to Mamata for trip to Rome next month||The Centre has denied permission to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for a visit to Rome next month where she was scheduled to attend a world peace conference. “Central government denied permission for Didi’s Rome trip! Previously they’ve cancelled the permission of China trip too. We accepted that decision keeping international relations and India’s interests in mind. Now why Italy Modi ji? What is your problem with Bengal? Chi!” tweeted Debangshu Bhattacharya, a Trinamool Congress spokesperson.. In August this year, Banerjee was invited to attend a program by Macro Impagliazzo, the president of Community of Sant’Egidio, a Catholic association based in Rome. She was the only Indian invited to attend it. Pope Francis, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Grand Imam of Egypt’s Al-Alzhar HE Ahmad al-Tayyib among others are expected to attend the conference scheduled on October 6 and 7, 2021. “In the letter the Union ministry of external affairs has stated that the event is not commensurate in status for participation by chief minister of a state,” said another TMC leader. The TMC reacted sharply and mounted an attack on the Centre alleging that the BJP was playing vindictive politics. “This is nothing but vindictive politics. The BJP has suffered a humiliating defeat in the West Bengal elections and is now desperately trying to stop Mamata Banerjee and her growing popularity in whatever way they can. They can’t digest the defeat,” said Tapas Roy, TMC spokesperson. The TMC returned to power for the third consecutive time after a thumping victory in the assembly polls. Out of the 292 assembly seats where elections were held in March – April this year, the TMC won 213 seats. The BJP, which aimed to win more than 200 seats and form the government, could win only 77 seats. Even the invitation letter from Rome had congratulated the Trinamool Congress supremo for her “significant election” victory in the recently held assembly polls and “for the important work for social justice, for the development of your own country, and therefore, for peace, which you have been doing for over ten years now.” On September 15, the West Bengal chief minister along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi was listed in the Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of the year. Earlier in September 2016, the chief minister had attended the canonization of Mother Teresa at Vatican City. The then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj also attended it. In 2018, Banerjee had alleged that the Centre had denied her permission to visit Chicago to attend the world Hindu conference. The Centre had, however, refuted the allegations saying that it never received any request. “The TMC doesn’t know that such decisions are not taken by the Bharatiya Janata Party. India has a foreign policy and it is the ministry of external affairs which takes the call,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, vice president of BJP in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-denies-permission-to-mamata-for-trip-to-rome-next-month-101632573497938.html

25-09-2021||India||On Pakistan, Rajnath Singh says 'growing realisation' of what India has been saying||Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said that there has been a growing realisation of Pakistan’s support to “violent radical and terror groups.” Further, Singh also said that India has been voicing its concerns about the same for long. The minister made the remarks during his address to the convocation ceremony at the National Defence College (NDC).“There is growing realisation of what India has been voicing for long, with regard to the active support of Pakistan to violent radical and terror groups,” Singh said. He made the comments referring to the recent events in Afghanistan, where Taliban have taken over the reins following the withdrawal of US troops, with experts pointing towards the role of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).There is growing realisation of what India has been voicing for long, with regard to the active support of Pakistan to violent radical and terror groups: Raksha MantriCalling “uncertainty” as the only certainty in evolving geopolitics, Singh said that the recent events in Afghanistan have “reinforced the reality of our times.” “Changes in state boundaries may not be as frequent today. However, the fast-transforming structure of states and the influence that external powers can have on it is clearly evident. These events raise questions regarding the very role of power politics and the use of terrorism as a tool to change state structures and behaviour,” he added. The minister also called on the students to draw lessons from the events in Afghanistan to beyond what was felt in the region.Also read | Young Indian diplomat Sneha Dubey rips Pakistan apart at UN forum: Top 5 quotesSingh said that the world is witness to the destabilising effects of terrorism and the dangerous precedence of violent radical forces that are attempting to gain legitimacy. “The turmoil caused in the region has been brought about by aggressive designs and the active support to non-state players, by irresponsible states,” he added, without naming any particular country.While India is “totally committed” to peace and goodwill amongst all nations, it has also displayed its resolve that security threats would not be tolerated. “Our actions in Balakot and Galwan are clear signals to all aggressors, that any attempt to threaten our sovereignty will be given a swift and befitting response,” Singh said.The remarks from the defence minister also came as US Vice-President Kamala Harris earlier on Friday called upon Pakistan to act on terrorist groups operating from the country during her meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is in the US on an official visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-pakistan-rajnath-singh-says-growing-realisation-of-what-india-has-been-saying-101632565460071.html
25-09-2021||India||Feminist activist Kamla Bhasin passes away after prolonged battle with cancer||Renowned feminist activist Kamla Bhasin passed away in the early hours of Saturday after battling cancer. She was 75. Born in 1946 in Shahidanwaali village in Punjab (now in Pakistan), Bhasin’s appeal lay in her ability to talk to a roomful of “anybodys”, as she once said — diplomats, television audience, feminists or children. The underlying message — imparted to suit the audience listening to her — was always one of gender justice. After working with a rural non-governmental organisation called Seva Mandir based in Udaipur for four years, Bhasin joined the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in 1976 — a job she retired from in 2002. In 2004, she set up Sangat, a South Asian Feminist Network supported by Delhi-based feminist resource group Jagori that Bhasin set up with other feminists including Abha Bhaiya, Runu Chakravarty, Gauri Choudhury, Sheba Chhacchi, Manjari Dingwaney, and Joginder Panghaal in 1984. Through the 1980s and ’90s, Bhasin was part of key feminist struggles in the country, from the protests against dowry deaths to demonstrations that led to changes in the way rape and sexual assault were prosecuted in the country. She also contributed to the movement by creating booklets on feminism, patriarchy, violence, which were translated into multiple languages and formed the basis of Women’s Studies in several organisations. In the past decade, she also became associated with One Billion Rising, a movement started by Eve Ensler to end violence against women. Bhasin’s FAO work took her across South Asia where she forged lifelong friendships with other feminist activists. Part of Bhasin’s significant contribution to the feminist movement was to expand its scope beyond national boundaries — in doing so, Bhasin and other feminists from the Global South ensured that the movement also critiqued the military-nationalist complex that they identified as part of patriarchal oppression. Bhasin first visited Pakistan, after the Partition, in 1983 at the invitation of the Family Planning Association of Pakistan to help them structure their work on women’s empowerment. She met noted feminist lawyer Asma Jahangir (who passed away in 2018) and other activists of the Women’s Action Forum. Through the 1980s, Bhasin and Nighat Said Khan from Pakistan, among others, helped women across the border forge connections: they met for workshops, discussed pertinent issues and strategies of protest that drove the feminist movement in both countries, and importantly, exchanged and re-wrote songs that would often be sung in these protests. “Kamla was one of the pioneers of the women’s movement in not only India but also South Asia. She had the amazing ability to communicate through, verse, song, poetry, visuals, and texts, the toughest concepts like patriarchy, feminism, masculinity, peace, non-violence, development from the women’s point of view. She worked inter-generationally and a whole lot of young feminists have been inspired by her all over South Asia,” said Jaipur-based Kavita Srivastava, general secretary of the People’s Union of Civil Liberties, Rajasthan. Bhasin’s ability to forge and maintain connections across borders was aided by her ability to versify and story-tell. She soon gained a reputation as a song-writer, and children’s rhyme-maker. Bhasin’s feminism was activism in practice; how it was done was as important: women must meet, talk, sing and laugh with each other; the change, she once said in an interview to this writer, had to happen on the inside. One of the songs that Bhasin wrote in the late ’70s-early ’80s — “Tod tod kay bandhanon ko dekho bahnain aati hain...Ayengi, zulm mitaengi (breaking the shackles that hold them back, look, the women have risen… They will be the ones who end oppression)” — was inspired by popular Punjabi folklore and soon became a staple in most feminist gatherings. Bhasin also brought chants from feminist protests across the border. In an interview with the Hindustan Times in 2018, she recalled learning the slogan ‘‘Meri behane maange Azaadi” from Pakistani feminists. She later improvised the words, she said. “The words would change many times depending on what we were protesting against, discrimination on the basis of caste, injustice to tribals or violence against women,” Bhasin said. Bhasin’s rhymes —including the well-known Dhammak Dham, a children’s book brought out by UNICEF, and the poem, “Kyunki mein ladki hun mujhe padhna hai/Padhne ki mujhe manahi hai so padhna hai (It’s because I’m a girl, I want to study/ It’s because I’m not meant to study, I want to study)” — challenged gender stereotypes and norms. These rhymes were put to music and sold as audio cassettes and later, CDs by Jagori. “Looking back at my thirty-plus years in the women’s movement, what I recall instantly are Kamla’s songs. These songs made me feel anger at patriarchy and the joy of sisterhood. Kamla’s songs broke binaries. They were not about victimhood or agency. These were angry songs, sad songs, fun songs, and songs of passion. They showed us that we were not alone, that change was possible. Kamla was passionate, a real ‘zinda dil’,” said queer feminist activist Jaya Sharma. Bhasin’s appearance in Satyamev Jayate, a show on social issues hosted by Aamir Khan, where she talked about the need for a paradigm shift in understanding rape – not as the survivor’s loss of honour, but the perpetrator’s — was as significant as her path-breaking speech at the Beijing Women’s Conference in 1995: both were received with a standing ovation. Bhasin is survived by a son, Jeet, who is a person with a disability, and four siblings including former Rajasthan politician Bina Kak. She lost her daughter, Meeto Bhasin Malik, who died by suicide in 2006. Bhasin’s funeral will be held on the evening of September 25 at the Lodi Road crematorium in New Delhi.

This is to comply with the WHO standards and will be in the dd-mm-yy format, a PTI report said. As of now, the certificates only mention the age of the beneficiary based on the year of birth, apart from other details like the name, place of vaccination. The report said that this new feature is likely to be available from next week. "It has been decided that a new feature will be added to the CoWin under which those who are fully vaccinated and want to travel abroad will have the full date of birth on their vaccination certificates," an official source said to PTI. Also Read: ‘Not because of CoWIN’: RS Sharma on UK quarantine rule for IndiansThe UK government has recently revised its travel guideline in which it has recognised Serum Institute of India's Covishield but UK government officials expressed doubt over India's certification process. The move drew strong criticism from India, which pushed for the recognition of its vaccine and vaccine certificate through diplomatic channels. India also clarified that if the UK refuses to consider Indian travellers vaccinated with Covishield as fully inoculated, then the same will be done to UK travellers in India. British High Commissioners Alex Ellis met National Health Authority chairman RS Sharma and the outcome of the meeting was that Covishield, which is a formulation of Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, manufactured in India and also exported to the UK is not the problem. "We're clear Covishield is not a problem. The UK is open to travel and we're already seeing a lot of people going from India to the UK, be it tourists, business people or students," British High Commissioner Alex Ellis had said in a statement on Wednesday.What was the controversy over UK's treatment of Covishield?Though the UK government recognised Covishield, it did not accept the vaccine certification in India. In such a case, a fully vaccinated Indian will also have to be quarantined in the UK, like a non-vaccinated traveller. India termed this treatment as discriminatory. While both sides discussed the issue, RS Sharma reiterated that there was no problem with the certificate that India gives. "This is a completely baseless controversy raised by some people," RS Sharma said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-certificates-to-mention-date-of-birth-for-fully-vaccinated-people-travelling-abroad-101632559493900.html

The NCPCR said the bill legitimised child marriages in Rajasthan and it went against the centrally passed Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, that prohibited solemnisation of such unions. The central Act constituted child marriages by a male adult with a girl child as offence and whoever performed, conducted and abetted such weddings were liable to rigorous imprisonment and fines.Also read | Bhanwari Devi: Justice eluded her, but she stands resolute for othersAccording to the Act, every such marriage would be voidable at the option of the contraction party who was a child at the time of the marriage, the NCPCR further said.Demanding a withdrawal of the bills, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has said its passage was a black day for the Assembly.The Congress government has, however, defended the move stating it had only made “technical changes” to the existing legislation.Citing a Supreme Court ruling that mandated registration of all marriages, including those of minors, parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Kumar Dhariwal has said the bill would bring simplicity and transparency to the work. “If the district collector wants, he or she can still take action against child marriages...The bill says that after marriage, only registration is necessary. It does not imply that child marriage is valid,” he said in the Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncpcr-chief-writes-to-gehlot-on-rajasthan-child-marriage-bill-cites-central-act-101632556897342.html

Congress city unit president Raghvendra Choubey held a meeting on Friday for the preparations of the rally. Congress national secretary Rajesh Tiwari said, “Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi will sound the poll bugle from the city of Baba Kashi Vishwanath on October 9. She will expose the anti-people government.” Varanasi is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Parliamentary constituency and the electoral battle for its assembly segments is considered politically important.Tiwari asked party workers to make the rally a success and said efforts will be made to ensure maximum possible participation from people of every community. Ward level, city-level office bearers, All India Congress Committee (AICC), Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) members, frontal organisation office bearers will lead the efforts for making Priyanka’s rally a success, he added. Congress leader Ajai Rai said, “Party workers have started preparations for the rally to be held in Rohania area of Varanasi.” Congress leader Shailendra Singh claimed voters will give a befitting reply to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the upcoming election for allegedly failing to fulfil promises. The BJP on Friday announced that it will fight the elections under UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath in alliance with Apna Dal and Nishad Party.

25-09-2021||India||Sneha Dubey: Meet the IFS officer who gave fiery response to Imran Khan at UN||India again castigated Pakistan as it gave blistering retort to Prime Minister Imran Khan raking up the issue of Kashmir in his address to the UN General Assembly. India said in its response that Pakistan, where terrorists enjoy free pass, is an "arsonist" disguising itself as a "fire-fighter".Khan in his address spoke about the 2019 decision of India to abrogate Article 370 as well as the death of pro-Pakistan separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani. "The worst and most pervasive form of Islamophobia now rules India," Khan said in an address, delivered by video due to Covid precautions.In a sharp retort, first secretary Sneha Dubey said the entire world has suffered because of Pakistan's policies as the country nurtures terrorists in its backyard. The young diplomat, who has won praise globally, reiterated that the entire union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh "were, are and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India"."This includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation,” said Dubey.Who is this dynamic officer?Sneha Dubey is an Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer of 2012 batch and completed her schooling from Goa. She went to Pune Fergusson College for higher studies and finally to Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) for MPhil in international Studies.She nurtured a dream of becoming an IFS officer from the age of 12. She cleared the civil services examination in her first attempt in 2011. Dubey is an avid traveller and believes that as an IFS officer, she has received a great opportunity to represent her country. Dubey is the first person in her family to be working as a government servant; her father works in a multinational company, while her mother is a school teacher.Dubey's first appointment after being selected in the IFS was in the ministry of external affairs. In 2014, she went to Indian embassy in Madrid.Praise on social mediaAs soon as her fiery response at the United Nations appeared on social media, it went viral with many users hailing Dubey for her replies. Some marvelled at the "young age" at which she has been given this responsibility and the way she handled it.“What a way to shut the mouths of the jokers in Pakistan… every word was so carefully chosen... full of facts... brilliant," said a user on Twitter."Isn't she brilliant. I am impressed. So happy to see young guns do so well," said a user with Krushna.Isn't she brilliant. I am impressed. So happy to see young guns do so well.Excerpts from Sneha Dubey's speech at UN"This is also the country that still holds the despicable record in our region of having executed a religious and cultural genocide against the people of what is now Bangladesh. As we mark the 50th anniversary this year of that horrid event in history, there is not even an acknowledgment, much less accountability,” the young diplomat said.Watch the full video of Sneha Dubey's response at UNGAWith the international community marking this month the solemn occasion of the 20th anniversary of the “dastardly” 9/11 terror attacks, Dubey said the world has not forgotten that the "mastermind behind that dastardly event, Osama Bin Laden, got shelter in Pakistan. Even today, Pakistan leadership glorify him as a 'martyr'."Dubey said it is regrettable that this is not the first time the leader of Pakistan has "misused" platforms provided by the UN to "propagate false and malicious propaganda against my country, and seeking in vain to divert the world’s attention from the sad state of his country where terrorists enjoy free pass while the lives of ordinary people, especially those belonging to the minority communities, are turned upside down."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sneha-dubey-meet-the-ifs-officer-who-gave-fiery-response-to-imran-khan-at-un-101632551532881.html

Before we stop violence against women, we need to demolish innumerable religious, cultural, and linguistic practices that are considered normal. For example, words like ‘pati’ and ‘swami’ for husbands must go. These words mean ‘master’ or ‘owner’. In free India, an adult woman cannot — and should not — have an owner. There are many more similar words and expressions that demean and insult women.

Exercising the right of reply, the blistering retort was put forward at the UNGA session by India's first secretary Sneha Dubey, moments after Imran Khan raked up the Kashmir issue in his own address at the UN summit.Watch: India exercises its right of reply at the #UNGA  @AmbTSTirumurti @MEAIndia @harshvshringla pic.twitter.com/YGcs28fYYa“We keep hearing that Pakistan is a ‘victim of terrorism’. This is the country which is an arsonist disguising itself as a firefighter,” the young Indian diplomat said, slamming Pakistan's Imran Khan for highlighting the Kashmir issue in his speech. “While such statements deserve our collective contempt and sympathy for the mindset of the person who utters falsehood repeatedly, I am taking the floor to set the record straight,” Dubey said.Also Read | PM Modi set to address UNGA session today, focus on ‘pressing global challenges’Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan in his UNGA address spoke about India’s August 5, 2019 decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Indian constitution—which led to the bifurcation of Jammu & Kashmir into two Union territories—as well as the death of pro-Pakistan separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani.This was not the first time that Khan had tried to rake up the Kashmir issue in international forums. His attempts, however, have gained little to no traction so far from the global community and the UN member states, who maintain that Kashmir is a bilateral matter between the two countries.India, said Dubey, was exercising its right of reply to “one more attempt” by the Pakistani prime minister to “tarnish the image of this august forum by bringing in matters internal to my country”. She said that Khan was even going so far as to “spew falsehoods on the world stage”.Continuing the strong retort, India said that Pakistan, where terrorists get a free pass, is a country that nurtures such militancy “in their backyard in the hope that they will harm their neighbours”. “Our region, and in fact the entire world, has suffered because of their policies. On the other hand, they are trying to cover up sectarian violence in their country as acts of terror,” she added.Also Read | At UNGA, Imran Khan tries to paint Pakistan as a victim of US ungratefulnessDubey highlighted that under such a backdrop, where the entire global community has been under strict vigil Pakistan's role in sponsoring terrorism, its prime minister Imran Khan's comments on terrorism are uncalled for. In this context, the Indian diplomat said that the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh “were, are and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India.” “This includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-acts-like-a-firefighter-but-is-actually-the-arsonist-india-s-strong-retort-at-unga-101632537853094.html

Know more about the RSS thinker||September 25 is the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, who is regarded as one of the most prominent faces in the history of Indian politics. Upadhyaya was a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) thinker and co-founder of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), which is the forerunner of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Upadhyaya was born in 1916 in Nagla Chandrabhan village, now called Deendayal Dham, near the town of Farah in Uttar Pradesh's Mathura district. His father, Bhagwati Prasad Upadhyaya, was an astrologer while his mother was a homemaker.Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya lost his parents at an early age and was brought up by his maternal uncle. He attended high school in Sikar. Being regarded as a brilliant student, the Maharaja of Sikar gave Upadhyaya a gold medal, ₹250 for books and a monthly scholarship of ₹10.After passing his intermediate exams with distinction in Pilani, Upadhyaya left for Kanpur to pursue a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and joined the Sanatan Dharma College and graduated in 1939. He then joined St John's College in Agra to pursue a master’s course in English but could not appear for the examinations due to issues in his family.प्रखर राष्ट्रवादी, उत्कृष्ट संगठनकर्ता, एकात्म मानववाद और अंत्योदय के प्रणेता एवं हमारे पथ प्रदर्शक पंडित दीनदयाल उपाध्याय जी की जयंती पर शत्-शत् नमन। #SevaSamarpan pic.twitter.com/PfQLSwerEXHe first became associated with the RSS in 1937 while studying at Sanatan Dharma College.

He was the president of the BJS from 1967-68. He contested the Lok Sabha elections from the Jaunpur constituency in 1963 but lost.In the 1940s, Pandit Upadhyaya started the monthly Rashtra Dharma publication from Lucknow, for spreading Hindutva ideology. He also started a weekly magazine Panchjanya and a daily Swadesh from Lucknow itself. He came up with 'Integral humanism' which was adopted in 1965 as the official doctrine of the Jan Sangh.Pandit Upadhyaya died under mysterious circumstances in February 1968. His body was found near the Mughalsarai Junction railway station in Uttar Pradesh.Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a 63-feet tall statue of Pandit Upadhyaya while inaugurating the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Memorial Centre in Padao on the Varanasi-Chandauli border. The ‘pancha loha’ statue is the tallest statue of the BJP ideologue in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deendayal-upadhyaya-s-birth-anniversary-today-know-more-about-the-rss-thinker-101632535821187.html

25-09-2021||India||SC sets aside Madras HC order on 10% EWS quota||The Supreme Court on Friday said that the Union government does not need its approval to implement the 10% quota for students from economically weaker sections (EWS) in the All India Quota (AIQ) seats for post-graduate and undergraduate medical and dental courses, as indicated in a Madras High Court order. Separately, since the government’s July 29 decision introducing the 10% EWS quota along with 27% reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) in AIQ seats from the current academic session is already under challenge in the top court, it directed the Centre to file its response by October 6.The Court order was passed in two separate proceedings. In one, the Union government was before the court challenging an August 18 order by the Madras High Court which stopped it from proceeding with the 10% EWS reservation without prior approval from the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench which is looking into the legal validity of the 103rd amendment passed by Parliament that provides reservations for those belonging to EWS. In the other, the top court was considered four writ petitions questioning the constitutional validity of the July 29 order. One of the four also raised an interim prayer seeking a stay on the implementation of the order for this academic session.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) KM Nataraj appearing for the Union government submitted that the Madras High Court order was wrong and should be set aside. On the second set of petitions challenging the July 29 notification, he sought time to file a reply.The bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna allowed the Centre to respond to the four petitions by October 6 and agreed to consider on October 7 whether the proposed reservation must be implemented from this year onwards. Senior advocates Arvind Datar and Shyam Divan, representing doctors from across the country, claimed urgency as the results of National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) for undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) medical courses were expected soon.On the Madras high court order, the bench felt that the direction to the Centre for seeking prior approval of the top court was “unnecessary”. That Madras HC order was passed on a contempt petition moved by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the ruling party in Tamil Nadu, which was seeking implementation of an earlier order of the High Court passed on July 27, 2020 by which the Union government was directed to form a committee and prepare a plan for rolling out OBC quota in All India Quota seats from 2021-22.The HC in its August 18 decision held that no contempt was made out against Centre in the light of the July 29 notification issued by it. While noting that the 10% EWS was introduced under the 103rd Constitution (Amendment) Act 2019, which is being examined by a Constitution Bench of five judges of the Supreme Court, the HC order said, “The additional reservation provided for economically weaker sections in the notification of July 29, 2021 cannot be permitted, except with the approval of the Supreme Court in such regard.”The SC bench knocked off this direction of the HC order and said, “We are of the view that the High Court has transgressed the limits of its contempt jurisdiction by entering into areas alien to the consideration before it on whether there was any breach of its direction of July 27, 2020….The direction issued by the High Court is alien to the exercise of contempt jurisdiction and is accordingly set aside.”The top court clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on the July 29 notification which is still under consideration before it. ASG Nataraj told the Court that in the petitions challenging the OBC and EWS quota, the petitioners have also challenged the 103rd Constitution Amendment. He said, “Our July 29 notification of providing reservation is in terms of the 103rd Constitution Amendment Act. This Act has been referred to a Constitution Bench. Till a decision is taken, the EWS quota is to be held valid.”Datar appearing for some of the doctors in one of the petitions said, “Till the 103rd Amendment Act is set aside, we have to assume it is valid. But we are on its implementation. How do they justify classifying a person with annual income of ₹8 lakh as economically weaker section when the income tax exemption limit in the country is ₹five lakh. The determination of economically weaker category is legally flawed and unconstitutional, and we want the Government to tell us how they settled on this figure.”Divan appearing in another petition told the Court, “The Information Brochure for the PG medical exam was out in February this year and the date of examination was announced on July 13. The reservation was announced only on July 29. At least for this year, there ought not to be any reservation in AIQ seats as it sucks away 2500 seats from the general quota students.”Both Datar and Divan represented 35 doctors who have moved separate petitions against the move to reserve seats under AIQ, which already provides reservation for Scheduled Castes (15%), Scheduled Tribes (7.5%) and persons with disability (5%).The July 29 decision applies to 50% PG seats and 15% UG seats under All India Quota seats. The Government had said, “This decision would benefit every year nearly 1500 OBC students in MBBS and 2500 OBC students in PG and also around 550 EWS students in MBBS and around 1000 EWS students in PG.”“The impugned decision is manifestly arbitrary as it is in complete breach of Article 14 (right to equality), 15 (non-discrimination), 16 (equality of opportunity in public employment) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution of India and also bypasses ceiling of reservation of 50 per cent (fixed by SC in the 1992 Indra Sahwney case),” the petitions filed through advocates Malak Manish Bhatt and Charu Mathur said. Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and P Wilson appearing for DMK pointed out that the states also need to be heard in these petitions as the July 29 circular applies throughout the country with states being necessary stakeholders. The Court said it will consider this aspect on the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-sets-aside-madras-hc-order-on-10-ews-quota-101632528629128.html
25-09-2021||India||Delta sub-lineage spotted in 10% of Covid-19 samples||The Delta variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus is the most common in Delhi, although one the variant’s sub-lineages, the so-called AY.12 variant, is being seen in around 10% of the samples, according to a doctor at one of the four centres sequencing viral genomes in the Capital.The numbers present a stark difference from national data (excluding Delhi’s) which show that another Delta lineage, AY.4, was seen in 53% of the samples sequenced by India’s genomic sequencing consortium, INSACOG. The increase was driven by AY.4’s presence in Maharashtra and Kerala, states that together account for nearly 34% of all the samples sequenced in the country till August. Delhi’s data for August hasn’t been uploaded on the INSACOG dashboard. Data for September hasn’t been uploaded for any of the states.“In Delhi, we find Delta and its sub-lineages in almost 99% of the samples, with the other 1% being the Alpha variant. The Delta variant (B1.617.2) which caused the fourth wave in the city, is the most common, followed by the AY.12 variant, which accounts for about 10% of delta variant in August and early September,” said Dr Ekta Gupta, professor of virology at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, which is one of the four labs sequencing viral genomes in the city.Samples from Delhi are sequenced at ILBS, Lok Nayak Hospital, National Centre for Disease Control, and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.“Samples are collected from the district and hospitals and sent to the lab for genomic analysis. Maybe all of the labs are not receiving samples right now because the number of cases is very low in Delhi at the moment. However, from the report that we have received so far, there is no need to worry (about AY.12),” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department.Dr Gupta said Delhi is unlikely to see a surge of AY.12. “The antigen is more or less the same as the Delta variant that led to the huge surge in cases in April. A huge proportion of the population has already been exposed to delta, hence the similar AY.12 is unlikely to cause a surge in cases again in the city.”According to a September 20 bulletin from INSACOG: “AY.12 has lost some of the mutations seen in Delta parent lineage. No new mutations of concern are noted in the spike protein.”Mutations in the spike protein are of significance as the Sars-CoV-2 virus uses the protein to enter human cells. There were several mutations on the spike protein of the Delta variant that made it highly transmissible and increased its ability to evade immunity from a previous infection or the current vaccines.Despite no significant mutations on the spike protein, AY.12 is the second most commonly sequenced variant in Israel that is seeing a surge in cases despite over 60% of the population being vaccinated.The most common variant is AY.4 (48%); AY.12 was found in 17% samples, and the original Delta variant in 9%, according to data from outbreak.com that aggregates data from the global database GISAID. To be sure, Israel did not see a previous outbreak on account of Delta like India did.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-sub-lineage-spotted-in-10-of-covid-19-samples-101632527746919.html

25-09-2021||India||Delhi HC refuses to give interim relief to Google||The Delhi high court on Friday refused to grant interim relief to Google against further media leaks of “confidential” business information.The judge posted the matter for Monday after noting that the September 8 order of the CCI was not on record and she would need to read it before passing any orders.The court was hearing a plea by Google against the leak of sensitive information including revenue, payments made to partners, key agreements with phone makers, and market shares to the press from an ongoing investigation by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) into its agreements with phone companies using its Android OS.The company’s plea came after details of the investigation by CCI’s Director general (DG) were reported in some sections of the media. The reports said Google was guilty of abusing its dominant position with Android to stifle competition to its Play Store.Justice Rekha Palli expressed displeasure after a submission by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) N Venkatraman who said that one Google official wrote to the CCI Chairperson threatening legal action against “those who may have facilitated the unlawful release of the DG report”.“Advise your client. Just because he is there… he should know that if you want to function in a country, he has to know the law. I don’t appreciate this... If he felt so strongly, he should have addressed the letter to the registrar (of CCI),” Justice Palli told Google’s counsel while posting the matter for September 27.On Thursday, Google moved the high court seeking an ex-parte injunction directing CCI to ensure that there is no further publication of any part of the DG report.The plea sought that CCI write to all media outlets or others that claim to have a copy of the DG Report or have reported on it requesting them to return all copies and materials in relation to the case and to confirm to CCI that they have destroyed all written or electronic copies.Additionally, it has also sought that an order of September 8, passed by CCI rejecting Google’s plea to reconsider the confidentiality issue, be set aside.Opposing this plea, CCI, through ASG N Venkatraman, told the court that the plea was “misplaced”, and an attempt to “frustrate” and “thwart” the ongoing probe . The watchdog refuted all allegations of the leak and said that no evidence has been produced to show that CCI leaked the report.“There are accusations against a government body and there is not a word (in Google’s affidavit) showing when and how it was done... They are trying to frustrate the proceedings. If they are aggrieved, they should file a suit against (the media),” he said.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Google, said the leaks happened while the report was in CCI’s custody and that it is the body’s statutory duty to protect confidential information.“Please see the habitual defaulter. Everyday leakage is happening... Give a dog a bad name and hang him by selective leakage,” the senior lawyer said, urging the court to pass an order protecting his client from further prejudice.He contended that CCI order’s of September was passed without following the principles of natural justice.“Let them say till Monday they will not allow further leak,” said the senior counsel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-refuses-to-give-interim-relief-to-google-101632515164563.html
25-09-2021||India||Odisha TV journo chasing elephant story drowns as boat capsizes, 2 others critical||An operation to rescue a tusker trapped in the swirling waters of a flooded Mahanadi river near Cuttack ended in tragedy on Friday when a journalist of a local TV channel who was in a rescue boat of the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force drowned while his cameraman colleague is fighting for his life.Arindam Das and Prabhat Sinha, chief reporter and cameraman of popular TV channel OTV respectively, were rescued in a serious condition with 4 personnel of ODRAF after the inflatable dinghy they were in capsized in the strong current of water near the pillars of the barrage. Five ODRAF personnel along with the OTV journalists in the inflatable dinghy were attempting to go near a tusker that was trapped in the swirling waters of Mahanadi River when the boat capsized throwing all of them into the furious river.Das, who was rushed to SCB Medical College and Hospital soon after his rescue was declared brought dead, said Dr Bhubanananda Maharana, emergency officer of the hospital. “Prabhat Sinha, the cameraman and ODRAF personnel are in very serious condition. We are trying our best to save them,” said Dr Maharana. One ODRAF staff is still missing.Soon after the news of Das’s death poured in, a shocked Jagi Mangat Panda, managing director of OTV tweeted that it was a terrible loss. “He was a brave and ethical journalist who fearlessly chose to go after breaking news. This is a terrible loss despite taking safety precautions & ODRAF’s best efforts. Om Shanti,” she tweeted.Colleague and editor of OTV, Radha Madhav Mishra broke down while talking about the death of Das. “As reporters we often make on-the-spot risk assessment of doing particular news. Arindam has done several such reporting assignments including covering cyclones in the past in difficult circumstances. I am too shocked and sad to say anything more,” he said. Das left behind a 3-year-old son and wife.Hours before the tragedy, around 80 officials of Odisha forest department including two divisional forest officers had started a rescue operation of a sub-adult tusker, part of a 17-member herd from Sukasen forest of Athagarh to Chandaka elephant sanctuary, that was trapped in the floodwaters of Mahanadi. While 8 elephants managed to cross the river and reach Chandaka, 8 others moved towards Dhabaleswar leaving one elephant trapped in the middle of the river. “Though elephants are good swimmers, the level of water was a little too high for the elephant and it was stuck,” said Sangram Behera, assistant conservator of forest of Chandaka forest division.The rescue operation did not make much headway as the elephant was slowly wading its way through the waters to the banks returned back, probably scared by a large number of people who were watching it over the barrage. A team of 5 ODRAF personnel from its 6th Battalion then decided to go near the elephant to check its condition when the two reporters of OTV hopped into the boat.Bhubaneswar-Cuttack police commissioner Soumendra Priyadarshi said though the inflatable dinghies are easy to manoeuvre and not difficult to balance in floodwaters, the current seemed to be too strong. “Though the journalists and others in the boat were wearing lifejackets the force of the water was too strong for them. The journalists carrying video cameras and other reporting materials may have found it difficult to balance themselves in such a situation,” said Priyadarshi.Meanwhile, the elephant that was trapped in the floodwaters is yet to be rescued. It has, however, found itself a vantage position in the river where the water level is little less.Wildlife expert and member of Odisha State Biodiversity Board, Jayanta Mardaraj said though elephants are good swimmers and regularly cross rivers without any problem, the water current may have been the stumbling block. “After floodwaters were released from the Hirakud Reservoir over last week, Mahanadi has been in spate. The elephant may have become weak after standing in the water for over 9 hours. It needs food so as to regain its strength,” said Mardaraj.Several prominent people including Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan condoled Das’s death. “I’m deeply saddened at the passing of OTV journalist and my friend Arindam Das. He had created his own identity with his daring news reportage in challenging circumstances.

25-09-2021||India||Three injured in boiler blast at a chemical factory in Bengaluru||Three workers sustained injuries in a blast at a boiler unit in a chemical factory in Attibele area in Bengaluru rural district on Friday. The incident comes just a day after two people were killed in a suspected cracker explosion at a godown at a godown at New Thagaratpet near KR Market. According to officials of the department of fire and emergency services, the explosion was reported around 1 pm and four fire tenders were dispatched to the location to bring the fire under control. “This is not the first time such an incident has happened here. We had told them that chemical factory was causing skin rashes and other problems for the local residents,” Vinod, a resident told the media. “Even today after the blast, the area is covered with smoke from the factory fire. People are concerned,” he said. Bengaluru rural police have registered a complaint and have started investigation. Meanwhile, senior police officers probing the explosion which occurred at a godown on Thursday that killed 2 people said that even though crackers were found to be the reason behind the blast, police have sought a report from the Forensic Sciences Labs (FSL). “The intensity of the blast is much higher than that of the usual cracker blast. So, we have asked for a report of what explosive material was used in these crackers and how the intensity was so high,” said a senior officer .Officers also said that the FSL report will clarify what triggered the blast. Explaining the events that triggered the blast, police said that it took place when boxes were being unloaded. “Usually, they are distributed among retailers and the godown was used to temporarily store them. When Manohar one of the workers didn’t handle a package of crackers correctly, the explosion took place, in which a person standing nearby died as well,” said a police officer. The godown owner, identified as Ganesh Babu, who was arrested on Thursday for not having the required permission to store firecrackers have been booked under the Explosive Substances Act, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-injured-in-boiler-blast-at-a-chemical-factory-in-bengaluru-101632512650567.html

From October 1, districts which have lower than 1% positivity rate will have permission to operate cinema halls at 100% capacity. If it more than 1%, then 50% capacity will be allowed and places where it is more than 2%, these cinema halls will be shut,” chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said in Bengaluru on Friday. He shared this development after a meeting with Covid-19 experts, ministers and other officials in Bengaluru. Bommai said that the same parameters would be applied to pubs in the state as well but pregnant women will not be allowed due to health concerns. The chief minister also stated that students of classes 6 to 12 can now attend school five days a week. He also informed that the night curfew has been relaxed by one hour and will now be enforced from 10pm to 5 am. Bommai, however, said that separate guidelines will be issued for Dasara (how its spelt and pronounced in Karnataka)The borders, Bommai said, would be closely monitored to contain the possibility of infections spreading in Karnataka. The relaxations come at a time when Karnataka’s Covid-19 infection rate appears to have stabilised. However, the threat of the impending third wave of infections continues to loom large over the state. The state recorded 789 new infections on Friday, which takes its active case load to 13,306, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. The positivity rate stood at 0.58% while the case fatality rate continues to be on a high at 2.91%. The death toll rose to 37,706 with 23 more deaths, the health department said on Friday.

25-09-2021||India||Karnataka government has ‘best managed’ Covid in state, says minister||The Karnataka government has “best managed” the Covid-19 pandemic in the state, and opposition Congress which ruled for long, is to be blamed for any deaths due to lack of medical facilities like oxygen, Health Minister K Sudhakar said on Friday.The minister said this while replying to the debate on Covid-19 second wave in the assembly, amid protest by Congress members from the well of the House, forcing him to cut short and table his answer for record.“The opposition has targeted and criticised the government on its Covid management, but they are not ready to listen to my reply. People of the state are watching. They are indulging in hit and run politics, they don’t care for the people,” Sudhakar said.During his reply amid chaos due to sloganeering by Congress MLAs against the implementation of National Education Policy and demanding extension of the monsoon session, he alleged that Congress has no commitment or responsibility to fight against Covid, and only wants to indulge in politics.The Congress is aware that the Covid has been effectively managed in the state, he claimed, adding that “the whole world has praised India’s Covid control and management, also Karnataka has best managed the pandemic in the whole country. That’s the reason the opposition party doesn’t have the patience to listen to the answer,” the minister said.Initiating the debate, Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah on Thursday had targeted the BJP government for its handling of the second wave, and said the government got into a relaxed mode after the first wave.Bringing up the Chamarajanagar tragedy, pointing out that 36 patients had died at a state-run hospital due to lack of oxygen supply, he sought an explanation on why no action was taken against the officials concerned for the deaths.Hitting out at the Congress for criticising the government’s Covid management, the minister, during his reply, said “the sixty years of Congress rule was such that before the first wave, 725 ICU beds and ventilators were there, in one year we have got 3,887 of them. There were only 4,847 oxygenated beds, we have made about 28,400 such beds available.” The oxygen storage facility in the state before Covid was only 320 tons, he said. “If there has been any deaths in the state (due to lack of oxygen), Congress is to be directly blamed for it, it is because of their misrule,” the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-government-has-best-managed-covid-in-state-says-minister-101632511989770.html
25-09-2021||India||Ruckus over NEP ends 10-day Karnataka assembly session||The Karnataka legislative assembly witnessed a ruckus on Friday, the last day of the 10-day monsoon session, with the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) trading charges over the National Education Policy (NEP) and the opposition party demanding an extension of the session to discuss issues.The Congress accused the BJP of trying to saffronise education by imposing the NEP, calling it calling it an “RSS or Nagpur Education Policy.” “(The) New National Education Policy is an attempt to enable upper caste and RSS to enslave marginalised sections, Dalits & women. If we try to oppose, Speaker jumps to justify the government,” Siddaramaiah said. Siddaramaiah said that the assembly speaker who is supposed to be above politics and unbiased does not behave in this manner. “Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has no faith in democracy and parliamentary system of governance. The entire government, including CM, is behaving like a puppet of RSS and working on their orders. Speaker had adjourned the session indefinitely based on the direction by the government. The session was being held after 6 months and there were many issues to discuss. I had recommended the business advisory committee to call for a 20 days session as there were pressing issues concerning common man. Speaker had promised to consider the request but it was not extended,” he said. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said there is nothing wrong if the NEP is an RSS agenda, emphasising that the policy is meant for “nation building”. “The NEP is to prepare our children for the 21st century and to the global standards.”Bommai said, “The Congress believed in bringing an education policy based on slavery while the one by the BJP was of self-respect.” Stating that the country doesn’t want Macaulay’s education policy brought in by the English, he said, “It has been detrimental to our country and has not given enough opportunity for our children, especially from rural areas, to compete at the global level.”Karnataka has already announced to become the first state in the country to implement the NEP. Assembly speaker Vishweshawara Hegde Kageri was trying to rush members to finish speaking on issues to end the session at 1 pm, but the opposition demanded an extension. “The session has been called after six months. The government finished their business but we have to discuss the problems of the people,” leader of the opposition Siddaramaiah said. The Congress had demanded that the monsoon session from September 13-24 be extended by at least a week to discuss the problems the people of the state are facing. Siddaramaiah said there has to be a discussion on the NEP as the policy would impact the lives of children and future generations; he was shouted down by ruling party legislators.The Congress then stormed to the well of the House, chanting slogans against the BJP which was reciprocated by the ruling party, even as health minister Dr K Sudhakar tried to provide his responses to earlier discussions on Covid-19 in Karnataka. At least two BJP legislators rushed to the well of the House to protest against the government’s inaction on the reservation demand by Panchamasali, the largest sub-sect within the dominant Lingayat community. The Congress also boycotted the addressed by Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla to the joint session of the legislature. Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education lashed out at the Congress. “The Congress party politicised the issue of Covid management and made false allegations in the House yesterday but did not have the decorum to listen to the State government’s reply today, he said.The Congress party created ruckus in the House today because it did not have the courage to let the people of the State know the truth. This exposes the double standards of the Congress, “ the minister said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ruckus-over-nep-ends-10-day-karnataka-assembly-session-101632511690038.html

25-09-2021||India||UP woman teaches Malayalam to migrant workers’ kids in Kerala||A woman from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, who learnt Malayalam during her studies in Kerala, is now voluntarily teaching the language to children of migrant labourers at a special training centre in Kothamangalam in Ernakulam district.Arshi Salim (21), daughter of a woodwork designer, is teaching 40 children belonging to other states at the centre started by Samagra Siksha Kerala (SSK) during the pandemic. These children do not have access to online classes and face economic hardships because of job loss of their parents due to pandemic-induced recession.When SSK started 40 such centres to help children of migrant workers in Ernakulam, Arshi Salim chipped in. As a daughter of a migrant worker, she understands their pain.“My father came to Kerala when I was 9-year-old. Enrolled in a local school I was a mute spectator as the medium of instruction was Malayalam. One day, I mustered courage and approached the Malayalam teacher with a strange request -- I want to speak like a Malayali. The teacher was moved and started teaching me well,” she said. Arshi bagged distinction in both Malayalam papers in Class 10 examination.She is the eldest daughter of M Salim who has four children. “Life was really tough in initial days of pandemic. My father even thought of going back. But many people helped us and the SSK selected me as an educational volunteer to teach migrant children,” she said, adding she was really happy when she got the first salary of ₹6,000. Arshi is pursuing a computer course now after completing her Plus 2 in humanities with distinction. Not a trained teacher, she imparts basic lessons in all subjects other than maths. Most of her students are from the north-eastern states.“Malayalam is a beautiful language very close to Sanskirt but some words are really tongue-twisting. But once you learn it, the flow will come naturally. Now I read Malayalam novels and poems,” she said, adding that her first priority is to help ease burden of her father after assuming a permanent job. Arshi said she will pursue her studies after her siblings get basic education. “My idols are father of nation Mahathma Gandhi and former President A P J Abdul Kalam,” she said.Praising Arshi’s teaching skills, Biman Sarkar, a Class 8 student belonging to Manipur, said, “She is committed, and her flow in three languages (Hindi, English and Malayalam) impresses us. For us, it is easy to connect with her.” SSK co-ordinator Siju Jacob said, “Arshi is hard working and she handles children well. She takes teaching as a passion.” SSK, an overarching programme for school education, aims at ensuring equal opportunities for schooling and equitable learning outcomes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upwoman-teaches-malayalam-to-migrant-workers-kids-in-kerala-101632511089671.html

According to the official notification issued by the Assam government, an inquiry will be conducted under the chairmanship of a retired judge of the Gauhati high court. “The government in the home and political departments have decided to institute an inquiry into the circumstances leading to the death of two civilians and injury of several others including police personnel in the firing incident that took place at Dhalpur area in Sipajhar revenue circle, under Darrang district on September 23, 2021,” it stated. A 30-seconds video that went viral on social media on Thursday showed a group of policemen surrounding the local resident, who suddenly collapses to the ground due to an apparent gunshot, raining him with blows of the stick, with gunfire in the background. Later, the man is seen lying motionless on the ground with an apparent gunshot wound on his chest even as the photographer, later identified by police as Bijay Shankar Baniya, repeatedly kicks and jumps on the apparently lifeless body. Baniya was later arrested and sent to 14-days judicial custody. The visuals were tweeted by some state lawmakers and local residents, but their origin was not clear. HT couldn’t independently verify the visuals.Responding to the video on Friday, Sarma said he would take action against the police, but that a “holistic view” should be taken. “I think you cannot demean the government of Assam by some six to thirty second video...Take a holistic view. If any of our police people are involved, I am going to take action. No doubt on that. But how can 27000 acres of land can be encroached by two or three thousand families? People are dying for want of land. The landless people, people who are affected by floods. They are requesting government for land,” he said.The chief minister also said, “Since 1983, that area is known for killings. Otherwise, normally people do not encroach on temple land. I have seen encroachments all around. Peaceful eviction drive was agreed upon, but who instigated?”EXPERT COMMENTThe controversial eviction was first mooted when Sarma visited the area on June 7 and instructed the district administration to clear the area occupied by “illegal settlers” for a community farming project for young people hailing from the state’s indigenous communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-government-orders-judicial-probe-into-violence-that-left-two-dead-101632510071533.html
25-09-2021||India||Killed in Assam eviction drive, boy who went to collect Aadhaar card||Sheikh Farid wasn’t supposed to be there.The 12-year-old was on his way back home from the local post office on Thursday after collecting his Aadhaar card. He had left home in the morning, happy at the prospect of receiving his first identity card.The youngest of four siblings, Farid lived 2km from where government evictions had begun on Monday. The family hadn’t been served any eviction notice.By evening, his lifeless body laid outside the family’s house in Assam’s Darrang district, the Aadhaar card peeking out of his pocket. “My son was excited about getting his Aadhaar card. I have no idea how he got killed,” said Khalek Ali, his father.Farid was caught in the violence that broke out during a drive to evict allegedly illegal settlers near the Brahmaputra banks on Thursday afternoon, and was one of two people felled allegedly by police bullets. “When his body was brought home, there was a bullet injury on his right chest,” added Ali.Another 20 people, including 11 policemen, were injured in the clashes.Hasna Banu was one of them. The 15-year-old, whose family had also not received an eviction notice, heard the commotion on Thursday and went to see what was happening. In the evening, she was brought home unconscious with a broken left arm.“I went to see what was happening. Suddenly there was panic and people were fleeing. Someone hit my arm from behind and I fell unconscious. I was picked up some locals and brought home,” said the student of Class 7.Banu’s father, Sayeed Ali, a farmer, said they didn’t take her to the local hospital because they were afraid of the district administration. Instead, they wrapped the injured hand with cloth and applied some herbs and traditional medicine.The deaths of Farid and Mainul Haque – a 35-year-old resident who was seen chasing policemen before being apparently shot and collapsing to the ground – triggered widespread condemnation on Thursday and forced the government to set up a judicial probe.Visuals of the incident showed a government photographer repeatedly jumping and kicking the apparently lifeless body of Haque. The photographer, Bijay Shankar Baniya, was arrested on Thursday night.The eviction drive started on Monday in a remote region roughly spread over 25,595 acres – roughly five times the size of state capital Guwahati –a massive sandbar with the Brahmaputra on one side and several small distributaries crisscrossing the area. In the area, roads are scarce and so is electricity supply.Many of the residents are Bengali-speaking Muslims, who are mainly farmers and use motorcycles, horse-drawn carts or bullock carts, or ferry their produce to nearby markets. To reach Dholpur-3, where the violence occurred on Thursday, one has to cross a stream and walk for nearly an hour or hitch a hike on a motorbike to reach the area.On Friday, many evicted residents --- who took shelter in makeshift houses made of tin sheets, jute and bamboo -- contested the government’s claim that they were given adequate warning.Thirty-one-year old Ful Chand said he got the eviction notices on Wednesday evening – less than 24 hours before the government drive began. The vegetable vendor’s family collected their belongings and moved to a new location located nearly a kilometer away, across a small stream. They are now living in a cramped temporary shed made of tin-sheets.“We got the notice on Wednesday evening and by Thursday morning police and district officials had arrived to evict us. We managed to collect most of our belonging and shift to this new place. We haven’t cook any meals and are eating whatever is being provided by generous relatives living on other parts of Dholpur who haven’t been served eviction notices yet,” said Chand.The evictions started on Monday – when 800 families were removed – under the Assam government’s Garukhuti Project, which aims to remove encroachers from 25,595 acres of land on a massive sandbar close to the Brahmaputra river and start agricultural and other allied activities for indigenous people.But local residents said they had lived in the area for decades.Seventy -year-old Kot Banu’s family was among those evicted on Thursday. The family said it had lived in the village since 1985 but had no land documents.She said they had three plots at different locations in Dholpur-3. Many residents of the area have had to shift house several times as the rising waters of Brahmaputra and its distributaries erode their agriculture plots and houses.“Instead of forcing us to leave our houses at such short notice and resorting to violence, the government should have first allotted us some alternate land where we could have shifted. What was the hurry to remove us from a place that we have called home for decades?” questioned Sattar Ali, a smalltime businessman.The government, for its part, blamed a large mob for attacking the policemen with sticks and stones. A senior police official present at the scene said on condition of anonymity that there were nearly 4,000 people present at the eviction site and suddenly attacked the police party.“There was discussion with the residents and after assurances of alternate measures for those evicted, the crowd had started dispersing. But suddenly hundreds of them rushed at us with spears, sticks and machetes. We fired tear gas shells and rubber bullets, but when it didn’t deter them we had to start shooting to protect ourselves,” he said.Constable Apurba Ronghang, 35, who sustained head injuries, said a mob of 700-800 people attacked the police team. “I was hit on my head with a bamboo stick or wood from behind as I was trying to flee from the mob. My helmet got removed and I fell on the ground. But they kept on hitting me. Luckily, my colleagues were able to rescue me,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-many-recall-horror-of-eviction-drive-in-assam-101632509889813.html
25-09-2021||India||Odisha TV journalist dies, another critical, after boat to rescue elephant capsizes||BhubaneswarA journalist with a local TV channel died while his colleague was battling for life after an Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) boat, which was sent to rescue an elephant stranded in the swirling waters of the Mahanadi, overturned near Mundali bridge of Cuttack on Friday. Arindam Das, 40, the chief reporter of OTV, his cameraman colleague Prabhat Sinha, along with five personnel of the ODRAF were in the inflatable dinghy that capsized due to strong current of water near the pillars of Mundali barrage during the rescue operation. Das, who along with Sinha and four ODRAF personnel were rushed to SCB Medical College and Hospital, was declared brought dead, said Dr Bhubanananda Maharana, emergency officer of the hospital. “Prabhat Sinha, the cameraman, and an ODRAF personnel are in very serious condition. We are trying our best to save them,” said Dr Maharana, adding that three other ODRAF personnel were also in serious conditions. One ODRAF official is still missing. Additional Director General (law and order) RK Sharma, said an investigation into the boat tragedy will be done to find out the circumstances that led the dinghy to capsize and why journalists were allowed to board the boat.An ODRAF official, who was rescued from the river, said the boat was sucked into a whirlpool. “As the boat capsized, we tried to restore its position, but the water current was very strong. As the boat got sucked into the whirlpool, the motor stopped working. We tried to come out of the whirlpool but it was tough...,” he said.Jagi Mangat Panda, managing director of OTV, said it was a terrible loss. “He was a brave and ethical journalist who fearlessly chose to go after breaking news. This is a terrible loss despite taking safety precautions & ODRAF’s best efforts. Om Shanti,” she tweeted. Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national vice-president Baijayant Panda and National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) DG Satya Narayan Pradhan condoled the journalist’s death. While Patnaik said the death of Das was a huge loss for journalism, the Union minister said the journalist had created his own identity with his daring news reportage in challenging circumstances. “He was and is a hero. Deeply anguished by boat tragedy which, despite safety precautions, took life of OTV’s intrepid chief reporter Arindam Das while covering an ODRAF elephant rescue. Deepest condolences to his family & prayers for injured & missing,” tweeted Panda. Saying he was extremely disturbed and saddened by untimely death of Das, NDRF DG said: “Can’t forget he took my first TV interview at Mundali soon after I joined as NDRF DG. Always active and stayed in touch. May your soul be forever blessed dear Arindam.”Editor of OTV, Radha Madhav Mishra said, “As reporters we often take on-the-spot risk assessment of doing a particular story. Arindam has done several such reporting including covering cyclones in the past in difficult circumstances. I am too shocked and sad to say anything more.” Das is survived by his wife and a three-year-old son. Hours before the tragedy, a team of 80 forest officials from two forest divisions of Odisha launched a major operation to rescue the adult tusker that was trapped inside the swirling floodwaters of the Mahanadi on Friday morning, officials said. Assistant conservator of forest of Chandaka forest division, Sangram Mohanty, said the tusker, part of a 17-member herd that was trying to cross the river from Chandaka side to Banki late Thursday night, got swept by strong water current in the river that is now in spate. “All other elephants, except the tusker, could cross the river. The level of water was a little too high near the spot where the elephant got stuck. Though elephants are good swimmers it got tired and was looking for ways to get out,” said Mohanty. The rescue operation did not make much headway as the elephant that was slowly wading its way through the waters to the banks returned back, probably scared by a large number of people who were watching it over the barrage. A team of five ODRAF personnel from its 6th Battalion then decided to go near the elephant to herd it towards the shore when the two reporters of OTV hopped on the boat. Bhubaneswar-Cuttack police commissioner Soumendra Priyadarshi said though the inflatable dinghies are easy to manoeuvre and not difficult to balance in floodwaters, the current seemed to be too strong. “Though the journalists and others in the boat were wearing lifejackets, the force of the water was too strong for them. The journalists carrying video cameras and other reporting materials may have found it difficult to balance themselves in such a situation,” said Priyadarshi. Officials said on Friday locals found the tusker trumpeting and converged over the Mundali barrage as fire brigade personnel thought of ways to rescue the elephant. They first put a net around it to stop it from getting swept away and then planned to bring a crane to lift it out of the swirling waters.“A couple of hours later, the elephant slowly regained its strength and started wading through the water though the water level kept on rising covering half its body. It had almost reached the shore when it decided to turn back and head into the swirling waters again annoyed by hundreds of people shouting and taking pictures in the mobile camera. We tried telling people to move away, but nobody would listen to us,” said Mohanty.It was then that the ODRAF officials were requisitioned by the forest department and they arrived within 15 minutes. A former ODRAF commandant said the team should never have gone into water as its mandate is to save human beings not wildlife. “In disaster situation the first principle is ensure own safety first and then attempt to rescue as many people as possible. There was no need of rescuing elephants that are known to be good swimmers. The team should have waited instead of taking the boat in the swirling waters. There was also no need of taking journalists unless they can tell the team about the topography of the area,” said the former commandant.Another senior police official who has trained with ODRAF, said Friday’s operation was a complete botch up till the end. “Though ODRAF claims to be very good in rescue, I was appalled to see its personnel being rescued from the waters through rope ladder. The personnel must be totally drained out of any energy and disoriented after the boat capsized and they should have been winched up through a crane. One needs biceps of steel to climb up the ladder,” said the official.By late Friday evening, the elephant was still in the riverwater, but was in a better position. DFO of Chandaka wildlife division, Mohd Jamil said he expected the elephant to swim its way through once the water level receded a little bit. “The crowding and the constant hooting on the barrage is still troubling the animal,” he said.Noted conservationist and former member of National Board for Wildlife, Biswajit Mohanty said the the mishap could have been avoided had the forest officials been a little more patient. “I don’t know what the forest officials were thinking, but the idea of herding away an elephant is ridiculous. Elephants can swim and in this case it would have found its way had the crowd been driven away by the forest officials,” he said.Wildlife expert and member of Odisha State Biodiversity Board, Jayanta Mardaraj said the elephant may have been forced to take the new path as the riverbanks are now encroached. “The riverbank has been encroached by farmhouses and elephants are now taking longer routes to cross rivers. In my youth, I have seen elephants regularly crossing the river from Chandaka to Banki effortlessly. But encroachment on the riverbanks is a major issue which is playing havoc with the elephant corridors,” he said.In August this year, the National Green Tribunal had ordered the Odisha government to notify 14 elephant corridors in the state within the next two months culminating in the realisation of the long-standing demands of elephant conservationists for declaration of the same that would give legal sanctity to the elephant paths.Responding to a petition by wildlife conservationist Biswajit Mohanty the Eastern Zonal bench of the NGT said that the 14 corridors identified by Asian Nature Conservation Foundation, a non-profit public charitable trust involved in the conservation of Asian elephants in 13 of the 30 districts be notified within two weeks.Mohanty had alleged that that though the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) had submitted details of elephant corridors in Odisha to the forest and environment department in 2012 for identification of 14 corridors with a length of 420.8 kms and a width of 0.08 km to 4.6 kms, no action was being taken for their formal notification under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-tv-journalist-dies-another-critical-after-boat-to-rescue-elephant-capsizes-101632509531945.html
25-09-2021||India||‘We got notice just hours before the eviction drive,’ claim residents of Assam’s Dholpur||Thirty one-year-old Ful Chand and his family of eight members haven’t cooked any meals since Wednesday night when he along with most of his neighbours in Dholpur-3 village got a notice from the Darrang district administration of Assam to vacate their houses and move away. The vegetable vendor’s family had to collect all their belongings and move to a new location nearly a kilometre away across a small stream. They now live cramped inside a temporary shed made of tin-sheets waiting for a better place to shift to or a government rehabilitation deal allotting a new plot. “We got the notice on Wednesday evening and by Thursday morning police and district officials had arrived to evict us. We managed to collect most of our belonging and shift to this new place. We haven’t cooked any meals and are eating whatever is being provided by generous relatives living in other parts of Dholpur who haven’t been served eviction notices yet,” said Chand. Two civilians were killed and nearly 20 others including 11 policemen were injured in violence during Thursday’s drive to evict around 500 families residing on government land for decades. A similar drive was carried out on Monday in which 800 families residing in other parts of Dholpur were evicted. There was no violence on that day. The areas where the eviction drives are taking place are part of the Assam government’s Garukhuti Project, which aims to remove encroachers from 77,420 ‘bighas’ (25,595 acres) of land located on a massive sandbar close to the Brahmaputra river and start agricultural and other allied activities for indigenous youth there. This year’s state budget mentioned that the government plans to “develop this cluster as a beacon of resurgent Assam” and earmarked ₹9.6 crore for it. Residents of these areas mostly comprise of Bengali speaking Muslims many of whom are engaged in agriculture. Though they have been living in the area for decades, none of them possess any land documents. 70-year-old Kot Banu’s family was also among those evicted on Thursday. The family, which has been residing in the area since 1985 has no land documents and have no clear idea how much land they possess. She said they have three plots at different locations in Dholpur-3. Many residents of the area have shifted house several times as the rising waters of Brahmaputra and its distributaries that crisscross the sandbar erode away their agriculture plots and houses. “Instead of forcing us to leave our houses at such short notice and resorting to violence, the government should have first allotted us some alternate land where we could have shifted. What was the hurry to remove us from a place that we have called home for decades?” questioned Sattar Ali, a small-time businessman. “The Darrang district administration had earlier assured to provide us plots, but the areas where we were asked to relocate to get flooded during monsoon. How can we stay there? We want the government to relocate us somewhere better. The size of the plot doesn’t matter much, but it should be in a place where we can stay without worries,” he added. Despite repeated attempts Darrang deputy commissioner Prabhati Thaosen and BJP MLA Padma Hazarika, who has been made chairman of the Garukhuti Project and given a cabinet rank, didn’t respond to calls seeking details of the government’s proposed package for the evicted families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-got-notice-just-hours-before-the-eviction-drive-claim-residents-of-assam-s-dholpur-101632509169598.html
25-09-2021||India||Quad leaders agree to scale up collective strategic cooperation||Leaders of India, the United States, Japan, and Australia gathered on Friday for their first in-person summit as partners of the Quad alliance, promising to use their shared values as democracies to work on COVID-19 vaccines, infrastructure and technological cooperation.The meeting is likely to be watched closely in Beijing, which criticised the group as “doomed to fail”. The four leaders each offered brief comments ahead of their meeting, which was likely to last about two hours.“I am honoured to welcome the first in-person meeting of democratic partners, who share common values, coming together to take on key challenges of Covid, climate and emerging tech,” said US President Joe Biden, describing the grouping as a collective of nations that “know how get things done and are up to the challenge”.The US President said the Quad is cooperating on a host of issues to work on its commitment to build a free and open Indo-Pacific, and said a new Quad fellowship for students pursuing advanced STEM courses will now be rolled out.Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke next. “Our four countries first came together in 2004 to extend support in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami. Today, as the world grapples with Covid-19, we are meeting once again and working in the interest of humanity,” he said, while adding that the Quad vaccine initiative will greatly help countries in the Indo-Pacific.Modi said he looked forward to the Quad partners working together on issues spanning supply chains, global security, climate action and Covid-19 response.The Quad vaccine initiative, announced in March, involves manufacturing of a billion doses with the partners chipping in with funding and logistics.Australian PM Scott Morrison said the Quad grouping was about “demonstrating how democracies such as ours get things done”. “We are liberal democracies, which believe in a world order of freedom,” he said.His Japanese counterpart said the alliance demonstrates the strong solidarity between the four nations and their unwavering commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.The group is expected to announce several agreements aimed directly at China, including one to bolster supply chain security for semiconductors and to combat illegal fishing and boost maritime domain awareness, a senior US official said, according to Reuters. It will also roll out a 5G partnership and plans for monitoring climate change.The meeting comes just over a week after the United States, Britain and Australia announced an AUKUS security pact under which Australia will be provided with nuclear-powered submarines, a move that has been roundly denounced by Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-leaders-agree-to-scale-up-collective-strategic-cooperation-101632508928748.html
25-09-2021||India||BJP hits out at opposition over caste census, calls them nepotistic||Amid growing demands from Opposition parties for a nationwide caste census, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday hit back at them and asked how much representation they have given to different social groups in their organisations and among elected representatives.The development comes a day after the Union government, in its affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, termed the 2011 caste census “unusable” for any official purpose on account of grave “inaccuracies”, and asserted that it was also against collecting any information on castes or backward classes, other than Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), during the upcoming population census in 2022.At a press conference on Friday, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi criticised parties calling for a caste census and accused them of nepotism“Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav used to be called dharti putra (son of the soil) but he ended up promoting his son. Mayawati, addressed as behanji (sister) by her admirers, spoke of the deprived communities but only thought of her brother,” Trivedi said.He added that, unlike other parties that only speak about the empowerment of people from backward castes, the BJP has walked the talk on development for all. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policy is clear. He believes in Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas…and welfare measures have been extended to all irrespective of their castes,” he said.Asked about the government’s stand on the issue, he said it has taken a position on “technical grounds”.Apart from the opposition parties, BJP allies -- the Janata Dal (United) and Apna Dal -- too have been at the forefront of seeking caste-based enumeration.On August 23, an 11-member delegation led by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand caste-wise enumeration of OBCs in the 2021 census. Most advocates say that not knowing the numbers of the various OBC communities prevents the creation of targeted interventions for their welfare. However, in July, Nityanand Rai, the minister of state for home affairs, stated in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha that the Union government has decided as a matter of policy not to enumerate caste-wise populations other than SCs and STs in the census.A BSP leader who does not wished to be named said the BSP has appointed a leader coming from backward community Bhim Rajbhar as BSP state unit president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-hits-out-at-opposition-over-caste-census-calls-them-nepotistic-101632508571212.html
25-09-2021||India||Health ministry to celebrate 1 billion Covid vaccine doses in October||The Union health ministry is making plans to celebrate India administering 1 billion coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine doses by early October – a milestone that is likely to coincide with Narendra Modi completing 20 years as the head of a government over his 13 years as Gujarat chief minister and his second term as Prime Minister.People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that the ideas being floated among senior functionaries to mark the occasion include, among others, felicitating the 100 beneficiaries who took the shot, or those who participated in clinical trials.“India is conducting the largest vaccination drive in the world, and it will be a momentous occasion when we complete administering one billion vaccine shots which is more than the population of some countries. Therefore, it is only fitting to celebrate the occasion as several agencies and people across the country have worked really hard to make this happen,” one of the officials in the ministry said.“Several interesting ideas are being floated such as whether to felicitate Covid warriors, or first 100 beneficiaries who took the shot, or those having participated in clinical trials among others or all of them on the occasion,” a second government functionary said.With over 7.4 million doses administered on Friday, a total of 848 million vaccine doses have been administered across India, according health ministry data till Friday night. Of the roughly 940 million adults eligible for shots, nearly 67% (626.7 million people) have received at least the one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, and about 23.6% (221.5 million people) have got both jabs in the drive that started on January 16.An average of 9 million doses have been administered daily in the past five days. At this rate, India appears set to touch the 1 billion dose mark in the second week of October.Modi took over at Gujarat chief minister for the first time on October 7, 2001.“It is incidental that the PM will also be completing 20 years as the head of a government; even though the date for both the events may not exactly be the same. It is likely to be close but likely not the same date. As per the trends, one billion jabs should complete around second week of October,” added the second official quoted above.Last week, on September 17, India set a world vaccination record for a single day by delivering 25 million doses to mark Modi’s 71st birthday – an achievement that was hailed for the numbers hit but the Opposition questioned linking the boost in numbers with a personal milestone for the PM.There is also a possibility of a small event being held offline to commemorate the achievement.At pace of vaccination in the past five days (7.5 million doses /day), all Indian are likely to be fully vaccinated by early February. This would mean that, unless the daily rate is upped to 10.4 million daily doses, India will miss the December 31 target set by the Union government in a statement to the Supreme Court.So far, six states and Union territories have completed administering at least the first dose to all adults – Lakshadweep, Chandigarh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and Sikkim. Four states and Union territories have administered first dose to at least 90% of the adults – Kerala, Uttarakhand, Ladakh, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.At the bottom end of the spectrum, lie Jharkhand (first doses administered to 52.9% adults), West Bengal (53.7% adults having received a single dose) and Uttar Pradesh (55.2%).To be sure, the vaccination rate has increased manifold over the past five months – from an average of 1.9 million doses a day in May, when the drive was opened up for all adults to 8.14 million doses a day in September.“We have reached the stage where government is able to provide states the volume of doses they demand based on their vaccine administration capacity. No state can now be seen complaining that they were in a position to administer more vaccine doses than what they were administering in a single day but were not doing that because of the short vaccine supply from the centre,” said the first official cited above.Experts say government would need to focus on states that are lagging to be able to meet the year-end target.“We have seen north and central Indian states exhibit vaccine hesitancy even for traditional vaccines, which needs to be dealt with for the vaccine coverage to expand as per requirement. However, there is no denying that the overall vaccination rate has seen significant improvement which is a good sign,” said Chandrakant Lahariya, senior public health and vaccine expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-to-celebrate-1-billion-covid-vaccine-doses-in-october-101632508029567.html
25-09-2021||India||Disruptions in house not good: Birla as Karnataka Cong boycotts special address||New Delhi: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Friday said that planned disruptions are not good in parliamentary democracy after the Congress legislators decided to boycott his special address to a joint session of the Karnataka legislature. State Congress president DK Shivakumar questioned, “Why the Speaker wants to talk about democracy in Karnataka assembly? If he wants to talk about democracy, he should do it in Parliament.” Shivakumar also claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government set a “bad precedent” by calling the Lok Sabha Speaker to the assembly. “Vidhana Soudha (the assembly) shouldn’t have been used for a political angle,” he said and justified the boycott saying except the President and governor, no one else has ever addressed the assembly. Birla, during his speech, remarked that “disruption of proceedings in a planned manner is not good anywhere” and maintained that “courtesy and mutual respect must be maintained during protests.” Addressing the issue of disruption of proceedings and disorderly conduct, Birla said, “As public representatives are directly connected to the people and understand their wants, issues and difficulties, their active participation in the legislative process is required. For this, they must ensure that the valuable time of the Assembly is not wasted due to disruption.” The Speaker’s comments were also seen by many in the backdrop of the continuous protests during the monsoon session of Parliament. The Lok Sabha could use only 23% of its time due to disruptions in that session. Birla said once again there is a need for wide-ranging discussions to maintain discipline, decorum and dignity in state legislatures. While he maintained that “differences and debates are the defining feature of our democratic system”, he emphasised that protest must be dignified and remain within parliamentary norms. Birla was addressing a special joint session of the Karnataka legislature on the last day of the monsoon session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/planned-disruptions-not-good-in-parliamentary-democracy-om-birla-as-karnataka-congress-boycotts-special-address-101632507669240.html
25-09-2021||India||Govt inks ₹22k-cr deal with Airbus for 56 jets||The Union defence ministry on Friday announced that it has signed a ₹22,000 crore contract with Airbus Defence and Space for 56 C-295 medium transport aircraft to modernise the India Air Force’s transport fleet, with the development coming a fortnight after India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) cleared the purchase to give push to the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India campaign).The C-295s will replace the IAF’s fleet of ageing Avro-748 planes that entered service in the early 1960s. Airbus Defence and Space and Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) will jointly execute the programme under which Airbus will deliver the first 16 aircraft in flyaway condition from Spain while TASL will assemble the rest in India. IAF will become the 35th C-295 operator worldwide.“The aircraft is capable of operating from semi-prepared strips and has a rear ramp door for quick reaction and para-dropping of troops and cargo. It will give a major boost to the tactical airlift capability of IAF, especially in the northern and north-eastern sectors and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,” the defence ministry said in a statement.The C-295 can carry up to nine tonne of payload or 71 personnel (or 50 paratroopers) and has a maximum speed of 480 kmph. It has a light footprint and can operate from short or unprepared airstrips.The Avro replacement project was in the works for almost a decade. The defence acquisition council -- India’s apex defence procurement body -- accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) to replace the Avro planes with 56 new aircraft in 2012. Under India’s defence procurement rules, AoN by the council is the first step towards buying military hardware.“The C-295 is a good aircraft. I hope we start manufacturing it in India soon to boost Atmanirbhar Bharat. The Avro was overdue for replacement,” said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal PV Naik (retd).The first 16 aircraft will be delivered to IAF in flyaway condition between September 2023 and September 2025, and the remaining 40 will be inducted by September 2031.Airbus Defence and Space and TASL are yet to announce where the aircraft will be assembled in India.“More than 100 locations across the country have been looked at and evaluated over the years. We have looked at aspects such as length of the airstrip, availability of infrastructure, social indicators and weather. A decision has not yet been made,” TASL CEO Sukaran Singh said at a media briefing after the contract was signed.The final assembly line in India will have a capacity of 12 aircraft per year. After the contract has been fully executed, subsequent aircraft manufactured in India can be exported to countries cleared by the government, the defence ministry said in its statement.Export opportunities could be there, but the current priority is to execute the project to the satisfaction of IAF, said Jean-Brice Dumont, executive vice president, military aircraft, Airbus Defence and Space. “Export potential is there, but we don’t want to divert attention from this project (for 56 C-295s),” Dumont said. The project is expected to boost India’s aerospace ecosystem and generate 15,000 skilled and 10,000 indirect jobs in the country.“It is the first ‘Make in India’ aerospace programme in the private sector involving the full development of a complete industrial ecosystem; from the manufacture to assembly, test and qualification, to delivery and maintenance of the complete life cycle of the aircraft,” Airbus Defence and Space and TASL said in a joint release.This is the first time that an Indian private company will be manufacturing a military aircraft in India. “This endeavour demonstrates TASL’s capabilities as a defence manufacturer to build globally competitive complex platforms in India,” Singh said.While the C-295s are meant to replace the Avro-748 planes, the new aircraft will also be suitable for demanding roles that the AN-32 currently undertakes.The contract will also have an offset clause. India’s offset policy stipulates that in all big-ticket capital purchases, the foreign vendor has to invest at least 30% of the value of the purchase in the country to boost indigenous capabilities. Airbus Defence and Space will discharge its offset obligations through direct purchase of eligible products and services from Indian offset partners, officials said.“The clearance of the joint project between Airbus Defence and Tata Advanced Systems is a great step forward in the opening up of aviation and avionics projects in India…It will create a domestic supply chain capability to international standards, which has never been undertaken before,” Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-ministry-inks-22-000-cr-deal-with-airbus-for-56-c-295-medium-transport-aircraft-101632507013413.html

25-09-2021||India||Changing gears: Three phases of the farm law protests||“It’s simple. Let me say this clearly, just smash their heads. Can you do it?” The chilling instruction, heard in a viral video on the morning of August 29 was from Ayush Sinha, an official in Haryana’s Karnal area, to policemen in full riot gear. It was to be a spark for a political firestorm.The orders left “no doubt” in the mind of farmers resisting the Modi government’s three liberalising farm laws since 2020 that the government wanted them “killed”, one farmer said.The controversial instructions not only ignited a fierce standoff between thousands of farmers and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Haryana government, but also served as a springboard for a full-scale political war against the ruling party by the mostly landed peasantry who are now preparing to fight the entire gamut of the Union government’s economic policies.And it marked the third phase of the farm protests.Seven days later, on September 5, Rakesh Tikait, the influential 59-year-old farm union leader leading the ongoing uprising of farmers against the three farm laws, announced an all-out campaign against the BJP, especially its economic agenda pivoted towards second-generation reforms and privatisation in Asia’s third largest economy.“The government of Modi has put India on sale. We will not allow India to be sold off,” he told tens of thousands of cultivators at a rally in Muzaffarnagar, a sugarcane belt in the politically important state of Uttar Pradesh which is governed by the BJP and goes to polls early next year.It was in Muzzaffarnagar that the political objective of the farm protest – dislodging the BJP – was officially articulated for the first time.Days later, Tikait and others led a similar march of cultivators into Karnal and laid siege to the mini secretariat there, only relenting after the government agreed to a probe. Sinha, the subdivisional magistrate, has since been transferred and claimed that the video showing his instruction to the policemen was doctored. Last week, the state government, too,in proceedings in the Punjab & Haryana high court, blamed the agriculturists for the violence .Muzzaffarnagar and Karnal marked a new phase in the farm agitation, which has waxed and waned over the last 10 months and took a firm footing only after a series of moves by leaders of the agitation, an analysis of their movement, agendas and speeches of farm leaders show.BEFORE THE LAWSThe first protests began well before the government brought three ordinances – laws promulgated when Parliament is not in session – in June 2020, which were later signed into regular laws in September 2020.Cultivators in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra were the first to protest against their sliding fortunes, as farm-gate prices steadily crashed in a slew of food items, in 2015 onwards. By 2016, poor returns began hurting cultivators bad.Farmers blame several reasons for low prices. But one came abruptly, and hit them the hardest at the time, they say.“When demonetisation happened, traders began saying they couldn’t buy too much because they did not have cash to pay. This led to a price crash,” Sukhchain Singh, a farmer, said in Hindi. He was talking about the situation at the time in the Shahabad agricultural market, one of the largest in Haryana. Singh has been a participant in the ongoing protests.Demonetisation refers to the Modi government’s 2016 decision to withdraw high-value banknotes from India’s monetary system, accounting for about 85% of total currency in value terms.The government has said demonetisation hadn’t shocked the farm economy, citing food output as evidence. Official estimates of total foodgrain production in 2016-17 stood at an all-time high of 272 million tonnes, 8% higher than the 251.6 million tonnes in the previous year.Singh said the cancelling of currency notes, which spelt chaos, didn’t affect farm output that summer because farmers had met cultivation costs through informal loans to be paid later.A BJP official who oversees economic affairs of the party, Gopal Aggrawal, rejected claims of demonetisation affecting the farm economy. He said there were initial shocks to the informal manufacturing sector, but the move to withdraw high-value currency was necessary to formalise the economy.“We agree farmers have problems,” Agrawal said. “But farm laws are not the cause of problems farmers are facing. The solution needs big changes. It is our conviction the farm-reform laws are the only solution. Farmers haven’t been able to show any alternative.”In June 2017, five farmers among a large group protesting low prices of milk and vegetables were killed in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, when police opened fire as the unrest turned violent. Protests soon spilled over to Maharashtra, where dairy farmers dumped milk on roads, rather than sell at throwaway prices.This first phase quickly coalesced into an organised agitation, when a platform of over 200 farmer unions set up in 2017, the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), called a big rally in Delhi on November 26-27. The demands were still about better prices and a farm-loan waiver.And there things stood for a few uneasy years.‘BLACK’ LEGISLATIONThen, the government brought in three farm laws. One law was meant to allow big businesses and supermarkets to buy produce from farmers outside heavily regulated state-backed wholesale markets.A second law would allow private traders to stockpile large quantities of food for future sales. A third law laid down a framework for contract farming.Allowing food businesses to stock large quantities is aimed at spurring private investors to build modern silos, according to the government.“If one looks at the overall public resources being spent on agriculture, one is amazed that three-fourths of the resources go primarily as subsidies on things like fertiliser, power and irrigation, while only one-fourth goes into investment,” said economist Uma Kapila, editor of the series ‘Indian Economy Since Independence’.Farmers in Punjab, who benefit heavily from the state-backed markets where government buys wheat and rice at assured prices, were weary. The move sought to change a system that had benefited them for long because the government was an assured buyer.With the state playing an outsize role as buyer of crops and provider of big subsidies, there were little of growth-enhancing investments, either public or private.A concrete step to launch a sustained agitation came when, under the aegis of the AIKSCC, several farmer leaders from Punjab and Haryana met at the Gurdwara Rakab Ganj, a Sikh temple in Delhi, led by influential farm union leaders such as Balbir Singh Rajewal and Gurnam Singh Chaduni in October 2020.“Instead of giving us relief, the government gifted us three anti-farmer laws,” said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, a farm leader.These changes, however, riled farmers, who say the new laws will expose them to exploitation by big buyers. In Bihar, they argue, where farm trade is entirely in private hands, some similar reforms have already ruined farmers.Bihar’s agricultural reforms of 2006, which saw the state liberalise agricultural trade by abolishing state-regulated markets, resulted in better prices for produce such as rice, wheat and maize, but the changes also brought greater price volatility, ultimately hurting farm growth, a study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) showed last year.The government has stated that these new laws would boost capital investment in the farm sector.More than 100,000 farmers have been camping at key border points of Delhi since November last year, which marked the first phase of the protests.TURNING POINTA turning point came on a cold night of January 28 this year, when news began to spread that authorities in Uttar Pradesh would descend on Ghazipur, a protest camp on Delhi’s border with UP, to vacate the site.The Ghazipur site was under the supervision of Rakesh Tikait, the son of legendary farm leader Mahendra SIngh Tikait who faced off with the then Congress government in 1986.Tikait cried before TV cameras, saying he would rather die than give in, which steeled the resolve of the Jats, a landed agrarian community that had benefited from the Green Revolution of the 1970s. Overnight, groups of young Jat men assembled at the Bharatiya Kisan Union headquarters in Sisauli village, and marched to the Ghazipur protest site. It brought the Jats of western UP, who were until then lukewarm to the agitation, into the protest fold. That set off the second phase of the protest, which appeared to be losing momentum -- the protest camps around Delhi continue to thrive, though -- till Sinha’s comments and events in Karnal and Muzzaffarnagar galvanised the farmers.They are now targeting the very core of the government’s economic agenda because they see a common threat: privatisation. “This government wants to sell off India. We have to give them ‘vote ka chote’ (hurt them with votes),” Tikait said in the September 5 rally.“After attending a protest which the police quelled with force, a farmer had died. These strong-arm tactics are worsening the situation on the ground. The farmers see this as oppression, which it is,” said Sudhir Panwar, a professor with Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/changing-gears-three-phases-of-the-farm-law-protests-101632505508450.html
25-09-2021||India||Rahul and Priyanka meet Pilot amid Raj rumblings||In a signal that the Congress has started moving fast to resolve the Rajasthan tangle, party leader Rahul Gandhi met the state’s former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot in New Delhi on Friday, their second meeting in a week.While both sides remained tight-lipped about what transpired during the meeting, two senior Congress leaders maintained that it was a “good meeting” and went in the “right direction”.“We expect the effects of the meeting can be visible in next few days,” said a senior Congress functionary indicating that some of Pilot’s sympathisers might be relocated in different governmental positions in Rajasthan soon, as the first step.A senior leader familiar with the development said Rahul and Priyanka want Pilot (44) to take charge of Gujarat campaign before moving back to Rajasthan. Gujarat is facing elections in late 2022. A second Congress leader expressed doubt over Pilot taking charge of managing all aspects of the Congress in Gujarat. “He (Pilot) can go there for campaigning. But giving Pilot full charge of Gujarat is unlikely. He needs to go back to Rajasthan to improve our prospects for the next Lok Sabha polls,” said the leader.The meeting went for an hour and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also joined the meeting at Rahul’s residential office at Tughlaq Lane. Rahul Gandhi and Pilot also met on September 17. That meeting, too, went on for an hour and the two leaders discussed both the Rajasthan situation as well as the larger goals of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.On Friday, too, the two leaders went into a huddle to discuss the political situation in the state as well as the larger 2024 goals.A senior Congress leader said that after the Punjab crisis is resolved, Gandhi’s main focus in Rajasthan as it is one of the six states where the Congress and BJP will fight in a bipolar election and the party needs to improve its tally if it wishes to form an alternative government in the next national elections.According to Congress leaders in Rajasthan, Rahul also met state health minister Raghu Sharma, who is considered close to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who has been homebound for some months now; first because of Covid and then heart ailment.Pilot did not respond to text messages or calls.A state minister close to chief minister Ashok Gehlot said meetings with senior leaders are a general affair. “What the leadership did in Punjab cannot be implemented in Rajasthan due to different political scenarios. Certainly, the long-pending political appointment and changes in the cabinet will be happening – hopefully after October 5,” he said, requesting anonymity.For a year, chief minister Ashok Gehlot and former deputy CM Sachin Pilot have been at loggerheads. A compromise formula worked out by the party’s central leadership is yet to bring in a thaw in the relationship, with many lawmakers upset about a promised cabinet reshuffle, which is the lynchpin of the compromise formula, taking longer to materialise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-meets-sachin-pilot-to-iron-out-rajasthan-tangle-their-2nd-meeting-this-week-101632501310073.html
25-09-2021||India||After SC judgement, UPSC invites application from women candidates for NDA exam||The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on Friday sought applications from women to appear in the November 14 examination for entry into the National Defence Academy (NDA) and Naval Academy, a move that came two days after the Supreme Court rejected the Centre’s request to allow women to be admitted to the elite military institutions from 2023. The court on Wednesday stressed that it “cannot belie the aspirations of young girls” while directing women shall be allowed to sit for the exam as per schedule.“In compliance with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India’s interim direction permitting the women candidates to take part in the National Defence Academy and Naval Academy Examination (II)…the Union Public Service Commission has decided to open the online portal of application on its website (upsconline.nic.in) for this Examination to enable the unmarried women candidates ONLY (to take it)...,” UPSC said in a statement. It added the application window will remain open for women candidates till 6 pm on October 8. The eligibility criteria is the same for men too, although women candidates are exempt from paying the exam fee of ₹100. CHECKThe Centre on Monday, September 20 sought exemption for this year’s admission. It said women can take the entrance exam in April-May next year to join NDA in January 2023. But the court wasn’t amenable to this. The court directed UPSC to issue a revised notification for the entrance exam after consultation with the ministry of defence to indicate tentative requirements for women candidates if standards for admission cannot be finalised by the time of issuance of the notification. The Centre argued in favour of a deferral in view of the sweeping changes that have to be brought about before women cadets are inducted and start their training at the joint defence service training institute.On August 18, the top court said that women should also be admitted to NDA . Following this interim directive, the government on September 8 said it has taken an in-principle decision to open doors of NDA to women cadets, but sought an exemption for this year’s admission. In an affidavit submitted on September 20, the government said it proposes to have the necessary mechanism in place by May 2022 -- the time by which UPSC is required to publish the first notification of the entrance examination for NDA next year. The affidavit added there were various amenities pertaining to accommodation, training capacity that needed to be worked out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-sc-judgement-upsc-invites-application-from-women-candidates-for-nda-exam-101632478628337.html
25-09-2021||India||In tweet to President Biden, Rakesh Tikait seeks US help on farm laws||Rakesh Tikait, a leader of the ongoing farmers’ agitation against three new agricultural laws, on Friday, tweeted up a storm by appealing to US president Joe Biden, seeking his intervention to get India to scrap the legislation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the US currently. Tikait’s tweet tagging @POTUS, the Twitter handle of the US president, came several hours ahead of an all-important meeting between the leaders of the US and India. “These black laws should be repealed to save us. Please focus on our concern while meeting PM Modi,” Tikait, the leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Indian farmers’ union) and a key face of the agitation, tweeted. The tweet, which had the hashtag “Biden_SpeakUp4Farmers”, began trending in India. Friday’s meeting was the first in-person meeting of the leaders of the Quad grouping of countries whose members are the United States, Japan, Australia and India. Tens of thousands of farmers are campaigning against three laws enacted in September 2020 to liberalise domestic agricultural trade. Farmers say the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations who will dictate prices and wean them off state support. The government has argued the changes will not alter an existing state-backed market system but would free up farm trade, boost investments in the farm economy and raise incomes. The year-old farmers’ protests have now broadened into a larger political movement against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s economic policies. Garnering global support is a key agenda of the protesting farmers. “International support for a movement this large rests on mobilising support at all levels. I personally think there is nothing wrong,” said Kavitha Kuruganti, a key member of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions. Tikait could not immediately be contacted for comment. Kuruganti, the only woman representative of the farmers to take part in talks with the Modi government on the laws, said “the UN had a special role to play” because India was a signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas. Early in the movement, farm leader Darshan Pal made a video appeal to the UN. Farm leaders say they command a lot of support among the Indian diaspora. People have protested against the laws in many cities, from Vienna to Melbourne, Kuruganti said. The ruling BJP slammed Tikait for the tweet. “To ask the US president to intervene on a domestic issue like agriculture really creates doubt over Tikait’s credibility,” said Gopal Krishna Agarwal, BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-tweet-to-biden-farm-leader-rakesh-tikait-seeks-us-help-on-farm-laws-101632474547194.html

25-09-2021||India||Defence ministry places order for 118 Arjun Mk-1A tanks worth ₹7,523 crore||The defence ministry on Thursday placed an order worth ₹7,523 crore with Heavy Vehicles Factory, Avadi, for 118 locally made Arjun Mk-1A tanks to sharpen the army’s combat edge, a fortnight after India cleared projects worth ₹33,000 crore to equip the Indian Air Force with new medium transport aircraft and airborne early warning systems in a push to the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India campaign).The order came seven months after the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) - India’s apex procurement body – accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for the tanks. The Arjun Mk-1A is an upgraded version of the Arjun Mk-1 main battle tank (MBT), which is currently in army service.The new tank will come with 72 upgrades over the existing variant including 14 major improvements, officials familiar with the development said, adding that the upgrades significantly enhance the tank’s lethality, mobility and survivability.“The Mk-1A is equipped with accurate and superior firepower, all-terrain mobility and invincible multi-layered protection provided by an array of advanced technology systems. It can take on the enemy during day and night. By virtue of these capabilities, this indigenous MBT will be on a par with any contemporary in its class across the globe,” the defence ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The execution of the order is expected to involve 200 Indian vendors and generate 8,000 jobs.Five Mk-1A t tanks will be delivered within 30 months, followed by 30 tanks every year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed over a prototype of the Arjun Mk-1A tank to the army chief, General Manoj Mukund Naravane, in Chennai on February 14. The army’s existing fleet consists of T-90, T-72 and the Arjun Mk-1 tanks.The improvements on the new tank include better firepower, auto target tracker, remote-controlled weapon system, explosive reactive armour, advanced laser warning and countermeasure systems, containerised ammunition bin, advanced land navigation systems and improved night vision capabilities, as previously reported by HT.The tank has been configured and designed for Indian conditions and is suitable for deployment to protect the frontiers, defence ministry officials said.However, some experts have flagged concerns about the bulky tank, saying its weight (68 tonne) could limit the army’s deployment options.The Defence Research and Development Organisation’s Chennai-based Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) has designed and developed the tank. The Mk-1A tanks will be manufactured at the Ordnance Factory Board’s (OFB) Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi, outside Chennai.The tank order comes at a time when the OFB - India’s main producer of weapons and military equipment - is being corporatised to boost its efficiency and competitiveness in a long-awaited reform in the country’s defence manufacturing sector. The Union Cabinet, headed by PM Narendra Modi, had in June cleared the corporatisation of the board.The OFB, which controls 41 ordnance factories, is being split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives, vehicles, weapons and equipment, troop comfort items, optoelectronics gear, parachutes and ancillary products.Ordnance factories are currently engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, mine-protected vehicles, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers.The development of the Mk-1A tank began in June 2010 and it was fielded for user trials two years later. Extensive trial evaluation was conducted in various phases covering 7,000 km and substantial firing of various ammunitions during 2012-2015, the defence ministry statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmanirbhar-bharat-defence-ministry-places-order-for-118-arjun-mk-1a-tanks-worth-7-523-crore-101632428940835.html
