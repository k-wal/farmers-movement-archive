This is an improvement than last year but the prices are still not remunerative and they should be above ₹3,000 as the input cost has also increased due rise in diesel prices and labour cost,” said farmer Madan Lal at Ladwa grain market in Kurukshetra.“As of now, the moisture content is higher and most crop is harvested by combine harvesters. We think the prices will easily increase to over ₹3,000 when the crop will be harvested manually,” said commission agent Naresh Kumar, at Ladwa grain market.Most of the paddy is coming in from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh as harvesting in Haryana has just started. “There are no restrictions on early transplantation in UP so the farmers there grow early varieties to empty their fields for vegetables. But this may create problems for Haryana farmers as those from UP won’t hesitate to sell their produce at any available price with there being no mandis in their state,” said another commission agent Praveen Kumar, of Niolkheri.The Haryana government has announced to advance procurement of Parmal varieties to September 25 from October 1. This will help farmers who have grown early varieties.As per the figures of the All India Rice Exporters Association, the country’s export of basmati rice has improved to 46,31,531 MT in 2020-21 from 44,54,656 MT in 2019-20.However, traders are expecting that the prices of basmati varieties to remain good this year and varieties such as Pusa 1121, CSR 30, Sharbati and Moochal may get more than ₹3,000 per quintal. It will help farmers get some relief as last year they were forced to sell Pusa 1509 and Pusa 1121 at around ₹2,000 per quintal.As per the figures of the state agriculture department, this year, the area under paddy cultivation is around 12.50 lakh hectare which is around 18% less than last year’s 15.27 lakh hectare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-increase-in-basmati-prices-paddy-arrival-begins-in-haryana-mandis-101630520947313.html
01-09-2021||Noida||Farmers begin agitation against Noida authority||Demanding a hike in compensation for land acquired for development and a settlement on the Abadi land issue, farmers from several villages in Noida attempted to begin an indefinite protest in front of the Noida Authority main administrative building in Sector 6 on Wednesday. Although the police thwarted, stopping around 300 protesters in Harola village while on their way to Sector 6 at around noon, the farmers said they will resume their protest from Thursday.The land acquisition had begun in 1990 and farmers now say they want enhanced compensation and at least 10% of the acquired land returned as residential plots. Apart from this, they also demanded a park in each village, roads and better civic amenities, among others. Abadi lands are habitation areas in villages. But what is termed habitation area by farmers is referred to as encroachment by the authority that wants to acquire it for development. According to guidelines brought out by the government, if the habitation has been around before 2011, then the authority will not acquire it and leave it for farmers’ use. In July, the Noida Authority started a process to resolve the longstanding issue.Sukhbir Khalifa, who is leading the agitation, announced that the agitation will continue till all demands are accepted. On Wednesday, while stopping the farmers, police detained Khalifa and others who were later. “We will garner support and restart our agitation on Thursday no matter police high handedness or the Noida authority that has ruined the livelihood of farmers,” said Ashok Chauhan, a farmer of Nagli Wazidpur.Noida Authority officer on special duty Avinash Tripathi said that the farmers’ demands will be dealt with in accordance to the rules.Police said they will act against protesters for violating the prohibitory orders that is in force in the district due to the pandemic. They said the protesters was cleared in under an hour without the use of force.“We knew about the protest and prepared for it by putting up barricades and managing traffic. Special units of the Rapid Action Force were deployed along with the local police to manage the situation. The protest was scheduled for the Noida Authority office but as soon as the group reached the barricading, they started arguing with law enforcement officials following which they were detained and taken to police lines,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (zone 1) Kumar Ranvijay Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-begin-agitation-against-noida-authority-101630520583331.html
01-09-2021||Noida||Primary schools reopen in GB Nagar but with 20% attendance||Primary schools in Gautam Budh Nagar resumed in-person classes on Wednesday but with just 20% of the students in attendance, said district officials. In August, the Uttar Pradesh government had cleared classes from 1 to 5 to resume in-person sessions after nearly four months following the second wave of Covid-19 infections. According to the state’s guidelines, schools are expected to scan children for fever at the gate and operate in two shifts - the first from 8am to 11am and the second from 11.30am till 2.30am. The schools are also required to get the written consent from the student’s parents or guardians allowing their wards to attend in-person classes. The other measures, such as physical distancing, masks and sanitisations too are required to be adhered to. Schools had resumed in-person classes for grades 9 to 12 from August 16, and classes 6 to 8 from August 23, following the same protocols. According to Gautam Budh Nagar basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) D K Singh, 577 government schools in the district resumed classes on Wednesday. “The attendance was thin, around 20%. This could be because of the heavy rain on the first day. We hope that the strength increases in the coming days. In the meantime, online classes as well as in-person classes are going on in the schools,” said Singh. He said there are around 300 private primary schools in the district. “About 90% of the private schools in the district have not reopened for primary classes because they did not have enough parents’ consent,” he said. Grads International School principal and president of the Gautam Budh Nagar chapter of the All India Principals’ Association Aditi Basu Roy said barely four to five children attended in-person classes at he private schools from grades 1 to 5. “Private schools are operating in hybrid mode by holding online as well as in-person classes. On Wednesday, less than 10% schools resumed in-person classes. Attendance in most schools was below 10%. Parents are still not confident about sending their children to school not just because of fear of Covid-19 but also of the viral fever that is being reported from nearby districts,” she said.Parents of students in private schools agreed to this view and said they were more comfortable with online classes till a vaccine is approved and made available for their children.“Most parents have refused to send their children to schools because of the fear of a Covid-19 third wave. Moreover, students of class 1-5 are too young to be disciplined enough to follow Covid protocols religiously without high supervision. Parents are of the opinion that government should first vaccinate the children against Covid-19 and only then reopen the schools,” said Manoj Kataria, President of GB Nagar Parents Welfare Society. “If the parents do not want to send their children to school, they can refuse and have full say in the same. The government has only ordered for reopening the schools so that those who want to go for in-person classes, have the option,” said BSA Singh. However, he said that if the trend seen in higher classes followed in primary schools, the strength is likely to increase in the coming days.“Initially for classes 9 and upwards, we had very few students attending in-person classes but now the strength has steadily grown to around 40% in many schools,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/primary-schools-reopen-in-gb-nagar-but-with-20-attendance-101630520584083.html
01-09-2021||Noida||Covid vaccination: Ghaziabad, Noida gear up to identify vulnerable sections||Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts are gearing up for a 10-day special drive, on the directions of the Uttar Pradesh government, to find out the susceptible population that is likely to be affected more in the wake of a third wave of Covid-19. The health officials of both the districts will focus on beneficiaries in the 45+ age group who have not taken the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, people having fever or Covid-like symptoms, those suffering from tuberculosis, and children left out of the routine immunisation. Officials of the health department said as part of the drive, teams will conduct door-to-door survey from September 7 to September 16. The mega drive is being taken up so that those who haven’t been vaccinated or taken the doses under the routine immunization get maximum protection in case resources are diverted in the wake of a third wave of Covid-19. “The government has directed to prepare a list of the beneficiaries under the five categories and a report will be submitted once the survey is complete. We will form teams for rural and urban areas for the purpose. As regards those who have still not taken the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, around 62% of those in the 45+ age group have been inoculated with the first dose while efforts are on to bring more such beneficiaries to the vaccination centres,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad district. “Likewise, children who are left out of routine immunisation will also be traced, besides people having fever or suffering from tuberculosis. The idea behind the drive is to ensure that all types of beneficiaries get proper and prior healthcare in case resources get diverted during the third wave of Covid-19,” he said. According to official records, Ghaziabad has set a target of vaccinating 878,250 beneficiaries in the 45+ age group, of whom 536,629 have so far taken the first dose. The coverage is about 61.1% till August 31. “We have an annual target of vaccinating 97,200 children, who have to be administered seven types of vaccines under routine immunisation (RI). During the drive, we will try to find out children who have been left out of the routine immunization. Some children may have been left out as they may migrated to the district with their families. These children will also be covered,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for vaccination. In Gautam Budh Nagar, the targeted population in the 45+ age group for Covid vaccination is about 356,345 beneficiaries, while the district has completed administering first doses to 434,840 beneficiaries till August 31. The coverage is about 122.03%. “The first dose coverage for the 45+ age group is more than the target population as people from outside GB Nagar also get inoculated here. During the 10-day drive, we will try to find out the beneficiaries in this age group who have still not taken the vaccine. For this, a meeting with district officials is scheduled in the coming days and a strategy will be formed,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer of GB Nagar district. During the drive, teams have been directed to carry out door-to-door survey and also find out people suffering from influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid-vaccination-ghaziabad-noida-gear-up-to-identify-vulnerable-sections-101630520465826.html

01-09-2021||Delhi||Sharjeel Imam tried to create anarchy, Delhi Police tells court||New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Wednesday told a city court that Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam gave provocative, divisive speeches and called for road blockades in an attempt to “create anarchy”.Imam made the alleged inflammatory speeches at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019, and at Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, 2019. He has been in judicial custody since January 2020 after he was slapped with the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and sedition, among other charges.Special public prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad told the additional sessions judge, Amitabh Rawat, that Imam is a great orator who knows five languages.Prasad read out a January 16 speech by the JNU student in Aligarh and said, “He (Imam) begins this speech by saying “As-salamu alaykum”, which shows that it is only subjected to one community”.“The people called upon to take action were also from one community. The speech was definitely divisive. It was not made for the general public at large but a specific community. He is attempting to create complete anarchy,” he further argued.Reading out the part of the speech given at AMU, Prasad said, “These are very crucial words because we must keep in mind that this accused is somebody who has done his thesis on rioting and, therefore, has knowledge as to how a critical mass can come together and how things can be done from them.”The matter would be heard on Thursday.Imam is accused of offenses relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and indulging in unlawful activities under the UAPA.Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Imam in the case, in which it alleged that he allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Central Government and instigated the people which led to the violence in December 2019.“In the garb of CAA, he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block highways leading to major cities and resort to “chakka jam”. Also, in the name of opposing CAA, he openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” the charge sheet had claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sharjeel-imam-tried-to-create-anarchy-delhi-police-tells-court-101630520463960.html

While making Uttar Pradesh fear-free and a corruption-free state, Babuji (Kalyan Singh) never hesitated to send the message home that he was a strong leader,” Yogi Adityanath said.Kalyan Singh was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Babri Mosque was demolished by kar sevaks on December 6, 1992. The 13th day ritual was organised at KMV Inter College ground in Atrauli tehsil where Kalyan Singh’s ancestral village Madholi is located.Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra, Uttarakhand governor Baby Rani Maurya and Uttar Pradesh deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma also attended the ceremony.“Babuji fulfilled the pledge he had taken to dedicate himself to the society and the country. And, whenever he got responsibilities, be it from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Bharatiya Jan Sangh or the Bharatiya Janata Party, he discharged them with full commitment, honesty, dedication and firmness,” Yogi Adityanath said.“He will always remain in our memories. He will be known for his strong conviction as administrator and left his mark both as health minister and chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and then as governor of Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh,” he added.“His popularity among his supporters can be judged by their huge turnout at his demise,” the chief minister said.Kalyan Singh’s son Rajveer Singh, who is the Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Etah in western Uttar Pradesh, and grandson Sandeep Singh, who is a minister of state in UP and MLA from Atrauli in Aligarh district, were also present. PTI adds: The main rituals were held under a decorated waterproof pandal (tent) to protect against rain. It also provided shelter to about 1,400 cooks called in to prepare meals for those attending the ceremony. Security personnel were posted all along the road from the air strip to the main site.Kalyan Singh’s mortal remains were consigned to flames at Bansi Ghat on the banks of the Ganga in Narora town of Bulandshahr district in western Uttar Pradesh on August 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-pays-rich-tributes-to-kalyan-singh-101630520343211.html
01-09-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Restaurant owner shot dead after fight over delivery delay, three arrested||A 38-year-old restaurant owner was shot dead at his outlet in Greater Noida late on Tuesday night, allegedly after a fight that broke out because a delivery order was taking longer than expected, police said.The victim Sunil Agarwal, a resident of Dadri, ran a restaurant, Zam Zam, at Mitra Enclave in Greater Noida. He was trying to resolve an argument with some food delivery agents when three men, all drunk and apparently unconnected with the restaurant or the delivery agents, opened fire and killed him. Three suspects have been arrested for the crime.According to additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, Vishal Pandey, 10 delivery agents were collecting 15 food orders at the restaurant at around 12:15am on Wednesday, when they had a disagreement with one of the restaurant’s workers , Narayan, setting off a chain of events that led to the Agarwal’s death.“A Swiggy delivery boy was engaged in a heated argument with restaurant staff, Narayan, over a delay in food. When the restaurant owner Sunil Agarwal reached there to intervene, someone opened fire from outside the restaurantand the bullet hit Agarwal in the head,” Pandey said.Ashwani Goel, a friend on the victim, said he was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared him dead. Pandey said police quizzed the delivery agents who were present at the spot but were yet to find any evidence of their involvement in the murder. A case was registered against unknown persons under Section 302 (murder) of IPC. “We questioned some eyewitnesses and restaurant staff to get an idea of suspects. We also scanned CCTV footage from neighbouring areas and identified a Hero Splendor motorcycle on which three suspects were seen fleeing from the spot,” he said.News of the incident went viral on social media, where the incident was originally passed off as a killing caused by delayed order. Over the past several weeks, social media has been abuzz over the treatment of delivery agents by food delivery companies, and also unrealistic demands some place on the time it takes to make deliveries. Abhishek, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said police launched a search and intercepted the three suspects near Zero Point on Yamuna Expressway on Wednesday afternoon. The suspects – Vikas Chaudhury, 26, Devendra, 24, and Sunil, 23, all residents of Anupshahr in Bulandshahr, were arrested.Police suspect it was Chaudhury — who works as a contractor — who fired a shot from a pistol that killed Agarwal. Abhishek said that the suspects said they had no connection with the restaurant owner or the delivery agents. “The three persons were heavily drunk at the time of the incident. One suspect, Sunil, has previously worked as a food delivery agent. The suspects live in a rented accommodation in Swarn Nagri, about 1km from the restaurant. At night, they had left home on a motorcycle and they were roaming around. On the way, they stopped near the restaurant where the delivery boys were standing,” he said.Hearing the heated argument, the suspects inquired about the matter between the delivery agents and the staff. When the restaurant owner reached there, it appears that Chaudhury took out a gun and shot at the owner,” the DCP said.The suspects returned to their room, and were planning to escape to Bulandshahr when they were arrested. Police have recovered a pistol, two countrymade guns, two live cartridges, and a motorcycle. Police said that charges under the Gangster Act will also be pressed in this case.“What has been reported is very concerning,” a Swiggy spokesperson said. “All delivery partners on Swiggy are on-boarded for providing delivery services after a background verification which includes checking for any court cases or criminal antecedents, and are not disincentivised for any delays.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-restaurant-owner-shot-dead-after-fight-over-delivery-delay-three-arrested-101630520102504.html

Experts said if the rivers continued to rise, people could face a flood like situation as was the case in 1998. On Tuesday DM Vijay Kiran Anand inspected the flood affected areas and told the villagers that while river Rohini was stable, but nothing could be predicted about Rapti. Jal Shakti minister Dr Mahendra Singh inspected the embankments in Gorakhpur and said that the Yogi government would help the flood-hit and compensate their losses. “This time it has rained thrice more than it did in previous years and that is why many rivers have crossed the danger mark. He said the embankments were safe despite the pressure of water,” the minister said. Keeping in view the situation, administration has set up a flood control room. River Rapti has already started breaching the embankment from the regulator at Mahewa from Habbort embankment from the last three days. Flood-like situation is also developing at Maniram, Kudria, Banrahan extension near Bhuteli, Pipiganj Makhnahan embankment, Rampur, Nayagaon and in Belipar area, locals said. On Tuesday late night the Ilahigabh regulator also started leaking. In 1998, the highest level of River Rapti was recorded at 77.54 meter. On Tuesday evening the Rapti was flowing at 76.95, which is only 59 cm below the mark that was recorded in 1998. In 2001, River Rohini’s highest level was recorded as 85.43 meter which had caused heavy flooding in the region. After 20 years on Tuesday evening, River Rohini was flowing at 84.97 meter which is only 46 cm below the mark recorded in 2001.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/floodlike-situation-in-gorakhpur-districts-as-rapti-rohini-continue-to-swell-101630519803390.html

These signals will lower wait times for commuters and enable faster commute as they operate based on the traffic volume.The development was shared by GMDA officials during the district road safety meeting held on Tuesday evening.“GMDA CEO [chief executive officer] Sudhir Rajpal has already given administrative approval to this project. According to the representatives of GMDA, old and defective traffic signals in the city will be replaced and smart traffic signals will be installed in their place. Tenders are being prepared for this (project) and it is expected to be floated within this month. Smart traffic signals will solve the problem of traffic management to a great extent across the city,” an official spokesperson of the district administration said.In a smart traffic signal system, cameras and sensors can detect the volume of traffic on each side. The stretch with the highest traffic density would automatically get a green signal for a longer period while the one with the least will get the shortest period.This way, traffic congestion can be minimised and vehicular movement streamlined, said officials. The project is expected to cost around ₹16.10 crore.In March, GMDA had announced that they were working towards converting all of the city’s 130 traffic signals into a smart one.It is not the first time that smart traffic signals will be installed in the city. In February 2019, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) installed four smart signals between Huda City Centre and Subhash Chowk, along the Netaji Subhash Marg.The district road safety meeting on Tuesday was presided over by additional deputy commissioner Vishram Kumar Meena. During the meeting, Meena formed a four-member committee of officials from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Regional Transport Authority (RTA), Raahgiri Foundation, and Gurugram traffic police to make congested junctions such as Shankar Chowk, Iffco Chowk, Signature Towers, Rajiv Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk safer for pedestrians.The committee was directed to visit these spots and create zebra crossings and tackle other pedestrian-related issues.Gurugram traffic police officials also disclosed in the meeting that so far, this year, they have issued 52,746 challans for wrong-side driving, 1,979 for driving in incorrect lanes, 484 for speeding, 4,184 for driving without seat belts, 13,867 for driving without helmet and 107 for overloading vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/smart-signals-to-come-up-in-city-to-lower-wait-time-enable-faster-commute-101630519325809.html

They took the DVR of the CCTV cameras and also the set up box,” she said.VMK Singh, an RWA member, said that people are afraid to leave their houses unattended. “A resident who was walking his dog in the evening also saw this robber. We want the police to take action curb these robberies,” said Singh.He said that around 30 similar robberies have taken place in the colony over the past two years.The police said that they are investigating the burglary. “We are checking feeds from CCTV cameras installed in the area. The police presence has been increased,” said Sanjeev Balhara, an assistant commissioner of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/burglary-in-suncity-residence-locked-house-targeted-again-101630519324575.html
01-09-2021||Gurugram||Rainfall of 100.8mm drowns Gurugram, key roads waterlogged, gridlocked||Rainfall of about 100.8mm, between 1am and 5.30pm Wednesday, left most areas of the city heavily inundated, with the Narsinghpur stretch on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and areas below the Iffco Chowk Metro station remaining waterlogged till late evening. According to the weather department officials, the city started receiving rain a little after midnight and it continued till noon on Wednesday, post which it fizzled to a drizzle till evening.Such was the extent of waterlogging across the city that the traffic police issued alerts over social media cautioning commuters about the high amount of accumulated rainwater on Sheetla Mata Road, CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, Iffco Chowk, sector 21/22 crossing, near Kherki Daula toll, Nathupur, Bilaspur Chowk, Signature Tower, Sector 12 Chowk, Iffco Chowk, near Mayfield Gardens traffic signal, near Good Earth Mall, below Guru Dronacharya Metro station, Mini Secretariat, Hamilton Court Road, Basai Road, Z-chowk near Huda City Centre, Narsinghpur, and Ram Chowk. Commuters and motorists were advised to avoid these stretches and plan their travel accordingly.The worst affected stretch was the service lanes of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, between Khandsa and Kherki Daula toll.The service lanes towards Manesar were heavily inundated and commuters had to rely on the main carriageway, but even there, the situation was not better — two lanes of the main carriageway were also underwater, traffic officials said.Pedestrians could be seen wading their way through the knee-deep water on the stretch. Two-wheeler riders and cyclists were unable to spot the potholes and several of them lost their balance and fell into the murky water.With the service completely inundated and only the main carriageway of the expressway (NH-48) carrying traffic, the 3km stretch from Khandsa to Kherki Daula also witnessed severe congestion.“It took me over 20 minutes to cross the stretch. The service lanes were inaccessible and a few lanes of the main carriageway were also heavily waterlogged. Traffic police officials diverted traffic through the unaffected parts and cleared vehicles from the limited road space available,” said Kuldeep Rana, a resident of Sector 49.Traffic police officials said the Narsinghpur stretch along with Signature Towers, and Basai Chowk were the worst hit in terms of traffic snarls.“Over 1,100 traffic police officials were deputed on ground to manage traffic and other waterlogging related issues. The three stretches were the worst affected areas with regard to traffic movement. We deployed additional staff to divert vehicles and assist the stranded, while cranes were also placed at these spots to tow away broken down vehicles,” said Ravinder Singh Tomar, DCP, Gurugram traffic police.Tomar said at Signature Towers, the stretches below the flyover were inundated and that triggered snarls while at Basai Chowk, ongoing construction work, coupled with rain, led to jams. Tomar, however, said no underpass in the city had to be shut this time on account of waterlogging.Even arterial stretches such as Iffco Chowk and Hamilton Court Road did not fare any better.At Hamilton Court Road, opposite Galleria Market, such was the extent of waterlogging that two vehicles were submerged and had to be towed away with the help of cranes.The stretch leading towards the camera museum was unserviceable. Officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) could be seen using motor pumps to channel rainwater towards the nearest drainage outlet.“Such was the extent of waterlogging on the Hamilton Court Road that I could not turn into Sushant Lok-1 and had to take a 3km detour to access it from the MG Road side,” said Ravish Singh, a resident of Sushant Lok-1.Previously, heavy rainfall was recorded in the city on August 19 and 20 of 2020, when over 196mm of rainfall inundated the seven-kilometre Golf Course Road, with rainwater accumulation as high as 0.5 metres above the surface level at several points. On July 28, 2016, Gurugram received just 55mm of rain. While that was not much when compared to other rain days — like the 19th of July when the city received 185mm of rain — it was enough to bring Gurugram to its knees; enough to overwhelm a skeletal drainage network; enough to cause the infamous “Gurujam” when commuters were stuck on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway for nearly two days; enough to flood all arterial roads, enough to inundate houses, and enough to wash away the moniker of “Millennium City”.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) media bulletin, Gurugram recorded a maximum temperature of 26.2 degrees Celsius (­°C), eight degrees below normal, and a minimum of 23°C, two degrees below normal on Wednesday. According to the IMD’s seven-day forecast, the city is expected to have spells of rain till Saturday and the weather is expected to clear on Sunday. Pardeep Kumar, chief engineer, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, said barring the Narsinghpur and Iffco Chowk areas, rainwater was cleared from most parts of the city by 4pm.“The city received rainfall in three digits. Despite that, waterlogging in most areas was managed to a significant extent. In most parts, rainwater was cleared by 3pm while in low-lying areas, it was cleared by 4pm. At Narsinghpur and Iffco Chowk, rainwater was cleared by 6pm,” said Kumar.Kumar attributed the extensive waterlogging at Iffco Chowk to an incomplete drainage project of the GMDA, which he said will be completed post-monsoon. At Narsinghpur, he said the intensity of rain was far more than in other parts of the city, due to which there was extensive waterlogging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rainfall-of-100-8mm-drowns-gurugram-key-roads-waterlogged-gridlocked-101630519323364.html
01-09-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 work from home survey: Majority of working professionals prefer flexible working hours||Over 90% of 3,300 working professionals, who were surveyed by a real estate consultancy regarding a change in work modes due to the Covid-19 pandemic, said that they prefer flexible working hours and remote working, but also that they miss social interactions that an office space facilitates, a report of the survey stated.The report, released by JLL, is based on questionnaires shared with over 3,300 respondents across three surveys conducted in March 2020, October 2020 and March 2021. All respondents are working professionals employed by companies that have at least 100 employees. Over 90% of those surveyed were employed with private companies, with big corporates comprising 70% of these and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) forming the rest.The report, released on Wednesday, stated that almost 40% of workers wanted offline interactions and 30% missed change of scenery. Also, 21% did not prefer to work from home (WFH). Also, 75% of the workers said they would like to work from the office at least once a week, an increase from 52% reported in October 2020 survey.City-based human resource experts and real estate developers who operate commercial office spaces concurred with the findings of the survey and said that a mix of office and remote working would be the trend in the near future. They said that with the Covid-19 situation easing, there would be mixed working options that will favour the offices more. Employees in the private sector have been largely working from home since the Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020, resulting in employers giving up office space or reducing it accordingly.“The offices of the future will have to be more human-centric, putting health and well-being at the forefront. Almost 60% of those surveyed believe that a workplace that promotes a healthy lifestyle and safety is a key priority,” Radha Dhir, the chief executive officer and country head for India, JLL, said.According to the survey, a majority of workers preferred to work three days from the office and two working from home.Mamta Yadav, practice leader, IRIS Corp, a human resources expert, said that working from offices would res barring a few sectors, as it is the normal mode for employees to operate. “There is need for people to connect with each other, have a change of scenery and learn on the job. There are only a few sectors where only WFH will suffice. In other places, a flexible work culture will evolve. Only working from home has led to health and psychological issues among a large workforce, particularly in the IT sector. Productivity also gets hit. So, returning to offices in a graded manner is likely to happen,” she said.Meanwhile, real estate developers in the city said that many companies have resumed operating from their office spaces, especially after the vaccination drives took place. “Our own office is working at full attendance with high degree of safety measures. Many tenants have returned to office and though WFH has saved us during the pandemic, if we want to grow the business, there is a need to stick to offices with may be a day or two dedicated to working remotely ,” Kamaljeet Singh, the vice-president of Bestech, a city-based developer, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-work-from-home-survey-majority-of-working-professionals-prefer-flexible-working-hours-101630519265989.html
01-09-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 vaccinations: Gurugram exceeds first dose target, coverage at 104%||Gurugram has become the first district in Haryana to administer the first dose of the vaccine against coronavirus infection to 100% of its eligible population above 18 years, according to the data shared by the Gurugram health department. The district has exceeded its target, achieving coverage of almost 104% due to an influx of migratory population from neighbouring states, officials said.Based on the state health department’s estimates, 1,632,456 people were to be covered under the vaccination programme, but data shows that over 1,703,642 people have taken at least their first shot, with about 43% of them also having taken the second shot. “Considering the migratory population, the district has exceeded its expected eligible population. More people in the district have to be inoculated with the first dose, which includes another three lakh (300,000) people. Currently, the focus is on increasing the second dose coverage, to take the existing coverage of 43% to nearly 60%,” Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said. According to the data, the maximum coverage has been in the 18-45 years age group. As per the Census 2011, 974,208 people aged 18-45 years are eligible for vaccination in the district, with 1,120,339 having taken the shot, taking the coverage to 115% in the age group. Also, 28% (272,778) of the beneficiaries in the 18-45 age group have taken the second vaccine shot. Officials said that this is the highest coverage among the 22 districts in the state, despite the uneven pace of vaccination from May 1, when slots were opened for people in the 18-45 age group. In the 45-60 age group, vaccinations for whom started in April, the health department set a target to cover 394,949 people, with 304,111 having taken the shot, taking the coverage to 77%. Also, 48% (189,576) of the beneficiaries in the 45-60 age group have completed their vaccinations by taking the second shot. Among the prioritised population of above 60 years, the district targeted over 263,299 people, with 198,208 having taken the first shot, taking the coverage to 73%. Also, 55%(144,814) of the senior citizens have taken both doses. In the past three months, the district health department adopted multiple measures to reach out to different strata of the society by starting special vaccination mobile vans in slums, dedicated camps for people with physical disabilities and transgenders, and multiple drive-through camps in malls across the city. On Wednesday, 22,623 people were vaccinated across 97 session sites. In May, private hospitals and states were directed to procure the vaccine stock directly from the manufacturer, leading to a slump in vaccination as states and private hospitals faced a shortage of vaccines. On June 21, the policy was revised and the Central government started procuring 75% of all vaccine doses for states. The remaining 25% is procured by private hospitals, for which they have to submit details with to the health department. Officials said that the policy change led to an increase in vaccination in August, with more than 500,000 doses administered in a month, an increase of around 200,000 vaccinations from July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-vaccinations-gurugram-exceeds-first-dose-target-coverage-at-104-101630519264585.html
01-09-2021||Mumbai||BJP MLA’s remarks on Lord Ram causes stir||Jaykumar Gore, Bharatiya Janata Party’s MLA from Maan in Satara district, has kicked off a controversy through his remarks against Lord Ram. The legislator in his recent speech in his constituency said that Lord Rama’s “intention was bad” and he won the battle against Ravan because of the latter’s brother Bibhishana. However, within seconds, Gore corrected his remarks and said that he meant Ravan’s intention was bad. While the BJP said it was just a slip of tongue and the MLA himself corrected it immediately, the Congress pointed out that Union minister Narayan Rane had made an issue of a slip of tongue by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray while delivering his speech on Independence Day. Gore, who joined the BJP ahead of 2019-Assembly polls by defecting from Congress, was speaking in a public meeting on Tuesday. “After his defeat, Ravan asked Ram why did he face the defeat even after having mammoth force and everything in his favour? Rama said that he could win because Bibhishana was by his side. Ram had bad intention…” he said. When people from the gathering corrected him, he said, “I meant Ravan had bad intention.” Gore had been facing political rivalry from his brother Shekhar in the constituency. The two brothers fought the polls against each other in 2019. Gore linked the reference from Ramayana to his family clashes in his speech and said, “My brother did not stand by me, but my intention had no fault,” he said. The MLA is facing criminal cases, including allegations of sexual harassment. “This indicates how the BJP’s intention about Ram is bad. The party has been supporting mob lynching in the name of Hindutva. We want to ask what action the party will take against Gore for his derogatory remarks against Lord Ram, who is worshipped by Hindus and in whose name the BJP has been doing its politics,” said Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant. BJP leader Ashish Shelar said, “It was a slip of tongue. He realised it immediately after speaking out in the flow of the speech. He has apologised for it and has corrected his statement. His statement is selectively made public on social media and the opposition is capitalising on it. The part of his apology has been deleted from the video which has gone viral.” Sawant said, “Rane attacked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for seeking information on the year of independence. It was not even a slip of tongue. Why is the BJP now justifying its MLA for his more serious mistake?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-mla-s-remarks-on-lord-ram-causes-stir-101630518722803.html
01-09-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: HC reserves order on plea by eight accused||The Bombay high court reserved its orders in the petition filed by the eight Elgar Parishad accused who challenged the cognizance taken by the sessions judge of the charge sheet filed by Pune Police in November 2018. The counsel for the accused argued that as the sessions judge had passed orders and not the special NIA court or a magistrate court as stipulated by the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) under which the accused were booked, the orders passed by the sessions judge were not valid and they were eligible for default bail. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the petition of Sudhir Dhavale and the other seven accused was informed by advocate Sudeep Pasbola that the petition was challenging the orders passed by the additional sessions judge which authorized the charge sheet filed by the Pune police and all other orders related to default bail applications in November and December 2018. The accused in their petition have submitted that the sessions judge was not the competent court to hear their applications as they had been booked under a scheduled offence and the provisions of the NIA Act which mentioned judicial procedure for offences under UAPA were to be presided over by a special NIA court only or a magistrate court. However, the sessions judge had presided over the cases and passed orders which were illegal and hence they were eligible for default bail. Similar arguments had been canvassed by advocate Yug Choudhry in the petition filed by Sudha Bharadwaj seeking similar reliefs. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for Pune police and state however argued that the Pune police had filed the charge sheet within the stipulated period and hence the prayer for quashing of the order was not valid and the petition should be dismissed. Additional Solicitor general Anil Singh for the NIA submitted that the NIA Act provided a hearing of trial by a special court and not before that and as the authorization of the charge sheet was a pre-trial stage procedure and hence the there was nothing averse in the sessions judge taking cognizance of the charge sheet. However, Pasbola objected stating that neither the state nor the NIA had addressed the issue raised by the petitioners about the competence of the sessions judge to hear cases registered under scheduled offences. After hearing the submissions the court said it had concluded the hearing and would pass orders in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-hc-reserves-order-on-plea-by-eight-accused-101630518062634.html

Wilson, according to his plea, had last met his father, Wilson Jacob, 84, in April 2018 in Alappuzha. Hence, he has sought temporary bail on humane grounds from September 13. Wilson was arrested on June 6, 2018, in the Elgar Parishad case by Pune Police.Wilson has said that as per customs a function is organised on the 30th-day, which falls on September 16. Wilson has also annexed a letter from the St Sebastian Church about the function.The plea has been moved on Wednesday through his counsel Satyanarayan Iyer. The court has asked the NIA to reply to it by September 6.Wilson’s plea filed before the Bombay high court, citing a US-based digital consultant ‘Arsenal Consulting’ which had stated that incriminating evidence was planted on his electronic device two years prior to his arrest, is pending.Last year the special court had rejected co-accused Surendra Gadling’s plea for an interim bail for the funeral of his mother after it was opposed by NIA citing the seriousness of the offence. However, Gadling had recently managed to get interim bail to perform final last rites on his mother’s first death anniversary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-rona-wilson-seeks-temporary-bail-following-father-s-death-101630517402813.html
01-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 1 month after being opened up, Ghatkopar-Mankhurd flyover shut for work||One month after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray gave green light to the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd flyover, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to undertake maintenance work, owing to which, traffic is expected to be disrupted. The BMC has also decided to install CCTV cameras, additional speed bumps and rumblers and making the surface rough.This comes after an uproar over several accidents on the flyover including the death of a 34-year-old biker Yusuf Khan, who slipped and lost his life on Monday. In the absence of this flyover, those heading to Navi Mumbai and further along with those heading to south Mumbai and eastern suburbs will have to use the Ghatkopar Mankhurd Link Road, which will result in traffic jams.The flyover was inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on August 1. Following this, on August 4, BJP corporator wrote a letter to mayor Kishori Pednekar and municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, pointing at the poor quality of construction work by the contractor. Thackeray on the day of the inauguration had also asked the BMC officials to make the surface of the flyover smooth.On Wednesday, however, the BMC started the maintenance work of making the surface smooth by keeping one lane between Ghatkopar and Mankhurd shut. According to BMC officials, they will install CCTV cameras, speed bumpers on both sides of the road, undertake milling works of the road will be carried out in a bid to make the flyover surface rough along with rumbler strips also being placed.The Mumbai Traffic Police maintained that maintenance work will be carried out by the BMC for 10 days. Kishore Shinde, senior inspector of the Mankhurd traffic police division said, ‘The plan is to carry out work for five days each on one side at a time. Currently, it is being carried out on Ghatkopar to the Mankhurd stretch. After five days, it will be carried out on the Mankhurd to Ghatkopar stretch.”However, the BMC did not clarify what will be the timings of keeping the flyover shut for repairs. P Velrasu, Additional Municipal Commissioner of the BMC said, “The plan is to undertake work in non-peak hours.”The BMC further said that though the movement of light vehicles is allowed, the flyover after maintenance will continue to remain shut for heavy vehicles due to the presence of high-tension cables overhead. The BMC expects that these cables will be shifted in the coming months’ post which movement of heavy vehicles will also be allowed.Meanwhile, the 2.9-km flyover, constructed for ₹713 crore by the BMC, was opened on August 1, three years after its deadline. The flyover has helped cut travel time for motorists heading towards Navi Mumbai from Ghatkopar as the link road has heavy traffic on the entire stretch, especially at Baiganwadi Junction in Shivaji Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-1-month-after-being-opened-up-ghatkopar-mankhurd-flyover-shut-for-work-101630517102830.html
01-09-2021||Mumbai||Defamation case: HC reserves order on Ranaut’s plea against Javed Akhtar’s complaint||The Bombay high court (HC) reserved its orders in the appeal filed by actor Kangana Ranaut against the criminal proceedings initiated by the Andheri magistrate court based on the defamation complaint by lyricist Javed Akhtar. The actor’s counsel argued that the magistrate had not followed proper procedure and had initiated the proceedings based solely on Akhtar’s complaint and the police report without hearing her. However Akhtars counsel argued that the magistrate had three options to initiate criminal proceedings and after viewing the interview in which the actor had made the defamatory comments had rightly initiated the proceedings. The single-judge bench of justice Revati Mohite-Dere while hearing Ranaut’s appeal was informed by advocate Rizwan Siddiquee that the appeal sought setting aside of the criminal proceedings ordered by the magistrate as well as the complaint by Akhtar.Akhtar has approached the magistrate court last year alleging that Ranaut’s defamatory comments against him on national television had maligned his character and tarnished his reputation which he had painstakingly garnered over 50 years of his career in Bollywood. The magistrate court at Andheri initiated proceedings against Ranaut in February and issued a bailable warrant in March after Ranaut did not attend the summons issued by the magistrate. The actor had then appeared and applied for bail, which was granted by the magistrate. In her appeal in HC, Ranaut challenged the proceeding initiated by the magistrate and said that the magistrate had not followed the procedure as laid down under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). She alleged that rather than conducting the examination of Akhtar and witnesses himself the magistrate had only directed the Juhu police to conduct an inquiry. She had added that if such a practice was allowed it would set a wrong precedent for other magistrates and also affect the rights and liberties of other accused.Pending a hearing of her appeal in HC, Ranaut sought a stay on the magistrate court proceedings and a declaration to term as illegal the signed statements of witnesses collected by the police.Akhtar had however filed an affidavit seeking dismissal of Ranaut’s appeal on the grounds that the magistrate had followed due process of law and only after viewing the July 19, 2020 interview of Ranaut and going through the statement of witnesses that the magistrate initiated the proceedings against her. Akhtar had also alleged in the affidavit that the appeal was filed with the sole intent to delay the proceedings.On Wednesday, Siddiquee submitted that the magistrate had passed orders mechanically without application of mind. “No material evidence was brought on record by the complainant (Akhtar) and the material was brought by a third party and the same was not examined on oath. However, the magistrate relied on it. He was duty-bound to determine the veracity of the complaint,” argued Siddiquee terming the investigation as one-sided as it was not done as per the stipulation of section 2020 of CrPC. While countering the arguments by Ranaut, advocate Jay Bharadwaj for Akhtar said that due procedure was followed by the magistrate and in order to conduct an impartial inquiry, all people involved were summoned by him, however, Ranaut did not attend the court, hence the bailable warrant was issued against her. After hearing both sides the court concluded the hearing and reserved its order on the appeal. Meanwhile, the Andheri Magistrate adjourned hearing of the defamation suit filed by Akhtar to September 14 and granted Ranaut one last chance to appear before it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/defamation-case-hc-reserves-order-on-ranaut-s-plea-against-javed-akhtar-s-complaint-101630516562673.html

The Maharashtra government has imposed restrictions on the entry of people at places of worship, among others, to check the spread of Covid-19.However, the BJP threatened the Uddhav Thackeray government that it would "forcefully open" the temples and other religious places if the state administration doesn't reopen them.This is despite the Union health ministry advising the Maharashtra government to restrict religious activities and put curbs on celebrations during the ongoing festival season as the threat of a potential third wave of Covid-19 looms large.Former Maharashtra finance minister and BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar questioned the decision of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to prevent the people from entering the places of worship even thiugh it allowed bars, liquor shops and malls to reopen and fully vaccinated commuters to board trains.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Tuesday that his government is not anti-religion or against any festivals, but only against Covid-19 outbreak.On Monday, the state government prohibited all sorts of public gatherings, including human pyramids, for the Dahi Handi festival, which was observed on Tuesday.However, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena defied the ban and held the ceremony at many places, including Thane, Kalachowki, Dadar, Mulund and Mankhurd. Mumbai police booked at least four MNS workers in Worli for flouting Covid-19 norms.Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 4,456 cases of Covid-19 infection and 183 related deaths in the previous 24 hours, taking the overall caseload to 64,69,332.

The risk of trees hitting wires and damaging them is also higher at night. And who will pay for the night allowance?”While most of the heavy branches were taken off the road, when asked about the ones left on the footpath, Kangane said, “Those will be picked up tomorrow (on Thursday).

It was also decided that vacant posts of patwaris would be filled up expeditiously for which requisition will be sent to the Punjab Subordinate Services Selection Board.

In this case, 12,000 quintal wheat was found to be missing from PUNSUP godowns in Phagwara and Bholath areas of Kapurthala district. Kapurthala vigilance bureau has conducted a probe and submitted a report to PUNSUP. “The vigilance bureau indicted five officials of PUNSUP, including its Kapurthala district manager, Daljit Singh, Jaswinder Singh, Gagandeep Singh, Iqbal Singh, all inspectors, and Rajiv Sehgal, senior auditor, as being involved in the scam. We had recommended an FIR against all of them,” said a local vigilance official. In May 2021, Kapurthala police booked two inspectors, Jaswinder Singh and Iqbal, for siphoning off wheat, valued at ₹ 2.5 crore in Phagwara. The case was registered against the inspectors, on the complaint of Daljit Singh, district manager, PUNSUP. This FIR says that PUNSUP district manager, Daljeet Singh, along with other officials conducted physical verification of Bholath and Phagwara godowns and found nearly 19,000 bags of wheat (roughly 12,000 quintal) missing from stock. Daljit sent a report to the department and a criminal case was registered against the two officials. Since then Daljit has maintained that he had filed a recovery suit against the two officials and flatly denied all vigilance bureau findings against him. “If PUNSUP has registered two FIRs, then we will take over these from it,” vigilance official said. Senior officials with the Kapurthala Police said, “The vigilance bureau needs to probe corruption cases, as it is specially mandated to do so.”The accused have been booked under Sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) and under 13 (2) Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, at the Sadar Phagwara police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-vigilance-writes-to-dgp-for-taking-over-2-5-crore-phagwara-wheat-scam-101630514222152.html

The postmortem report revealed that there were external injuries on her body. Her feet were touching the ground," petitioner's advocate Rajeev Kumar said."The court has also initiated the process of criminal contempt against Jharkhand Advocate General Rajiv Ranjan and Additional Advocate General Sachin Kumar and the court has asked them to submit their reply by October 5," Kumar added."The matter of contempt against the two top law officers of the state arose during the hearing of Rupa Tirkey's case. "When Ranjan stated that the matter should be posted before the bench comprising of Chief Justice as on the previous date, he heard the counsel for petitioner stating that '200% the matter is going to be allowed to CBI. In petition, it is stated that despite the Court's strict observations directing the Advocate General to file an affidavit, he stated that his oral submissions are sufficient. Furthermore, the Additional Advocate General Sachin Kumar vehemently argued in a language not appropriate to be used before the Court. This was termed by the petitioner as conduct against the dignity of the court," Kumar added."It was then the contempt petition that stated that after the submissions made by the Advocate General, the Additional AG Sachin Kumar vehemently argued in a language not appropriate to be used before the Court,"he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-hc-orders-cbi-probe-in-cop-s-death-case-101630513136455.html

His statement came amid speculations that the AAP could tie up with regional parties in order to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh.The AAP, which is currently the ruling government in Delhi, is serious about expanding its base in states such as Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, which will witness polling next year. One of the promises the AAP has made in all these states is to provide free electricity to residents if it comes into power.In Uttar Pradesh too, the AAP said it will provide free electricity if it wins next year. Other benefits include provision of water and health care to residents for free. “Three hundred units of power supply will be made free for the poor, water supply would be free, free health care, employment would be ensured for the youth and if they don’t get jobs then they will be given unemployment allowance,” Sanjay Singh told reporters.The AAP also hit out at the Uttar Pradesh government over alleged corruption and said it will get the state rid of it, provide quality education to students, ensure safety of girls and women and also ensure adequate return to farmers for their produce.Meanwhile, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who was a part of Wednesday’s press briefing, told reporters the objective of AAP’s Tiranga Yatra is to ensure the ‘aan, baan, shaan’ (pride, honour and glory) of the tricolour on the 75th year of India’s Independence and added that politics of Uttar Pradesh dented this pride and glory of the flag.“We will reach out to all people in the state irrespective of caste and community and appeal to them to elect a party that works with an objective to achieve the dreams of BR Ambedkar,” Sisodia said.Launching an attack at the BJP, Sisodia said the saffron party spoke of nationalism but when it comes to providing education to children of the nation, they (BJP) are the ones who usurp the midday meal funds meant for their education by the people in power.”The Delhi deputy CM also alleged the lack of health infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh and cited the death of a woman in Firozabad due to alleged unavailability of hospital beds. “The youth are jobless, the farmers do not get adequate return for their produce and people in cities face corruption for getting even the smallest of works done,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aapto-go-solo-in-uttar-pradesh-assembly-polls-says-sanjay-singh-101630513360094.html

Sources said that Congress leaders are hesitant to organise public events for distribution of cheques, fearing resentment and anger of people. According to the Moga administration, debt of around ₹17 crore is to be waived of 17,416 farmers. Of these, only four have received cheques and that too on August 20, when chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had virtually launched the disbursal of cheques.Rajinder Dhillon, district manager, Moga Central Cooperative Bank, said, “The cheques are ready and Congress MLAs and halqa in-charges are to hand these over to the beneficiaries. They, however, have not been able to find time due to their bust schedules. As soon as Congress leaders distribute these cheques to beneficiaries, the debt will be cleared in the same event.” On August 20, the administration had announced that the state government had waived the loan of 1,225 beneficiaries of Dharamkot constituency, 3,448 of Baghapurana constituency, 2,646 of Moga constituency and 10,067 of Nihal Singh wala constituency.When questioned on the delay, Moga MLA Dr Harjot Kamal said, “I do not know the reason for the delay in distribution of cheques. I have not received either the cheques or any directions in this regard. I will hand over cheques to beneficiaries whenever I receive these.”Congress district president Maheshinder Singh said, “I will write to MLAs and other leaders to handover cheques to beneficiaries as soon as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/10-days-after-farm-loan-waiver-event-17-000-in-moga-yet-to-get-cheques-101630513562436.html

On Wednesday, news that names put forward to the national leadership in Delhi for the state’s executive committee were chosen “exclusively” by H K Patil, who holds the post of party observer in Maharashtra, created a rift in the party. The Congress’ state unit president, Nana Patole, is not at all happy, given that not a single name he suggested has been included in the list. Party spokesperson in Pune, Gopal Tiwari, claims he has already written a letter to national Congress chief, Rahul Gandhi, on the same. A Congress party source, speaking anonymously, confirmed, “A rift has emerged between party observer H K Patil and state unit president Patole. The members chosen for the state-level committee are from the Patil camp, while Patole has been left out in the cold.” Another state-level Congress leader confirmed that Patole was unhappy over nominations to the state committee. “He has had a word with Patil,” is all the leader was willing to say, however, adding, “Some Congress leaders have approached the national leadership over the appointments and filed complaints against Patil.” Another Congress party functionary added, “Some leaders had asked Patil for an appointment, but he avoided dialoguing with them.” Another Congress worker from Pune said, “As the state unit president is unhappy with the committee, there are chances that the party will make some changes. Leaders are also hoping the party considers the appointment of a new president for the city unit Congress.” Ramesh Bagwe was recently retained as city Congress chief. However, with municipal elections in February 2022, the rank and file of the Congress in Pune believe a change in leadership is necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rift-in-congress-over-choosing-of-state-s-executive-committee-101630513081016.html

The petitioners - UP Sunni Central Waqf Board and Anjuman Intezamia Masjid, Varanasi had challenged the Varanasi court’s order dated April 8. Justice Prakash Padia reserved the order after hearing the counsel for the petitioners, counsel for the central government, the state government and others. The petitioners’ contention was that the suit in which the order of the civil judge (senior division), fast-track court (FTC) of Varanasi (dated April 8, 2021) was passed, is itself not maintainable as per Section 4 of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which bars filing of suit or any other legal proceedings. Hence, no claim can be made regarding a religious place that existed on August 15, 1947. As per the Act of 1991, no relief can be sought for changing the status of any religious place as it existed on August 15, 1947, contended the petitioner’s counsel.The argument of the petitioner’s counsel was that when the high court had already reserved its judgment on the issue of maintainability of the aforesaid suit, the court below should not have passed any order in the suit till the issue of maintainability of the suit was decided by the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/high-court-reserves-order-on-gyanvapi-issue-101630511281503.html

According to state police investigation, Tirkey’s friend and colleague, sub-inspector Shiv Kumar Kanaujia, allegedly harassed her, which led to her suicide. Kanaujia was subsequently arrested in the case.However, Tirkey’s father Devanand Oraon alleged his daughter was murdered. In June, he filed a petition in the HC for a CBI probe. He alleged his daughter was harassed by some colleagues at the instance of Pankaj Mishra, assembly representative of chief minister Hemant Soren, and another person named Dahu Yadav. Since her daughter went against Mishra’s wishes to manage some of the cases she was investigating, she was murdered, the father alleged.Following an outcry over her death by tribal rights groups and opposition BJP, the Hemant Soren government set up a one-member judicial commission headed by a former HC justice to probe the allegations. Tirkey’s father had challenged the government’s decision in the HC.“The bench of Justice SK Dwivedi on Wednesday directed a CBI probe. We had been highlighting that it was a rare case, wherein police started projecting it as a suicide from the very next day after her body was found in mysterious conditions,” said Rajiv Kumar, Oraon’s counsel.Contempt proceedings against AG, AAGIn a related matter, the bench of justice Dwivedi also ordered to initiate criminal contempt of court proceedings against advocate general Rajiv Ranjan and additional advocate general Sachin Kumar for one of their remarks during hearing in the case.During one of the virtual hearings, the microphone of the petitioner’ counsel was left on even after the day’s proceedings got over. The counsel was heard telling those sitting around him that he was “200% sure that the court would order a CBI probe in the case”.The AG and the AAG raised it before the bench next day, to which justice Dwivedi asked if they were willing to give their submission through an affidavit. They refused and prayed that their verbal submission was enough. Justice Dwivedi then announced to recuse himself from the hearing and directed the petition to be put up before the chief justice for further direction.Chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan then directed to continue the hearing in the court of justice Dwivedi.The petitioner then filed an interlocutory petition (IA), seeking contempt proceedings against the AG and the AAG. Though the court rejected the IA as it was not maintainable, it took suo motu cognisance and served notices. Senior lawyer Kapil Sibal appeared on behalf of the AG and AAG on Tuesday and defended the two lawyers. “The court, however, reserved its order on Tuesday. On Wednesday, it ordered criminal contempt proceedings,” said a lawyer involved in court proceedings in the matter.

01-09-2021||Patna||Covid effect: 37% of MBBS students in Bihar fail first varsity exam||Around 37% of first-year MBBS students of nine medical colleges in Bihar have failed their first university examinations conducted during the coronavirus pandemic, the results for which were declared on August 30, according to officials at the Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU), under which their colleges function.These students of 2019 batch staged a protest on Wednesday on the office campus of the university in Patna, demanding that they be promoted on the basis of their internal marks. “Around 37% of students have failed the exam,” said AKU controller of examinations Rajeev Ranjan. This is the worst performance by students since the inception of the AKU in 2010, university officials said. “A delegation of students met AKU vice-chancellor Prof Surendra Pratap Singh, demanding that the failed students be promoted on the basis of their internal marks. Since the National Medical Commission (NMC) does not allow it, we asked them to appear for the second (supplementary) exam that begins from September 27,” said Ranjan. Around 250 students from the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), both in Patna, Bhagalpur’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital (JLNMCH), Gaya’s Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital (ANMMCH), Muzaffarpur’s Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital (SKMCH), and the Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) at Pawapuri, gathered on the AKU to press for their demands. “We are seeking re-evaluation of answer sheets because some of us who topped the college tests have failed the university exam. The AKU has not heeded our request either for re-evaluation or re-totalling of marks,” said an aggrieved students who did not wish to be identified. “Our classes were conducted online and exams held offline. Not to speak of the quality of teaching through online mode during the pandemic, the AKU changed the pattern of exams at the eleventh hour. We had to attempt 18-20 questions this time, instead of six earlier. The number of multiple choice questions was also less this time as compared to the previous exams. Against this backdrop, the marking has been very stringent,” said one of the students. The AKU controller of exams, however, disputed their contention. “Mixing and scanning of answer sheets is computerised. Name and roll code of students is removed and only answer sheets containing barcode are sent to the examiner. We leave no scope of any bias, which may otherwise reflect in the examiner,” said Ranjan. He said there was no scope in the AKU statute for re-evaluation of a single or a handful of answer sheets. “If at all re-evaluation has to be done, it will for the whole batch. Already 63% students have passed the exam,” said Ranjan. On Tuesday, the student body of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had also demanded re-evaluation of answer sheets. In a letter to the Bihar governor, who is also chancellor of AKU, the IMA student body claimed that 38% (447 of 1,172) medicos across nine medical colleges in Bihar flunked the examination. Giving a break-up of the number of failures, the IMA student unit said that 69% students (104 of the 150) failed the examination at the Madhubani Medical College, a private medical college in Madhubani. The results in the remaining eight government medical colleges of Bihar were, however, not as bad. The IMA student body claimed that 13.88% medicos (25 of 180) failed at the PMCH, the oldest institution in the state established in 1925. Similarly, as many as 28.33% (34 out of 120) at the ANMMCH, 30% (36 out of 120) at the SKMCH, 37.50% (45 out of 120) medicos at the NMCH; 38.33% (46 out of 120) at the JLNMCH, 41.66% (50 out of 120) at the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital (DMCH); 41.80% (51 out of 122) at the VIMS, and 46.66% (56 out of 120) medicos at the Government Medical College (GMC), Bettiah, were unsuccessful, it claimed. The said examination, the first university examination for the 2019 batch of MBBS students, was supposed to have been completed in December last year, but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic and culminated on March 26, just before the peak of the second wave of coronavirus in Bihar. The AKU took five months to declare the results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/covid-effect-37-of-mbbs-students-in-bihar-fail-first-varsity-exam-101630509360850.html
01-09-2021||Pune||Parts of Maharashtra likely to receive above-normal rainfall in September: IMD||As per India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast Konkan, Goa and adjoining parts of central Maharashtra may receive normal to above-normal rainfall in September. Officials also noted that withdrawal of monsoon may be delayed this time.If monsoon picks up pace during September, many parts of Pune district may receive good rainfall, said, officials.Between June 1 and September 1, the district has reported 705.4 mm rainfall which is one per cent less than normal.In August alone, Pune district has reported the fourth-lowest rainfall since 1995. Pune district reported 83.3 mm in August.M Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, said that parts of Central Maharashtra that are adjoining Konkan and Goa may receive normal to above-normal rainfall in September.“However, as per forecast so far by different models, interior central Maharashtra may receive below normal rainfall,” said Mohapatra.With three monsoon breaks so far, central Maharashtra has reported five per cent excess rainfall with actual rainfall of 628.8 mm between June 1 till September 1.During the same time, Konkan and Goa have reported 12 per cent excess rainfall with 2845.1 mm rainfall. Vidarbha however has reported 14 per cent less than normal rainfall and Marathwada has reported 20 per cent excess rainfall in the given period.Speaking about the monsoon withdrawal, Mohapatra added that southwest monsoon withdrawal may be delayed this time.“The withdrawal of monsoon as per new dates is during the third week of September. However, as per the extended range forecast, we are expecting a delay in withdrawal of southwest monsoon,” said Mohapatra.Not just Maharashtra and Pune city, India as a whole has reported less rainfall in August.Mohapatra added that the rainfall averaged over the country as a whole during September 2021 is most likely to be above normal.“The rainfall in September will be more than 110 per cent of the long-period average (LPA)). The LPA of rainfall during September based on the data of 1961-2010 is about 170 mm. Considering the expected above normal rainfall activity during September 2021, the current deficiency of nine per cent in seasonal rainfall during June to August is likely to reduce and accumulated seasonal rainfall from June 1 to September 30, 2021, is likely to be around the lower end of the normal,” said Mohapatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parts-of-maharashtra-likely-to-receive-above-normal-rainfall-in-september-imd-101630508882259.html

The complainant accepted the job offer and sent an email to the address provided by the accused.Once the complainant agreed to work for the accused, the man asked the complainant to mediate a trade with an Indian company based in Shillong, Meghalaya to procure a mineral called xanthoconite.According to the complainant, the accused told him that the pharma company planned to do business worth $40.5 million with the Meghalaya-based company.Under the guise of various charges and with the promise of seven per cent returns, the complainant was asked to invest ₹27,99,636 for three weeks in June this year.Between June 3 and June 23 the man was contacted through message by the first accused, one female, and one person who identified himself as a British national.

01-09-2021||Mumbai||Rane to launch news channel before Mumbai civic body polls to counter Sena||In what may intensify the ongoing war of words between the Shiv Sena and its favourite bugbear, Union minister Narayan Rane is planning to launch a Marathi news channel before the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections due early next year.“Preliminary preparations have begun. Things are yet to be finalised. We will try and launch it before the BMC elections,” said Rane’s younger son Nitesh, who is a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Kankavali in Sindhudurg district. On being asked about the name, editorial leadership and other details, Nitesh said “The branding is yet to be decided.”In 2008, Rane had launched a newspaper Prahar (Blow) to put forth his point of view, and take on the Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece, Saamana. Prahar has editions in Mumbai, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg.Rane’s aides said the decision is spurred by the unceasing attacks made by the Shiv Sena on the Ranes through their mouthpiece Saamana. The channel, about which Rane senior has referred to in an interview to the electronic media, will also serve as a propaganda vehicle for the BJP and Rane in the battle for the cash-rich BMC, which is one of the richest civic bodies in Asia.One of the reasons for Rane’s induction in the BJP and later into the Narendra Modi-led cabinet was the need for an aggressive face to take on the Shiv Sena, especially in the Mumbai civic body elections. As a former Shiv Sainik and ex-chief minister of the state, who began his electoral career as a corporator in the Mumbai civic body, Rane knows several chinks in the armour of his former party.When contacted, Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande said this channel could be “one more platform to attack Thackeray and Shiv Sena.”Incidentally, the Shiv Sena, to which Rane originally belonged, has its genesis in a cartoon weekly Marmik that was launched by cartoonists Bal Thackeray and his younger brother Shrikant on August 13, 1960. The Thackerays upheld the “jobs for sons-of-soil” cause in the weekly and spurred on by his father, the social reformer-journalist ‘Prabodhankar’ Keshav Sitaram Thackeray, Bal Thackeray formed the Shiv Sena in 1966.Thackeray also launched the Marathi newspaper Saamana in 1989 and the Hindi tabloid Dopahar Ka Saamana in 1993. The party’s line is spelt out in Saamana, which has Sena hawk and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut as the executive editor and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s wife Rashmi as the chief editor. Uddhav held the position of editor till he became the chief minister in November 2019.Several other politicians in Maharashtra also control newspapers and media groups. This includes the Dardas (Lokmat) and Peasants and Workers Party (PWP) leader Jayant Patil, who publishes the Krishival newspaper from Alibag in Raigad. Former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh also founded the Marathi daily Ekmat, headquartered in Latur.Incidentally, the Shiv Sena also experimented with a still-born plan to launch a Marathi news channel in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rane-to-launch-news-channel-before-mumbai-civic-body-polls-to-counter-sena-101630503120042.html
01-09-2021||Kolkata||Bengal mulls inoculating children to brace for Covid 3rd wave: CM Mamata||In view of the third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) which is likely to affect children the most, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday that her government is considering whether the children would be required to be vaccinated against viral disease. She said that the state government could start a programme similar to the pulse polio drive to inoculate children against Covid-19.“Keeping the third wave in mind, we are now thinking whether children will be required to be vaccinated or not. If required, the government will launch an inoculation programme similar to the pulse polio drive,” Banerjee said at the foundation laying ceremony of Dhunseri Poly Films plant in Panagarh.Banerjee once again highlighted the shortage of vaccines in the state and urged the Centre to supply more doses. “We have achieved the vaccination target for Covid-19 and are at number one. We have given till yesterday (Tuesday) what we got from the Centre. We completed the vaccination of 4.1 crore people in Bengal till Tuesday. My state’s requirement is that of 14 crore more doses, looking at the possibility of a third wave where children are at risk,” the chief minister further said.Banerjee also assured the people of the state that no one will be left behind in the vaccination drive and urged them to not rush to the inoculation centres based on rumours. “I just request the people not to rush to the vaccination centres and wait for the authorities to notify about the timings,” she said. Her comment came in the backdrop of a stampede reported at a vaccination Centre in the state’s Jalpaiguri district after scores of local residents tried entering the premises. At least 25 people have been injured in the incident.Till now, West Bengal has administered 4,10,99,468 vaccines to eligible beneficiaries of which 2,95,43,733 have been inoculated with the first dose and the remaining 1,15,55,735 with both doses. On Tuesday, over 1.21 million beneficiaries got the jab.A total of 1,521,342 Covid-19 cases have been reported in the state so far which include 18,447 deaths, 15,21,342 recoveries and 8,815 active cases.

I tried to drive it away by making noise. But the leopard left the goat and suddenly jumped towards me. I was initially petrified. But then I realised that if I didn’t act, I would be dead,” said Saun.Saun said he hit it with the sickle he was carrying and it worked. “The injured leopard fled but fell unconscious some distance away. The head wound from the sickle led to its death,” he said.Saun said this was the first time that he came across a leopard while grazing goats since his childhood.“People claim that leopards run away if an alarm is raised, but in my case, instead of running away, it attacked me. In such a situation, I had no other option but to hit it back.”He said forest officials were later informed and they arrived at the spot immediately.“We took the body of the leopard into our possession. It was a female leopard and we cremated it after post-mortem,” said Dinesh Joshi, ranger Pithoragarh range of forest.The forest department were told that Saun killed the leopard in self-defence.“Villagers revealed that if Saun hadn’t resisted with a sickle in self-defence, the leopard would have killed him. Wildlife Protection Act 1972 gives some relief in such cases where no option is left for a man for his own protection from wild animals,” said Joshi, the ranger.Saun said he was surprised that the attack took place in the village and not in a forest. “It was never my intention to kill the leopard but it happened suddenly as I was trying to save my life,” said Saun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-villager-killed-leopard-with-a-sickle-to-save-own-life-101630497719463.html
01-09-2021||Other||When my son’s school taught his father a lesson||Going down memory lane, I’m reminded of an incident when my son was studying in Class 6 of a local convent school. His English teacher complained to me about him during a parent-teacher meeting saying, “He needs special attention or tuition from a competent teacher.” I asked her to suggest a good teacher and humbly requested if she could spare some time to teach him as she was living in a sector near our residence. Accepting my request, she asked me to meet the principal for his permission. The next day, I went to meet the principal and sent a slip briefly mentioning my name and the purpose of my visit. The principal sent a message through the peon to wait for a while as he was in the middle of an important meeting. Soon, the principal, known for his administrative capabilities and being a strict disciplinarian, called me in his office. Handing over an application after greeting him, I urged him to allow my son to take tuition from his class teacher. He asked me, “Who teaches him English at home?” I promptly said, “My wife and me. I’m an information officer in the Punjab government and my wife a lecturer in Government College.” Seeing the application he asked, “Have you written this application?” I replied in the affirmative. He returned the letter to me after encircling the word ‘tution’ with a red sketch pen, as erroneously misspelt by me. Giving a blank white paper with the word ‘tuition’ written on the top, he signalled me to sit on a sofa in the corner of his office and asked me to write it 25 times. Embarrassed, I hesitatingly handed back the paper to him after completing the most awkward task. He meticulously checked it as often diligently done by the teacher in a classroom and advised me never to venture to teach my ward as “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing”. After a word of caution, he called the English teacher and allowed my son to take tuition from her. After expressing gratitude, I quietly walked out of the principal’s office, feeling dejected. Finally, I realised that the English language, which I had always taken pride in and considered my forte being an editor of an English departmental magazine for over a decade, had let me down and broken my illusion about having mastered the language. Immediately, I set out for my office and remained perturbed the entire day till I reached home in the evening. My wife curiously asked, “Did you meet the principal today for Babloo’s tuition? What did he say?” I related the entire incident to her and told her not to ask me to visit Babloo’s school in future either for the parent teacher meet or any other purpose. The ‘holy sermon’ delivered by the principal almost three decades ago still reverberates at the back of my mind and from that day onwards I never dared to teach my son English as a wise father. opinder.lamba@gmail.com The writer is additional director (press) to the Punjab chief minister||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/when-my-son-s-school-taught-his-father-a-lesson-101630497600965.html

Police have not taken any action against Kartarpur Congress MLA Surinder Singh, who was also named by Bakshi on Facebook Live. Also read: ‘Highest in 19 years’: Heavy rainfall in Delhi makes new September recordThe police action against Bali came after Bakshi’s family refused to cremate the body. Bakshi, 40, managed the gaushala at Lambra village in Jalandhar district. He consumed poison on Monday and accused Surinder Singh, Bali and three others of harassing him. He died during treatment on Tuesday. Bakshi claimed threat to gaushala, temple The police booked Sanjeev Kala, Gautam Mohan and Sriram Mohan for abetment to suicide but didn’t name the Congress MLA and the police official as accused in the FIR. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Sukhpal Singh said, “We have registered a case as per the statement of victim’s son, who didn’t blame the MLA and the cop.” On those named by the victim in the Facebook Live, he said their role will be probed. The victim claimed that the politician and police officer were threatening to raze down the gaushala and a temple. Talking to mediapersons, the Congress MLA said that the victim’s son was demanding ₹4.5 lakh from a family in his constituency to settle a police case. “He called me up on Sunday night and said the police are going to register a case against his son and sought my help. The allegations were made to malign my image,” the MLA said. Bali said the police were probing charges of extortion against the victim’s son. In March 2020, Bali, who was posted as Kartarpur station house officer (SHO), was shifted to the police lines for thrashing local residents for the violation of curfew amid the pandemic. Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta had ordered the transfer after three videos of him and his team thrashing people out to buy essentials were shared on social media. BJP leaders visit victim’s family BJP vice-president Rakesh Rathore was among the leaders who visited the victim’s family and demanded action against Congress MLA Surinder Singh. They alleged that police have not been acting against the MLA under political pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jalandhar-sub-inspector-booked-for-abetting-gaushala-manager-s-suicide-101630495560539.html

01-09-2021||Jaipur||SMS Hospital’s top surgeon says blockage in Gehlot’s artery not due to Covid||A senior doctor at Jaipur’s famous Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital has questioned the claim that Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s artery blockage that forced him to undergo an angioplasty procedure at the hospital last Friday was the result of post-Covid complications.On August 27, CM Gehlot underwent angioplasty during which a stent was placed in one of his three main arteries that had “90% blockage” following “severe” chest pain since Thursday. The blockage was discovered on Friday and the angioplasty was conducted hours later the same day, according to the chief minister and the hospital authorities.Gehlot’s tweets on Friday and Saturday suggested he was told by doctor(s) that the artery blockage was a “post-Covid” development.“This happened due to post-Covid effect, therefore, I request you all to take care and stay healthy, follow Covid protocols and get vaccinated on time. I thank you all again,” he tweeted on August 30, three days after undergoing the angioplasty process.Responding to one of CM’s tweets, the head of department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery at SMS Hospital, Dr Rajkumar Yadav tweeted, “On behalf of cardiothoracic and vascular surgery [department at] SMS Jaipur, I congratulate you for successful and timely angioplasty.”He continued, “Since the beginning of your pain [in the] chest it was [due to] the blockage only which was wrongly attributed to Covid.”Dr Yadav, didn’t specify who was responsible for the “wrong attribution” or diagnosis.When approached for clarity on the events, Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma said a medical team was monitoring Gehlot’s treatment at the SMS Hospital after he complained of chest pain and it was formed in the presence of state chief secretary, principal secretary to the CM, secretary health, and Sudhir Bhandari, principal SMS medical college.“If there was any lacuna, I will get it examined,” Sharma said referring to the suggestion made by Dr Yadav.SMS medical college principal Bhandari said the CM had “acute symptoms” and was taken for cardiac intervention on Friday. “A team led by HoD of cardiology attended to him and he felt better. All the faculty of cardiology and cardiothoracic and vascular surgery were present there,” he said. As mentioned earlier, Dr Yadav is the head of department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery at SMS Hospital.Dr Bhandari added that after Gehlot recovered following angioplasty, a board of cardiology was constituted for any follow up.He said the CM had diabetes and blood pressure, risk factors in Covid. “The CM pre-Covid had no cardiac issues, and so it is a presumption,” he added. Dr Bhandari is aware of Gehlot’s recent medical history.Cardiologist Dr Nikhil Choudhary at Narayana Multispeciality Hospital in Jaipur, said that during acute Covid, the heart beats can increase or decrease; the heart can become weak; and clotting can happen in arteries to an extent that it can cause heart attack.He said it was too early to talk about long-term complications post Covid-19, but the use of steroids [in its treatment] was leading to diabetes and heart blockages. Choudhary added that clotting can develop during Covid or a month after it, but such cases aren’t seen after 3-4 months. Gehlot contracted the infection on April 29 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/sms-hospital-s-top-surgeon-says-blockage-in-gehlot-s-artery-not-due-to-covid-101630494359055.html

We will ascertain the reasons during his remand,” the SP said. A senior police official, who is privy to the investigation, said Abhishek had informed his maternal uncle, who lives nearby, that door of his house was locked and nobody was answering the bell. The uncle had asked him to break open the door. “Next, he told his maternal uncle that some miscreants had shot at his family members and that he was rushing his sister to PGIMS.

Two and a half crore rupees have already been disbursed under the scheme to incentivise growth in the animal husbandry sector and increase milk supply to current and future dairy plants in the state, officials said.Medha Dairy has three functional plants in the state that together procure 130,000 litres of milk every day. Three more milk processing plants are set to become operational by the end of this year, resulting in greater demand for milk.“Around 40,000 milk producers currently registered with the federation will benefit from the scheme. Currently, the federation pays up to ₹34 per litre to the suppliers, depending on their milk quality. The government will now provide Re 1 per litre as incentive. The fund is to be transferred to the federation, which will further transfer it to the beneficiaries,” said Shashi Prakash Jha, director, animal husbandry and dairy development, Jharkhand.Jha said the scheme was being implemented retrospectively since April this year and incentives will soon be transferred to the beneficiaries. The scheme was announced in the state budget and was launched symbolically by agriculture minister Badal Patralekh, who handed over cheques to a few registered milk producers on Monday.“Payment against milk is done within a week. We have already transferred ₹2.5 crore to the federation for payment under the scheme for April, May and June. Payment for subsequent months would also be done soon. Initially, ₹4 crore was provided for it in the budget. But we expect the procurement to increase soon, so we will have to increase the budget,” said Jha.The officer added that there was zero possibility of any pilferage as the incentives will be transferred to bank accounts of milk producers registered with the federation.“We have their details including bank accounts. We have farmers who are selling as little as five litres of milk everyday and also those who are supplying hundreds of litres daily,” said Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-launches-incentive-for-milk-producers-selling-to-state-owned-dairy-101630493759253.html
01-09-2021||Delhi||Wanted: Non-saaya wedding dates||Picking a wedding date is about choosing an auspicious date, in consultation with a priest or pandit. But now, with the fear of a third Covid-19 wave looming large, couples are thinking beyond auspicious time periods, moving towards non-saaya dates. According to data put together by WeddingWire India, a wedding technology platform, there has been a 76% surge in demand for non-saaya dates, or dates that aren’t conventionally considered auspicious. And, this trend is being welcomed as a refreshing change. “Given how rooted Indians are in their culture and customs, the surge in demand for non-saaya weddings is a favourable change for the wedding industry. This radical change which was envisioned 2-3 years down the lane has been fast-tracked by the pandemic. If the trend continues to strike a chord with the consumers, it will drive new revenue opportunities for professionals in a $50 billion Indian wedding industry,” says Anam Zubair, associate director of marketing at WeddingWire India.Echoing similar views, Mehak Sagar, co-founder, WedMeGood also feels that Covid-19 further ensured that this trend gains steam. She says, “There are a lot of reasons why this is happening. With the uncertainty around, couples are planning with shorter timelines when cases are low, combined with the fact that they often get off season benefits for the same. It just makes a lot of sense to pick a date that’s convenient, where the weather is good and falls on a weekend.”Other wedding vendors including photographers, decorators and planners are also of the view that convenience and unpredictability are stimulating the trend. Megha Israni, founder of Israni Photography, which recently shot the Disha Parmar-Rahul Vaidya wedding, says, “We don’t know when the next Covid-19 wave is going to hit us. Couples don’t want to plan too many things for the future and are hence, comfortable in opting for non-saaya dates.”Aashna Saran of Aash Studio, which was in charge of décor at actor Dia Mirza’s wedding, feels off season opens up a pool of options for couples to choose from, while photographer Ankita Asthana, co-founder of WeddingNama, believes this trend has turned weddings into a year-long business, rather than a seasonal affair. The changes is also benefitting wedding vendors in getting more bookings. Another photographer, Shrey Bhagat, co-founder, Knotting Bells has been witnessing a drastic change in weddings taking place in off-season months. “We have witnessed a rise in off-season weddings, as we have several weddings lined up during September-October. Couples have started looking at monetary perks, as wedding vendors during a non-saaya days, charge a low package,” he says.Some also feel safety has taken precedence over deciding a date. “The new order of priority is checking government rules on number of guests, safety, availability of venue, budget and then the date,” says wedding planner Namha Malhotra, founder, Castles & Coasters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wanted-non-saaya-wedding-dates-101630492277636.html

01-09-2021||Kolkata||Coal smuggling case: Abhishek Banerjee’s wife asks ED to question her in Kolkata||Trinamool Congress (TMC) national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee on Wednesday did not visit the office of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Delhi where she was summoned for questioning in the coal smuggling case. Citing the risk of travelling during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, she wrote to the agency and said it would be convenient for her if ED officers questioned her at her Kolkata residence. “I am a mother of two infants and travelling to New Delhi physically alone in the midst of the pandemic will put my and the lives of my children at grave risk. It would be convenient for me if you consider asking me to appear in Kolkata at my residence since your organisation has its office in Kolkata and I reside in Kolkata too. Besides, as per my understanding, the alleged cause of action of the subject matter of your inquiry too arises out of West Bengal,” her letter, which HT has seen, said. Also Read | ED summons Mamata’s nephew, his wife over money laundering caseThe letter, which was leaked to the media on Wednesday afternoon, was dated August 31. The summons were dated August 18. ED officials did not comment on Rujira Banerjee’s letter. Rujira Banerjee was questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in February in connection with the same coal smuggling case. The CBI team had visited Abhishek Banerjee’s residence. In March, the CBI also questioned Rujira’s sister Maneka Gambhir and the latter’s husband Ankush Arora and father-in-law Pawan Arora. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee reacted sharply in February when a CBI team visited the south Kolkata residence of her nephew Abhishek Banerjee and served a notice to his wife. “A tiger cub is not scared of fighting cats and rats. Muscle flexing or threats of jail sentence cannot scare us. We have stood before guns in the past. I will not surrender as long as I am alive,” the chief minister said at a public event. The CBI registered a case regarding the issue on November 27 last year. It alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, was sold in the black market over several years in the western parts of West Bengal where Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines. Among the prime suspects is former TMC youth front general secretary and businessman Vinay Mishra, who renounced his Indian citizenship in December last year and became a citizen of Vanuatu, a small island country in the South Pacific Ocean. Abhishek Banerjee was earlier president of the TMC’s youth wing. He appointed 15 general secretaries, including Mishra, on July 20 last year. Last month, the Calcutta high court dismissed Mishra’s appeal for relief from the CBI probe and did not extend his bail. The ED summoned Abhishek Banerjee to its Delhi office on September 6. Three Indian Police Service officers, Shyam Singh, Gyanwant Singh and S Selvamurugan, have also been summoned to Delhi on September 8, 9 and 10 respectively in connection with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/coal-smuggling-case-abhishek-banerjee-s-wife-asks-ed-to-question-her-in-kolkata-101630491419813.html

He announces the name of the candidate on visiting the constituencies.The SAD being a regional party with a centralised chain of command is known for making early start before the elections.After snapping ties with the BJP over the three farm laws being opposed by the farmers, the SAD has tied up with the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party and given 20 seats to it in a prepoll arrangement.There are five to six months for the elections to take place in Punjab and other political parties, including the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party, are yet to announce names of candidates. These parties have decision making at the central leadership level, so the poll process is a lengthy one, particularly the announcement of candidates.Names of 12 halqa heads announcedCheema said that Punjab is already in election mode and candidates who want to contest have started working in their constituencies and the announcement is a mere formality.There are 12 halqa (area) heads announced by the party keeping in view the polls.

01-09-2021||Patna||One-fourth pending cases in Bihar courts related to excise, shows HC data||It is ironic that one of the largest chunks of pending litigation in the dry state of Bihar is made up of excise-related cases such as recovery of banned liquor, arrests of liquor smugglers and hooch tragedies, data shows.In the last three and a half years since 2018, the percentage of excise cases among total civil and criminal cases pending before the Patna high court has been around 19%, as per HC records. This rose to 21.75% in 2020, when the courts heard limited cases due to the pandemic.The impact on subordinate courts is greater with their share of pending excise cases being around 25%, as per official figures. It was 25.42% during 2020. The total number of civil cases pending in Bihar’s subordinate courts stands at a staggering 3.337 million, including over 2.878 million criminal cases.57,159 excise cases have been filed in Patna HC between 2018 and May 31, 2021. This includes 32,909 cases for regular bail, 23,495 for anticipatory bail and 314 for quashing besides others. The highest number of 26,270 cases was filed in 2019, up from 20,548 in 2018, though it dropped to 12,763 in 2020 and 8,070 in the first five months of 2021, largely due to the impact of the pandemic.In the subordinate courts, 217,000 excise cases piled up in the last three years, besides, the 230,000 bail cases related to prohibition.It was interesting to note that the border district of Kishanganj saw the lowest number of excise and prohibition-related bail cases in the last three years, while Bhojpur, Rohtas, Saran, Madhubani, Muzaffarpur, East Champaran and West Champaran reported the highest number of such cases during the period.In 2019, alarmed by the growing pendency, the Patna high court asked the state for a plan to dispose of these excise-related cases. Though special courts were mandated for trial of liquor prohibition related cases, they did not exist then and have not become functional even till today, despite cabinet’s nod.A senior official said on condition of anonymity that the government wanted at least one court in every district to exclusively hear excise cases and more than one court in bigger districts.“The government requested the HC for appointing judges. However, the HC authorised courts of additional district judges (ADJ) in each district to also hear excise cases in addition to other cases,” he added.While the litigations are growing, the number of judges in the HC has reached an all-time low with 35 vacancies (including the one to be created in September) against the sanctioned strength of 53.Last month, the Patna high court directed that all proceedings related to confiscation of property under the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 must positively be initiated/concluded within a period of 90 days from the date of appearance of the parties concerned and the appeal/revision, if any, be also decided within a period of 30 days from the date of initiation, failing which, the “things” (vehicle/property/ etc.) shall be deemed to have been released in terms of several orders passed by this court in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/onefourth-pending-cases-in-bihar-courts-related-to-excise-shows-hc-data-101630480917935.html

Its collections include images of Lord Buddha, Goddess Tara and of the Sun God carved in black stone.But all these had not been available for public viewing as the doors of the museum remained closed following the retirement of its curator in February 2019.On August 30, Dr Alok Ranjan, Bihar’s culture minister got its doors reopened for viewers.“The Saharsa museum, which is known as the Karu Khirhar Museum, has been the 26th in the list. It was created to conserve and display the antiquities discovered in this area, but since 2019, it’s been closed due to shortage of hands in the directorate of museums. But to revive it, the directorate has appointed some employees now,” he said. There are 27 government museums in the state including five in state capital Patna.Besides, the culture department has planned development of this museum to make it an effective institution for the conservation of antiquities. It will showcase the heritage of the Kosi and of the Mithila regions, the minister said.“We are planning for a better and bigger building for the museum. The district administration has provided land for this purpose in the Naya Bazaar area at Saharsa,” he said. The culture department will now get a detailed project report prepared for the Museum building, he added.Another official from the culture department, who did not want to be quoted, said Karu Khirhar Museum at Saharsa has been the most recent among the museums in the state. “It was set up to retain the antiquities and other archaeological findings of the region at the local level. There’s been a trend to take all the archaeological findings and discoveries from districts to the state capital,” the official said.Some of the Kosi region’s archaeological findings, which are now at the Saharsa Museum, were in the state capital earlier. In a bid to return them to their land, this Museum was created in 2004, the official added. “But security has been a big issue at this Museum. Also, there has also been a shortage of employees here. It remained closed earlier also due to the shortage of employees and was reopened in 2015 after a long gap of six years,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/repository-of-kosi-mithila-heritage-saharsa-museum-reopens-after-almost-3yrs-101630471436860.html

01-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court refuses bail to police constable who posed as RAW officer||Mumbai sessions court on Tuesday rejected the bail application of a police constable who allegedly posed as an officer of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and was arrested for cheating a city businessman with the promise of securing post-graduate medical seats for his two sons. Additional sessions judge RJ Katariya rejected bail plea of constable Nagesh Pawar on the grounds that the cheating amount was huge, the constable’s wife was yet to be arrested and the investigation was yet to be completed.Thirty-year-old Pawar, a Pune resident, was arrested by the Tilak Nagar police in Mumbai for allegedly cheating businessman Vasudeo Khetnani. Khetnani’s sons wanted to pursue post-graduate medical courses and the businessman met one Mahendra Kahar in connection with their admission. Kahar introduced him to Dinesh Kawa in June 2015, and the latter demanded ₹ 1.60 crore for securing admission for both the sons.Also Read | At 158,880, August Covid infections in Maharashtra 33% less than JulyKhetnani reportedly paid Kawa ₹ 55 lakh and drew a demand draft in the name of a college on his request. Later, he was asked to arrange ₹75 lakh.Thereafter, police said, Kawa, and Khetnani’s son met Pawar and his wife Roshani in Navi Mumbai and allegedly paid them ₹ 75 lakh. At the time Roshani allegedly boasted about her contacts with politicians and management of various medical colleges. Pawar was also introduced as a RAW agent. Khetnani’s sons did not get admission and the four accused return some amount to the businessman. Roshani executed a document acknowledging the receipt of money from Khetnani and undertaking to repay the amount.In February 2019, Khetnani registered a case of cheating at the Tilak Nagar police station.Seeking bail for the constable, Pawar’s counsel VS Tiwari claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case. The court rejected Pawar’s plea. Considering his role and the nature of the crime, he was not entitled to get bail at this stage, said the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-refuses-bail-to-police-constable-who-posed-as-raw-officer-101630467656942.html

01-09-2021||Kolkata||Aishe Ghosh, SFI leads stir at Visva Bharati against expulsion of students||Kolkata: Aishe Ghosh, the student union president at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University and other leaders of the Students Federation of India (SFI), the students’ wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Tuesday started an agitation at Visva Bharati University in West Bengal in protest against the expulsion of three students on disciplinary ground. The students, who were suspended in January last year, took part in agitations against several actions by vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty and visits by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders such as Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta in 2020 and Union home minister Amit Shah before the March-April assembly polls.Demanding Chakrabarty’s removal, Ghosh said, “He is acting on behalf of the Rashtriya Shayamsevak Sangh (RSS) that wants to establish control over several universities. They tried the same in JNU.”Students of Kolkata’s Jadavpur University also took part in the protest.Also Read: Visva-Bharati ‘temporarily suspended’ admission process, publication of resultsVisva Bharati students had been agitating outside the V-C’s on-campus residence since August 28 when the university’s executive council passed the expulsion order. The three students were earlier asked to submit their petition in regard to the decision on expulsion. On August 28, the executive council of Visva Bharati held on to its decision to expel the students, a member of the faculty association, who is aware of the development, said on condition of anonymity.“Several teachers are also under suspension. They have challenged the order,” the faculty association member said.Located at Bolpur in Birbhum district, Visva Bharati is Bengal’s only central university, of which the Prime Minister is the chancellor. Rabindranath Tagore founded Visva Bharati in 1921 and it was declared a central university in 1951.The V-C and the university did not make any statements till late Tuesday evening. The authorities have sent an e-mail to the local police, seeking security for the V-C’s quarters. In August last year, the V-C’s decision to cordon the campus led to a stir. A crowd comprising local residents and shopkeepers demolished two gates and damaged construction material kept for building a wall around the ground where an annual fair is held in December.The fair, popularly known as Poush Mela, draws thousands of people and even foreign tourists. For traders, the fair is a major source of income. While the V-C sought deployment of central paramilitary forces on campus following the vandalism, chief minister Mamata Banerjee disapproved of the wall.“When Tagore built Visva Bharati, he wanted students to be in the heart of nature and study in the open. He did not want wood and cement structures,” she said in August last year. In January last year also, there was student unrest when Swapan Dasgupta was invited by the authorities to speak on the Citizenship Amendment Act at a seminar.The following month, Chakrabarty triggered a controversy when he said those who gather at Delhi’s Rajghat donning white caps on Gandhi Jayanti are “the country’s biggest thieves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/aishe-ghosh-sfi-leads-stir-at-visva-bharati-against-expulsion-of-students-101630446055420.html
01-09-2021||Chandigarh||LIT trashes charges of auctioning prime land at throwaway prices||The Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) has found itself embroiled in another controversy over the e-auction of around 16,344 square yards of prime land in the Model Town Extension on August 16, with detractors alleging that the land had been sold at very low rates. While the land near the Dugri Canal Bridge has been auctioned for around ₹98.38 crore (including 6% cess), it has been alleged that the market value of the land is around ₹350 crore and the LIT, which being led by chairperson Raman Balasubramaniam, has fixed the reserve price at ₹91.86 crore, to benefit the bidders. BJP leader Bikram Singh Sidhu has submitted a complaint with Union home minister Amit Shah and Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, seeking a CBI inquiry into the alleged fraud and criminal cases against those involved. A copy has also been marked to the local bodies department director Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.Demanding cancellation of the auction proceedings, Bikram Singh alleged that the fraud had been committed on the behest of a Cabinet minister to benefit the bidders and the land mafia. “The market rate of the land in that area is at least ₹2 lakh per sq yard and a fraud of around ₹250 crore has been committed.” Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon also accused the LIT chairperson of committing fraud by finalising the reserve price of prime land at a lesser rate in comparison to the market value. “The LIT should focus on providing facilities to the public rather than auctioning properties at lesser rates to benefit bidders. This auction should be cancelled by the local bodies department,” Dhillon said. As per officers in the local bodies department, senior Congress leaders in the city have also brought the matter to the chief minister’s notice. One of the LIT officials, requesting anonymity, said senior officials of the local bodies department also took up the matter with the chairman. Chairperson refutes allegations Meanwhile, chairman Balasubramaniam refuted the allegations during a press conference organised at the LIT’s office on Tuesday saying that the action had been conducted in a transparent manner. “Information regarding the e-auction was published in national newspapers three times before the property was put on auction. Anybody could submit a bid. Four bidders participated in the auction for this property and many other properties were also auctioned by the LIT. All the proceedings were recorded,” he said. “The reserve price was fixed as per the norms and the bidders will be able to cover only 40% of the total space as per the norms and bylaws. However, property will be allotted subject to the approval of the local bodies department, which has been sought. Those claiming that ₹350 crore could be earned from the auction, should submit an offer with the LIT and we will cancel the e-auction and allot the property to their name,” the chairperson said, adding that the successful bidder had also submitted around ₹13 crore with the LIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lit-trashes-charges-of-auctioning-prime-land-at-throwaway-prices-101630445756012.html

The FIR has been lodged one-and-a-half months after the complaint was submitted by the commission. Unidentified persons have been booked under Section 7 and 9 of The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act. Geja Ram had recommended an FIR against the MC executive engineer and sub-divisional officer for allegedly forcing the sewermen to enter manholes to clean the sewer lines without safety kits in Jugiana area on July 16. Subsequently, MC officials including executive engineers, sub-divisional officers and junior engineers locked horns with Geja Ram, during the meeting of the commission convened to discuss the delay in lodging an FIR. The MC officials alleged that the chairperson himself had forced the employees to enter the manhole, to implicate MC staffers. The MC employees union had said that they will go on strike if an FIR was lodged against the MC officials.While the staff of MC’s operations and maintenance (O and M) cell is taking up the matter with the employees’ union, Geja Ram said that the FIR should name the accused officials. Meanwhile, Geja Ram said, “I will take up the matter with the officials at state level and will also move the high court so that appropriate action is taken against the officials who put the lives of sewermen at stake by forcing them to enter the manhole without safety kits.”Sahnewal station house officer (SHO) Balwinder Singh said an FIR has been lodged but no accused has been named in the case so far as it is not clear on whose directions manual scavenging was being done. A few videos of the incident have been submitted by Geja Ram and the MC officials, and in one of the videos Geja Ram can also be seen asking the sewermen to enter the manhole. These videos also need to be investigated before taking any action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/manual-scavenging-fir-lodged-against-unidentified-persons-101630445394268.html

The inquiry will be conducted by Additional SP Rajesh Meena.HT cannot verify the authenticity of the widely-circulating audio clips.The state government, however, ordered suspension of the three police personnel whose voices allegedly figure in the audio clips.Nagaur’s SHO Sadar police station Anju Kumari and constable Bhawarlal Burdi, and SHO Aklera police station in Jhalawar district Nand Kishore Verma have been placed under suspension following directions of Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, a statement by the government later said. Verma was earlier posted as SHO Sadar.Nagaur SP Abhijeet Singh said four audio clips emerged on 24 August at 10.30pm.

He has been arrested before.The SP said constable Bhanwarlal was suspended on August 25 on suspicion that he was linked to Ganesh.The police officer said SHO Nand Kishore’s role was also found to be suspicious in view of his conversation with Bhanwarlal in one of the audio clips.

He has even accused the MC officials of demanding commission for allotment of contracts and for releasing the payment of completed works.“This is not acceptable as it has put a blot on the image of the MC officials. If Jain fails to submit an apology or a proof of corruption in three days, we will raise an agitation which might also include a strike,” said Sahota.Meanwhile, Jain said that he has proof and will provide it to the MC employees union.

An analysis of the health department’s media bulletins reveals that against 241 deaths in July, the state registered 80 deaths in August. On the other hand, the state’s death toll in June was 1,502. Also, fresh cases in the state have dipped by nearly 57%, with 1,472 cases in August against June’s 3,495. The government experts say this is for the first time since June last year that the state has registered the positivity rate as low as 0.1%. “Our positivity rate for August remained one of the lowest in the country. The biggest factor behind this was that the state has not lowered testing. Our average daily testing count is 40,000-45,000,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.The analysis further revealed that the number of active cases further came down to 324 from 534 on July 31. With nearly 50% of the target population vaccinated with the first dose, the state registered a slight improvement in terms of vaccination as 39.5 lakh doses were administered in August. The data from the CoWIN portal reveals that state has administered 1.35 crore doses of vaccine against the target of 2.02 crore. Nearly 1.02 crore people have been inoculated with the first dose whereas 32.46 lakh have been fully vaccinated. “We are expecting 70 lakh doses soon though we have not received the arrival schedule,” said the nodal officer. The state continues to focus more on the first dose even after repeated instructions by the Centre to focus more on the second jab.Even as there are reports about rolling out vaccination strategy for below-18 age group in September, Punjab officials claim there is no such indication in this regard from the Centre as of now. “We have not received any official communication in this regard so far,” a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-situation-in-punjab-gets-better-no-signs-of-surge-yet-101630441434661.html

Addressing a gathering at the Batala grain market in the presence of two party MPs and four MLAs, the former Punjab Congress president said the party is united and will again form government in the state under the leadership of Amarinder Singh. Those from the Amarinder camp present on the occasion were Khadoor Sahib MP Jasbir Singh Dimpa, his Amritsar counterpart Gurjit Singh Aujla, and MLAs Fatehjung Singh Bajwa (Qadian), Balwinder Singh Ladi (Hargobindpur), Santokh Singh Bhalaipur (Baba Bakala) and Joginderpal (Bhoa). Bajwa said, “I have decided to play a proactive role in the state politics. I will contest the upcoming elections and that too from the Gurdaspur district. However, the final decision will be taken by the party leadership comprising Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Amarinder. They will take a call on which seat in the district I will be fielded from.” The district is also a stronghold of two state cabinet ministers—Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa— who have been supporting newly elected state party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, the one leading a banner of revolt against the CM.A strong critic of Amarinder not long ago, Bajwa hailed the CM on various fronts such as increasing the old age pension amount from ₹750 to ₹1,500 and hiking the state auured price (SAP) of sugarcane. “We are also taking measures to provide relief to people of the state in terms of electricity bills,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-show-of-strength-in-batala-cong-mp-bajwa-sings-capt-s-praises-101630441197251.html

Rawat, who arrived in Chandigarh to douse the fire of renewed feud between Captain and Sidhu, held a closed-door meeting with the PPCC chief and his team for nearly three hours.The meeting was attended by PPCC general secretary Pargat Singh and two co-presidents Kuljit Singh Nagra and Pawan Goel.Sources privy to the meeting said Sidhu conveyed his displeasure to Rawat over no action being taken on issues flagged by him. Sidhu maintained that if the key issues of drugs trafficking, cancellation of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private thermal plants and sacrilege are resolved, no one can stop the party from securing a thumping win in the upcoming assembly polls.Rawat, however, asked Sidhu and his aides to maintain discipline and not do anything that can dent party in the polls. Hours before Rawat’s arrival, Sidhu targeted his own government over its “failure to nab the drug traffickers in its tenure of over four years.” On Monday, Sidhu had upped ante on PPAs and demanded an extended assembly session to scrap them. Rawat kicks up rowAfter emerging out of the meeting, Rawat told mediapersons that he had met Panj Pyaras and all issues had been sorted out. He added that party’s office- bearers will be appointed within 15 days. Rawat’s statement evoked a sharp reaction from SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema who said the Congress leader has no right to equate his partymen, who are patits and have no knowledge about the Sikh religion, with Panj Pyaras (five beloved ones) who have a special place in Sikhism. He asked Rawat to withdraw his “irresponsible” statement and offer apology. “Otherwise, we will file a case against him for hurting religious sentiments,” Cheema said. On being contacted, Rawat’s aides said he will give a statement tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-air-differences-with-cm-amarinder-in-public-cong-s-punjab-affairs-in-charge-rawat-to-sidhu-camp-101630441134000.html
01-09-2021||Chandigarh||Now, Punjab CM questions Haryana counterpart on pro-farmer initiatives||In a sharp response to his Haryana counterpart’s tweets questioning him on farmer welfare measures, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said Manohar Lal Khattar’s claims were nothing but a shoddy defence against the nation-wide criticism of the ‘shameful treatment’ meted out to farmers by the BJP government. “Instead of apologising for the unprovoked attack on farmers in Karnal, Khattar had been brazenly defending the police action,” said Amarinder in a statement. Rebutting Haryana chief minister’s assertions that his government had done more for the farmers than the Punjab government, Amarinder said: “If that is the case, then why are farmers of your own state angry with you and your party?” Claiming that Haryana does not give a single paisa to its farmers in power subsidy, Amarinder said: “In Punjab, power subsidy of ₹7,200 crore is being provided every year for agriculture pump-sets of farmers.”Not only was Punjab leading the country in terms of procurement of key crops like wheat, paddy and cotton at MSP, it was also providing additional assistance to farmers to ensure smooth procurement in the face of the faulty policies of the BJP-led central government, said Captain.What Khattar had saidIn a series of tweets on Monday, Khattar had listed several steps taken by Haryana for farmers, and asked what Amarinder Singh’s government has done in comparison. “Who is anti-farmer, @capt_amarinder ji? Punjab or Haryana?” asked Khattar. “Dear @capt_amarinder ji, Haryana procures 10 crops at MSP—paddy, wheat, mustard, bajra, gram, moong, maize, ground nut, sun flower, cotton and makes the MSP payment directly into the account of the farmer. How many crops does Punjab buy from the farmer at MSP?” Khattar asked his Punjab counterpart. He also said that Haryana provides an incentive of ₹7,000 per acre to every farmer who wants to move away from paddy cultivation||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-punjab-cm-questions-haryana-counterpart-on-pro-farmer-initiatives-101630440593600.html

Also compensation should be announced for the injured and the dead, the statement said. “Farmers were protesting peacefully and showing black flags was no crime. This government always responds to the black flags with sticks. An officer was giving orders, which have no place in a democracy. This is a violation of the rights of citizens. The government wants to suppress the voice of the farmers, who have been agitating peacefully on the streets for the last nine months,” Selja said. Meanwhile, the student wing of the Congress party, National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) on Tuesday took out a protest march in Karnal against the recent lathi-charge on farmers. Led by the NSUI state president Divyanshu Budhiraja, the activists marched towards the residence of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar at Ram Nagar in Karnal.

In an interaction with mediapersons, Harjinder’s father Buta Singh and uncle Major Singh said they are with the farmers and actively participate in the farmers’ agitation. Buta Singh also shared photos in which he and his other son are sitting with the protesting farmers at Singhu border. Buta Singh, who is associated with the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), said he will continue to support the farmer’s agitation. “As the INLD has demanded an investigation into the lathi-charge episode from Karnal SP, I have decided to leave my post as INLD’s Kurukshetra district president until the investigation is over,” he added. “There is conspiracy to target Harjinder as some people had recorded his video when he was trying to disperse the farmers. Harjinder is an inspector when he is on duty and a farmer when home. We have earned everything from agriculture,” said Major Singh. Some members of Sikh community had held a protest outside the residence of Harjinder, accusing him of beating up Sikh farmers during the lathi-charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-backlash-father-of-karnal-sho-says-they-are-farmers-first-101630440176140.html
01-09-2021||Chandigarh||Bail to ex-Punjab DGP: HC judge lets off cop from contempt loop over email casting aspersions on bench||The Punjab and Haryana high court judge, who got an e-mail casting aspersions on him while dealing with petitions on the arrest of former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, has let off a state vigilance officer of contempt of court loop. The HC bench of Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi on Tuesday said “the majesty of the court is preserved and upheld not by initiation of contempt proceedings but by the manner in which it protects fundamental rights of the citizens and extends equal protection of laws and equality before law and justice to all who approach this court”. “...that is with what I would like this matter of initiation of contempt proceedings to end,” observed Justice Tyagi on the last day of his work on Tuesday while dealing with two applications moved by Saini. Saini was arrested by the vigilance bureau on August 18 evening in a September 2020 case. The next day, his wife had approached the HC terming his arrest illegal. The same day, a 2018 plea of Saini was also listed before justice Tyagi in which there were orders against the arrest of the ex-cop from high court. While the hearing was underway on August 19, an e-mail addressed to the chief justice came purportedly from Harvinder Pal Singh, investigating officer, in the September 2020 FIR, in which Saini was arrested. The e-mail, which was also marked to Justice Tyagi, wanted the case transferred from him to other bench casting aspersions on him. In that day’s order, Justice Tyagi observed that the court reserved the right to initiate contempt proceedings against the officer in view of the fact that vigilance as well as government counsels had submitted that he was not authorised for the same. “I am of the considered view that where litigant has a reasonable apprehension of not getting justice from a particular court, he has the remedy of applying for transfer of the case. In case of filing such application in respect of a case pending in this court, the matter lies in the discretion of the chief justice to take a decision,” Justice Tyagi observed, adding the email should not have been sent to the bench presided over by him.“The e-mail seems to have been sent by an over-enthusiastic police officer but the same could not be a matter of his own choice. He seems to have been ill-advised regarding the same by someone from behind the scene. I am not only conscious of the harsh reality that the police officers work under tremendous pressure and even risk their lives in their fight against crime but unfortunately they also have to tow the line of those in power,” he added.On Tuesday, the court was hearing two pleas. Saini had approached the high court for advancing of hearing from September 9 claiming that he feared he could be arrested in some fresh case. Another plea was to bring on record alleged interviews by vigilance department officers in which they were accusing Justice Tyagi of passing order “in a tearing hurry” and not affording any opportunity of hearing to the department. Both the applications were withdrawn by Saini. One more plea filed by Saini alleging contempt of court by vigilance department officers will be taken up by high court on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bail-to-ex-punjab-dgp-hc-judge-lets-off-cop-from-contempt-loop-over-email-casting-aspersions-on-bench-101630440173586.html

Led by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, the constituency-wise campaign had started on August 18 with an eye on 2022 Punjab assembly polls. Party’s top leaders discussed the issue after a section of farmers clashed with Akali workers during one such programme in Samrala on Monday, while there had been sporadic incidents of farmers opposing Sukhbir’s events. The party also announced that there will be no change in the Wednesday’s event scheduled to be held at Sahnewal (close to Samrala) in Ludhiana. “The SAD had voted against the three anti-farmer black laws, quit the Union cabinet and ended alliance with the BJP to register its protest,” said the core committee, urging the farm bodies to support the programmes announced by the party. Party’s top leaders , meanwhile, appreciated the statements of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) against attempts to sabotage activities of ‘farmer-friendly’ political parties. “Statement by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) assumes significance as the SAD is the only party engaged in mass contact programme in the state,” said Sukhbir’s principal adviser Harcharan Singh Bains. BKU Dakounda general secretary Jagmohan Singh said, “Farmers can seek answers from leaders of political parties, but clashes or any attempt to interfere in their matter must be avoided.” Maluka stays awaySAD’s key leader from Malwa and a member of the core committee, Sikandar Singh Maluka, who is considered close to the Badals, stayed away from the Tuesday’s meeting. He is seeking ticket from Rampura Phul segment for his son Gurpreet Singh and wanted to contest on Maur seat where the party intends to make Jagmeet Brar a candidate. Maluka has expressed his resentment in public, but the party leadership maintained silence on the matter. There was no discussion on the issue in Tuesday’s meeting as well. Despite repeated attempts, comments of Maluka could not be elicited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbirs-mass-contact-programme-will-continue-sad-s-core-committee-101630440113855.html
01-09-2021||Chandigarh||New specifications for paddy procurement irk Punjab farmers, rice millers||PatialaThe new quality specification fixed by the central government for the procurement of paddy has irked rice millers and farmers in Punjab. The rice millers in the state have already threatened to boycott the procurement process, terming the new rules as an indirect attack on farmers, who are protesting against the three farm laws for more than nine months. According to the new specifications in case of rice, stricter quality control measures have been put in place for the millers as broken grain percentage has been reduced to 20% from the earlier 25%. Moreover, the moisture content in rice to be accepted from millers has also been reduced from 15% to 14%. The damaged grain percentage has come down from 3% to 2%, while the red grains, which earlier had the limit of 3%, will not be accepted as per new specifications.In the case of paddy unloaded at grain markets, the central government has reduced the moisture content limit from 17% to 16%, while the permissible limit of foreign matter (organic and inorganic) has been lowered from 2% to 1%. The percentage of discoloured, sprouted and damaged has been reduced to 3% from 5%.Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda), said the Centre is hell-bent on taking anti-farmer stance. “We were demanding increase in the moisture content, but the government has reduced it in the new specifications. With the new rules, the government is inching forward in implementing its plan to minimise procurement process across the country,” Singh said. President of the Punjab Rice Millers Association Tarsem Saini said the new specifications are neither miller-friendly nor farmer or consumer-friendly. “The central government has ignored major stakeholders while coming up with these norms. Not even a single farmer or a rice miller was part of expert committee which recommended these specifications,” he said.Saini said the state government should take up the matter strongly with Centre as it is not viable to follow new norms on the ground.On August 29, Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Kumar wrote to Union minister for consumer affairs, food and Public distribution Piyush Goyal for his immediate intervention to put these specifications on hold.“These would have adverse effect on the farmers as it is very difficult to deal the with moisture content at the time of harvesting and procurement due to decrease in temperature,” Sharma had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-specifications-for-paddy-procurement-irk-punjab-farmers-rice-millers-101630439875308.html

Chandigarh Police resorted to using water cannons to prevent the agitators from breaking the barricades.

Hooda alleged the lathi-charge was planned by the government. “The planning is evident from the video of an officer who is instructing cops to hit the farmers on their heads,’’ Hooda said. Commenting on the completion of 2,500 days of the BJP government, the leader of the opposition said that no new railway or metro line, university, power plant, national-level institute or a big industry was set up in the state during the BJP rule. “Both the terms of the BJP-led government have been full of failures. Then what are the celebrations for? Is the government celebrating the fact that it has made Haryana number one in unemployment, crime, drugs, scams, farmer protests and pollution? Is the government celebrating the fact that it got the farmers thrashed? ” the former chief minister said. Guv asked to return land acquisition amendment bill to assembly The Congress MLAs also submitted a memorandum to the Haryana governor asking him to return a Bill recently passed by the assembly to amend the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, to the legislative assembly for reconsideration. The Haryana amendment bill proposes to exempt certain development projects, rural infrastructure, affordable housing, industrial corridors, health and education and urban metro rail projects from the ambit of social impact assessment study and provision to safeguard food security. “This bill is anti-farmer, anti-poor and undemocratic. The bill was passed hurriedly without detailed discussion in the House,” Hooda said. Addressing a press conference, Hooda said the amendment bill was against the spirit of the Principal Act, 2013 passed by the Parliament and will hurt the interest of farmers who are already agitating against three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-mlas-demand-judicial-probe-into-karnal-canecharge-101630439695485.html

01-09-2021||Chandigarh||SC puts Centre, Chandigarh admn on notice on private schools’ plea||The Centre and UT administration have been put on notice by the Supreme Court, after the Independent School Association, Chandigarh, filed a petition against the Punjab and Haryana high court’s ruling on uploading of balance sheets online. The apex court heard the matter on August 27, and has sought a reply on the issue from the government within three weeks. Earlier this year, the UT education department had issued show-cause notices to private schools, warning of penalties for not uploading balance sheets for the last financial year. The Independent School Association, which represents around 78 schools in the tricity, had then approached the high court against the notices and constitution of a fee regulatory authority. They reasoned that uploading balance sheets would violate their right to privacy and would also make it difficult to run schools.However, the bench of justices Jaswant Singh and Sant Parkash had ruled against the schools. “Since the field of education is a charitable occupation, we do not find any reason to hold that uploading of the financial statements... will breach the right to privacy,” the 107-page judgment noted. Following this, on August 19, the education department had written to all schools to upload their balance sheets within two months or face action.“There are a few constitutional irregularities in the ruling, which we have pointed out in the petition to the Supreme Court,” said HS Mamik, president of Independent School Association.Meanwhile, senior officials of the education department maintained that they are just enforcing the high court’s directions. An official, who did not wish to be named, said that failure to upload balance sheets will invite action under the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016, as extended to the UT and adopted in 2018. “Such schools can also be held in contempt of court,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-puts-centre-chandigarh-admn-on-notice-on-private-schools-plea-101630438258560.html

For expediting trials all sessions judges have been directed to ensure that cases of honour killing are assigned to the designated court/fast track court to ensure expeditious disposal of such cases within six months as directed by Supreme Court. This direction would apply even to pending cases, the court ordered, adding that courts would conduct trial on day-to-day basis and coercive process should be taken to secure presence of the witnesses, if required. In cases where the trial is not concluded within six months, the court concerned would submit the progress report to high court seeking extension.

01-09-2021||Chandigarh||Now, Sidhu questions Punjab govt on ‘inaction’ in drug peddling cases||ChandigarhPunjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Tuesday questioned his own government on the “inaction” against those involved in drug peddling.In a statement, Sidhu said numerous tormented mothers, who had lost their children due to the drug menace spread across the state, and people were waiting for the report of the special task force (STF) on former Akali minister Bikram Singh Majithia. In February 2018, the STF filed a status report in the Punjab and Haryana high court. Later, the government filed before the court an opinion-cum-status report, and the matter is still in the court, he said. The STF report on Majithia in the ₹6,000-crore Bhola drug racket is likely to be opened by a division bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court on September 2.Questioning the government’s “inaction”, Sidhu said that despite the court’s directions, nothing had done to extradite the 13 drug smugglers back to India, who peddled drugs into Punjab and smuggled drugs to some countries. “These drug smugglers operated under the cover of government security using VIP vehicles,” he alleged.Sidhu said even a common man could sense why these drug smugglers had not been extradited for the past five years. “Because had they been brought to book, they would have spilled the beans and exposed the unholy nexus of drug peddlers and politicians,” he added.He claimed that the money exchanged with Amritsar-based businessman Jagjit Singh Chahal and statements by Bhola and Majithia’s former election agent Maninder Singh, alias Bittu Aulakh, are proof of the former minister’s involvement in the case.“What are we hiding? Why no action? Why no transparency? Why this delay?” Sidhu questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-sidhu-questions-punjab-govt-on-inaction-in-drug-peddling-cases-101630438193440.html

The accused, Saroop Singh of Johal Dhai Wala village in Goindwal Sahib sub-division, was arrested by a team led by Tarn Taran city station house officer (SHO) Jaswant Singh around 11pm on Monday. Saroop, who was a highly radicalised operative, had been linked with a foreign-based terror entity, said police, adding that their vigil has thwarted another possible terrorist attack in the border state.The team intercepted Saroop, who was riding a motorcycle, near the village and searched him on suspicion, leading to the recovery of the two hand-grenades, a mobile phone, an Aadhaar card and a driving licence. “On the occasion of Krishna Janmashtami, we had increased vigil that led to the arrest,” said a senior police official, requesting anonymity. Director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said that during preliminary investigations, Saroop has revealed that he came in contact with foreign-based terror handlers over social media and was further radicalised, cultivated by them and motivated to carry out terror acts in Punjab.Saroop further disclosed that his foreign based-handlers had arranged a consignment of two hand grenades for him, said the DGP, adding that the accused had already conducted recce of a few sensitive targets in Amritsar and Ludhiana. A training video sent by his foreign handlers explaining how to successfully explode a hand-grenade has also been recovered from the mobile phone of the accused, he said.The DGP said preliminary investigations suggest that all these consignments are being sent from across the border by terror organisations for carrying out strikes in Punjab.A case under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Explosives Substances (Amendment) Act has been registered against the accused at the Tarn Taran city police station.The development came at a time when Punjab has been witnessing huge influx of grenades and RDX-laden tiffin boxes, besides recovery of arms and ammunition, signalling major attempts being made by foreign-based terrorists to disturb peace in the border state.On August 8, the Amritsar rural police had recovered five hand-grenades, along with a tiffin bomb from Daleke village in Lopoke. The state special operation cell, Amritsar, had on August 16 recovered two hand-grenades of the same make besides other weapons from Amritpal Singh and Shammi. Similarly, the Kapurthala police also recovered two hand-grenades, a tiffin bomb and other explosive material from Gurmukh Singh Brar and his associate from Phagwara on August 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/terror-plot-foiled-man-held-with-2-grenades-in-tarn-taran-101630438074568.html

The Islamist group also blocked roads leading to the valley, news agency ANI reported citing Afghan media outlet Tolo News.Panjshir remains the only province out of Taliban’s reach.“They have cut off telecommunication services in Panjshir for the past two days. The people are facing challenges in this regard and cannot get in touch with their relatives living in other parts of the country,” a resident of the province said.People living in Kabul also told Tolo News that they were unable to reach out to their relatives and friends living in the region. “All my relatives and friends are in Panjshir. Unfortunately, on one hand, the road to Panjshir is closed and on the other hand, the communication networks are not working,” a Kabul resident said. The blockage of roads has also led to rise in prices of food in the valley.The developments came two days after the Taliban attacked an outpost in Panjshir. Panjshir lies in the Hindu Kush mountains, approximately 145km north of Kabul. The Taliban is yet unable to take this major holdout of resistance despite taking over Afghanistan in a matter of weeks.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-snaps-internet-services-in-panjshir-101630520549163.html

These include journalists, women’s rights activists, former officials and extremely vulnerable individuals.However, defence secretary Ben Wallace said as many as 1,100 Afghans who were entitled to come to the UK, were left behind.Meanwhile, current and former officials have hit out at the UK government and suggested that many more could have been rescued from Afghanistan in recent months.But Dominic Raab defended the government’s approach and insisted that Britain had prepared for all eventualities ahead of the Taliban August takeover and will continue to try helping people flee the new regime in Kabul.“We started planning in June for the contingency of an evacuation and the full drawdown of the embassy,” Raab said as he was being accused by the opposition leaders for failing to cut short a vacation in Greece as the Taliban rapidly advanced to take over Afghanistan. The foreign secretary only came back to London after Kabul fell into the hands of the Islamic Emirate on August 15.Ahead of his visit to neighbouring countries of Afghanistan, Raab also said the Foreign Office is dispatching 15-person “rapid deployment teams” to continue with the evacuation efforts.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dominic-raab-heads-to-afghanistan-s-neighbours-to-hold-talks-on-evacuations-101630516711297.html
01-09-2021||World||Pope uses Putin's words to chide West's Afghan war. He thought it was Merkel's||Pope Francis has criticized the West's two-decade-long involvement in Afghanistan as an outsider's attempt to impose democracy — although he did it by citing Russian President Vladimir Putin while thinking he was quoting German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Asked during a radio interview aired Wednesday about the new political map taking shape in Afghanistan after the United States and its allies withdrew from the Taliban-controlled country following 20 years of war, the pope said he would answer with a quote that he attributed to Merkel, whom he described as “one of the world's greatest political figures.”“It is necessary to put an end to the irresponsible policy of intervening from outside and building democracy in other countries, ignoring the traditions of the peoples," the pope said, using his own translation into Spanish.But the words were spoken last month by Putin in the presence of Merkel, during her visit to Moscow.During the meeting on Aug. 20, Putin scathingly criticized the West over Afghanistan, saying that the Taliban’s rapid sweep over the country has shown the futility of Western attempts to enforce its own vision of democracy. At a news conference with Putin, Merkel conceded that the operation had failed in delivering a clear future for Afghans."We did not want to force any system on Afghanistan,” Merkel told reporters. “But we saw that millions of girls were glad to go to school and that women could participate. There are many in Afghanistan who are very, very unhappy about developments now.”Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, refused to comment directly on the pope's comments when asked on Wednesday, but he added that Merkel's position on Afghanistan was well known and repeated during a recent speech to the German parliament.The goal of no international terror attacks from Afghanistan since the military operation started in 2001 “was achieved,” Merkel told German lawmakers on Aug. 25: "That was a concrete contribution to the safety of our country.”Although she acknowledged that the West's goals may have been too ambitious and cultural differences and corruption may have been underestimated, she also said that the mission in Afghanistan “wasn’t futile” for the country’s population, as it helped reduce child mortality, deliver drinking water and electricity to a majority of Afghans and protected rule of law and the basic rights of women and others.Merkel said the analysis of what went wrong would take time and each international mission would need to be assessed on its own, but she added that “we must not and won’t forget Afghanistan, because even if it doesn’t look like it in this bitter hour I’m convinced that no violence and no ideology will stop people’s urge toward freedom, justice and peace forever.”The Vatican didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the pope's interview with Spain's Cadena COPE, which took place Friday at his residence. The radio station owned by Spain's Catholic bishops' conference aired the talk on Wednesday and said that its content had been vetted by the pope himself.Francis also said that “not all eventualities were taken into account” in the departure of Western allies from Afghanistan.“I don’t know whether there will be a review or not (about what happened during the withdrawal), but certainly there was a lot of deception perhaps on the part of the new (Afghan) authorities,” said the pope. “I say deceit or a lot of naivety.”He said he believed that the Vatican’s top diplomat was offering to engage in Afghanistan to make sure that locals don’t suffer and called for Christians across the world to engage in “prayer, penance and fasting” in the face of events in Afghanistan.In the interview, Pope Francis addressed direct questions about his health for the first time since he underwent bowel surgery in early July.He said his body is adjusting well to the removal of part of his colon and that he can now eat whatever he wants and leads “a totally normal life.”He said that he expected his trip to Slovakia and Hungary between Sept. 12-15 would be as busy as previous ones. He also has an upcoming tour taking him to Cyprus, Greece and Malta.The pope also said he was expecting to appear and speak at the U.N.-sponsored COP26 climate talks in November in Glasgow, Scotland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-uses-putin-s-words-to-chide-west-s-afghan-war-he-thought-it-was-merkels-101630516853702.html

The findings on Wednesday were the result of an investigation by domestic distributor Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, the ministry said in a statement."Stainless steel is routinely used in heart valves, joint replacements and metal sutures and staples. As such, it is not expected that injection of the particles identified in these lots in Japan would result in increased medical risk," Takeda and Moderna said in a joint statement.The use of three lots of Moderna vaccines was suspended on Thursday after 39 vials were found to contain foreign material. All the vials came from a single lot, but two others were suspended as a precaution as they all came from the same manufacturing line of Spanish pharmaceutical company Rovi , which bottles Moderna vaccines.The most probable cause of the contamination was related to friction between two pieces of metal in the machinery that puts stoppers on the vials, Takeda said, citing a joint investigation with Moderna and Rovi. The material was confirmed to be grade 316 stainless steel.The three suspended lots were the only ones affected by the manufacturing issue and Rovi has taken corrective measures, the statement said.Use of other doses of the Moderna vaccine from different batches also was temporarily halted in three regions in Japan this week. In some cases, foreign substances have been found in unused vials, whereas others appear to be caused when bits of the vials' rubber stopper break off when needles are incorrectly inserted.The contamination issue gained more attention after the health ministry said on Saturday that two men, aged 38 and 30, died in August within days of receiving their second Moderna doses. Each had received a dose from one of the suspended lots.The cause of death in the two cases is still being investigated. Takeda said there was no evidence the fatalities were caused by the vaccine."The relationship is currently considered to be coincidental," the company said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stainless-steel-particles-found-in-suspended-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-japan-101630511400222.html
01-09-2021||World||Taliban affiliate Al Qaeda calls for liberation of Kashmir as part of global jihad||The Narendra Modi government has noted with concern the statement issued by Taliban affiliate Al Qaeda on Tuesday praising the Sunni Pashtun US-designated terrorist group for humiliating and defeating American forces and then expelling them from Afghanistan and virtually exhorting the Islamist forces to launch global jihad to liberate Palestine, Islamic Magreb, Somalia, Yemen and Kashmir from the enemies of Islam. The Al Qaeda statement came on the day the senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Stanakzai assured the Indian envoy to Qatar that no anti-India activity would be allowed in Afghanistan.While US President Joe Biden claimed victory in Afghanistan after what he called decimating of Al Qaeda and killing of their leader Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda statement shows the group is alive and kicking in Afghanistan as it sought the allegiance of Taliban supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akundzada and previous two Ameer-ul-Momeen of the Islamist group including Mullah Omar. Just as the Taliban have never raised the issue of Kashmir, they have also never criticised the Al Qaeda group. The statement reveals that the so-called liberation of Afghanistan was the first step and a precursor to global jihad by the Islamist group. It is quite evident that the capture of Kabul by the Taliban has made the group a rallying point for all jihadists in the world.On Tuesday, Al Qaeda called on the Taliban to "liberate" Kashmir, Palestine, Yemen and other "Islamic lands" just as they liberated Afghanistan from the US occupation. In a message congratulating the Taliban, the terrorist group said that the victory of insurgents in Afghanistan demonstrated what the Islamic nation is capable of, adding that “jihad is the only way” towards “victory and empowerment”."It is time for you to prepare for the next stage of the struggle, the way for which has been paved by the victory of the defiant Afghan nation," al Qaeda said, asserting that the victory of the Taliban is a prelude to the “liberation” of the rest of the Islamic nations.Also Read | Taliban discuss Kabul airport ops in official meet with Dutch delegates in DohaThe terrorist group, co-founded by Osama bin Laden in 1988, claimed that the complete withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan has humiliated the United States and tarnished its global reputation. Calling Afghanistan a “graveyard of empires and an impregnable fortress of Islam”, al Qaeda said that the war-torn country has “successfully defeated and expelled” an invading imperialist power twice within a span of fewer than two centuries. The group extended its congratulations to Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.“On this historic occasion, we would like to offer our congratulations to the leadership of Islamic Emirate, specifically to the Leader of the Believers, Hibbatullah Akhundzada,” it said.The Taliban has repeatedly assured other countries, including India and the US, that they won’t allow terrorist groups to use Afghan soil against them. In the peace deal signed between the US and Taliban which led to the foreign troops’ withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Islamist fundamentalists have specifically pledged to prevent al Qaeda and other terrorist networks from using Afghan soil.“It is time for you to prepare for the next stage of the struggle, the way for which has been paved by the victory of the defiant Afghan nation. With the help of Allah, this historic victory will open the way for the Muslim masses to achieve liberation from the despotic rule of tyrants who have been imposed by the West on the Islamic world,” al Qaeda made the clarion call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-affiliate-al-qaeda-calls-for-liberation-of-kashmir-as-part-of-global-jihad-101630507902807.html

Both the vaccines follow a two-dose regimen and are based on the mRNA technology. Further, the people who have so far been immunised with the single-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine will also be receiving a Pfizer shot as a booster at least four weeks after the first vaccination, the Associated Press reported.Also read | Do Covid-19 vaccine boosters help? This Israeli study has answersMeanwhile, the booster campaign also began in nursing homes across the country on September 12, the Associated Press also reported, citing the country’s health ministry. Close to 18 million people would be eligible to receive booster doses. France became the first major European nation to begin inoculating its citizens with booster doses, with several other countries in Europe to follow.Earlier on August 24, the French National Authority for Health (HAS), announced its recommendations regarding the booster programme. It also said that the fourth wave of Covid-19 was proceeding in the country and was driven by the Delta variant. “HAS considers that there is no sufficient argument, till date, to preferentially recommend one vaccine over the other for the booster dose, and that the two available mRNA vaccines are very effective against severe forms of Covid-19, including those related to the Delta variant,” it said in a statement.The booster programme in France begins as 70% of the adult population have been fully vaccinated in the European Union. Data from the Covid-19 vaccine dashboard of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) showed that as of September 1, 76.3% of the French population have been inoculated with at least one dose of the vaccine while 61.8% have been fully vaccinated.Notably, the World Health Organization has previously expressed their concerns about booster programmes in countries that have sufficient vaccine arsenal while some countries have not even delivered first doses to their population. Several WHO experts have earlier expressed concerns about equitable distribution of vaccines globally and also said that the present data does not show that a booster shot was needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-begins-administering-covid-19-boosters-for-65-people-with-underlying-health-conditions-101630508496382.html

It was India's first officially acknowledged contact with the Taliban since its formation in 90s.During the meeting, India raised the issues of safe return of its citizens still stranded in Afghanistan and concerns about Afghan soil being used for anti-India activities and terrorism.

The commission added that additional funds could be made available.The EU is eager to avoid a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis caused by the Syrian war when more than a million migrants entered the bloc. The EU will focus on development aid, including support for refugees in Afghanistan’s neighbors like Pakistan and Tajikistan to prevent migration flows from reaching the EU, according to the note. “The EU will engage and strengthen its support to third countries, in particular the neighboring and transit countries, hosting large numbers of migrants and refugees,” according to a statement after a Tuesday emergency meeting of EU home affairs ministers in Brussels. “The EU will also cooperate with those countries to prevent illegal migration from the region.”An email seeking comment from the commission wasn’t immediately returned. ‘Strategic Mistake’Support for refugees is a fraught topic in the bloc, with several member states firmly opposed to accepting any migrants. Janez Jansa, prime minister of Slovenia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU, said on Twitter last month that Europe shouldn’t open any humanitarian migration corridors for Afghanistan to avoid the “strategic mistake” of 2015. Even though about 500,000 people have been displaced in Afghanistan this year, flows of people into neighboring countries have been muted, according to the note, which added there had been no significant movements toward the EU. The EU has currently suspended development aid to Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of the country but has earmarked about 1 billion euros under its current budget, according to the note. These funds would be conditional on a number of factors, including allowing safe passages, the respect of human rights, fighting terrorism and the creation of an inclusive government, the note said.The number of those fleeing Afghanistan is expected to rise, according to the note, with officials agreeing on the need for security checks and to address the risk of irregular migration and human smuggling. Officials also highlighted the risks posed by Afghanistan becoming a haven for terrorists, the dangers posed by the large amounts of weapons left behind by the US and the Taliban becoming an inspiration for extremist movements and disinformation, including in the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-mulls-plan-to-spend-300-million-euros-to-resettle-30-000-afghan-refugees-101630501146192.html

The Northern Alliance, a coalition of ethnic Uzbek and Tajik forces concentrated in Panjshir Valley, has vowed to continue fighting the Taliban.Ahmad Massoud, son of the slain hero of the anti-Soviet resistance Ahmad Shah Massoud, has been leading the anti-Taliban coalition in Panjshir. Amrullah Saleh, the first vice president of the ousted Afghan government, has backed the coalition in their fight against the Taliban.The senior Taliban official blamed the leaders of Panjshir for the failed negotiations, saying there are still some people in the valley who "don't want the problems to be solved peacefully."Now it is up to you to talk to them," Muttaqi said in a message to the people of Panjshir. "Those who want to fight, tell them it is enough."Watch: Taliban men killed by Panjshir Resistance fightersReports suggest that the Taliban fighters attacked the valley from two fronts as soon as the last US soldiers boarded their flight out of Afghanistan to end the decades-long war.Fahim Dashti, an official of the National Resistance Front comprising anti-Taliban militia fighters and former Afghan security forces, said that the Taliban perhaps wanted to "try their luck.""By the grace of God, luck wasn't on their side," Dashti said in a video posted by Voice of America's Dari language service.The mountain valley, which begins around 80 kilometres north of the capital Kabul, stood strong against the Taliban rule from 1996-2001 before the US-led foreign troops invaded Afghanistan.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/those-who-want-to-fight-taliban-s-message-to-panjshir-leaders-after-talks-fail-101630496689639.html

They said that these vaccines are designed to induce a strong and long-lasting immune response through the creation of memory T-cells and B-cells.These cells are capable of responding to protein targets called antigens present in other disease causing microbes, including the viral antigens in Sars-CoV-2, the researchers further said.The study has been published in the journal Med.The researchers conducted laboratory-based analyses using sensitive, new techniques to detect and characterise T-cell responses to antigens.They applied these techniques to measure the response of T-cells isolated from the blood of Covid-19 convalescent patients and those vaccinated against the disease to antigens from Sars-CoV-2 and the MMR and Tdap vaccines."The researchers observed an association where individuals with Covid-19 who had either MMR or Tdap vaccines had a much lower frequency of going to the intensive care unit or dying," said study co-author Andrew Lichtman.Those who had previously been vaccinated for MMR had a 38 per cent decrease in hospitalisation and a 32 per cent decrease in ICU admission or death, while patients previously vaccinated for Tdap had 23 per cent and 20 per cent decreased rates, according to the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-can-routine-measles-and-tetanus-vaccination-prevent-covid-19-study-explains-101630496523401.html
01-09-2021||World||‘Heroic’ Afghanistan has turned a new page: China||China on Wednesday described Afghanistan as a “heroic country”, which never surrendered to foreign forces, adding that it has turned a new page following the US’s chaotic exit after a 20-year conflict.The Chinese foreign ministry also called for an investigation into the death of Afghan civilians during the two-decade conflict, saying US airstrikes led to far more civilian deaths than the official statistics of the US government reveal.China has repeatedly criticised an ill-planned US withdrawal and has said it is ready to deepen “friendly and cooperative” relations with the Taliban following their takeover in August.“Chairman Mao Zedong once said that Afghanistan is a heroic country and has never surrendered. China and Afghanistan are friendly countries. China does not want to harm Afghanistan, and Afghanistan does not want to harm China. The two countries always support each other,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday.Wang was responding to a question about reports that the Taliban will announce a new government on Friday. “The Afghan people, having suffered so much, are now standing at a new starting point for national peace and reconstruction. The international community is closely following developments including the formation of a new government in Afghanistan.”Wang added that China hopes that all parties in Afghanistan will build an open and inclusive political structure, adopt moderate and prudent domestic and foreign policies, and make a clean break with all terrorist groups and live in good terms with other countries, especially its neighbours.“China will as always pursue a friendly policy towards the entire Afghan people, respect Afghanistan’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and will not interfere in the country’s internal affairs,” Wang added.“The US forces have withdrawn from Afghanistan. But the murder of civilians by the US forces and their allies over the past 20 years must be investigated thoroughly and the killers must be brought to justice,” Wang said.Separately, in an interview to Chinese national broadcaster’s English channel, CGTN, the Taliban has said it is looking forward to developing a strong relationship with China. “China is a very important and strong country in our neighbourhood, and we have had very positive and good relations with China in the past,” Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the group, said.“We want to make these relations even stronger and want to improve the level of mutual trust,” Mujahid said, adding that Beijing can support Afghanistan in the economic sector. “We want them to boost exports to our country and help us in the development of our country. We are looking forward to good relations with them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heroic-afghanistan-has-turned-a-new-page-china-101630496219890.html

By 2001, when US-led forces invaded, the Taliban had seized control of most of the country.At Kandahar Cricket Ground, white-bearded Taliban leaders waited in the shade in the players' dugout, reclining on armchairs behind wooden coffee tables as they waited for the parade to start.Others sat crossed-legged on the grass, while hundreds more gathered in the terrace stand to watch.The Taliban's secretive supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada is living in Kandahar, the group said Sunday, after years in the shadows.Word had spread that he would make an appearance Wednesday, but he did not show up, leaving the city's new governor to address the crowd.In footage posted online of the build-up to the event, another helicopter flew overhead trailing a Taliban flag as fighters in headscarves waved beneath.A day earlier thousands of Taliban faithful had poured onto the streets of Kandahar, waving flags and shouting "God is greatest" in celebration at the final US withdrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-leaders-waited-in-players-dugout-for-parade-showing-off-us-hardware-in-kandahar-101630488072586.html

It has been carried out by researchers in Brazil and published in the scientific journal Molecules.The researchers said that a molecule produced by the jararacussu pit viper inhibited the coronavirus' ability to multiply by 75 per cent. They arrived at the figure by conducting tests on monkeys.Already known for its antibacterial qualities, the peptide can be synthesised in the laboratory, said Rafael Guido, a University of Sao Paulo professor and an author of the study, in an interview, making the capture or raising of the snakes unnecessary.The scientists called it a possible first step toward a drug to combat the virus causing Covid-19. They hope to test the substance in human cells but have not given any timeline.This is yet another experiment to find a way to stop Covid-19 from spreading, especially in the wake of reports from many countries that the effect of currently available vaccines is beginning to fade.Reserarchers in Britain released a study last week, which said that protection against Covid-19 offered by two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines begins to fade within six months.The effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine after the second dose fell from 88 per cent to 74 per cent, an analysis of data collected in Britain's ZOE Covid study showed.For the AstraZeneca vaccine, effectiveness fell from 77 per cent to 67 per cent after four to five months.Britain and other European nations are planning for a Covid-19 vaccine booster campaign later this year after top vaccine advisers said it might be necessary to give third shots to the elderly and most vulnerable from September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-viper-s-venom-can-stops-covid-19-from-multiplying-claim-scientists-101630488455000.html

The presenter of the show, Yves de Mbella, has been suspended, the channel said.The prime-time show was broadcast on Monday where de Mbella asked his guest to demonstrate how he raped women using a female mannequin.At one point, a laughing de Mbella even helped the guest adjust the mannequin and asked him how he chose his victims, whether he preferred them "slim or fat" and whether the victims "enjoyed it".The man was later asked to give women advice to avoid being raped.The segment was swiftly condemned on social media platforms in Ivory Coast and across West and Central Africa. An online petition was also launched, which has so far received more than 30,000 people who have demanded punishment for the presenter.“Please tell me I’m dreaming,” Priss’K, an Ivorian rapper, wrote on Facebook.The country's independent communications council announced the suspension of de Mbella for 30 days, saying in a statement that the segment used obscene language, condoned rape and attacked the dignity of women.The popular presenter issued an apology in a lengthy Facebook post. "I'm sincerely sorry to have shocked everyone while trying to raise awareness," de Mbella wrote on Facebook. "I made an error.""I'm also sorry for everything that was said or done during that sequence of the programme that hurt," he wrote. "I beg for forgiveness from all victims of rape."The Nouvelle Chaine Ivoirienne (NCI) private television station has cancelled the final episode of this particular show which was scheduled to air on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ivory-coast-tv-presenter-asks-guest-to-simulate-rape-suspended-after-outcry-101630484330323.html
01-09-2021||World||Pakistani terrorists coming to Afghanistan: Ghani informed Biden on July 23||At least 10,000 to 15,000 Pakistani terrorists were in Afghanistan as part of a full-scale invasion, planned and supported by Pakistan, Ashraf Ghani had told US President Joe Biden during their last phone call on July 23, weeks before the fall of Kabul and the Ghani government. "Mr President, we are facing a full-scale invasion, composed of Taliban, full Pakistani planning and logistical support, and at least 10-15,000 international terrorists, predominantly Pakistanis thrown into this, so that dimension needs to be taken account of,' Ghani told Biden, as reported by Reuters. The news agency accessed a transcript of the phone call and authenticated the 14-minute conversation.From the conversation, Reuters deciphered that neither Biden nor Ghani at that time could anticipate the imminent fall of the government as Biden talked about providing close air support to Afghanistan, while Ghani emphasised the need to move with speed.'Best military': What Joe Biden told Ashraf Ghani in their last phone call on July 23Afghanistan government officials, the former vice president Amrullah Saleh etc have been repeatedly pointing to Pakistan's support for the Taliban, which Pakistan ministers have been refuting vehemently.Pakistan featured in the conversation of Ghani and Biden on July 23 as Biden advised Ghani to attempt to change the perception of people by announcing to the world that Afghanistan has a plan to counter the Taliban offensive. To this, Ghani presented the bigger picture to Biden and explained that it was not only Taliban, there was full Pakistani planning and logistical support and around 10 to 15,000 international terrorists, predominantly Pakistanis thrown into this.Within weeks, the Taliban reached Kabul on August 15 prompting a collapse of the Ghani government. A day before, however, Ghani addressed the nation and assured the Afghans that he would mobilise the army, only to leave the country the very next day when the Taliban reached Kabul.On July 23 itself, Biden’s National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, General Mark Milley and U.S. Central Command commander General Frank McKenzie spoke to Ghani.In July, both Ashraf Ghani and Pakistan PM Imran Khan exchanged barbs at the inaugural ceremony of the Central and South Asia connectivity in Uzbekistan, where Ghani said Pakistan was opening supporting and celebrating the Taliban's advances. "President Ghani, let me just say that the country that will be most affected by turmoil in Afghanistan is Pakistan. Pakistan suffered 70,000 casualties in the last 15 years. The last thing Pakistan wants is more conflict," Imran Khan had said in reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-terrorists-coming-to-afghanistan-ghani-informed-biden-on-july-23-101630483729028.html

With the addition of Mu, now there are five variants of interest such as Eta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda and Mu.Here is all you need to know about this new variant1. This variant is scientifically known as B.1.621.2. Mu was first detected in Colombia in January and was classified as a variant of interest in August.3. Mu has mutations that indicate a risk of resistance to vaccines, but further studies are needed for better understanding.4. The variant might have immune escape properties as it has a constellation of mutations.C.1.2 Covid-19 variant: Centre says no cases in India so far, but how deadly is it?5. After Colombia, Mu has been reported in other South American countries and in Europe. Though it is not widespread across the globe, its presence is 39 per cent in Colombia.Apart from this variant, which has already been classified by the WHO, another variant C.1.2 has been detected. This has not been classified as either a variant of interest or a variant of concern, but the WHO said that it is monitoring the variant. None of these variants has been detected in India.Why emerging variants are significant even if they are not widespreadThese new variants are far from what Delta has become. But the emergence of new strains is of much importance to the scientific fraternity as strains are the virus's response to vaccines. Hence, chances are there that new variants may neutralise vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-mu-variant-of-covid-which-is-under-who-monitoring-at-present-101630480659853.html

The reason behind this move, according to a company note, is to keep its employees and their families healthy.According to the memo sent by Nomura to its employees, the rule will come into effect from October. It further said that all smoking rooms managed by the Nomura Group will be closed.Will Nomura punish its employees for smoking?No, according to Nomura's spokesperson Yoshitaka Otsu. The spokesperson told Bloomberg that the move is based on mutual trust.Japanese firms have been discouraging smoking at workplaces for years. And Nomura's move is a part of that. The companies have argued that if employees quit smoking, it will increase their productivity.Will the company monitor the employees?The answer to this again is no, according to Otsu. Since the move is based on trust, Nomura said it doesn't want to keep an eye on its employees.Nomura is introducing the measures to create a favorable working environment, prevent secondhand smoking and promote employee health, it had said in a separate statement last week.Smoking and work from homeThe National Cancer Centre in Japan carried out a survey in March this year, which revealed that cigarette consumption has increased in the island nation since the work from home culture began.The survey results showed that 2 in 10 smokers have a higher intake than earlier, because there are no restrictions at home.Nomura's targetNomura is seeking to reduce the smoking rate among its employees in Japan to 12% by 2025, compared with 20% in March 2020, according to its website. The brokerage has been providing financial aid to help workers quit since 2017.Other companies which have adopted similar strategySnacks manufacturer Calbee Inc. in 2018 prohibited smoking during working hours because the health of its employees and their family was “essential” for a company to grow.Food producer Ajinomoto Co. instituted a no-smoking-while-working policy in 2019, which also applies to staff working remotely.SoftBank Group Corp.’s telecom unit introduced a similar rule in April last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nomura-asks-employees-not-to-smoke-even-when-working-from-home-here-s-why-101630476245332.html

While some Americans are still in the country and the US authorities are yet to evacuate them along with Afghans who have been working for them, all soldiers have left the country after two decades of war.Here are the latest developments in the Afghanistan crisis since the US completed the withdrawal on Monday.Taliban meeting in KandaharTaliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid on Tuesday informed that leadership have been holding meetings in Kandahar province to discuss Afghanistan's political, security and social issues, now that it is under their control. "The leadership council has also discussed issues around forming the new government and its cabinet and has taken some decisions on providing services to the people," Tolo News reported citing Mujahid's tweets.India holds first formal meeting with Taliban leadersIndian envoy in Qatar Deepak Mittal met the deputy head of the Taliban’s political office to discuss regional security, the foreign ministry confirmed in a statement on Tuesday. The meeting was at the request of the Taliban and was the first between officials from both sides since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan on August 15.Kabul mayor imposes Sharia law in KabulNewly appointed Kabul mayor Hamdullah Nomani, who is also the head of the Taliban's municipality commission, enforced Sharia law throughout the capital of Kabul. In an interview with a local media report, Nomani stated that from now on corrupt individuals will be dealt with in accordance with Sharia law.Taliban take control of Kabul airportWith the exit of the US troops, the Taliban are in possession of Hamid Karzai International airport in Kabul. The symbolism of the airport was underlined Tuesday when the Taliban's top spokesman stood on its runway and declared victory over the United States. But what happens next remains unclear. Attacks in the past week have shown the airport is a target for terrorists, so security is the primary concern.Biden defends exit from AfghanistanUnder backlash over the chaotic exit from Afghanistan, US President Joe Biden defended his handling of the withdrawal in the first statement since the process was completed on Monday. “I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” he said. “It was time to end this war,” he added later in his speech, pounding his fist on the lectern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-us-troops-leave-kabul-here-s-what-the-taliban-are-up-to-5-developments-101630474797778.html

A slightly indisposed Akhundzada is presently in Sunni Pashtun bastion of Kandahar.Also Read | Haqqani network is the sword arm of Taliban with Pakistan the common parentEven though the Taliban leadership is projecting a united front to the world, multiple fractures are being exposed within the UN designated terrorist group with Mullah Yaqoob, son of first Emir-ul-Momeen Mullha Omar, wanting to bring military elements into the Cabinet rather than political elements being pushed by Mullah Barader, the co-founder of the Sunni Islamist group. Reports from Kabul indicate that Mullah Yaqoob, who is also the head of military commission and deputy leader, has openly told that those living in luxury of Doha cannot dictate terms to those involved in askari jihad against the US led occupation forces. Mullah Barader and Sher Mohammed Stanekzai ran the Taliban’s political office from Doha and negotiated with US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad with Pakistan and UK brass involved in the exercise.There are several fault lines visible within the Taliban with tension between Mullah Yaqoob and the Haqqani terror empire controlling Kabul at present. There is friction between non-Pashtun Taliban and Kandahar faction just as there are differences between the Pashtun and non-Pashtun tribes. With everyone fighting for their piece of cake in the Afghan government, there is concern within Taliban leadership about the differences coming out in the open and triggering violence with each group fighting the other as in the mujahideen days of the 1990s. With US leaving behind more than USD 85 billion of weaponry in Afghanistan, there is enough ammunition with each faction to fight the other for at least a decade. Already, the minority Shia Hazaras of Central Afghanistan are up in arms with Taliban executing some 14 members of the community in Khadir district of Daykundi province.Also Read | 'Full independence', 'historic moments': Taliban after US troops leaveHowever, the biggest worry within the Sunni medieval theocracy are the differences between the Taliban under Yaqoob and the HQN under Sirajuddin Haqqani and could lead to pro-Afghanistan and pro-Pak factions within the ruling regime. While the Taliban leadership exercises its judgement rather than blindly take orders from the Pakistani deep state, the HQN network is a family run terror factory aided and abetted by the Pakistani ISI operating through retired army officers with jihadist inclinations. With the west turning its back on Afghanistan for time to come, Russia and China only interested in firewalling the bordering Central Asian Republics and Xinjiang province from the spread of jihad from Emirates of Afghanistan, Kabul will go dark for the world till the next major terror attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yaqoob-and-haqqani-factions-fight-over-taliban-government-101630474732128.html
01-09-2021||World||Canada: Liberal Party MP denies sexual harassment allegations||A sitting Indo-Canadian MP, part of Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau’s caucus, is facing charges of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff members over the past six years but remains a candidate as the September 20 Federal elections approach.Raj Saini, who has roots in Himachal Pradesh, has been the MP for the riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) of Kitchener Centre in the province of Ontario since 2015.According to a report from the outlet CBC News, multiple sources “described four different cases where Saini allegedly made unwanted sexual advances or inappropriate comments”. Saini denied the accusations to CBC News.It also reported that a former staffer filed a complaint related to alleged “unwelcome advances and harassing behaviour” with the Canadian Human Rights Commission last year.In a statement issued by his office, Saini denied the allegations, saying, “I have never acted inappropriately towards staff or constituents.”Saini also stated that he was made aware of one allegation last year and “insisted an independent third-party review of my office take place through the House of Commons. The outcome of that review, which was completed in June 2020, found that nothing arose regarding concerns of harassment in the office.”Asked about these developments while campaigning on Tuesday, his party leader Trudeau defended Saini, “I know Mr Saini has shared the details of all the processes that have been undertaken in his office because it’s really important that we respond to any concerns and issues brought up.”Trudeau has maintained his party has a zero tolerance policy towards matters of this nature. On Tuesday, he said, “We’ll continue to insist that everyone deserves to have a safe workplace.”CBC reported that the complaints against Saini date back to a party holiday gathering in December 2015 at a downtown Ottawa convention centre. The outlet said that four female staffers had complained about inappropriate acts then, and also named former MP Marwan Tabbara. The latter faced an internal party investigation and contested the 2019 Federal elections but was removed from the caucus after charges in a different case in 2020.Saini, however, has denied any wrongdoing, as he said, “Protecting my staff and ensuring they are respected is not something I take lightly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-liberal-party-mp-denies-sexual-harassment-allegations-101630474981152.html
01-09-2021||World||Canada polls: O’Toole posing tough challenge to incumbent Trudeau||While incumbent Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is an international political celebrity, the opponent who is threatening to displace him, Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole, remains largely unknown, even within Canada.However, as his party gains ground on the ruling Liberal Party, even leading in some polls to bag a large share of seats in the Federal elections scheduled for September 20, his profile has risen. More importantly for the relationship between Ottawa and New Delhi, which has suffered under Trudeau, O’Toole has a pro-India agenda as part of his platform.Born in Montreal, the 48-year-old is behind a party platform calling for Canada to join the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), the bloc that includes India, the United States, Japan and Australia. In contrast, the Canadian government has yet to present an updated Indo-Pacific policy that has been expected for months. O’Toole also served in the Royal Canadian Air Force for 12 years and was first elected to the House of Commons in 2012.Similarly, as negotiations for a free trade pact as well as an investment treaty with India haven’t progressed very far, O’Toole has promised to “pursue” these objectives. Both pacts were first proposed under the government of former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, Trudeau’s predecessor, and O’Toole had served as a veterans affairs minister in his cabinet.That theme appeared in an op-ed O’Toole wrote for the Canadian daily, National Post, in March, in which he noted, “Canada needs an economic future that reduces our dependence on China’s industry and marketplace. We can only accomplish that by deepening ties with the world’s largest democracy, India.”When Trudeau first became Prime Minister in 2015, the mandate letters for his finance minister as well as International Trade Minister included a focus on improving trade ties with India, but that has not come to fruition over the past six years. O’Toole, in the oped, said, “India is Canada’s tenth largest trading partner, but it has the potential to become our second. India’s economic transformation is under way, and it is one that should not only be applauded but supported.”It’s still a difficult path for O’Toole to get the top job as Trudeau’s Liberals remain favourites to win the maximum seats and form another minority government, though the Conservatives have closed the gap over the past ten days.

01-09-2021||World||Biden defends decision to end ‘forever’ Afghan war||US President Joe Biden on Tuesday defended his decisions to end the war in Afghanistan and the evacuation operations forcefully in remarks from the White House that he was not going to “extend the forever war, and I was not extending the forever exit”.The US president called the operation that airlifted 120,000 Americans, allies and Afghan partners an “extraordinary success”.Biden also defended the exit date of August 31 saying it was not an “arbitrary deadline” but it was “designed to save American lives”.The last American military aircraft involved in the evacuation operation left the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul at 11.59pm local time on Monday with Major Gen Chris Donahue, commander of the US Army 82nd Airborne Division, the last US personnel to leave Afghan soil.“I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” Biden said, speaking from the Dining Room in an address to the nation.The American president defended his decisions to end the war, wrap up the evacuation operation before his self-imposed deadline of August 31 and pushed back against those who have argued that the US could have stayed longer in Afghanistan and the airlift could not have started earlier or have been more orderly.The American president reiterated that the decision to end the military operations at Kabul airport was based on “unanimous recommendation” of his civilian and military advisers, the secretary of state, the secretary of defence, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and all the service chiefs.Biden called the evacuation an “extraordinary success” saying “no country in history has done more to airlift out the residents of another country, as we have done”.To those who have argued the evacuation should have started earlier, in June of July, and in a more orderly manner, he said, that there still would have been a “rush to the airport, a breakdown in confidence and control of the government, and it still would have been a very difficult and dangerous mission”.Biden said when he decided in April to end the Afghanistan war, the assumption was that the Afghan military that had been trained and equipped by the United States would put up a fight and there. “The assumption that the Afghan government would be able to hold on for a period of time beyond military drawdown turned out not to be accurate.”On the question of the US staying indefinitely, as some of his critics have argued for, he said he had only two options: accept the deal made by Trump and extend the timeline from May 1 to get more people out or “send in thousands of more troops and escalate the war”.Biden said staying in Afghanistan longer served no national interest, because of the goal of going there had been achieved a decade ago with the killing of Osama bin Laden and decimation of Al-Qaeda. The US had stayed there for another decade and it was time to end the war.Biden maintained the US will remain focused on combating terrorism, but it does not have to fight a ground war to do it. Using over-the-horizon capabilities, terrorists can be struck anywhere in without “American boots on the ground - or very few, if needed”.And to the Islamic State-Khorasan, which has claimed responsibility for the Kabul airport bombing that killed 170 Afghans and 13 US troops, Biden said: “We are not done with you yet.”The US killed two IS-K “planners” and “facilitators” in a drone strike in Nangarhar province and one suspected suicide bomber headed for the airport in another strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-defends-decision-to-end-forever-afghan-war-101630471438038.html
01-09-2021||World||'Best military': What Joe Biden told Ashraf Ghani in their last phone call on July 23||US President Joe Biden and former Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani spoke for the last time on July 23, weeks before the fall of Kabul on August 15, which saw Ghani leaving the country leading to an irrevocable fall of his government. According to Reuters, the last call between the duo lasted for roughly 14 minutes and they discussed military aid, political strategy etc. But none of them spoke anything about the possibility of the entire country falling to the Taliban, the news agency, which went through the transcript of the conversation, said."Reuters reviewed a transcript of the presidential phone call and has listened to the audio to authenticate the conversation. The materials were provided on condition of anonymity by a source who was not authorized to distribute it," the news agency said.Biden told Ghani that the US will provide close-air support if Ghani spells out a plan against the Taliban offensive. Biden also advised Ghani to get buy-in from powerful Afghans for a military strategy going forward, and then to put a “warrior” in charge of the effort, a possible reference to defence minister General Bismillah Khan Mohammadi. Biden said he is not a "military guy" and hence can't advise Ghani on military strategy, but he advised him to work on improving Afghanistan's perception in front of the world.Also Read | 'Maybe it’s because my deceased son': Biden on ending war in AfghanistanIf Afghan politicians address a press conference at that time when the Taliban was escalating its advance and was capturing one district after another, then it might change the perception, Biden said.Did Biden praise the Afghan army?According to the report, Biden lauded Afghan armed forces and said, "You clearly have the best military". “You have 300,000 well-armed forces versus 70-80,000 and they’re clearly capable of fighting well," Biden told Ghani in the 14-minute phone call. “You have 300,000 well-armed forces versus 70-80,000 and they’re clearly capable of fighting well," Biden said to Ghani.“We are going to continue to fight hard, diplomatically, politically, economically, to make sure your government not only survives but is sustained and grows,” said Biden.The White House Tuesday declined to comment on the call, Reuters reported.The revelation comes at a time when the United States is putting the blame squarely on Afghan soldiers for losing the fight. Even in his latest statement, issued after the complete withdrawal of the US troops from Kabul, Biden said the US was ready to fight when the Afghanistan government failed its people.Full Pakistani planning: What did Ghani tell BidenAshraf Ghani told Biden that Afghanistan was facing a full-scale invasion and the Taliban were not the only ones attacking. Ghani reportedly said that apart from the Taliban, there was full Pakistani planning and logistical support, and 10-15,000 international terrorists." I just spoke again to Dr Abdullah earlier, he went to negotiate with the Taliban, the Taliban showed no inclination. We can get to peace only if we rebalance the military situation. And I can assure you… I have been to four of our key cities, I’m constantly travelling with the vice president and others, we will be able to rally. Your assurance of support goes a very long way to enable us, to really mobilize in earnest," Ghani said.'Karzai would not be helpful': Biden, Ghani disagreeBiden's advice for perception improvement included bringing together former president Hamid Karzai, former vice president Abdul Rashid Dostum. But Ghani was not on board with the proposal. “He is contrary, and time is of the essence, we cannot bring every single individual … We have tried for months with President Karzai. Last time we met for 110 minutes; he was cursing me and he was accusing me of being a US lackey," Ghani is believed to have said to Biden. To this, Biden said he will reserve his judgement.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/best-military-what-joe-biden-told-ashraf-ghani-in-their-last-phone-call-on-july-23-101630467915621.html

If Pakistan's "military strategy" was somehow responsible factor in the defeat of the 300,000-strong Afghan army, whom the US had trained for so many years, then the US assessment that the Afghan army lost morale does not hold water, the ambassador wrote. The fall of Kabul proved the futility of the investment of the United States in the country, if anything, he wrote.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan invited global criticism after he said that the Taliban are not a military outfit that his army (in Pakistan) can hunt them down. After the fall of Kabul, Pakistani ministers also spoke to their counterparts in other countries on the issue of supporting Afghanistan at this crucial juncture.Islamabad 'fears' rise in violence along Afghan-Pak border, here's whyCongressman Michael G Waltz mentioned the Pak-Taliban conduit and sought the US sanction of Pakistan. "...I ask that your administration also consider sanctioning Pakistan unless they change course and make greater efforts to prevent the Taliban from using their border region to regroup between firefights," Waltz had written to Biden in August.My letter to Representative Waltz, responding to his observations on Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan. @PakinUSA @ForeignOfficePk @michaelgwaltz pic.twitter.com/tk6YEEM0dxAsad Majeed Khan's reply has come in this background where he, in turn, blamed the US for the fall of Kabul."The contention that Pakistan's military strategy was somehow the decisive factor in the defeat of the 300,000-strong Afghan National Defence and Security Forces-- trained and equipped at the cost of at least $83 billion to the American taxpayer-- does not square with the US government's assessment about the issued of low morale, desertions and ghost soldiers that had long plagues the ANDSF," he wrote.Pakistan has been consistently saying that it has no favourites in Afghanistan and would work with any government in the country. Pakistan has also joined the United States, China, Russia is "explicitly opposing any effort to impose a government by force" in Kabul, Khan wrote in his scathing letter."The swift collapse of the Afghan government has, if anything, proven the futility of investing more effort and money into finding a military solution to a political problem," Khan wrote.Khan wrote that though Afghanistan's fall was sudden and shocking, it was not surprising at all as the Afghan government had been steadily losing territory for years. "..demoralised soldiers do not fight for a corrupt, kleptocratic leadership that will bolt at the first hint of trouble," Khan said adding that Pakistan has its embassy functioning in Kabul and it will keep its doors and borders open to the Afghan people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-fell-because-of-kleptocratic-leadership-stop-blaming-us-pakistan-envoy-writes-to-us-congressman-101630466328618.html

"My fellow Americans, the war in Afghanistan is now over," Biden said at the White House. "I'm the fourth president who has faced the issue of whether and when to end this war.

01-09-2021||World||Dozens of dogs left at Kabul airport; 'Not ours,' says Pentagon||After reports claimed that dozens of dogs have been left by the US forces at the mercy of the Taliban, waiting to be slaughtered, the Pentagon called those reports 'erroneous' and said that the US military did not leave any dog in the airport and the photos and videos that are doing the rounds on social media are not those of the military, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby tweeted.The reports emerged after an image of dogs inside cages in front of a demilitarised helicopter went viral on social media. The Pentagon claimed that those dogs did not belong to the US military. Kabul Small Animal Rescue was in the custody of those dogs, Kirby said.To correct erroneous reports, the U.S. Military did not leave any dogs in cages at Hamid Karzai International Airport, including the reported military working dogs. Photos circulating online were animals under the care of the Kabul Small Animal Rescue, not dogs under our care."To correct erroneous reports, the U.S. Military did not leave any dogs in cages at Hamid Karzai International Airport, including the reported military working dogs. Photos circulating online were animals under the care of the Kabul Small Animal Rescue, not dogs under our care," Kirby said.Kabul Small Animal Rescue is an animal rights organisation operating in Afghanistan for the past year. It had initially planned to evacuate some animals but was forced to leave their cages at the airport as dogs were not allowed on military aircraft and private charter aircraft were not allowed into Kabul.“We are heartbroken that the aircraft we secured to transport the rescued dogs of Kabul Small Animal Rescue out of Afghanistan were not ultimately allowed to take the animals and their caretakers safely out of the country,” said Lori Kalef, director of Programs at SPCA International.So the dogs under their custody had to be released into the airport which turned them into homeless strays, a statement from the KSAR said. It also said that the NGO will return to the airport when it is safe and will re-rescue the animals.People for the ethical treatment of animals (Peta) started a petition based on reports and said: "...dozens of US military working dogs, numerous animal companions belonging to evacuated Americans, and more than 100 dogs previously rescued from the streets of Afghanistan along with an unknown number of rescued cats and the humans caring for these animals were left behind in Afghanistan after the last US plane left Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul." The statement also added that Peta was trying to verify these reports."Red tape and catastrophes have apparently wrecked every attempt to secure a flight out for these animals and their caretakers. While the cats and staff are reportedly safe for the time being, many dogs—including a pug belonging to an American Embassy worker—may have been let loose to fend for themselves on and around airport grounds. These animals and the humans who have been caring for them desperately need you to speak up!" the animal rights group said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-dogs-left-at-kabul-airport-not-ours-says-pentagon-101630462845286.html
01-09-2021||World||Will continue drone strikes in Afghanistan 'if and when needed': Pentagon||A day after the last remaining troops of the United States left Afghanistan, the Pentagon on Tuesday said that it will continue to conduct drone strikes against the Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K) and other terrorist groups operating within the South Asian nation. The ISIS-K is the same group that carried out an attack on Kabul airport last week killing at least 169 Afghans and 13 US service members.Following the attack, the US also retaliated with drone strikes against an ISIS-K planner, a facilitator and a suspected suicide car bomber."We have the capability from an over the horizon perspective of ensuring our national security interests are protected and defended," said the press secretary of Pentagon, John Kirby according to Fox News. "And what I would tell you, without getting into hypotheticals or speculating about future operations, we're going to continue to maintain those capabilities and use them if and when we need to," Kirby added.The longest war of America ended late on Monday after the US withdrew the last remaining troops from Afghanistan. The chaotic exit led to Taliban seizing control of Afghanistan and pushed the war-torn country back to where it was in 2001. Though international affairs observers are sceptical about the Taliban, infamous for their treatment of women and girls, as well as a brutal justice system, the group has repeatedly promised to have a more tolerant and moderate regime this time.On Tuesday, Taliban leaders walked across the runway of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport after the last American planes left Afghanistan. They also fired celebratory shots in the air and called it a "major victory." "This victory belongs to us all," Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said, adding, "the world should have learned their lesson and this is the enjoyable moment of victory."In a speech on Tuesday, President Joe Biden reiterated the US' stand against the ISIS-K group. "To ISIS-K we are not done with you yet," Biden said, adding that "to those who wish America harm, we will hunt you down and you will pay the ultimate price."Defending a decision that drew sharp criticism and scrutiny for its execution, Biden also said the real decision in Afghanistan was "between leaving and escalating," framing his choice to withdraw troops as the only option aside from surging more forces to the country. "I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit," he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-continue-drone-strikes-in-afghanistan-if-and-when-needed-pentagon-101630460094669.html
01-09-2021||World||'Maybe it’s because my deceased son': Biden on ending war in Afghanistan||In his first address after the United States withdrew its forces from Afghanistan, US President Joe Biden said that this was the 'right, wise and the best' decision for America'. Blaming Donald Trump for an agreement with the Taliban, Biden said that when he came to office, the Taliban was in its strongest military position since 2001, controlling of contesting nearly half of the country. "The previous administration’s agreement said that if we stuck to the May 1st deadline that they had signed on to leave by, the Taliban wouldn’t attack any American forces, but if we stayed, all bets were off," he said.The president touched upon several issues relating to the US, Afghanistan, ISIS in his speech:'Afghan forces did not hold on'"...We were ready when the Afghan Security Forces — after two decades of fighting for their country and losing thousands of their own — did not hold on as long as anyone expected. We were ready when they and the people of Afghanistan watched their own government collapse and their president flee amid the corruption and malfeasance, handing over the country to their enemy, the Taliban, and significantly increasing the risk to US personnel and our Allies," Biden said blaming the failure of the Afghan forces.US does not take the Taliban by their word"The Taliban has made public commitments, broadcast on television and radio across Afghanistan, on safe passage for anyone wanting to leave, including those who worked alongside Americans. We don’t take them by their word alone but by their actions, and we have leverage to make sure those commitments are met," Biden said adding that leaving on August 31 was not due to any arbitrary deadline but to save American lives.Trump released top Taliban commanders"My predecessor, the former President, signed an agreement with the Taliban to remove U.S. troops by May the 1st, just months after I was inaugurated. It included no requirement that the Taliban work out a cooperative governing arrangement with the Afghan government, but it did authorize the release of 5,000 prisoners last year, including some of the Taliban’s top war commanders, among those who just took control of Afghanistan," Biden said.Not against threats of 2001, but against 2021 threatsDefending the decision of leaving Afghanistan since the national interest of the United States, Biden said that the US now can't afford to address the threats it used to face in 2001. "This is a new world. The terror threat has metastasized across the world, well beyond Afghanistan. We face threats from al-Shabaab in Somalia; al Qaeda affiliates in Syria and the Arabian Peninsula; and ISIS attempting to create a caliphate in Syria and Iraq, and establishing affiliates across Africa and Asia," he said.Watch | Warning for ISIS-K, message for Americans: Joe Biden after US troops leave AfghanistanNot done with the ISIS-K yet"We will maintain the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and other countries. We just don’t need to fight a ground war to do it. We have what’s called over-the-horizon capabilities, which means we can strike terrorists and targets without American boots on the ground — or very few, if needed. We’ve shown that capacity just in the last week. We struck ISIS-K remotely, days after they murdered 13 of our servicemembers and dozens of innocent Afghans. And to ISIS-K: We are not done with you yet," Biden said.'Maybe it’s because my deceased son, BeauBiden remembered his son Beau Biden who served in Iraq for a full year as he said he was committed to stopping the war.

"I don’t think enough people understand how much we have asked of the 1 per cent of this country who put that uniform on, who are willing to put their lives on the line in defense of our nation. Maybe it’s because my deceased son, Beau, served in Iraq for a full year, before that.

01-09-2021||World||Islamabad 'fears' rise in violence along Afghan-Pak border, here's why||There is growing concern among Pakistani officials about security in neighbouring Afghanistan, as the Taliban tries to form a government and stabilise the country following the departure of the US and other foreign forces.Islamabad is particularly worried about militant fighters from a separate, Pakistani Taliban group crossing from Afghanistan and launching lethal attacks on its territory. Thousands of Pakistanis have been killed in jihadist violence in the last two decades.Underlining the security threat within Afghanistan, in the last few days, a suicide bombing claimed by an Afghan offshoot of Islamic State outside Kabul airport killed more than 100 people, including 13 US troops.A rocket attack on the airport followed, and on Sunday militant gunfire from across the border in Afghanistan killed two Pakistani soldiers."The next two to three months are critical," a senior Pakistani official said, adding that Islamabad feared a rise in militant attacks along the Afghan-Pakistan border, as the Taliban tried to fill a vacuum left by the collapse of Afghan forces and the Western-backed administration."We (the international community) have to assist the Taliban in reorganising their army in order for them to control their territory," the source added, referring to the threat posed by resurgent rival militant groups including Islamic State.US officials have repeatedly accused Pakistan of supporting the Afghan Taliban, which fought in a civil war in the mid-1990s before seizing power in 1996.Islamabad, one of the few capitals to recognise the Taliban government that was toppled in 2001, denies the charge.Pakistan's government has said that its influence over the movement has waned, particularly since the Taliban grew in confidence once Washington announced the date for the complete withdrawal of US and other foreign troops.The official, who has direct knowledge of the country's security decisions, said Pakistan planned to send security and intelligence officials, possibly even the head of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, to Kabul to help the Taliban reorganise the Afghan military.An Afghan Taliban spokesperson did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment on security relations with Pakistan.Pakistan expects Taliban cooperationThough recognition of a new Taliban government was not immediately on the table, the official said, the world should not abandon Afghanistan."Whether we recognise the Taliban government or not, stability in Afghanistan is very important."The official warned that Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), a loosely affiliated offshoot of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, was actively looking to launch attacks and recruit new fighters.Left unhindered, it would almost certainly grow from relatively small numbers currently.The United States recently launched two drone strikes targeting ISIS-K militants, including one in Kabul and one near the eastern border with Pakistan.The strikes followed a pledge by President Joe Biden that the United States would hunt down the militants behind the recent suicide bombing.The Taliban criticised the strikes as a "clear attack on Afghan territory".Pakistan, whose armed forces also possess unmanned drones as well as conventional aircraft, will avoid intervening directly in Afghanistan if at all possible, said the official.The Afghan Taliban have reassured their neighbour that they will not allow their territory to be used by anyone planning attacks on Pakistan or any other country.But Islamabad expected the Afghan Taliban to hand over militants planning attacks against Pakistan, the official added, or at least force them from their mutual border, where Pakistani troops have been on high alert in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamabad-fears-rise-in-violence-along-afghan-pak-border-here-s-why-101630458612771.html

Reports said that the video surfaced on Monday just after the US troops left the country and went viral for two reasons. First, the Taliban are not believed to have trained pilots. So any flying video from Kandahar is creating interest on social media. Second, a man was seen 'hanging' from the helicopter. Republican senator Ted Cruz shared the video and slammed Joe Biden's 'Afghanistan catastrophe', claiming that the Taliban hanged a man from an American Blackhawk helicopter.Afghan pilot flying this is someone I have known over the years. He was trained in the US and UAE, he confirmed to me that he flew the Blackhawk helicopter. Taliban fighter seen here was trying to install Taliban flag from air but it didn’t work in the end. https://t.co/wnF8ep1zElAfter the video went viral, some social media accounts claimed that it was not what it looked like as the man seen dangling from the helicopter was actually a Taliban fighter who was trying to install a Taliban flag from the air. The Blackhawk was also being flown by an Afghan pilot, training in the United States and the United Arab Emirates, and not a Taliban. Asvaka news agency also posted the same video claiming that the Black Hawk was seen over the Kandahar governor office. Reports claimed that the man was actually trying to install a flag on the governor's office, from the air. But it did not work in the end.It turns out the post I shared w/ a video of Taliban “hanging a man” from a helicopter may be inaccurate. So I deleted the tweet. What remains accurate is:- The Taliban are brutal terrorists.- We left them millions in US military equipment, including Black Hawk helicopters. https://t.co/zOvNM5UXUWReuters Factchack claimed that a closer shot of the video shows that the "man is alive, despite the contrary claims".Following this, Ted Cruz deleted his former tweet and wrote, "It turns out the post I shared w/ a video of Taliban “hanging a man” from a helicopter may be inaccurate.

01-09-2021||World||Joe Biden defends timing of Afghan exit, says it saved US lives||President Joe Biden defended his handling of the US exit from Afghanistan, praising as historic a weeks-long evacuation of more than 100,000 people and rejecting criticism that the withdrawal was mishandled.“I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” he said. “It was time to end this war,” he added later in his speech, pounding his fist on the lectern. Republicans have said Biden should have extended an Aug. 31 deadline to withdraw until every American was removed from the country. About 200 Americans remain in Afghanistan, according to the State Department, and the president said his decision was not “arbitrary.”The deadline “was designed to save American lives,” he said. The US would have risked additional casualties in renewed combat with the Taliban had its forces remained, he said.He described the US airlift from Kabul’s airport over the last month as unprecedented. More than 117,000 people were removed, including about 6,000 Americans.“No nation, no nation has ever done anything like it in all the history,” he said.Biden’s political opponents have criticised the president’s withdrawal strategy, saying the US should have begun removing people from the country earlier and should have operated more forcefully within Kabul -- actions the president maintains would have risked combat with Taliban forces and further American casualties.“I believe there should be accountability for what I see as the biggest failure in American government on a military stage in my lifetime,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.The president’s critics have also argued that by leaving, Biden has increased the likelihood the country would once again become a breeding ground for international terrorism as the Taliban struggle to unify disparate factions and keep the economy afloat.But Biden again described himself as bound by an agreement his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, struck with the Taliban last year to withdraw from the country. While some critics have said Biden could have abandoned or substantially renegotiated the deal, and Trump and his allies have tried to recast the agreement as conditional, the president insisted any major change would have led to fresh violence.“We were left with a simple decision: Either follow through on the commitment made by the last administration and leave Afghanistan or say we weren’t leaving and commit another tens of thousands more troops going back to war,” he said. “That was the choice, the real choice, between leaving or escalating.”Biden promised during his campaign that he would withdraw the US from Afghanistan, a position broadly supported among the American public prior to the evacuation effort, polls showed. Though Republicans have criticized the execution of the withdrawal, Trump sought to leave even faster, striking a deal with the Taliban in his final year in office to exit the country by May 1 of this year.But a Reuters/Ipsos poll published Monday showed that less than 40% approved of Biden’s handling of the withdrawal and that three-quarters of Americans wanted US forces to remain until every American civilian was evacuated.For years, US politicians and military leaders have described the Afghanistan government and army as more stable and capable than they proved during the Taliban takeover. In his speech, Biden suggested that Americans had been misled.“It was time to be honest with the American people again,” Biden said. “We no longer had a clear purpose in an open-ended mission in Afghanistan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-defends-timing-of-afghan-exit-saying-it-saved-us-lives-101630441134726.html

The move will come into effect from the midnight of September 3.The cost of the RT-PCR test will be ₹600 per person. Requisite arrangements have been made at the Mumbai airport for implementation of these fresh guidelines, and the capacity of testing at the airport has been increased to 600 tests per hour.International passengers travelling to Mumbai from United States or any other country -- except the above --- and who are exiting the Mumbai airport or are taking a connecting flight from Mumbai airport will have to produce a negative RT-PCR report, with the test done 72 hours before the journey, at the Mumbai airport. A RT-PCR test is not mandatory for such passengers on arrival at the Mumbai airport.The statement was released by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday, as per guidelines issued by the Union Government for international passengers. The decision has been taken in view of more transmissible variants of SARS-COV-2. While institutional quarantine is not required anymore as per the new guidelines, all international passengers must give a self-declaration form with an undertaking of home quarantine for 14 days. These forms need to be submitted to officers deployed at the Mumbai airport.Exemptions granted as per earlier guidelines, for fully vaccinated passengers, or passengers above the age of 65 years, has now been done away with.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-covid-19-norms-in-place-for-international-passengers-arriving-in-mumbai-101630520823675.html
01-09-2021||India||It was time to finish US’s ‘forever war’, says Biden||US President Joe Biden has defended his decision to end the war in Afghanistan and the hurried evacuation operations, saying in remarks from the White House that he was not going to “extend the forever war” and “was not extending the forever exit”.The US President called the operation that airlifted 120,000 Americans, allies and Afghan partners an “extraordinary success”. He also defended the exit date of August 31, saying it was not an “arbitrary deadline” but it was “designed to save American lives”.Biden said he refused to send another generation to fight in a “forever war.” The departure from Afghanistan, completed Monday after 20 years of war against the Taliban, was “a wise decision and the best decision for America,” Biden said in an address to the nation. After coming under fire over the chaotic nature of the rush to the exits in Afghanistan, Biden said he did what should have been done years ago.The last American military aircraft involved in the evacuation operation left the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul at 11.59pm local time on Monday, with Major General Chris Donahue, commander of the US Army 82nd Airborne Division, the last US personnel to leave Afghan soil.“I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” Biden said, speaking from the Dining Room in an address to the nation.To the Islamic State-Khorasan, which has claimed responsibility for the Kabul airport bombing that killed 170 Afghans and 13 US troops, Biden said: “We are not done with you yet.” The US killed two IS-K “planners” and “facilitators” in a drone strike in Nangarhar province and one suspected suicide bomber headed for the airport in another strike.The American President defended his decisions to end the war, wrap up the evacuation operation before his self-imposed deadline of August 31 and pushed back against those who have argued that the US could have stayed longer in Afghanistan and the airlift could not have started earlier or have been more orderly.He reiterated that the decision to end the military operations at Kabul airport was based on “unanimous recommendation” of his civilian and military advisers, the secretary of state, the secretary of defence, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and all the service chiefs.Biden called the evacuation an “extraordinary success”, saying “no country in history has done more to airlift out the residents of another country, as we have done”.To those who have argued the evacuation should have started earlier, in June of July, and in a more orderly manner, he said, that there still would have been a “rush to the airport, a breakdown in confidence and control of the government, and it still would have been a very difficult and dangerous mission”.The US President said that when he decided in April to end the Afghanistan war, the assumption was that the Afghan military that had been trained and equipped by the US would put up a fight. “That assumption that the Afghan government would be able to hold on for a period of time beyond military drawdown turned out not to be accurate,” he said.On the question of the US staying indefinitely, as some of his critics have argued for, he said he had only two options: accept the deal made by his predecessor Donald Trump and extend the timeline from May 1 to get more people out or “send in thousands of more troops and escalate the war”.He said staying in Afghanistan longer served no national interest, because of the goal of going there had been achieved a decade ago with the killing of Osama bin Laden and decimation of the al Qaeda. The US stayed there for another decade and it was time to end the war, he added.Biden maintained that the US will remain focussed on combatting terrorism, but it does not have to fight a ground war to do it. Using over-the-horizon capabilities, terrorists can be struck anywhere without “American boots on the ground – or very few, if needed”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-was-time-to-finish-us-s-forever-war-says-biden-101630520522560.html

Every year 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of sugar are exported to Afghanistan. During the 2020-21 fiscal year India exported 650,000 tonnes of sugar so far. The season for sugar runs from October to September.“Our sugar export to Afghanistan has been affected now because of the prevailing current situation out there. Some orders have been cancelled,” Subodh Kumar, joint secretary in the food ministry, told news agency PTI. He however said that sugar exports will resume in the next season after normalcy is restored under the new regime.There is no change in the India-Afghanistan trade policy unlike Pakistan which decided to not buy sugar from India. India is the world’s second largest producer of sugar after Brazil.India exported six million tonnes of sugar in the 2020-21 season. India produced an estimated 31 million tonnes of sugar in the current 2020-21 season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-sugar-exports-to-afghanistan-come-to-a-halt-101630519932229.html
01-09-2021||India||Post-poll violence: Mamata govt moves SC against high court order for CBI probe||The Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court challenging a Calcutta high court order for a court-monitored CBI investigation into all cases of rape and murder during the violence that was unleashed after the Assembly elections result was announced in the state in May. The HC direction had come following recommendations of a panel of the National Human Rights Commissions (NHRC).In its special leave petition, the state government said it did not expect a fair and just investigation by the central agency which was busy framing cases against functionaries of ruling Trinamool Congress.Earlier, lawyer Anindya Sundar Das, one of the PIL petitioners on whose plea the high court had passed its order on August 19, had filed a caveat in the apex court urging that no order be passed without hearing him if the state or other litigant moved appeals.Also read | Bengal post-poll violence: CBI meets affected families, files 7 more casesA five-judge bench of the high court, headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal, had ordered a CBI investigation in all alleged cases of heinous crimes in West Bengal after the election results were declared on May 2. The bitterly fought election brought the Trinamool Congress back to power and the BJP has since been claiming massive violence against its workers in the state.Regarding other criminal cases related to post-poll violence, the high court had directed that they be investigated by a Special Investigation Team under the monitoring of the court.The high court bench, which also comprised justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar, had observed that there were "definite and proved" allegations that complaints of the victims of violence in the aftermath of the West Bengal assembly polls were not even registered.Also read | 'Deserves to be rejected': Calcutta HC on Bengal govt's argument blaming ECI for post-poll violenceOrdering the setting up of an SIT to probe all other cases, it had said it would include Suman Bala Sahoo, Soumen Mitra and Ranveer Kumar, all IPS officers of the West Bengal cadre."All the cases where, as per the report of the committee, the allegations are about murder of a person and crime against women regarding rape/attempt to rape, shall be referred to CBI for investigation,” it had said.The high court has also directed the NHRC committee, constituted by its chairman on a direction by the five-judge bench, and any other commission or authority and the state to immediately hand over the records of the cases to the CBI to carry forward the probe.The bench had said it will monitor the investigations by both the CBI and the SIT and asked the two agencies to submit status reports to the court within six weeks.It had said that the working of the SIT will be overseen by a retired Judge of the Supreme Court for which a separate order will be passed after obtaining his/her consent.In its ruling, the bench had said heinous crimes such as murder and rape "deserve to be investigated by an independent agency which in the circumstances can only be Central Bureau of Investigation."The bench had said the State failed to register FIRs even in some cases of alleged murder. "This shows a pre-determined mind to take the investigation into a particular direction.""Under such circumstances investigation by an independent agency will inspire confidence in all concerned," it had noted.It had said allegations that the police had not registered a number of cases initially and that some were registered only after the court had intervened or the committee was constituted were found to be true.It had observed that the facts in relation to the allegations made in the PILs are "even more glaring" as the incidents are not isolated to one place in the state.The NHRC committee had on July 13 submitted its final report to the court.An interim report of the NHRC committee had mentioned that Atif Rasheed, a member of the committee, was obstructed from discharging his duty and he and his team members were attacked by some undesirable elements on June 29 in Jadavpur area on the southern fringe of the city, the court noted.The PILs had alleged that people were subjected to assault, made to flee homes and properties were destroyed during the violence in the wake of the assembly elections and sought impartial probe into the incidents.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/postpoll-violence-mamata-govt-moves-sc-against-high-court-order-for-cbi-probe-101630517919618.html

The worried government convened a meeting of experts, mainly epidemiologists, virologists and public health activists on Wednesday after the alarming spike in cases. Most of the experts present at the meeting said the present surge is likely to subside only after mid-September and asked the government to vaccinate the maximum number of people to check further damage. The projection report prepared by the pandemic core committee also said the situation will stabilize only after September 10. The government has called another meeting with local body chiefs on Friday to streamline containment measures. The high viral caseload has invited enough trouble for the state as many neighbouring states have put severe restrictions on people travelling from Kerala. The Union health ministry has also asked Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to increase vaccination in districts bordering Kerala. On Tuesday also the state had reported over 30,000 cases. The test positivity rate or TPR remained high at 18.76 per cent after 1,74,854 samples were tested. Kerala also reported 173 deaths on Wednesday taking the total death toll to 20,961. The active caseload also crossed 2.20 lakh. Two districts reported over 4000 cases-- Thrissur 4424 and Ernakulam 4324. Statistics show there is a whopping 24 per cent increase in cases after Onam. The R factor that tells how many new cases have been transmitted from an infected person has gone up from 0.9 per cent to 1.5% after Onam, health ministry statistics show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-covid-19-surge-to-continue-till-sept-second-week-say-experts-101630517702657.html

The court said cows were an integral part of Indian culture and the Central government should frame laws accordingly."We know that when a country's culture and its faith get hurt, the country becomes weak," the single-judge bench of Justice Shekhar Yadav said."The cow has been shown as an important part in India's ancient texts like the Vedas and the Mahabharata that define Indian culture and for which India is known," the 12-page order further read.Justice Yadav said the central government should table a bill in Parliament to give fundamental rights to cows and strict laws should be enacted to punish those harming the animal.The court said the accused, Javed (59), had stolen the cow, killed and beheaded it and kept its meat, adding that he had committed a similar offence earlier too."This is not the first offence of the applicant. Earlier too he had committed cow slaughter which had disturbed the harmony of society,” Justice Yadav said.According to a report in LiveLaw, the court further observed “fundamental right is not only the prerogative of beef eaters, rather, those who worship the cow and are financially dependent on cows, also have the right to lead a meaningful life”.It also said the right to life is above the right to kill and the right to eat beef can never be considered a fundamental right."The country will be safe, only when there would be the welfare of cows, and then only, there the country would prosper," Justice Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/declare-cow-as-national-animal-with-fundamental-rights-says-allahabad-hc-101630516147150.html

01-09-2021||India||Assam cabinet decides to remove Rajiv Gandhi’s name from Orang national park||The Assam cabinet on Wednesday decided to remove the name of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi from the Orang National Park. “During a recent interaction between Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and prominent members of the Adivasi and tea-tribe community, they had demanded removal of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s name from the Orang National Park,” said parliamentary affairs minister Pijush Hazarika. “Since the name Orang is associated with the sentiments of the Adivasi and tea-tribe community, the cabinet has decided to rename the Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park as Orang National Park,” he added. Located on the North Bank of Brahmaputra, Orang National Park spread over 78.80 sq km is the oldest forest reserve in the state. It was named a wildlife sanctuary in 1985 and declared a national park in 1999. In August 2005, the Congress government headed by Tarun Gogoi had decided to rename Orang National Park after the late Prime Minister despite resistance from local groups. The national park is named after the Oraon people, who are inhabitants of Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. Thousands of them were part of the many tribes from those states who were brought by the British to work in the tea-gardens of Assam. Many people from the Oraon tribe had settled near the area where the park is now located and the area took its name from them. According to the 2011 census, there are 73,437 Oraon people in Assam. “There was no demand for renaming of the national park from our side, but there may have been some who sought that. When the state has a BJP-led government, this was expected. In few years, a Congress government might change the name again,” said Dhiraj Gowala, president of Assam Tea Tribe Students Association (ATTSA), the premier student body of the community. “Such name changes are part of a similar drive by BJP governments across the country. Instead of this, it would be better if the state government focuses on our main demands like granting scheduled tribe (ST) status to tea-tribes, increase in daily wages of tea-garden workers etc.,” he added. Opposition Congress said that the renaming was another attempt by the BJP to wipe away contributions of Rajiv Gandhi to the country and to the state. “They can change names, but can’t wipe away the contributions of Rajiv Gandhi as the architect of a modern and progressive India. It was the former PM who brought peace to the state after the six-year-long agitation against illegal immigrants by signing the Assam Accord in 1985. But instead of recognizing these, the BJP is busy rewriting history,” said Bobbeeta Sharma, Congress’s media in-charge in Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cabinet-decides-to-remove-rajiv-gandhi-s-name-from-orang-national-park-101630513742334.html

01-09-2021||India||Kerala high court rejects plea seeking CBI probe into tree felling in Wayanad||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into illegal tree felling in Wayanad (north Kerala) observing that there is no need to intervene in the ongoing investigation. The court, however, directed the special investigation team (SIT) to probe all angles of the case and not to spare any one. A native of Thrissur, George Vattikulam, an activist, moved the High Court last month saying that the SIT investigation was dragging and expressed concern that many influential people involved in the case may go scot free and sought a central agency probe. The court said it is satisfied with the present investigation and directed the SIT to spare no one. The division bench headed by Chief Justice S Manikumar, however, said if the investigation was not proper or made public, then the petitioner had every right to move court again for another inquiry. “The SIT should probe the tree felling on assigned land, forest and protected areas,” it observed. The court later accepted the state government’s contention that the case was progressing well and the main accused were arrested. The court also said it did not want to disturb the ongoing probe. Earlier delay in arresting the main accused, three brothers of the Augustin family, had invited sharp criticism from the court. The Kerala government had opposed the CBI probe. In October 2020, the state revenue department had issued an order allowing felling of protected trees like rosewood and teak grown by farmers on the assigned land. Under the guise of this order, wood worth crores of rupees was smuggled from private and forest land. Poor farmers were given paltry amounts after being shown the government order by timber mafia. The tree felling and smuggling of valuable wood came to light in March after an upright forest officer unearthed illegal felling in which 101 rosewood trees, some of them as old as 500 years old had been cut and smuggled. After this many other districts also reported similar cases and green activists claimed that trees worth ₹500 crore were plundered using a weird government order and they suspected a nexus between politicians, officials and the timber mafia. Later the government had constituted a SIT and the Union Environment Ministry also sought a report from the state on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-rejects-plea-seeking-cbi-probe-into-tree-felling-in-wayanad-101630512542281.html
01-09-2021||India||HT This Day: September 2, 1972 — Bobby Fischer wins world chess title||ReykjavikBobby Fischer tonight won the World chess championship from Boris Spassky in a 21st-game victory to become the first American modern world champion. Fischer thus fulfilled a childhood dream that has driven him for 20 years. Fischer’s aide Fred Cramer said the Russian champion telephoned arbiter Lothar Schmid to tell him he resigned the 21st game of their $250,000 match, giving Fischer the title.Schmid sought a ruling from Dr Max Euwe, the president of the International Chess Federation and the last non-Russian to hold the world title. Euwe said that a telephoned resignation was valid and permissible.Fischer did not even know that he was world champion. And the crowds were still buying tickets outside the playing hall and fighting for seats in the cafeteria when the telephone call came. Fred Cramer and Fischer’s second, the Rev. William Lombardy, broke the news to the new champion shortly after he awoke, ready to resume the 21st game. Fischer asked Schmid to get a statement in writing from Spassky that he had resigned, Cramer said. Spassky’s resignation in the 21st game gave Fischer the winning 12-1l2-point lead. Spassky’s score was 8-1/2 points. This is the first time the winner had earned a four-point lead in a title match.Variations The game was adjourned after five hours’ play last night when Spassky (white) selected a 41st move and gave it to Schmid in a sealed envelope. Fischer deployed the Taimanov variation of the Sicilian defence. The variation was named after Russian grandmaster Mark Taimanov whom Fischer had beaten 6-0 in this competition.AP adds: When Bobby Fischer won his first U.S. chess championship at 14, the world called him a prodigy. Now that at 29 he has defeated Boris Spassky for the world title, people are calling him a superstar.For Fischer, however, the victory over the Russian is simply what he felt he deserved. “I am tired of being the unofficial champion,” he said several months before the match in Iceland got under way. “It is nice to be modest, but it would be stupid if I did not tell the truth. I should have been world champion 10 years ago.”Ten years ago, Fischer finished a surprisingly poor fourth behind three Russians in the tournament playoffs. He promptly accused the Russians of cheating, insisting that the used the round-robin format to their advantage by playing easy matches to draws against each other and saving the tough stuff for him.In 1965, the International Chess Federation scrapped the round-robin in favour of the player to player eliminations of the kind that led Fisher to the Reykjavik match.The American challenger began with a victory at the inter-zonal finals in Palma de Mallorca and went on to amass an unprecedented 20 straight wins. The Soviet Union’s Tigran Petrosyan had checked Fischer’s winning streak in the second game of their semifinal match in Argentina last November, but the U.S. grandmaster ultimately defeated the Russian 6-1l2 to 2-1l2, to earn the right to meet Spassky. The boy, who in 1958 became the youngest U.S. chess champion, was crew-cut and skinny, clad in T-shirt, dungarees and sneakers. The man who just brought the United States its first world chess title is tall, broad-shouldered and handsome, clad in a knight-patterned sweater and suede jacket. Between the boy and the man have been a series of spectacular victories and equally spectacular losses-usually when Fischer stalked off, complaining about the rules or the judges or the playing conditions. That was what he did in Iceland, forfeiting the second game by refusing to show up in an argument over playing conditions.No one ever disputed Fischer’s chess prowess. Grandmaster Robert Byrne, defeated twice by Fischer, said: “Bobby pursues the idea of the game in the platonic sense. All of us players have that ideal. But Bobby knows how to embody it.”Fischer, true to his capricious form arrived in the hall 16 minutes late. The crowd went wild with for and shouted “Bobby Bobby” when the announcement was made. Fischer looked at the crowd ‘hen down at his feet, walked over to sign his score sheet and almost ran out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-september-2-1972-bobby-fischer-wins-world-chess-title-101630510922393.html

"The government should roll back the hike," he said.Prices of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cooking gas cylinders across all categories, including subsidised gas, were hiked on Wednesday by ₹25 per cylinder -- the third straight increase in rates in less than two months.Also read| JD(U)’s national ambition behind demand for caste census and Pegasus probe, say party leadersSubsidised as well as non-subsidised LPG now costs ₹884.50 per 14.2-kg cylinder in Delhi, according to a price notification of oil companies.Further, speaking against leaving petrol and diesel prices to market mechanisms, Tyagi said the government must step in to curb their cost for people's benefit.According to a report in NDTV, Tyagi further said the opposition might use this as a weapon against the alliance in the coming elections."There has been an unprecedented increase in prices (of petroleum products). See where the petrol and diesel prices are today… The kitchen budget has been hit badly. This is very worrying."As a friendly party, we want to suggest to the government that the recent increase in prices should be rolled back… There are Assembly elections scheduled in many states in the coming months. Our political opponents can use this as a weapon against us in these elections," he was quoted as saying in the report.Also read | Bihar: JD(U) bid to project Nitish as ‘PM material’ a move to counter BJPA number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand, are set to see Assembly elections early next year,Of late, the Nitish Kumar-led party which is in power in Bihar with the BJP, has taken positions on certain issues that have raised eyebrows.On Sunday, the national council of the JD(U) passed a unanimous proposal stating Kumar is an able politician who can lead the nation as its Prime Minister.JD(U) president Lalan Singh, who put forward the resolution which deemed Kumar as ‘prime ministerial material’, said the Bihar chief minister was neither the Prime Ministerial candidate in the NDA and nor was he a contender for the post, but he had all the qualifications to become one.Earlier, Kumar had backed the opposition's demand for an investigation into the alleged snooping involving Pegasus spyware.He had also led the chorus for a caste census, a politically fraught issue over which the BJP has so far maintained silence and the Centre has spoken against a need for the same.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jdu-has-a-poll-warning-for-modi-govt-in-its-lpg-price-hike-rollback-advice-101630509999710.html

Amid the rising number of infections in neighbouring Kerala, Mandaviya discussed matters related to managing the spread of Covid-19 in those areas of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu which shares borders with Kerala, the statement said.“Highlighting the need to take adequate steps to contain the inter-state spread of Covid-19, Mandaviya requested the respective health ministers of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to increase the pace of vaccination in districts of their states that border Kerala,” the health ministry statement added.Kerala, which is currently the worst hit state from the pandemic across India, has registered over four million cases of the coronavirus disease till now including 229,912 active cases, nearly 21,000 deaths and 3,838,614 discharges. On Wednesday, the state saw another high in its daily tally as 32,803 new cases were recorded while 173 patients died and 21,610 recovered, according to the health department’s bulletin.In view of the worsening situation in Kerala, the Karnataka government on Tuesday made a seven-day institutional quarantine mandatory for people coming in from Kerala even if they have been vaccinated and carry a negative RT-PCR test report.Addressing reporters, health minister Dr K Sudhakar said on Tuesday that the Karnataka government is chalking out a strategy in consultation with experts on how to strengthen the Covid-19 prevention drive in districts which border Kerala such as Udupi, Chamarajanagar and Dakshina Kannada. Dr Sudhakar added the government may opt for even more strict measures in these border districts.On the other hand, Tamil Nadu, which extended its lockdown-like restrictions till September 15, had made it mandatory in August for people coming in the state from Kerala to present a negative RT-PCR test report and a vaccination certificate (both doses), in order to ward off the spread of Covid-19. According to the guidelines, the RT-PCR test result should not be older than 72 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mandaviya-reviews-covid-situation-in-tamil-nadu-k-taka-amid-spike-in-kerala-101630508674459.html
01-09-2021||India||Bangladesh information minister Hasan Mahmud to visit India next week||Bangladesh information minister Hasan Mahmud will visit India during September 5-8 for meetings with senior Indian officials and to boost cooperation between the two sides, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. Mahmud, who is also a senior leader of the ruling Awami League party, is expected to meet his Indian counterpart Anurag Thakur, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, the people said on condition of anonymity. He will be the first senior Bangladeshi leader to visit India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to Dhaka in March to participate in the neighbouring country’s National Day celebrations. That was Modi’s first visit abroad since the Covid-19 pandemic began last year. Mahmud’s visit will be an opportunity for the two sides to address strains in bilateral ties caused by India’s decision to halt the export of Covid-19 vaccines after the country was hit by a devastating second wave of infections in March-April. The Bangladeshi side was upset as the decision affected the supply of 30 million doses of Covishield vaccine contracted for from the Serum Institute of India. In recent months, Bangladesh has finalised deals with China for millions of doses and domestic pharmaceutical firms are set to start manufacturing vaccines too. Besides his official engagements, Mahmud will inaugurate a “Bangabandhu Media Centre” dedicated to Bangladesh’s father of the national, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, at the Press Club of India in New Delhi. The Bangladeshi side has donated computers, other equipment and books for the centre. The setting up of the centre is part of Bangladesh’s celebrations marking the birth centenary of Rahman, which began last year and were extended due to the pandemic. The Bangladeshi side has plans to create more such centres across India at universities and other institutions. Acclaimed Indian director Shyam Benegal is currently working on a biopic of Rahman that is being jointly produced by the film development corporations of the two countries. Benegal has completed most of the film, titled Bangabandhu, and is preparing for a shooting schedule in Bangladesh. During Modi’s visit in March, the two countries announced several initiatives to boost trade and connectivity, especially railway links that existed before the 1965 India-Pakistan war. Modi has repeatedly said Bangladesh has a special place in India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy, and New Delhi is looking at the connectivity initiatives to help drive the development of the landlocked north-eastern states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladesh-information-minister-hasan-mahmud-to-visit-india-next-week-101630508880890.html

The biennial show will be held in Gandhinagar from March 11-13, 2022. Singh will be briefed on the preparations for the event which is being planned at a time of ongoing uncertainty amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It also comes at a time when the government has sharpened its focus on promoting self- reliance in the defence manufacturing sector and positioning India as an exporter of military hardware. In the last one year, the government has imposed a ban on the import of 209 defence items that will be implemented progressively from 2021 to 2025 to boost self-reliance. DefExpo was traditionally held in Delhi until 2014 after which it has seen a string of new venues --- Goa (2016), Chennai (2018) and Lucknow (2020). The venue was shifted to Goa when the late Manohar Parrikar was the defence minister, it moved to Chennai when Nirmala Sitharaman held the portfolio, and it was staged in Lucknow last year with Singh as the defence minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-to-review-preparations-for-defexpo2022-101630505340060.html

Sasikala meets OPS to condole his wife's death||Expelled All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader VK Sasikala met party coordinator and former deputy CM O Panneerselvam on Wednesday to condole his wife Vijayalakshmi’s death.A key aide of late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalilathaa, Sasikala met Panneerselvam briefly at Gem hospital in Chennai and held his hands and consoled him. The two Jayalalithaa loyalists who fell out after her death reportedly spoke for about 20 minutes and Sasikala is said to have enquired about Vijayalakchmi’s condition before she passed away.Also read | Everyone backstabbed me: Sasikala in clipWith the ace politician who was eased out of the AIADMK years ago making several not-so-discreet attempts at making a comeback to the party fold, the meeting is seen as significant as the AIADMK top brass, headed by E Palaniswami and Paneerselvam, has been staunchly opposed to such moves.Ever since she walked out of jail earlier this year ahead of the Assembly election in Tamil Nadu, Sasikala has been making many bids at staking claim to the party. One such such move has been sharing audio clips with supporters wherein she spoke about setting the party back in order.In one of the clips she said everyone had back-stabbed her and that she would have picked O Panneerselvam as chief minister before she went to prison in 2017. This was a day after the dual leadership in the AIADMK expelled 16 party members for speaking to the ousted former interim general secretary.Also read | Sasikala's divide and rule policy won't work with AIADMK: Senior leader D JayakumarSasikala had also recently met former party presidium chairman Madhusudhanan at the hospital before his death.

01-09-2021||India||ED files complaint against TMC lawmakers, former mayor in Narada case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday filed its first complaint in the 2016 Narada sting operation case against West Bengal ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislator Madan Mitra, former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee and suspended IPS officer S M H Meerza. In the complaint lodged at a special Kolkata court of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), all five were charged under Sections 44 and 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Hakim, Mukherjee, Mitra and Chatterjee were arrested by the CBI on May 17 in the same case and released on bail after days of judicial custody during which they were hospitalized on health grounds. Chatterjee joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019 but left after the March-April assembly polls. Mirza was arrested by the CBI in September 2019 and released on bail. The ED is conducting a parallel investigation in the case which pertains to a controversy that erupted ahead of the 2016 assembly polls after the Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing a number of high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. While the ED’s action came as a blow to the TMC, the BJP, too, was not spared as the agency named leader of the opposition in the assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, as a suspect in a separate complaint filed before the court. The second complaint also names Mukul Roy, who joined the BJP in 2017 but returned to the TMC on June 11. TMC Lok Sabha members Saugata Roy, Kakali Ghosh Dastidar and Prasun Banerjee have been named amongst others. After reviewing the complaint filed by Rathin Bose, assistant director, ED, the special CBI court on Wednesday granted permission to serve summons to Hakim, Mukherjee and Mitra through the office of Biman Banerjee, the speaker of the West Bengal assembly. The court also authorized the central agency to directly summon Chatterjee and Mirza for questioning. Reacting to the court order, TMC general secretary Kunal Gosh said, “How can we conclude that the ED is not working under political orders? It should immediately summon Adhikari who is a prime accused in the Saradha chit fund case as well. Why is he not being touched?” BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “The ED is following the law. The TMC’s allegations are baseless.” The arrest of the TMC ministers and leaders in May triggered a legal battle and political slugfest. Following the arrests, chief minister Mamata Banerjee rushed to the CBI’s office at Nizam Palace in south Kolkata. She left after nearly six hours during which a few thousand TMC supporters assembled outside the premises. Some of them allegedly pelted stones at policemen. Though a special CBI court granted interim bail to all four on May 17, the CBI refused to release them and moved the Calcutta high court challenging the bail order. The matter was virtually heard by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Arijit Banerjee for nearly an hour late in the night after which the bail was stayed.A huge contingent of the Kolkata Police and Rapid Action Force had to be deployed outside the CBI office and Presidency correctional home where the accused were taken. The CBI approached the high court on May 24, seeking transfer of the case out of the state. The CBI claimed that on May 17 the TMC held violent protests, hampered the probe and intimidated the CBI court’s judge. Mamata Banerjee countered this petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-files-complaint-against-tmc-lawmakers-former-mayor-in-narada-case-101630503780218.html

01-09-2021||India||JD(U)’s national ambition behind demand for caste census and Pegasus probe, say party leaders||The ruling Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) in Bihar, which has put its alliance partner, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in a spot by seeking a probe into the Pegasus case and teaming up with rival Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) to demand a caste census, aims to make its presence felt in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Manipur elections, say party leaders.The JD(U) is a state party in Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh, and making a mark in UP and Manipur would enable it to seek national status, thereby having some impact on national politics. JD(U) insiders believe that the demand for caste census has catapulted Nitish Kumar to the status of a national leader as several Opposition parties are now demanding the same along with the general census in 2022. The Centre is yet to agree to it.The party is banking on RCP Singh, a union minister from JD(U), to work on a deal with the BJP and get a reasonable number of seats to contest for in the 2022 UP assembly elections. Or, party leaders said, JD(U) would contest the polls alone, which could impact the BJP’s upper caste vote-bank.“Singh has been given the task to negotiate with BJP leaders because of his closeness with their leadership. As former national president of JD(U),he is trying to revive the party in UP,” said a senior JD(U) functionary, requesting anonymity. Also Read | JD-U national council reiterates demand for caste census, says law not enough for population controlOther party leaders in the know of things said JD(U) leaders have had preliminary talks with BJP national president JP Nadda, union home minister Amit Shah and even UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath in this regard. “We are an old ally of the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and would definitely like to contest in alliance with the BJP in UP,” said JD(U) national principal general secretary KC Tyagi. He, however, denied that Singh had been pushed into negotiating with the BJP by the party. “He is in touch with UP party leaders and BJP leaders because CM Nitish Kumar wants an early settlement on the seat-sharing arrangement rather than leaving it for the last moment,” he added. Tyagi said that the JD(U), which is vying for a national status, has decided to hold its next national council meeting in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Manipur, the two states where it wants to field candidates. However, odds are against the JD(U) in UP if one goes by past election results. In 2007, the JD(U) contested in 16 seats, but won only one, and forfeited its deposit in 12. It could only manage 0.42% of the vote share then. In 2012, it contested on 219 seats, forfeited its deposit in all of them, and managed just 0.36% of votes. It did not contest the 2017 elections in UP. Other Bihar-based parties, the RJD and the Lok Janshakti Party, also tried their luck in previous UP elections and met a similar fate. “The scenario has changed. UP has 12% Kurmi (an agriculture community) voters and backward communities are rallying behind Nitish Kumar, ever since the demand for caste census grew. We want a respectable number of seats to contest on,” said Tyagi. However, in UP, the BJP is unlikely to leave much space for smaller parties, even as the Opposition is trying to cobble together a united front. This could also lead to rumblings within the NDA. A senior BJP leader, who requested anonymity, said if the party gives JD(U) close to the number of seats the contested in 2007, they should be happy with it.According to political experts, however, the JD(U) is more interested in marking its national presence rather than winning seats. “The label of a national party depends on the number of seats and vote share that a party gets. The quest to become a national party is also a part of JD(U)’s messaging to NDA allies that the party means business even with less numbers. At the same time, it wants to signal to the Opposition that Nitish Kumar is not only a firm-footed chief minister but also a dominant national player,” said former principal of Patna College Nawal Kishore Choudhary.In September, Nitish Kumar is likely to participate in the birth anniversary functions of Chaudhary Devi Lal, which leaders from several Opposition parties are likely to attend. Kumar, in August, met former Haryana chief minister and INLD president Om Prakash Chautala in Gurugram and called it a courtesy meet. Chautala had earlier spoken about his idea of exploring a third-front option on the birth anniversary of his father Chaudhary Devi Lal on September 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jdus-national-ambition-behind-demand-for-caste-census-and-pegasus-probe-say-party-leaders-101630501861539.html
01-09-2021||India||680 dead in monsoon rains; thousands displaced in flood-hit Assam & Bihar||At least 13 people were killed in rain-related incidents in the past 24 hours as downpour continued to pound various parts of the country, data released by the Union home ministry said.More than 680 people have died since June 1 when the monsoon officially arrived in the country, it added. While large-scale flooding displaced thousands of people in Assam, Bihar and some parts of West Bengal, landslides triggered by heavy rain continued to wreak havoc in parts of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.The ministry’s report on the flood situation said that 22 districts of Assam, 36 of Bihar, 12 of Uttar Pradesh and two each of West Bengal and Jharkhand were affected due to rise in water level in several rivers, including Ganga, Kosi, Bhagmati, Gandak, Ghagra and Mahananda. About 1.5 million people in these states have been affected due to the floods in the past 48 hours alone, the report added. Also Read | Heavy rainfall in Delhi makes new September record Data released by the disaster management departments of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand said the two states recorded more landslides this year when compared to previous years, even though rainfall has been less. Although rainfall in Uttarakhand was deficient by around 5% this year, the state saw a 32% increase in landslides, as per data from the state public works department. Over 135 people have been killed in over 1,200 incidents such as landslides and boulder falls, or were washed away in swollen rivers this year.Himachal, which saw 9% less rainfall, reported a 60% increase in landslides this year, according to the state disaster management authority. About 150 deaths were reported from the state so far this rainy season. Assam is witnessing floods despite less than normal rainfall. “For the month of August, the state received 296.3 mm rainfall against the normal of 347.1mm,” Sumit Das, senior scientist at Guwahati-based regional meteorological office, said. In the past seven days till August 31, the average rainfall for the state was recorded at 70.7 mm -- 4% less than the normal of 73.2 mm. Till August-end, Bihar received 801.9 mm of rain as compared to the normal of 1,027 mm, even as 32 of the total 40 districts remained flooded, displacing over a million people. While half of Odisha is witnessing drought-like conditions, the two neighbouring states of West Bengal and Jharkhand recorded flooding in some districts. Both Bengal and Jharkhand have received up to 8% excess rain, which is considered normal. Burdwan district in Bengal received around 40% more rain above the climatic normal in the entire season. Last week, Cooch Behar received 136% excess rain while North Dinajpur received 98% excess rain. In Jharkhand, Ranchi and its neighbouring districts received 20% excess rainfall this monsoon.Maharashtra, which has seen very high rainfall in the past two months, witnessed excess rainfall in 16 districts, including Mumbai and Nashik. The rainfall is up to 371% higher than normal for this period, according to IMD’s local weather office. Extremely heavy rainfall in the last two months which led to high-intensity floods and landslides resulted in the deaths of nearly 300 people and displaced over 450,000 people across the state, officials familiar with the matter said. A relief and rehabilitation department official said “As per data from early August, floods and landslides affected more than 1,100 villages in the districts of Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Kolhapur and Satara.” While the western and some parts of northeastern Madhya Pradesh received heavy rainfall in the past two days, there has been no flood-like situation in the state, officials said. Fifteen districts -- four in Bundelkhand, five in Mahakaushal, two in the central region and four in Malwa -- are in the orange zone, officials said. The state has recorded 720.8mm rainfall so far while it received 254mm rainfall in August alone, officials said, adding that there has been an overall rainfall deficiency of 7% this year.In the next few days, above normal rainfall activity is likely over many parts of central India and normal to below normal rainfall over many areas of northwest, northeast and southern most parts of peninsular India. With the IMD predicting above-normal rainfall in September, the current rain deficiency of 9% over the country is likely to decrease and hence, the overall monsoon rain (June 1 to September 30) is likely to be in the “lower end of normal category”. Despite having more dry days than previous years, extreme rainfall in the month of August increased this year in some states, the weather body said.

Make up your mind,” news agency ANI quoted Abdullah as saying.The remarks came a day after the first officially acknowledged meeting between India and the Taliban. Indian ambassador to Qatar Deepak Mittal met with the head of Taliban’s political office in Doha, Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, at the Indian embassy there. The ministry of external affairs said that the meeting took place “on the request of the Taliban side.”Also read | Safe return of Indians, terror in focus at first India, Taliban meetAbdullah asked the Centre why they were talking with the Taliban if the government considers them to be a terrorist group. Further he also asked if the Centre would move the UN and push for delisting the Taliban as a terrorist organisation.During the meeting with the Taliban side, the Indian ambassador discussed the safety and early return of Indians stranded in the country, the external affairs ministry said. Also, the travel of Afghan nations, especially the minorities, was also brought up during the talks. The ambassador had also emphasised that the Afghan soil should not be used for terrorist or anti-Indian activities, to which the Taliban representatives had assured that the issues would be addressed positively, the ministry said.While the Indian side has said that the key priority would be the safety of citizens stranded in Kabul following the Taliban’s takeover, it is yet to recognise the group formally. “The primary concern is the security and safety of people. Currently, there is no clarity about any entity forming a government in Kabul. I think we are jumping the gun regarding recognition,” the MEA had said last week. However, the Taliban have announced that the group wanted to continue Afghanistan’s political, economic and cultural ties with India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-up-your-mind-omar-abdullah-asks-centre-to-clarify-stance-on-taliban-in-afghanistan-101630499532731.html

The Congress leader was referring to the rise in prices of fuel while addressing a press conference.Govt to monetise under-utilised public sector assets“The problem is not cyclical, it is structural. The economic crisis that we faced in 1991 has resurfaced. The solutions that we brought worked till 2012 and I believe that without a new approach we will not be able to come out of this crisis. We need a new approach. Our plan for the economy, which worked from 1991 to 2012, stopped working after that,” he said.“We have to change our vision. Our strategy stopped working after 2012 and we wanted a new approach. PM Modi promised that he would bring a new approach for ‘New India’. Those were empty promises,” Rahul further added.Rahul Gandhi also criticised the National Monetisation Pipeline and took a dig at the ‘Make in India’ initiative. He said the Congress knows what the approach should be. He claimed that PM Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman don’t know how to address these ‘structural’ issues.‘People are angry’The Lok Sabha MP from Wayanad also said that people are angry and the Congress understands the pulse of the nation from the rising prices of fuel and LPG. He said that the Congress workers have been restraining themselves from taking to the street to protest against the rising fuel prices, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The anger against the government is building but voices are being suppressed. Covid-19 pandemic has not ended, hence we also do not want lakhs of people to take to the streets because this can lead to other issues. We are exercising restraint,” Rahul Gandhi said.He said that there will be a strong reaction as the anger against the rising fuel price will continue to mount.‘Demonetisation of the common people’During Rahul Gandhi’s press conference, which lasted a little bit over 30 minutes, he mocked the National Monetisation Pipeline and said that farmers, labourers and the unemployed were being demonetised. “Farmers, labourers, unemployed youth, middle class and medium and small enterprises are being demonetised. Only 4-5 friends of PM Modi are being monetised,” he said.Rahul Gandhi said the government was selling off ‘India’s assets’ to the private sector. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) reacted to the statement to say that the Congress leader does not have any idea regarding GDP. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that the GDP numbers for Q1 show that the economy has ‘bounced back under the leadership of PM Modi’, news agency ANI reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/structural-problems-in-centre-s-way-of-handling-economy-rahul-gandhi-101630497454336.html

The university is named after Narayan.JPU vice-chancellor Faruque Ali has promised to make amends from the new academic session starting in a couple of months as students’ organisations threatened an agitation over the omission. Bihar’s top leaders, including Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Prasad and chief minister Nitish Kumar, have been among the followers of Narayan.Also Read | ‘Ashoka Pillar’, ‘Buddha Relic Stupa’ submerged under floodwater in BiharIn a tweet, Prasad hit out at the government for the omission. “I had set up JPU 30 years ago at my karmbhoomi. It was named after Jai Prakashji. Now the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) backed Bihar government and RSS mindset has removed the thoughts of great socialist leaders like JP-Lohia from the same university. This cannot be tolerated. The government must take its cognisance forthwith.”Ali insisted the governor’s house approved the new syllabus during his predecessor’s tenure. He added it was initially kept pending due to a delay in the implementation of the choice-based credit system(CBCS). “CBCS should have been implemented long back, but it could not be possible at JPU. All universities in Bihar did it by 2018. I came here in September 2020 and wanted CBCS to be implemented straightaway for the benefit of students. I was told that the syllabus is ready and as there was no time left due to two years of backlog exams. It was implemented.”Ali said when the institution is named after Narayan, there was no reason for the omission. “In fact, there can be a separate paper on JP. Once the backlog exams are over for 2018 and 2019, we will bring about the required change from the next session starting within a few months.” Others omitted from the syllabus include Dayanand Saraswati, Raja Ram Mohan Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The additions are Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Subhash Chandra Bose, and Jyotiba Phule.Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary expressed his displeasure over the omission and additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar spoke to Ali when the matter came to light.Higher Education Council vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha said the university could not have taken the decision to alter the syllabus without getting it vetted. He added he has asked Ali to look into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jai-prakash-narayan-omitted-from-syllabus-of-bihar-varsity-named-after-him-101630497602639.html

01-09-2021||India||By switching on the sun, Railways can prevent 7mn tonnes of carbon emissions||The Indian Railways can offset around 7 million tonnes of carbon every year if it harnesses the energy from the sun. Not only that but it can also run one in four trains on the national network powered by solar energy and save in fuel costs to the tune of ₹17,000 crore.The latest findings lend credence to Union minister Piyush Goyal’s ambitious target of turning the Indian Railways into the world’s first net-zero carbon emitter by 2030. The minister had issued directives to railways to identify huge areas of unproductive land for setting up solar power plants to generate electricity for the national transporter.About 51,000 hectares of unused railway land has been identified for the purpose and the Indian Railways and the Union ministry of railways have formed a joint venture — Railway Energy Management Company — to support the development of solar photovoltaics and wind energy projects to supply the railway’s energy needs. Plans are already underway to deliver 20GW of solar-powered electricity to match the demand for energy to move trains.During his speech on the India's 75th Independence Day this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also announced the country's plan to become a net-zero carbon emitter by 2050 and highlighted that work was underway for 100% electrification of Indian Railways.On the track of net-zero emissionsIf the Indian Railways can achieve this target, it would lead to an annual emissions reduction of at least 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, which could help meet 5% of India’s targeted nationally determined contributions (NDC) to mitigate the effects of climate change. Together, these will help India reach its renewable energy target of 450GW by 2030.The analysis, part of a joint study by Delhi-based Climate Trends and the UK-based green-tech start-up Riding Sunbeams, highlights that around a quarter of the 20GW solar capacity —up to 5,272 MW — could be fed directly into the overhead power lines of the railways instead of being procured over the electricity networks, reducing transmission and distribution losses and saving money.“India is leading the world on two vital climate frontiers, including electrification of the railway network and solar power deployment. Connecting two of these keystone low-carbon technologies in Indian Railways can drive both India’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and its efforts to transition off fossil fuels to tackle the climate crisis,” Leo Murray, the founder of Riding Sunbeams said.The researchers found that substituting energy supplied from the coal-dominated grid for private-wire supply from solar could also rapidly cut emissions by as much as a 6.8million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.Power of 100% electrificationThe national transporter chose World Environment Day — celebrated every June 5 — this year to announce its plan to complete the electrification of the entire railway network by 2023 to reduce pollution, and leapfrog into its path of net-zero carbon emitter by 2030."Head-On-Generation systems, bio-toilets, and LED lights recreate the train itself into a travel mode that's kinder to the environment while maintaining comparable passenger comfort," the officials of the world’s second-largest railway network said in a statement on June 5.As per the Paris Agreement on climate change, India has pledged to reduce the intensity of emissions by 33-35% by 2030 from 2005-levels. One of the ways India can achieve its goal of shifting to non-fossil-fuel-based energy for 40% of its cumulative electricity generation capacity by 2030 is by transitioning the Indian Railways into a green transport medium.Indian Railways is the single largest consumer of electricity in India and is heavily dependent on coal-based power generation. The railways consume 20 TWh of electricity per year, which is roughly 2% of the country's total power generation. In 2019-20, the locomotives in the national network consumed 23,79,865 kilolitres of diesel and around 1,000 tonnes of coal to run.Cost of transition to clean energyConverting all current diesel traction to electric modes would initially cause a 32% increase in emissions due to India’s reliance on coal to produce electricity. The emissions intensity of the Indian electricity grid is 825 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e)/ GWh, over three times higher than the emissions intensity from the UK, for example. To mitigate this, the Indian Railways would need either to procure its supply of clean electricity from solar and wind generators connected directly into the rail network, or develop new grid-connected renewable projects to match the traction energy supplied via the electricity grid.“There has been analysis that converting all diesel locomotives to electric will indeed increase the emissions in the short term, however, this report shows the tremendous opportunity of doing it right the first time, by creating a direct connection of the locomotive system to solar PV installations, meeting more than a quarter of the total demand,” Aarti Khosla, the director at Climate Trends, who co-authored the study, said.As per the Niti Aayog data, the Indian Railway contributed to around 6.84 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission in 2014.The researchers, however, warned that achieving the target of 100% electrification in all routes by 2023 could be accompanied by an increase in carbon dioxide emissions in the short term because of India’s current reliance on coal to produce electricity.Decarbonisation of the power sectorBecoming 100% electric means shifting emissions to the power sector, which is 76% powered by coal as of December 2020. The net-zero target means the railways will be pushing the power sector to provide renewable energy instead of coal-based electricity. Since the national transporter is already the second-largest electricity consumer, its switch to fully electric will mean it can leverage its procurement power to accelerate power sector decarbonisation in the coming decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-railways-net-zero-emissions-clean-energy-climate-action-2030-101630492233320.html

Despite Kannada being declared as the official language, some officials have been derelict and this will not be tolerated,” he said.Also Read | Almatti dam height rise: Maharashtra seeks details from Karnataka amid fears of damagesFormer Congress chief and AICC in-charge of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Goa Dinesh Gundu Rao first raised the issue by accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government of neglecting Kannada to “please the Centre”.“It is a shame for Karnataka to ignore Kannada in our Metro inauguration programme on the Kengeri Purple route. It is impossible to tolerate sidelining of Kannada in a government programme. Our Metro project is a central and state partnership project. So why should Kannada not be a priority?” Rao said in a post on Twitter on Sunday.The event was inaugurated by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and Union minister for housing & urban affairs, petroleum and natural gas, Hardeep S Puri.At the event, Bommai also spoke in English mostly, which the BJP defended by saying that Puri did not understand Kannada. They reasoned that Bommai communicated with the minister in a language he understood, keeping the interest of the state in mind.Language strikes an emotional chord in Karnataka which, like several other non-Hindi speaking states, nurses a feeling of neglect for its native tongue under the current government.The Congress and other regional outfits have accused the union government of pursuing ‘one-nation, one-language’ policy as a way to make Hindi a common tongue as part of its larger Hindutva agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kannada-culture-department-issues-notice-to-bengaluru-metro-over-language-row-101630492979189.html

Citing the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, Rujira requested the ED officials to visit her residence in Kolkata instead.Last month, the ED issued summons to Abhishek and Rujira to appear before it for questioning in a money laundering case linked to an alleged coal scam in West Bengal. While Abhishek, the nephew of TMC supremo and Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, had been asked to appear before the agency on September 6, his wife was asked to appear on Wednesday (September 1).In a letter addressed to ED’s assistant director Sumat Prakash Jain, Rujira said, “This refers to summons dated August 18, 2021 asking me to appear in person in New Delhi on September 1. I am a mother of two infants, and travelling to New Delhi physically alone in the midst of the pandemic will put me and my children at grave risk.”Assuring cooperation from her side in the questioning, she said in the letter that the alleged cause of action of the subject matter of the ED’s inquiry too arose out of West Bengal. "You may communicate your decision. I assure you of every cooperation from my side,” Rujira said.The ED’s money laundering probe is based on the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI’s) First Information Report (FIR), which was registered in November last year regarding alleged mass coal pilferage in Eastern Coalfields Limited mines in Kunustoria and Kajora regions of West Bengal. Anup Majhi also known as Lala, is said to be the prime suspect in the caseIn February, a from the CBI had questioned Rujira at her residence in connection with the case.Meanwhile, the ED told a Delhi court in April that Abhishek Banerjee,33, was allegedly a beneficiary of funds obtained in the illegal mining, according to a report by Hindustan Times last Saturday. Citing the probe, the central agency alleged that an amount of ₹1,352 crores was generated by Anup Majhi by the means of illegal coal mining in two years. It was alleged that the funds collected by Manjhi and others in collusion with police officials, reached the politicians in Bengal and were then laundered in the country and overseas, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/citing-covid-19-rujira-banerjee-refuses-to-appear-before-ed-in-coal-scam-case-101630491611882.html

01-09-2021||India||Day after quitting AIUDF, MLA resigns from Assam assembly and joins ruling BJP||A day after he quit as primary member of All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), Phanidhar Talukdar, who represented Bhabanipur seat, resigned from the Assam assembly and joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday. Talukdar was the only Hindu among AIUDF legislators, a party which enjoys support from the Bengali-speaking Muslim community of the state. With his resignation, AIUDF’s strength in the assembly also came down to 15 MLAs. Following his resignation from assembly and a meeting with chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Talukdar joined the BJP at the party state office in presence of state unit president Bhabesh Kalita and other senior leaders. “Bhabanipur is associated with Khargeswar Talukdar and AIUDF’s win from this seat for three successive polls upset Hindus of the constituency. There was also no development in the area for past many years,” Talukdar told mediapersons after submitting his resignation to Speaker Biswajit Daimary. “I am attracted towards the good work being done by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and the ideology of BJP. Hence, I decided to join the party for the benefit of my constituency,” he added. “Bhabanipur is a historic place as it is associated with Khargeswar Talukdar. It was painful that this seat was represented by AIUDF since 2011. I am happy that Phanidhar Talukdar quit the AIUDF and joined us,” CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Wednesday. Khargeswar Talukdar, who died on December 10, 1979, was the first person killed in the six-year-long agitation against illegal immigrants. The agitation, that saw 855 deaths, ended with the signing of the Assam Accord in 1985. “I am hopeful that Talukdar will get re-elected from the Bhabanipur seat on a BJP ticket during the bypolls. I appeal to all BJP cadres and our alliance partners Asom Gana Parishad and United People Party Liberal to ensure his victory,” he added. Talukdar is the third newly elected MLA to resign from their parties after the assembly polls. Earlier, Congress MLAs Rupjyoti Kurmi of Mariani and Sushanta Borgohain of Thowra resigned from the party and also quit as members of the assembly.

01-09-2021||India||India’s ‘crown jewels’ are not up for sale: Govt responds to Opposition||The government on Wednesday dismissed the Opposition’s claims that the country’s “crown jewels” were up for sale under the ₹6 trillion National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) unveiled on August 23. It insisted the asset monetisation is distinct from slump sales. “The framework for monetisation of core assets under NMP clearly mentions that none of the assets in NMP is up for sale,” the government said in a statement.The government plans to raise ₹88,000 crore this year by leasing infrastructure assets of the central government ministries and state-run companies under NMP. The funds will then be used to build new infrastructure assets, helping boost economic growth. Roads (27%), railways (25%), power (15%), oil and gas pipelines (8%) and telecom (6%) are the top five sectors by value under the monetisation programme.The government maintained the assets have been put on a “limited period lease” and will be retaken later. It said the monetisation idea was not new as it was taken up earlier as well at the central and state levels. “In fact, it was the former (Congress-led) UPA (United Progressive Alliance) government at the Centre that had taken the initial steps towards… privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports.” It added non-discriminatory access of the assets to the public will follow the monetisation and there will be no monopoly.The government said the bulk of the infrastructure asset base will continue to be under the public sector after monetisation. “So public sector will continue to operate, run these assets and build more assets that can be further monetised.” The government called the monetisation “structured contractual partnership”. It insisted the private partners will only “operate and maintain the assets and return them to the government on completion of the transaction period.”Also Watch | ‘Do they belong to PM Modi?’: Mamata slams monetisation plan after Rahul GandhiCongress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh rejected the government’s explanation as irrelevant. “Public assets which were created with the taxpayers’ money will be given on lease. The people, who are going to lease them, are going to get that expense (for leasing) from public sector banks. The same assets will later be put in front of the same public who will have to pay for them (to utilise their services),” Vallabh said. He added technically this is a “grand clearance sale”.Vallabh said the monetisation contracts of airports such as in Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Mumbai, Jaipur, Guwahati, and Thiruvananthapuram were given to those who have never had any experience in such management. “Were they handling airports, were they into the business of airports? What was their experience in airports? Nothing at all. The same is going to happen with the rest of the assets of the country.”Vallabh said many gas pipelines, ports, warehousing assets, passenger trains, transmission lines, which the government seeks to monetise, are strategic assets. “There cannot be a more strategic asset than transmission lines because the country’s entire network, be it defence or whether it is normal day to day electricity consumption, everything depends on them.” He added the government is transferring strategic assets, not to one but two of their friends and everyone knows who they are. “I would not call this monopoly, but this is a duopoly,” he said. Vallabh added the government is leasing the assets for the “useful life” which is another way of sale. “The value of an asset after its useful life is that of scrap.”Vallabh said it was confusing to see the government is deliberately creating a monopoly in the economy. “Even the developed economies, be it the US or the UK, are making laws to do away with monopolies… and cartels. In India, assets created in the last 70 years are being used by the government to create monopolies.”He cited the government’s claim to raise ₹six trillion from the monetisation of assets and asked are they not yielding any revenue at the moment. “What is the current revenue of these assets... ?” He added for the last three years, the government has promised 100 lakh crore investment in infrastructure. “Where are they? You have said that you will generate six lakh crores from monetisation... where will the rest of 94 lakh crores come from?”Vallabh referred to the government’s claim that the “formulation of NMP included extensive consultations” with the stakeholders from the industry and experts. He added NMP was not even discussed in parliament. Vallabh called the government clarifications “haphazard” and said apparently finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is not a good listener. “She should specify when this was discussed in Parliament and which trade unions did you (the government) have discussions with.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-crown-jewels-are-not-up-for-sale-govt-responds-to-opposition-101630484158435.html

01-09-2021||India||Congress' Harish Rawat apologises for 'Panj Pyare' comment after backlash||Senior Congress leader and unit in-charge of Punjab, Harish Rawat, on Wednesday issued a statement of apology after sparking a major furore for equating Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu and four working presidents under him as 'Panj Payare', inducted into the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh.In a statement posted on social media, Rawat said he had no intention to hurt the Sikh sentiments and it was wrong on his part to compare the working presidents with Panj Pyare."Sometimes to express your respect, you use such words that are objectionable. I too have made the mistake of using the word 'Panj Pyare' yesterday for my honourable president and four working presidents," Rawat stated, adding, "I have made this mistake, I apologise for hurting the sentiments of people."The former chief minister of Uttarakhand also said, as an atonement, he will "sweep in a gurudwara in his state for some time."The Congress leader further said that he holds the 'Panj Pyare' in high esteem and had always worked for the betterment of the places related to Sikhism in Uttarakhand during his tenure.Panj Pyare, the five beloved ones, is the collective name given to five Sikh men − Bhai Daya Ram became Bhai Daya Singh, Bhai Dharam Ram became Bhai Dharam Singh, Bhai Himmat Rai became Bhai Himmat Singh, Bhai Mohkam Chand became Bhai Mohkam Singh, Bhai Sahib Chand became Bhai Sahib Singh, by Guru Gobind Singh. They formed the nucleus of the Khalsa.On Tuesday, Rawat met Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, along with working presidents Pawan Goel, Kuljit Singh Nagra and Punjab Congress general secretary Pargat Singh. After the meeting, Rawat in the media briefing equated Sidhu and the four working presidents as "Panj Pyaras". "It was my responsibility to discuss with the PCC chief, his team and 'Panj Pyare' (Navjot Singh Sidhu 4 working presidents). Sidhu has told me that the discussions over polls, organisational structure will be geared up... Rest assured, PCC is working," he told the media.The comment drew major outrage from leaders in Punjab who sought an apology from Rawat. Lashing out at Rawat, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Daljeet Singh Cheema said such remarks are not a joke and hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community. "It is very sad and disappointing that the Punjab Congress in-charge Harish Rawat has said that the meeting was chaired with 'Panj Pyare'. The 'Panj Pyaras' are respected and honoured in the Sikh Community. I would request Harish Rawat that is not at all a matter of joke, such remarks hurt the sentiments of the Sikh Community," Cheema said."He should withdraw the statement immediately, and the entire Congress should apologize to the entire Sikh community. A case should be registered against them for hurting the sentiments," he added.The SAD leader further accused the Congress of being anti-Sikh and hurting Sikh sentiments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-harish-rawat-apologises-for-panj-pyare-comment-after-backlash-101630480673068.html

Refuting these reports that are running on certain social media platforms, the Kashmir Zone police said that these reports qualify as "fake news"."Some social media platforms are running that 60 youth have gone missing from different parts of the Kashmir valley amid the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan," the Kashmir police tweeted on Wednesday, quoting the inspector-general of police (IGP) of Kashmir. "This is totally fake news".Some #SocialMedia platforms are running that 60 youth have gone #missing from different parts of the #Kashmir Valley amid the taliban takeover of Afghanistan. This is totally #fake news: IGP Kashmir@JmuKmrPoliceIn the wake of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, several reports emerged in the media suggesting terrorist groups have infiltrated the Kashmir valley, raising the level of violence on the ground. Citing unnamed security sources, these reports claimed that men from the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) valley were engaged in the lightning-fast Taliban offensive that won the militants control of the war-torn country on the heels of the US exit.These reports also stated that as many as 60 young men from Jammu and Kashmir went missing in the last few months, amid the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. The reports, however, refused to elaborate much on the disappearances.The Indian Army, however, had said last week that there is nothing to worry about regarding the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir in the context of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.Notably, India had, on the penultimate day of its presidency in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), issued a strong resolution on Afghanistan "demands that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts, and reiterates the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan, including those individuals and entities designated pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999), and notes the Taliban’s relevant commitments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-news-cops-refute-reports-of-60-youth-missing-from-kashmir-valley-amid-afghanistan-conflict-101630478046743.html
01-09-2021||India||Implement cheaper, sustainable cooling strategies: Lancet series||As temperatures rise throughout the world and heat waves become more intense, is reliance on air conditioners sustainable? What are the cheaper and sustainable cooling strategies that can be adapted by cities? How does heat affect the human body? A two-paper Lancet series on ‘heat and health’ published recently highlights solutions to such questions to combat heat stress. The use of air conditioners is the most common cooling solution implemented worldwide. “From a health perspective, use of air conditioning provides numerous benefits,” state the authors. “Reduction in indoor temperatures dramatically alleviates heat strain. A working air conditioning unit in a home is the strongest protective factor against heat-related fatalities. In hospital wards, its presence reduces the risk of mortality during a heat extreme by 40%. In general, the strongest driver for air conditioning adoption is improved thermal comfort.” Yet, there are urban and rural disparities in access to air conditioners and affordability is also a concern. Also Read | 50% of patients still have issues after a year: StudyAccording to the authors, identifying and implementing sustainable cooling strategies broadly accessible to all sections of society is a pressing need. “Not just air conditioners, in rural India, people cannot afford to buy air coolers too,” said Premsagar Tasgaonkar, a researcher with Watershed Organisation Trust (WOTR) that studied indoor and outdoor temperature in Maharashtra’s Yavatmal district and made policy recommendations like subsidies on air coolers during summers, building canopies and community halls every few kilometres, and getting people to use tiled roofs for better indoor temperatures. The authors of the Lancet papers have offered similar solutions. Fountains providing spray with moving water to accelerate evaporative cooling, bodies of water, large grasslands with trees, canopies located over outdoor areas, reducing road and vehicle density to mitigate greenhouse gas and heat emissions from vehicles, increasing insulation of roofs and walls to reduce net conductive heat flow from the outdoor to indoor environment are some of the solutions offered. Global temperatures have seen a record-breaking rise year after year. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in January that the past six years have been the warmest on record since 1880, with 2016, 2019 and 2020 being the top three. The WMO observed that 2020 was 1.2°C above pre-industrial era (1880) temperatures. According to a NASA analysis, the earth’s average temperature has risen more than 1.2°C since the late 19th century. 2020 was also the eighth warmest year in India, according to the India Meteorological Department’s statement on climate. The Lancet papers also highlight that exposure to high ambient temperatures causes suffering and death due to severe dehydration and cardiovascular strain. Senior citizens above 65 years of age, those with comorbid conditions, and children are known to be more vulnerable to heat strain. People who work outdoors are also at higher risk of suffering from heat related morbidity and mortality. A Lancet countdown had estimated 31,000 heat related deaths of people above 65 in India in 2018. “The heat-related health issues are not very well understood in India,” said Dr Dileep Malvankar Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, who was involved in drafting the Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan in 2013. “A lot of deaths caused by heat directly and indirectly never get registered as heat-related deaths,” he said. He recommends states and civic bodies appoint nodal officers for environmental health and create environmental health departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/implement-cheaper-sustainable-cooling-strategies-lancet-series-101630479537752.html

In some states, hospitals are awaiting equipment to connect the oxygen pipes especially to the Covid designated wards while others are looking for trained manpower to run the plants.Officials in multiple states said the issues are expected to be resolved by the September end or the first week of October. The installation of the plants acquired renewed urgency after the second Covid-19 wave this summer triggered a shortage of life-saving medical oxygen. According to the Union health ministry, about 50% of the remaining plants would be operational by September 15. All 1,222 plants are scheduled to be operational by December.In West Bengal, where 10 of the 49 plants are operational, at least four were not running. The state government has fixed September 15 as a deadline for installing all 49 oxygen plants.Also Read | C.1.2 variant: Centre says no cases in India so far, but how deadly is it?NC Mandal, the chief medical officer of Bengal’s Howrah district, said the 1,000 litre/minute PSA plant installed there has faced a few technical hiccups, and also there are not enough patients. The PSA plant at Jalpaiguri hospital in north Bengal, installed almost a month ago, was not working for over a week due to some technical snags, said an official.In Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital, a PSA plant, with a capacity of 5,0000 litre/minute, was not running as there are not enough patients. Another officer said that one PSA plant installed at Islampur Subdivisional Hospital is functional but has not been used as the pipeline was being installed.In Bihar, only 14 of 62 plants were running. At the Nalanda District Hospital, a 1,000-litre per minute PSA plant was commissioned in August. But the work on connecting oxygen to 300 beds was incomplete. The beds include 14 of a special neonatal care unit and 10 in emergency triage and treatment unit. “We expect to complete the oxygen pipeline work in a couple of days,” said Sunil Kumar, civil surgeon, Nalanda.Bihar is expected to generate 117 metric tonnes of medical oxygen daily and ramp up its storage capacity to 310-kilo litre in anticipation of a possible third Covid-19 wave. Each of the 10 state-run medical colleges will have at least one PSA oxygen generation plant. In all, 121 oxygen plants are being set up, health minister Mangal Pandey has said.In Uttar Pradesh, the newly installed 1,200 litre per minute oxygen plant at government-run 232-bed Tej Bahadur Sapru Hospital in Prayagraj was being tested. Officially the plant is running.“The oxygen pipelines have also been laid. This plant will supply oxygen in the next few days,” said the hospital’s chief medical superintendent, Kiran Malik.The hospital is looking for trained manpower to run oxygen plants around the clock. Malik said they may opt to train their own staff.Uttar Pradesh has so far commissioned 30% of the 127 PSA plants sanctioned to it.In Madhya Pradesh, just 18 of 88 plants are running. Several plants are shut as there are no critical Covid patients. RP Patel, the superintendent of Bhopal’s Katju Hospital, said a plant installed there a month back is not operational as there are no critical patients.Also Read | India logs 41,965 cases in 24 hours; more than half are from KeralaDamoh’s chief medical health officer, Sangeeta Trivedi, said an oxygen plant has ensured that a community health centre in the region has a dedicated oxygen supply for the first time. “We do not have to refer every patient to private hospitals for treatment now,” she said.Officials said all the 88 PSA plants in Madhya Pradesh will be operational by September end.Only 10 of the 51 sanctioned plants are operational in Rajasthan. The oxygen plant installed at one of the state’s biggest hospitals, Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh ) Hospital, is running for only a couple of hours daily.Arvind Gupta, an official at the hospital, said they are running the plant daily for 1-2 hours as there are no Covid patients. “If needed, we would provide oxygen to other hospitals also.” The operationalisation of the plant was delayed as a valve was defective, and had to be replaced, said a person aware of the matter.As many as 70 PSA plants have been set up in Tamil Nadu under PM Cares Fund and another 72 through donations and corporate social responsibility funding. “Twenty-eight plants have been commissioned so far and installation is ongoing at another 33 sites,” said J Deepak, managing director, Tamil Nadu Medical Service Corporation, which is handling Covid-19 infrastructure and medicines.In Chennai, which was among the worst hit during both Covid waves, oxygen plants have been commissioned in Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Institute Of Child Health and Hospital for Children, Government Stanley Hospital, and ESI Hospital.E Theranirajan, the dean of RGGGH, said a plant has been installed specifically for Covid patients at the hospital. He added it will take another week to make it operational. “Two more oxygen plants, for non-Covid patients, have been made operational through CSR initiatives with a daily production capacity of 0.8 MT each.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-plants-commissioned-but-problems-remain-in-making-them-operational-101630478278182.html

This strain of the coronavirus, first reported from South Africa, has now spread to at least six countries, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The public health body of the United Nations (UN) said this week that it was monitoring the new C.1.2 virus strain, which could possibly be more transmissible and evade protection provided by vaccines, according to a study.No case of new COVID-19 variant C.1.2 reported in India so far: Govt sourcesC.1.2 Covid-19 variant was first detected in South Africa in May, but an alert about the "C.1.2 lineage" was issued by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in the country on Monday. It said, however, that the Delta variant is still the most dominant strain of the coronavirus in South Africa.On medRxiv, a preprint server for health sciences, a paper that is yet to be peer-reviewed pointed out that the C.1.2 Covid-19 variant has been detected across the "majority" of provinces in South Africa and "seven other countries spanning Africa, Europe, Asia, and Oceania”; however, the exact extent of the variant's spread has not yet been confirmed by health authorities.WHO has a system of classifying coronavirus variants based on their transmissibility, virulence, or efficacy in the face of social measures. While 'variants of concern', such as the Delta variant, show an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (for example, increased hospitalisations or deaths), the 'variants of interest' usually show community transmission in multiple clusters, but are not necessarily more virulent or transmissible.However, what's important to note here is that the World Health Organisation is yet to classify the reported C.1.2 coronavirus variant as either a 'variant of interest' or a 'variant of concern'. An alert was still issued by the South African institute since the C.1.2 variant is reported to contain a few "key mutations" which could trigger it to become variants of interest or concern. “Any time we see those particular mutations come up, we’d like to keep an eye on the variant to see what it’s going to do," The Guardian quoted Dr Megan Steain, a virologist and lecturer in immunology and infectious diseases in Sydney, as saying. "These mutations may affect things like whether it evades the immune response, or transmits faster."According to the study cited earlier, the C.1.2 lineage has a mutation rate of about 41.8 mutations per year, which is about twice as fast as the current global mutation rate of the other variants. "It could be more transmissible and has the potential to spread fast," said Upasana Ray, a virologist from Kolkata's CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology. "Since there are so many mutations in the spike protein, it could result in immune escape and thus a challenge for the vaccination drive worldwide if allowed to spread."So far, researchers say that the mutations N440K and Y449H, associated with immune escape from certain antibodies, have also been found in C.1.2 sequences. Based on these findings, an educated guess says that it is similar to what was previously seen in variants like Beta and Delta. Therefore, there could be a chance that the serum would not neutralise as well as it would against an ancestral strain, but a lot of these projections are still speculative, researchers said, adding that more experiences are needed to properly judge the efficacy of current Covid-19 vaccines against the new strain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/c12-covid-19-variant-centre-says-no-cases-in-india-so-far-but-how-deadly-is-it-101630473952638.html

The modalities and issues related to the Centre’s move to take over projects on the Krishna and Godavari rivers in the two states will be among the issues discussed at the meetings. The Krishna waters sharing is a major bone of contention between the two states. The diversion of waters from the Godavari to the Krishna will also be discussed. The two states have so far held 13 meetings on waters sharing. Telangana is on Wednesday expected to again seek a higher share of waters allocation from the Krishna. It was allocated 299 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of waters from the river when it was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014. The Krishna flows through Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. The united Andhra Pradesh was allocated 811 TMC. “There was no Telangana state earlier; so, the 299 TMC allocation was done without proper consultation... Hence, we want a higher share,” a Telangana irrigation department official said, requesting anonymity.Telangana has been seeking higher waters share, and the matter is pending before the Krishna River Water Disputes Tribunal- 2. “Until the matter is solved, we are asking for a 50-50 share which Andhra Pradesh is opposing,” the official said.An Andhra Pradesh’s irrigation department official said all issues including Telangana’s demand will be discussed.The KRMB was to be allocated to Andhra Pradesh and GRMB to Telangana as per the bifurcation plan. Andhra Pradesh has sought to shift the KRMB’s office from Hyderabad to Visakhapatnam, about 550 km from the river basin. Telangana wants the KRMB office to be closer to the basin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meetings-of-krishna-godavari-boards-to-be-held-today-101630475217266.html

As a new month begins, here is a list of important changes that will come into effect from today.Mandatory PAN-Aadhaar linkingThe State Bank of India (SBI) had earlier directed that linking the PAN card and the Aadhaar card was mandatory and had to be done within September 30. According to bank officials familiar with the development, there might be transaction-related issues in case an individual does not follow through with the directions. According to the erstwhile guidelines, the bank account had to be linked with PAN in the case of depositing over ₹50,000 to the account.Aadhaar-PF linkingFrom September 1 onwards, employers can also credit their contribution of the provident fund (PF) only if the employee’s Aadhaar number is linked to their Universal Account Number (UAN). The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) amended Section 142 of the Code of Social Security, 2020, which has made the Aadhaar-PF linking mandatory for availing of various services, receiving payments, and seeking benefits, among others.LPG price hikeCooking gas prices are rising once again in early September, reports had indicated last month. Now, petroleum companies have hiked LPG cylinder prices once again by ₹25; taking the price of a non-subsidised 14.2-kg cylinder in Delhi to ₹884.50. The price of cooking gas had gone up by ₹25 per cylinder on August 18. Earlier still, in July, the price of cooking gas was increased by ₹25.50.Since the cooking gas prices witnessed a surge for two months in a row, it was expected that the trend will continue in September as well. Since January this year, LPG prices have increased by ₹165 per cylinder.The new rates are effective from today. The price of a 19-kg commercial cylinder has also increased by ₹75, which will now cost ₹1,693 in Delhi.New cheque clearance normThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has laid down a new Positive Pay System for clearing cheques in 2020 in order to verify an issuer’s details for stopping any fraudulent acts. The system had, however, come into effect on January 1 of this year.Axis Bank will adopt the new system from September 1 onwards; the private sector lender has already begun the process of informing its account holders of the rule via SMS. Customers who are issuing high-value cheques must now inform their respective banks before doing, under this new system for cheque clearance. This is meant to prevent bank frauds pertaining to issuing and clearance of cheques.GSTR-1 filing guidelinesNew rules are also being issued for goods and services tax (GST) networks from this month. The Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN) has said that from now on, in order to file GSTR-1 in accordance with the rules, everything has to be submitted in line with Rule-59(6) of the Central GST Rule. According to these new protocols, no person can file GSTR-1 unless he fills up the GSTR-3B form.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-aadhaar-pf-link-to-lpg-prices-here-are-new-rules-in-effect-from-today-101630460652645.html

The total number of coronavirus cases recorded in Maharashtra have now reached 6.464 million and the death toll due to the disease has reached 137,313. Lesser number of infections also saw a 16% drop in the death rate in August when 4,208 Covid-related fatalities were reported. 5,020 deaths took place in July and 7,542 in June.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to Maharashtra government for Covid-19 management, said despite the overall drop in number of infections, there were some pockets of concern in the state. “Some districts such as Pune, Kolhapur and Satara are not witnessing a dip,” said Dr Salunkhe. Mumbai recorded 323 new Covid cases on Tuesday and one death, taking the Maximum city’s infections tally in August to 15,977. With the dip in the number of cases mid-August, 13,453 (87.9%) of the 15,290 Covid beds across hospitals in the city were vacant as of Tuesday morning. The 15,290 beds comprise normal beds, oxygen beds, ICU beds, paediatric ICU beds, neonatal ICU beds, and ventilator beds for Covid patients.6,838 (90%) of the 7,595 oxygen beds; 1,639 (73%) of the 2,243 ICU beds and 883 (68%) of the 1,289 ventilator beds were vacant, as per official data. 37 of the 39 paediatric ICU beds and 22 out of the 28 neonatal ICU beds were vacant too. Of the 127 beds for cancer patients with Covid, requiring dialysis, 66 or 51% were vacant, the data showed.Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s public health department, said, “We have noticed bed vacancy has been steadily increasing over the past two-three weeks. The dip in cases witnessed during August is mainly responsible for this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-158-880-august-covid-infections-in-maharasthra-33-less-than-july-101630461655893.html

If you are really concerned about rising NPAs (non-performing assets) of the public sector banks, concentrate on big corporate debtors...not on such small loanees,” a bench, headed by Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, told Canara Bank.Loans are deemed non-performing once they are left unpaid for at least 90 days beyond the due date and borrowers are likely to default on these debts.The bench, which also included justices MR Shah and Hima Kohli, was hearing an appeal by Canara Bank against a judgment of the Madras high court in March this year.The high court had repelled an attempt by the public sector bank to hold a social service society from Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, liable for repaying an amount of ₹48.8 lakh, which was given to 1,540 individuals as loans in 1994-95. The high court had held that Canara Bank cannot recover its outstanding loan from the society’s fixed deposit since there was no formal contract or express agreement of recovery from the society in case of failure by the borrowers to repay the loans.Representing the bank, senior advocate Dhruv Mehta argued before the top court that the Tiruchirapalli Multipurpose Social Service Society gave letters of guarantee that they will assure repayment of loans from the borrowers and that it was only on this assurance, the amounts were released.But the bench noted that the loan was given by the bank under the DIR scheme to financially assist low-income groups. “These amounts were given to those involved in small farming, poultry, dairy, or to tradesmen and artisans. These are marginalised sections...some of them cannot even pay ₹10 for their photos on these forms. And the society, admittedly, helped you to identify these people. Why are you now going after the society?” the bench asked Mehta.The bench added: “Giving loans to certain sections of society is also a social function. It is not only an economic function. You should also bear a moral responsibility.”At this, Mehta replied that the banks were already suffering from the problem of NPAs and that recoveries had to be made to tide over it.The court, however, retorted: “These are not the people to go after. You should go after the big fish. Canara Bank should not come in appeal against a society such as this.”Mehta said that the bank has come in an appeal since a petition under Article 136 (special leave petition with wide discretionary power) is a ‘Brahmastra’.“The Constitution has entrusted us with this Brahmastra only to make sure we use this only in suitable cases. And this is not the one,” said the bench, rejecting Canara Bank’s appeal.It also upheld the high court order, stating that the bank should desist from contesting a matter like this and should instead channelise its energy and resources on better cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/go-after-big-fish-if-concerned-about-npas-supreme-court-to-psbs-101630460128299.html

01-09-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination: Record 12 million vaccine doses administered in a day||New Delhi: With over 12.8 million shots of the vaccine administered across India on Tuesday, according to data available at 11pm on the Co-WIN dashboard, India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive set yet another single-day record for doses delivered, wrapping up August as, by far, the best month (yet) of India’s mass inoculation programme.The total number of people across India who have now received at least one shot of the vaccine has surpassed 500 million, data shows.Tuesday’s record single-day jabs means that in the month of August, the country administered a total of 183.5 million doses, translating to a daily average of 5.9 million doses throughout the month. This average administration is a jump of 1.6 million doses a day over the previous monthly best recorded in July (average of 4.3 million jabs a day). At its lowest since the drive was thrown open to all adults, this pace had dropped to under 2 million doses a day through May, data shows. With more vaccine doses (at least 250 million) available in September, the number could increase even more. Tuesday marked the third time in the past 15 days that the country has set a new record for single-day dose administration. A total of 12,869,300 doses had been administered till 11pm on Tuesday, according to data from the Union health ministry’s Co-WIN dashboard, bettering the previous high of 10,064,376 doses set on Friday. Before that, on August 16, 8.82 million jabs were administered across the country.Buoyed by these daily records, the country’s pace of vaccination, which was patchy for months, appears to have finally settled into high gear. In the past week, an average of 8.3 million doses has been administered across the country every day – the highest pace ever recorded in the country, according to HT’s dashboard.The recent jump in pace comes less than a week after India touched the milestone of covering half the country’s adult population with at least one shot of the vaccine. Till Tuesday night, a total of 651.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered across the country to 500 million people with 350 million people partially vaccinated and 150 million people having received both doses of the vaccine. When seen alongside the country’s projected adult population of 940 million (according to the Census of India’s National Commission on Population), this means that 53.3% of people above the age of 18 years have received vaccine shots – 37.3% have been partially vaccinated and 16% having received both doses.A LONG WAY STILL TO GOWhile the pace of the drive has seen progress, data shows that there is still a long way to go if India wants to achieve its stated target of vaccinating its entire adult population of 940 million by the end of 2021.Data shows that the country still needs to increase the pace of vaccinations to completely cover all adults by the end of December, a commitment the government has made in a submission to the Supreme Court. In total, India needed to administer around 1.88 billion doses by the end of the year to meet this target. Since 651 million of these have already been administered, that leaves around 1.23 billion doses still left in the remaining 122 days in the year, or 10.1 million doses every single day for the rest of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-record-12-million-vaccine-doses-administered-in-a-day-101630439693571.html

01-09-2021||India||Rajnath Singh praises Adityanath, launches 180 projects in U.P.||Lucknow: Praising the “tough stand” taken by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on law and order in the state, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said, “The heartbeat of criminals stops when they hear the name Yogi.”Singh was speaking after he, along with the UP chief minister, laid the foundation stones for 180 projects that will come up at an estimated cost of ₹1,710 crore in a programme at Jyotiba Phule Park in Lucknow.They also inaugurated the Victoria Street-Charak Flyover on the occasion.Singh, who is also the Lok Sabha MP from Lucknow said, “Had Yogi Aditynath not been the chief minister, then I would not have been able to work so much for Lucknow.”“If we want to ensure good governance in the state, it is not possible without better law and order. Development is also not possible without it. He should be appreciated for the strict action taken by him,” the Union minister said.Adityanath said that Uttar Pradesh had changed and the state was in second place in the ease of doing business rankings. “That’s why it has attracted investment of ₹65,000 crore during the corona period. From 2003 to 2017, the state government ensured a steep fall in economy, law and order, but today everything is looking up,” he added.Describing the Victoria Street flyover as “a historic work”, Singh said it earlier took one hour to cover the 4-km distance, but now commuters would be able to cross the stretch in three minutes.Five flyovers have been completed and work on the next four would start soon, said Rajnath Singh.Singh also drew the attention of the CM to the slow pace of 100-km ring road project in Lucknow, urging him for its timely completion. “I request CM to show his ‘tevar’ (attitude) as only he can do that,” he said. The defence minister also appreciated Adityanath for providing over 250 acres on lease of Re 1 for a facility to manufacture Brahmos missiles in Lucknow under the defence corridor project. He added, “Every household in Lucknow will get piped natural gas (PNG) connection. Green Gas Limited has agreed to lay PNG lines across the city. Now the cost of gas will be less.”Rajnath also hailed the CM for his sensitivity during the coronavirus pandemic, citing the facilities provided to children whose parents died due to the infection.The defence minister asked his supporters to have a picture of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on every hoarding which they put up for his welcome.“God has created the wonderful duo of Modi at the Centre and Yogi in UP. That’s why 90% of people have been benefited by government schemes in the state,” the defence minister added.Uttar Pradesh will go to polls early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-praises-adityanath-launches-180-projects-in-up-101630438555886.html

The move comes as most states are partially reopening their schools for physical classes as the second wave of the pandemic continues to ebb and the country’s vaccine drive gathers momentum.

This average administration is a jump of 1.6 million doses a day over the previous monthly best recorded in July (average of 4.3 million jabs a day). At its lowest since the drive was thrown open to all adults, this pace had dropped to under 2 million doses a day through May, data shows. With more vaccine doses (at least 250 million) available in September, the number could increase even more.Tuesday marked the third time in the past 15 days that the country has set a new record for single-day dose administration. A total of 12,869,300 doses had been administered till 11pm on Tuesday, according to data from the Union health ministry’s Co-WIN dashboard, bettering the previous high of 10,064,376 doses set on Friday. On August 16, 8.82 million jabs were administered across the country.Buoyed by these daily records, the country’s pace of vaccination, which was patchy for months, appears to have finally settled into high gear. In the past week, an average of 8.3 million daily doses has been administered across India – the highest pace ever recorded in the country, as per HT’s dashboard.The recent jump in pace comes less than a week after India touched the milestone of covering half the country’s adult population with at least one shot. Till Tuesday night, a total of 651.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered across the country to 500 million people with 350 million people partially vaccinated and 150 million people having received both doses of the vaccine. When seen alongside the country’s projected adult population of 940 million (according to the Census of India’s National Commission on Population), this means 53.3% of people above 18 years of age have received vaccine – 37.3% have been partially vaccinated and 16% have received both doses.While the pace of the drive has seen progress, data shows there is still a long way to go if India wants to achieve its stated target of vaccinating its entire adult population by 2021-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-12-million-vaccines-administered-in-a-day-101630436833075.html
01-09-2021||India||Experts raise questions on Kerala ‘record’ jabs||A nurse in Kerala administered vaccine to 893 people in seven and a half hours and state health minister Veena Geroge felicitated her on Monday in Pathanamthitta district for this record of sorts, but her feat hasn’t gone down well with the medical community. Meanwhile, the state reported 30,203 Covid positive cases with a high test positivity rate of 18.86% on Tuesday after 160,152 samples were tested. The active caseload rose to 218,292 and the state also reported 115 deaths, said the state health ministry. Many experts have criticised the state’s crave for ‘records’ when it remained the pandemic capital of the country contributing around 70% of the total cases. They said as per the statistics more than 100 vaccines would have been given in an hour. But going by the medical practice, they said, 5 to 10 minutes are needed for each inoculation, as the person will be asked about the possibility of medical reaction and case history, if any, before administering it. They said it is difficult to give more than 25 vaccines in an hour even if somebody helped the nurse. What irked professionals are that the minister’s office released the news with photos of the event underlining the ‘record’. Many health activists also took to social media to criticise it. “It shows the state will stoop to so low to create records,” an activist said, not wishing to be named. Others asked the government to stop its soft corner for records which landed it in a sorry state. After the incident kicked off a row, the nurse at Chenganur government hospital, K Pushpalata, said it was not done for any record and that it was a collective work. “I did not do this for record but I met all procedures and rules. It was a collective venture,” she said. Later the minister also criticised those who made it a controversy. “Everything can’t be seen in negative way. Some people only see the negative side and try to portray all good work in bad light,” she said, asking them not to de-motivate overworked health workers. Meanwhile, the state government has decided to conduct only RT-PCR tests in six districts that completed around 80% of vaccination. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said three districts -- Wayanad, Pathanamthitta and Ernakulam -- have crossed 80% vaccine coverage, and Thiruvnanthapuram, Idukki and Kasaragod are about to reach 80%. Only RT-PCR tests will be done in these districts. Many experts have earlier criticised the state’s overdependence on antigen tests which still formed around 40% of total tests. “We are on a mission to inoculate all eligible population by September-end. We have covered those above 60 years well,” the CM said, after chairing a core committee meeting on pandemic. The state clamped night curfew from Monday and decided to conduct a sero prevalence study to determine the immunity of people against the Sars-Cov 2 virus and find out whether some mutation has taken place in the state. But many experts criticised the night curfew move. “We have no idea who suggested it. As such the state has no night life,” said Dr N M Arun, an internal medicine expert. The health minister said nod for the sero study was granted by the Indian Council of Medical Research and samples will be collected from all parts of the state. “This study will help streamline our preventive measures and we can find out how much per cent of people got immunity so far. We can make targeted vaccination and testing based on its findings. We are trying hard to complete at least one dose to all eligible people by September-end,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-raise-questions-on-kerala-record-jabs-101630436035336.html
01-09-2021||India||AIADMK protests against Jayalalithaa Univ merger||Tamil Nadu police on Tuesday detained former deputy chief minister O Paneerselvam and other AIADMK lawmakers and later released them for protesting against the ruling DMK’s move to merge Dr J Jayalalithaa University in Villupuram district with Annamalai University in Chidambaram. When minister for higher education K Ponmudy introduced the Tamil Nadu Universities Laws (Amendment and Repeal) Bill 2021 for the merger, AIADMK’s former higher education minister K Anbazhagan was on his feet to oppose it. He was followed by Panneerselvam, who eventually led a walkout from the ongoing assembly and they sat in protest on a busy arterial road along the Kalaivanar Arangam, where the assembly takes place. The ‘road roko’ went on for about 15 minutes before the police picked them up and detained them inside a marriage hall. After being released, Panneerselvam accused the Dravida Munnetra Kazahagam (DMK), which formed the government in May, of political vendetta. “From the time when she was chief minister from 2011, Amma (Jayalalithaa) rolled out several schemes and made high budgetary allocations for us to excel in the higher education sector and for the overall progress of the state,” said Panneerselvam. “She established several colleges during her governance. No chief minister of any state has achieved the way she has, so it is only apt to name an educational institution after her.” In February earlier this year, the then All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) regime passed a Bill in the assembly to establish Dr J Jayalalithaa University in Villupuram to start functioning from this academic year. It was to honour their leader, who passed away in office in December 2016.Panneerselvam added that it was late Jayalalithaa who saved Annamalai University from closing down due to a shortage of funds and allocated funds annually for the running of the institute. “The DMK has introduced this Bill out of political vendetta just to remove Amma’s name,” said Panneerselvam, adding that the student community, people of Tamil Nadu and the AIADMK condemn the move.When the AIADMK had passed the Bill in February, it also gave effect to the bifurcation of the Vellore-headquartered Thiruvalluvar University and to create a new academic institution with headquarters in Villupuram. The colleges in the surrounding districts of Villupuram, Cuddalore and Kallakurichi would be disaffiliated from Thiruvalluvar University, and transferred to the newly established university, which they named after Jayalalithaa. The DMK’s new bill seeks to repeal the Dr J Jayalalithaa University Act 2021. It also seeks to convert the Annamalai University from a unitary institution to an affiliating university so that the colleges in Villupuram, Cuddalore, Kallakurichi and Mayiladuthurai could then be affiliated to the Annamalai University. The DMK denied passing this bill out of political vendetta. The party has justified its decision stating that Jayalalithaa University has remained non-functional as it was passed for namesake during the fag end of the previous regime without taking any practical steps, such as funding for its functioning. To this, Panneerselvam said that it’s a newly established university and the new government should support it. DMK said that since Annamalai is an existing renowned institution with 1000 acres of land and other infrastructure, it would be more beneficial to students. “Annamalai University has now come under the government and by changing it from a unitary to an affiliating university, we can get UGC grants and it will be beneficial for students from the surrounding districts as it is already a renowned institution,” said DMK spokesperson Constantine Ravindran. DMK also cited the example of two other educational institutes that are named after Jayalalithaa in the state, but they aren’t changing those names or scrapping those institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmkprotests-against-jayalalithaa-univ-merger-101630435974037.html
01-09-2021||India||After HC order, T’gana stays reopening of government schools||The Telangana Education department on Tuesday issued a clarification on reopening of schools in the state, saying that except for the social welfare, residential and tribal welfare schools with hostel facilities, all other schools are permitted to reopen from September 1.A memo was issued to that effect by the secretary to government (education), Sandeep Kumar Sultania, based on a High Court ruling on Tuesday which asked the government to lay down standard operating procedures (SOP) to be followed by all school managements about the reopening of the educational institutional institutions in the state. The state government had on August 23 announced that physical classes in all schools (including residential and welfare schools with hostels) would resume from September 1. However, city-based IAS coach and advocate Bala Krishna Mandapati filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) on the issue, due to the ongoing Covid pandemic. The state’s plan to completely resume offline classes hit a break on Tuesday morning as a bench of acting Chief Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and justice Vinod Kumar ruled that it is not mandatory to attend offline classes starting tomorrow for any child. Based on the court’s directions, the memo from the Telangana Education department stated that it is now up to school managements to have either online or offline classes for children or a combination of both. It added that any undertaking by parents from managements absolving the latter if any child gets infected with Covid-19 would also not have any “legal effect”.The Telangana government, led by chief minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR), decided to reopen and run physical classes from September 1 and had issued guidelines for the same. The state is still reporting about 300 Covid-19 cases every day even now.In the state, schools and other educational institutions have been shut since the academic year began, and classes are still being held online. After the government decided to reopen all schools, management were asked to create a customised seating arrangement along with a proper plan of physical distancing, aside from students being made to wear masks compulsorily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-hc-order-t-gana-stays-reopening-of-government-schools-101630435972503.html
01-09-2021||India||Bengaluru Metro looks to cut inter-train interval to 3min on Phase-I lines||BengaluruThe Bengaluru Metro will soon start retrofitting works on its existing phase-I lines to keep it on par with the technology used in subsequent phases to enable trains to run in 3-minute intervals rather than the limitation of the 5 minutes between them.This will not only increase frequency but also reduce wait times and encourage more people in India’s IT capital to use the Metro as a viable public transport over private vehicles, said officials of the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL).“The new technology in phase-II is that I can run a train even with a gap of three minutes. As and when the passengers increase, we can increase frequency,” BMRCL managing director Anjum Parvez told Hindustan Times. “BMRCL will start retrofitting gates in phase-I to make it compatible with the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC).”Parvez said signalling systems in phase-II will be different from those in phase-I, which will reduce time between two train services. “Even gates have to be compatible to NCMC and they would be changed as well to make the technology uniform across phases to allow seamless travel within the city.”Bengaluru has 56 kms of operational Metro tracks in a city that is over 800 square kms wide. Around 120-km tracks are in various stages of construction in the city, which has been a challenge for ordinary commuters to deal with amid traffic snarls.Bengaluru, which has a vehicular population of 9.4 million, was judged in 2019 to have the world’s worst traffic globally, according to TomTom, a Netherlands-based global provider of navigation, traffic and map products. The poor quality of roads, lack of viable public transport options and last-mile connectivity, delays in completion of the Metro, and now the fear of contracting the coronavirus in public spaces have forced more people to opt for private transport options, adding to the number of vehicles on the already congested roads of the city.BMRCL has also started using prestressed slabs in its construction to save time, Hindustan Times reported on August 26.Since the inauguration of the Metro line in Delhi in 2002, the entire country has a total of around 730 kms operational in 18 different cities and another 1,049 kms under various stages of construction, according to government data.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday announced to extend the Metro’s existing services to rural Bengaluru and other parts, which would in effect double the entire network to around 317 kms. He has instructed officials to draw up plans to increase the Metro’s network that extends to Ramanagara, Magadi and Rajanakunte, that are over 30-40 kms from the outskirts of the city.But almost every single stretch of the Metro has been delayed invariably. The latest, Nayandanahalli to Kengri on Mysuru road, that was inaugurated on August 29, was delayed by two months. According to BMRCL officials, there is a minimum 5% escalation in the cost of the Metro for every year the project is delayed.The chief minister has brought down the deadline for some of the existing lines under construction by a year from 2025 to 2024. By 2022, an additional 36 kms of Metro lines are scheduled to be completed, Bommai announced on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-metro-looks-to-cut-inter-train-interval-to-3min-on-phase-i-lines-101630435856820.html
01-09-2021||India||Over 300 booked for Covid violations during Owaisi rally||Over 300 people who attended a political rally of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Asaduddin Owaisi in support of two candidates contesting the municipal corporation elections on Monday, were booked for violating Covid-19 protocols, police said on Tuesday.The Market police in Belagavi city registered a case under the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act, apart from IPC sections based on a complaint by Sripad Kulkarni, who is a nodal officer for Covid-19.Three urban local bodies (ULB’s)--Hubbali-Dharwad, Belagavi and Kalaburagi--are heading to the polls on September 3. The counting will be held on September 6.All three major political parties--BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) and other local outfits are carrying out similar rallies across these districts. Heightened political campaigning in earlier bypolls in three constituencies—Basava Kalyan, Maski and Belagavi (Lok Sabha)--on April 17 had resulted in a sharp spike in Covid cases in these districts and contributed to the severity of the second wave of infections that lasted between March and July this year, Hindustan Times had reported. Then chief minister BS Yediyurappa had warned of strict action “after the election”, making it a convenient case for political parties to violate rules while continuing to hold citizens responsible for the rapid spread. In a bid to stop the spread, the state government has made it mandatory for all persons coming from neighbouring Kerala to undergo seven-day institutional quarantine. “Guidelines for Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Charamarajanagar are yet to be discussed. I will discuss this with CM regarding this. People entering border districts need be under surveillance to check the spread of infection,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said on Tuesday. He also added that the government will initiate action against a college in Kolar which has become a Covid hotspot after nearly 32 students have tested positive. “32 students are infected with Covid in a college in KGF. All of them are Kerala returnees. I will visit the college and take action against the college management. Covid has been brought under control to 700-800 cases per day from as high as 50,000 cases per day. (The) Government has worked hard to mitigate the pandemic,” Sudhakar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-300-booked-for-covid-violations-during-owaisi-rally-101630435855319.html
01-09-2021||India||Shock, grief as victims’ families come to terms with the tragedy||Most of them received the news of the tragic accident early Tuesday morning and since then the families of the seven deceased are in a state of shock. According to family members, they were not familiar with other occupants of the car. The deceased were identified as Karuna Sagar (28), DMK MLA Y Prakash’s son, his fiancé Bindhu(28) Ishita(21), Dhanusha(21) Akshay Goyal(23) Utsav( 22) and Rohit( 23). On Monday, Sagar had posted on his social media accounts about his arrival in Bengaluru in his Audi 3 series SUV that met with the tragic accident. Relatives and friends of Sagar said he had a craze for high-end cars and bikes. Sagar is a businessman and used to visit Bengaluru often. According to police, Sagar came to Bengaluru on Monday to purchase medicines at around 5.30 pm and even carried out some business in the city. The family had called him for dinner at 9.30pm but he informed them that he won’t be coming and went ahead with his friends. According to eyewitnesses, some occupants in the car were in their pyjamas. Based on this input, police suspect that the group had gone out for an unplanned joy ride at night when the accident took place at around 1.45 am. The MLA was in Chennai when he learnt about the accident and left for Hosur, in Krishnagiri district. His elder brother Chandrappa came to St John’s Hospital here to receive the body after the post-mortem. “A big tragedy has befallen us. I am not in a position to say anything,” he told reporters. Another victim of the accident, Bindhu was set to get married to Sagar, according to her father Chandrashekar. According to him, he didn’t know any occupants of the car, other than Sagar. “We knew that they were friends and they wanted to get married, but no official proposal was made so far. She had said she would only marry him, and we had agreed to it,” he said. He said that his daughter had called him around 8 pm on Monday. “She finished her masters in the UK and was working in Bengaluru. She spoke with me last night around 8 pm. It was a normal call, she asked me if I had dinner. She was working from home that night. She didn’t mention about going on a drive,” he said. Another occupant in the car, Rohit, had lost his parents 10 years ago and his uncle was taking care of him. Bharat Amrut, a cousin brother of the deceased, who had come to the police station said that they received information about the incident around 3 am. “Police called me this morning and asked me to come to the police station. They didn’t initially tell me he died. They told me that there was an accident and Rohit is under treatment. As we were on our way to Bengaluru (from Hubli), we were told that he had passed away. Our family members had spoken to him but there was no conversation that he was going on a drive,” he said. According to him, Rohit used to work in an online education platform and he had been living in Bengaluru for past one year. When asked if he knew other occupants in the car, the cousin said the family didn’t have any information about them. “We don’t know how he made contact with such highly influential people, like an MLA’s son,” he said.

01-09-2021||India||Fortified rice not enough to tackle malnutrition: Experts||India wants to fortify all rice with iron and vitamins distributed under various subsidised food-security schemes, but experts are divided on whether the move will solve the country’s notoriously longstanding malnutrition problem among women and children.The government currently runs a pilot programme to distribute nutrient-enriched rice, covering a period of three years beginning 2019-2020 with a budget of ₹174.6 crore.On August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his Independence Day speech, announced a major expansion of the programme. “Will give rice fortified with nutrients to the poor. Be it the rice available at the ration shop, the rice provided to the children in the mid-day meal, or the rice available through every scheme, all of it shall be fortified by 2024,” Modi had said.India ranks 94th among 107 nations on the Global Hunger Index, which classifies the country as having a “serious” level of hunger. According to the 2016 National Family Health Survey-4, which provides the latest data on health and nutrition, 38.4% of children in the country were stunted (low height for age) and 21% were wasted (low weight for height).The survey showed that the prevalence of anaemia among Indian women had seen only a small decline from 55% in 2005-06 to 53% in 2015-16.The government’s rice fortification push is important given that targets under the National Nutrition Mission are yet to be achieved. Since its launch, the mission aims to reduce stunting and wasting by 6% by 2022 (2% per year) among children, and anaemia by 9% (3% per year) among children, teenage girls and pregnant women.“An emphasis on fortification alone may do little to improve anaemia because from a nutrition point of view, absorption of iron depends on the availability of other nutrients that can come only from a diversified diet,” said Veena Shatrugna, former deputy director at the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad.Officials, however, say the government’s pilot programmes have shown promising results. In Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli, rice fortified with iron had shown a reduction in anaemia prevalence by 10% and improved average cognitive scores by 11.3 points, official provisional data reviewed by HT showed.A meta-analysis by World Health Organization showed rice fortified with vitamins and minerals, including iron, reduces the risk of iron deficiency by 35% (16 studies having 14,267 participants).According to Arun Kumar, a nutritionist and a medical doctor who works on health ethics and conflict of interest, the government ought to take into account the latest recommended dietary intake of various micronutrients, which have lowered the daily intake quantity of nutrients, such as iron. “This means a simple diverse diet is still the best option.”Locally prepared, hot cooked meals are still the preferred option to boost the nutrition status of malnourished children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fortified-rice-not-enough-to-tackle-malnutrition-experts-101630435553850.html

01-09-2021||Editorials||GDP numbers tell a story||The 20.1% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for the first quarter of the fiscal year is lower than what was expected, not just by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which pegged it at 21.3%, but also private forecasters. A Bloomberg poll of economists put this number at 21%. To be sure, the number may have been higher if the second wave of Covid-19 had not disrupted the sequential recovery which was underway. GDP growth in the March quarter was 1.6%. The latest numbers increase the likelihood of 2021-22 GDP growth missing the RBI projection of 9.5%. The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in its August resolution upwardly revised the June quarter numbers and reduced its growth projections for the remaining three quarters of the fiscal year. There are four key takeaways from these figures.
