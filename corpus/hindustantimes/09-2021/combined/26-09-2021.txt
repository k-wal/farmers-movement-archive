26-09-2021||Noida||Noida police bust fake job racket, arrest five||The Noida police arrested five men from Sector 3 on Saturday for their alleged involvement in a fake job racket, as part of which they cheated nearly 500 job seekers by fetching their data from a private company and taking money from them on the pretext of facilitating their application process. Police are on the lookout for the mastermind of the racket, who are on the run. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said police received information that some people were operating a fake job racket from a fictitious call centre in Noida’s Sector 3. “The Sector 20 police conducted a raid on Saturday and arrested five people from the spot,” he said. The suspects were identified as Vishal, 30, Vijay Singh, 26, and Mohit Sharma, 24, from Ghaziabad, and Sajid Khan, 26, from Meerut and Akshay, 25, from Baghpat. During interrogation, Singh said, the suspects revealed that they used to procure the job applicants’ data from a job portal. “The suspects used to call people and extracted money on the pretext of registration, processing files, offer letter, etc. They charged ₹1,900 for registration and ₹4,500 for processing application of each candidate. They have cheated nearly 500 people in the last one year from different states. However, they did not provide any job to the applicants,” he said. Police recovered 13 computers, two laptops, two mobile phones, 17 walkie-talkie, 17 SIM cards, one POS machine, and seven debit cards from their possession. Sub-inspector Ranjeet Singh filed a complaint in this regard after the arrests were made.

26-09-2021||Noida||Residents of Noida housing complex protest against developer||Noida: Residents of Civitech Stadia housing complex in Sector 79 on Sunday protested against the developer for failing to provide basic facilities such as proper lifts, well-planned parking space, and fire safety measures, among others. They also complained that the developer has not even been able to execute the registry of their flats for a long time now.Civitech Stadia -- comprising around 520 units, out of which 300 are occupied -- is developed on five acres. The project is developed under the Noida authority’s ‘Sports City Scheme’ that was supposed to have adequate sports services.“We shifted to this housing complex two years ago, thinking we would lead a peaceful life here. But the developer is not providing us the promised services. Lifts do not work properly, exit gate remains closed, parking space is improperly allotted, flats have not been registered, and the developer is not even returning ₹52,000 -- advance payment for electricity connection,” said Deepak Garg, president of Civitech Stadia residents’ association.Buyers said they want to obtain individual electricity connections under a new policy. Earlier, developers used to take connections for all the flats together.“The developer has sold parking on the surface, where it cannot be allowed, as it blocks the way of fire tender. And if we try to communicate these issues, the staff misbehaves with us. We do not understand why the developer is not refunding the ₹52,000 we had paid for the electricity connection,” Rishabh Gupta, joint secretary of Civitech Stadia residents’ association.Meanwhile, Subodh Goel, managing director of Civitech Developers Private Limited, said the protest is completely unjustified. “Two years ago, people moved into their flats and paid ₹52,000 for the electricity connection. We have been providing them all the services properly, including electricity. Now, they want to obtain individual connections and want a refund. We are paying ₹12,000 out of the total ₹52,000 because the remaining ₹40,000 for the power load will be adjusted. How can we refund ₹40,000 that we paid to the government? All other issues are baseless because the lifts work properly, there are no parking issues, and our residential society has excellent common facilities... Registry of flats has been halted as the Noida authority has banned it, so it is not our fault,” said Goel.Avinash Tripathi, Noida authority officer on special duty in-charge of the group housing, said, “We will look into the matter and take appropriate action if the homebuyers approach us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-of-noida-housing-complex-protest-against-developer-101632679900604.html
26-09-2021||Delhi||North Delhi corporation puts ‘cell towers on wheels’ plan on hold after opposition from residents||With complaints pouring in from residents and municipal councillors about the cellular towers on wheels, the remunerative projects cell of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation issued directions to all deputy commissioners on September 20 to put on hold installation of any new cellular tower in its jurisdiction till a review is undertaken. The order issued by the section officer of remunerative projects cell highlights that most of these complaints state that the sites for installation of ‘cell on wheels’ are located in the middle of colony or on a very small municipal park and many of the proposed sites are in close proximity of residential areas. “All sites of CoW will be reviewed by the concerned zonal deputy commissioner in consultation with RWAs and public representatives,” said the order. The zonal officers have also been asked to submit a detailed report after the review exercise, proposing alternate locations preferably within 500m from the allocated site.Yogesh Verma, chairman of Keshavpuram zone and former leader of the house in the north corporation said that over 200 cells on wheels have been installed after the new mobile tower policy was introduced last year. “We can understand that there is no scientific evidence to prove that these towers impact the health of people living around them but we cant be rigid about public sentiment. All such new installations have been stopped now and review will be carried out to find nearby locations, which are away for human settlement,” he said. Verma added that mobile connectivity is also necessary and a mid-way solution needs to be found. Last year, the Cellular Operator Association of India stated that Delhi would require additional 14,000 towers by 2024 to resolve connectivity issues.The issue of growing resistance to cells on wheels is not just restricted to north Delhi. Last month, more than 56 resident welfare associations (RWAs) in south Delhi also petitioned the south corporation on problems regarding the new mobile cellular towers while demanding a more consultative process to fix the locations. According to experts, there is no conclusive scientific evidence to prove that the electromagnetic radiation from cellular mobile towers causes health hazards.Ruby Makhija, secretary of Navjiwan Resident Welfare Association, one of the petitioners said, “We are aware of the studies that state mobile towers are safe but a large number of residents are concerned about the possible impact of mobile tower radiations. There should be sustained effort to raise awareness and consultative process should be undertaken to find a suitable location,” she said. Makhija added that they have been resisting the installation of cell on wheels tower since August 23. “120 residents signed against the installation while only 2-3 residents were in favour. SDMC guidelines state that NOC is required from RWAs in DDA flats and group housing societies, then why are we being discriminated?,” she asked.Bhavreen Kandhari from Defence Colony said residents have submitted a petition in the court against the installation of cell on wheels tower in the central park in Defence Colony. “The installation was stopped and the erected structure has remained on the park premises. Parks should be left alone as these spaces are used by children and elderly. We are aware about the studies but do not want to take any chances,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-delhi-corporation-puts-cell-towers-on-wheels-plan-on-hold-after-opposition-from-residents-101632679551529.html

The community leaders have maintained that king Mihir Bhoj was a Gurjar.Shyam Singh Bhati, GB Nagar president of Akhil Bharatiya Veer Gurjar Mahasabha, who organised the mahapanchayat, said that some people deliberately removed the word ‘Gurjar’ from the plaque of the statue. “The Gurjar community’s sentiment was hurt, and we called a meeting on Sunday over the issue,” he said. Bhati said that the community leaders have given one week for the administration to add the word ‘Gurjar’ to the plaque, or they will intensify their protest in different parts of the state. He also said that about 2,000 people from Delhi, Gurugram, and other NCR cities participated in the event at Chithera village.Pramendra Singh Bhati, another Gurjar leader, said that the plaque should be replaced with a new one having ‘Gurjar’ written on it as soon as possible. “If they do not replace the plaque, we will continue our protest,” he said.

Some people were also detained from Chithera village,” he said. Police on Tuesday arrested two persons for allegedly damaging posters with photos of king Mihir Bhoj, CM Adityanath, Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar, among others in Dadri.

Both assailants were gunned down by the police in retaliatory firing. The police suspect that the shoot-out is the culmination of one of the most notorious rivalries between two gangs of Delhi --- Gogi and Tillu Tajpuriya gangs.

As Tajpuriya’s cousin was also contesting the elections, he and his associates allegedly assaulted a candidate whom Gogi and his associates supported. The candidate withdrew his name from the elections and Gogi held Tajpuriya responsible for it. It was beginning of the decade-long rivalry between Gogi and Tajpuriya that has resulted in bloodbaths on Delhi’s streets and killings of nearly two dozen people from both the sides.

A committee has been constituted to probe the matter and submit its report within 15 days. The suspension order was passed on Saturday by the office of the Basic Shiksha Adhikari in Agra. The assistant teachers Rashmi Sisodia, Jivika Kumari, Anjali Yadav, Suman Kumari and Sudha Rani were seen dancing in the classroom of the school in the video, said to have been recorded on March 21 this year. “The songs to which the teachers were seen dancing were not educative. By dancing in class, the teachers violated the Teachers’ Service Rules and tarnished the image of the education department, besides causing anger among villagers,” said Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) Brajraj Singh in his suspension order. An explanation was also sought from the principal of the primary school, Dinesh Chand Parihar and the teachers named. Parihar said in his reply that the video was recorded on March 17 and he had no prior information of any such dance performance by teachers in school. Besides, he had gone for an academic meeting that day. “Four of the teachers, except Jivika Kumari, filed their reply stating that ‘Bal Sabha’ and online classes were organized for the children on March 17. These teachers also apologized for their behaviour. The block education officer in his report mentioned that explanation by these five teachers was not found satisfactory and recommended action against them,” said BSA Agra in his suspension order. The teachers were blamed for improper behaviour as they danced to film songs which were not educative. They were also accused of attempt to tarnish the image of teachers and the department, violation of Government Employees’ Regulations 1978 and Right to Education Act, not obeying instructions from higher authorities and negligence in conduct. “In the light of the report by the block education officer, it was found befitting to suspend these five teachers and get the matter probed. As such, a three-member committee has been constituted which would provide charge-sheet to all five teachers in three days and conduct probe and submit report in 15 days,” said BSA Agra Brajraj Singh in his order passed on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-teachers-suspended-for-dancing-in-class-101632678880515.html

But our vision was clear from the get-go. Srijan was not solely about making paper paintings available for sale and generating income for artisans. It was also about the need to innovate and strike a chord with modern customers,” she said.The official said all products were priced between ₹3,000 and ₹10,000 for a larger reach: “While Jaypore is giving artisans access to the domestic market, Amazon caters to the niche and foreign markets.”“Each painting’s USP is the use of natural mineral paints. All online listings include detailed description of the product to acquaint customers with Himachal’s rich legacy,” said Sehajpal, adding that with the festive corner around the corner, the product offerings will be increased and pine-needle products will also be introduced soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/project-srijan-takes-traditional-kangra-art-online-for-wider-reach-101632677980926.html

26-09-2021||Gurugram||Pedestrian safety: Committee to analyse five points with most fatalities||Following discussions about pedestrian safety at a road safety meeting earlier this month, the district administration constituted a four-member committee to survey five key crossings on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and suggest measures to resolve pedestrian issues.Officials said that the committee will focus on Shankar Chowk, Iffco Chowk, Signature Towers, Rajiv Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk, where 80-85% of the on-road fatalities are pedestrians, due to an array of reasons ranging from lack of pedestrian amenities to long detours to access pedestrian bridges.“Our first priority is to safeguard citizens. It was observed that at all these five points, footfall is among the highest in the city. However, they also have a high number of road accidents and fatalities involving pedestrians. Hence, a committee has been formed to first identify the issues pertaining to each of the points, and accordingly, come up with solutions for implementation,” Dr Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said.In addition, the committee also has the responsibility to align each of the crossings in such a manner that all road users, including motorists, those using non-motorised transport, cyclists and pedestrians, have equitable distribution of the right of way (ROW) at these five points.The committee comprises officials from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Gurugram traffic police, Raahgiri Foundation and Regional Transport Authority (RTA).The five points, all located on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, are among the 21 black spots in the city where the highest number of road fatalities have been reported. Any 500-metre stretch of road where more than five road fatalities are recorded in a three-year period is termed a black spot.The issue of pedestrian safety at the five points was raised in a district road safety meeting held earlier this month, following which the committee has been formed.“The committee has carried out a preliminary on-ground survey at the five points. From the initial survey, we all have discovered that the subways at each of the five points have virtually no takers. In addition, the foot overbridges (FOBs) are located at far-off distances and not properly placed,” Sarika Panda Bhatt, the co-founder of Raahgiri Foundation and one of the committee members, said.With regard to the FOBs, Bhatt said that instead of providing a path to cross from one end of the highway to the other, it is primarily helping pedestrians reach an adjoining arterial road. In addition, due to poor placement, it takes pedestrians nearly three times the distance and time to cross the road using the FOB, due to which these structures have few or no takers.Bhatt said that almost 80-85% of road fatalities at these five points are pedestrians.“The pedestrian amenities at each of the five points are not making any difference. Instead, the committee is likely to recommend the installation of traffic signals below the overhead flyover at each of the junctions as a solution. The committee will be carrying out more on-ground surveys before submitting a final report to the administration for perusal,” Bhatt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/pedestrian-safety-committee-to-analyse-five-points-with-most-fatalities-101632677080158.html

Police sources told news agency PTI that since most organisations have only extended moral support to the bandh it is unlikely to impact normal life in the state or in the capital.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai appealed to farmers to allow financial activities to be conducted since the country is still recovering from the financial losses brought by the Covid-19 pandemic. "All sectors are recovering from Covid, financial activities are taking place, farmers are also participating in it....I appeal to farmers organisations to allow businesses and activities to function," Bommai urged.Public transport employees’ unions, hotel owners association, lorry, auto rickshaw, and taxi owners unions said they support the protest, but will continue to operate on Monday, citing losses incurred during the pandemic.

While state government said Maoist activities in three affected districts were under control, it has reportedly expressed concerns over the spread of the activities in key cities of the state. Thackeray, along with the chief ministers, home ministers from few other states, participated in the review meeting convened by the Ministry of Home Affairs and chaired by its minister Amit Shah in Delhi on Sunday. Launched in 2015, the National Policy and Action Plan on LWE, the central government has focused on the development of Maoism-infested districts. Three Maharashtra districts — Gadchiroli, Chandrapur and Gondia — were identified as the LWE-affected districts with more development funds provided for them under the national policy. During the meeting, the CM has reportedly said that Maoist activities in three districts have subsided significantly over the past few years. Expressing satisfaction over the funding from the Centre, Maharashtra CM reportedly urged the Centre for more funds for the infrastructure related to the police stations, communication network and road construction. “The naxal activities in these districts have come down significantly. Infrastructure network in these districts have been strengthened over the past few years and it has helped the infested areas to come to the mainstream. Facilities like single-window services have been provided to the villagers in these districts. Many such government schemes are made available at police stations. The state has demanded for more funds for development of schools, installing more police posts and ensuring better communication network for these districts. The poor connectivity of internet services in remote places of these districts not only hamper the communication by the police forces, but also prove hurdle some for students. The state has raised demand for improvement on this front,” said an official from the home department. The CM has reportedly expressed concerns over the movement spreading its wings in some of the cities in the state. “The home department has information about sporadic activities in some parts of the leading cities of the state. There could be attempts to make the tribal areas as their experiment hubs for the activities. The uncertainty, poverty and unemployment could be used for spreading the base. The state government wants the Centre to focus to neutralise such attempts,” said the official.According to the statement issued by the Central government, the Union home minister said it is very important to neutralise the sources of income of the left-wing extremists. The agencies of the Central and state governments should try to stop this by making a system together. He urged all the chief ministers to give priority to the problem of LWE for the next one year, so that a permanent solution can be found in this problem. He said that it requires building pressure, increasing speed and better coordination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-pushes-for-more-funds-to-tackle-naxal-hit-areas-in-maharashtra-101632674259695.html

First, we will check the response of parents for sending their wards to school. The final decision regarding resumption of pre-primary classes will be taken after Durga Puja vacation.”“We are conducting first term exam for pre-primary students through online mode, which will continue till September 30”, she added. Other prominent schools, including Carmel High School, Loyola High School, St Xavier’s High School and St Michael’s High School are also considering resumption of pre-primary classes in mid-October.Meanwhile, the rise in viral fever and flu symptoms among children in early September has worried many parents who now are apprehensive about sending their wards to schools.Poonam Sinha, the mother of a five-year-old, said, “It’s not safe to send young children outside. Covid-19 cases have declined but there is a sudden rise in viral fever and dengue cases. I don’t want to put my son at risk. I will not send him to school till the situation normalises.”Pre-primary schools in the state are facing closure since March last year.Several playschools closed during the pandemicThe prolonged closure of schools led to the shut down of thousands of playschools in the city owing to the financial crisis. Ridhima Sharma, a playschool operator near Bailey Road, decided to shut down her playschool in April this year.“Bearing operating costs, including building rent and teachers’ salaries, became next to impossible due to prolonged closure of the school. The majority of parents withdrew their wards and they stopped paying fees for online classes.

26-09-2021||Lucknow||Yogi ministry expansion: New picks reflect BJP focus on OBCs, Dalits||The seven new ministers inducted into the Yogi Adityanath government reflect the Bharatiya Janata Party’s focus on picking educated, mostly young leaders, from non-Yadav Other Backward Castes (OBCs) and non-Jatav Dalits as ministers who have got a people-connect, BJP leaders admitted. Most of the new ministers in the Yogi government are below 55, with at least two of them being under 45 years. Each of the new faces would have their task cut out, a senior BJP leader said, adding, that with around 90 days left for the Yogi government to undertake major policy decisions, these new ministers would have to hit the ground running. The BJP is still mulling whether something on the lines of the “ashirward yatra”, which was undertaken by those leaders who found a place in the Narendra Modi government in July, should be launched. Party leaders admitted that the new ministers would surely undertake “community-connect” initiative, though its form is yet to be decided. While Jitin Prasada is all set to be nominated to one of the four MLC posts, the rest of the six ministers are already lawmakers, helping the party select three OBCs and Dalits for MLC posts. BJP leaders said the party has also decided to nominate members of Gurjar, Bhurji and Nishad communities as MLCs. Apart from Jitin Prasada, the party has also named Virendra Singh Gurjar (Shamli), Sanjay Nishad (Gorakhpur) and Gopal Anjan Bhurji (Moradabad) as its MLC picks, thus ending a long-delayed suspense on the subject. “This would mean that along with seven ministers, these MLCs would help our caste outreach further. Only Jitin ji is minister and would be nominated as MLC too. The rest of the six ministers and three remaining MLC positions are all filled up by different subcastes of OBCs and Dalits,” a BJP leader said. “This is the first time, a member of Bhurji caste has been made an MLC,” BJP leaders said. “We would readily undertake whatever task the party assigns to us,” said Dharamvir Prajapati, the new minister of state and OBC leader, who was made BJP MLC in January. His appointment showcases the BJP focus on Dalit-dominated Agra belt from where the party has six lawmakers, two MPs, and a mayor. In July, the BJP’s Agra Lok Sabha MP SP Singh Baghel was appointed as a Union minister of state in the Narendra Modi government. The BJP’s focus on riverine communities comprising boatmen and fishermen, who are also being wooed by the opposition Samajwadi Party, was apparent in the appointment of Sangeeta Balwant Bind, 41, a postgraduate woman politician from the community. “None has done as much for the marginalised class as BJP and we would definitely strengthen this outreach initiative,” she said soon after being sworn in as a minister of state. The BJP has also nominated Nishad party leader Sanjay Nishad as MLC, party leaders said. PROFILES OF NEW MINISTERS Jitin Prasada, 47, Cabinet minister Once referred to as the “young turk” and a key component of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s team, Jitin Prasada, has been made a cabinet minister, less than five months after he defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party. The BJP in UP has its own homegrown Brahmin leadership like Union minister Mahendra Nath Pandey, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma and the state’s cabinet ministers Shrikant Sharma. There are others, too, like UP ministers Ram Naresh Agnihotri, Satish Chandra Dwivedi, Neelkanth Tiwari, Chandrika Prasad Upadhyaya and Anand Swaroop Shukla. But, the BJP has consistently been getting influential community leaders from other parties. These include UP’s law minister Brajesh Pathak, who was previously a prominent Brahmin face of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), former Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi, now BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from Prayagraj. The entry of Prasada in BJP, who had floated an organization to highlight the perceived injustice against Brahmins in the Yogi Adityanath government, was seen as RSS-BJP’s attempt to wean away a young, Brahmin leader from the Congress and also to symbolically indicate that the party treated the leaders of the community well, party leaders said. Sanjay Gond, 46, Minister of State (MoS) The BJP’s only scheduled tribe (ST) MLA in Uttar Pradesh represents the Obra assembly constituency from Sonbhadra district, where he is quite popular due to his simplicity. The Gonds are present in a sizeable number in the backward eastern UP areas of Mirzapur, Chandauli and Sobhadra. By his appointment, the Yogi Adityanath government appears to have taken a leaf out of the Samajwadi Party template, which had also appointed a member of Gond community as minister. Back then, Vijay Singh Gond had been made a minister. Sanjay Gond was elected on the BJP ticket after defeating Vijay Singh Gond’s son Virendra. In 2017 two assembly seats were reserved for the scheduled tribes and both assembly seats are in Sonbhadra. Sanjay’s wife was recently elected block pramukh. Paltu Ram, 51, MoS This first-time Dalit lawmaker represents the Balrampur (reserved) assembly constituency in UP. Resident of Gonda in eastern UP, Palturam belongs to the Khatik subcaste of Dalits. In the 2017 UP assembly elections, he defeated the Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance candidate by a margin of over 25,000 votes. A postgraduate who rose from student politics, Paltu Ram is known for his oratory and simplicity. Dalits are a key component of the RSS-BJP plan for the 2017 UP polls. Chatrapal Gangwar, 65, MoS An OBC leader, former RSS pracharak Chatrapal Gangwar, who retired as a school principal, became a lawmaker in 2017 after defeating the BSP candidate in the Bahedi assembly segment of Bareilly Lok Sabha seat. Representing the Kurmi sub-caste of OBCs, his induction is being seen as the party’s attempt to strike a balance after another prominent Kurmi leader Santosh Gangwar, the Lok Sabha MP from Bareilly, resigned as Union minister recently. Dharamvir Prajapati, 54, MoS This BJP MLC from Agra, originally hails from Hathras in western UP started his career as a RSS swayamsevak (wholetimer). The chairman of Mati Kala Board, set up by the government to boost artisans, he was made MLC in January. Soft spoken, this BJP leader has previously been BJP’s OBC cell general secretary and has twice served as secretary in the UP BJP set-up. His appointment showcases the party’s focus on the Dalit-dominated Agra belt. During previous Deepotsav celebrations, Prajapati had been quite active getting clay artisans from across the state to make earthen lamps to be lit in Ayodhya on Diwali. His connect with artisans has made him quite popular. Sangeeta Balwant Bind, 41, MoS The postgraduate politician is the daughter of a retired postman and belongs to the riverine (Nishad) OBC community. “A BJP lawmaker from Ghazipur, Bind’s selection showcases the party’s desire to promote young and educated faces from the marginalized community,” a BJP leader explained. She entered politics via student politics as well as after a stint in rural panchayat polls. Wife of a homeopathic doctor, she is a first-time lawmaker who has been made minister. Dinesh Khatik, 44, MoS This first-time BJP lawmaker who won against Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) from the Hastinapur assembly constituency of Meerut is an old RSS hand who has been associated with the BJP since long. His father also was with the RSS while his brother has been a member of zila panchayat. Apart from politics, Dinesh also manages a brick kiln and lives in Meerut’s Ganganagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-ministry-expansion-new-picks-reflect-bjp-focus-on-obcs-dalits-101632673480477.html

State finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who represents Bathinda Urban, has retained his ministerial berth. Joining Manpreet is two-time Congress MLA from Gidderbaha Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, 43. A political bête noire of Manpreet, the outspoken legislator had carved his niche in state politics after winning from Gidderbaha, considered to be a bastion of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), in 2012.Gurpreet Singh Kangar and Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, who represented Rampura Phul (Bathinda) and Guru Har Sahai (Ferozepur), have been dropped as ministers. Both were considered close to former CM Captain Amarinder Singh; Kangar was revenue minister, while Sodhi was handling sports and youth affairs and NRI affairs portfolios.GIDDERBAHA BACKDROPSAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal had won from Gidderbaha five times in a row from 1969 to 1985; later too, the segment continued to be in favour of the Akalis. In 2012, however, a greenhorn Warring had defeated Manpreet, then a Punjab People’s Party (PPP), now defunct, candidate. Manpreet had contested from Gidderbaha for the fifth consecutive time. After this victory, Warring won again from Gidderbaha in 2017. After the last assembly elections, however, Warring had been sulking as Manpreet, a new entrant to the Congress fold was inducted as a cabinet minister, while his claim was ignored. Over the past few months, Warring has accused Manpreet of corruption. Manpreet, however, has not responded to the accusations. The Gidderbaha MLA has never retracted his allegations.On June 27, Warring joined the Akalis in opposing and taking potshots at Manpreet and his aide’s alleged support to illegal mining in Bathinda. He had tagged the then CM Amarinder Singh and sought action against all those involved. “These are the people who are pulling Congress down,” he had tweeted. On July 12, Gidderbaha MLA had demanded disciplinary action against Manpreet for favouring Akali leaders over the Congressmen. Warring had tagged former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Twitter, urging him to take note of Manpreet’s alleged anti-party activities, and seeking his removal from the state cabinet. He had also accused Manpreet of interfering in Gidderbaha to weaken him. Warring came to the notice of Rahul’s close aides during the former’s campaigning in 2009 Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh. He also led the Indian National Youth Congress from 2014 to 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fms-b-te-noire-warring-is-minister-south-punjab-share-drops-to-two-101632672519738.html
26-09-2021||Patna||Will Kanhaiya Kumar’s entry to Congress herald new start for party in Bihar?||Will former JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar be able to transform the image of the Congress party in Bihar? Will he be able to carve a niche for himself in the highly polarised caste-based politics? Or, he will find it hard to get the opportunity to grow in the face of opposition from within the party? This type of debate dominated the discussion at the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) office on Sunday, a day after Independent Gujarat legislator and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani broke the news of joining the Congress along with Kanhaiya Kumar on October 28 in New Delhi. Although the former JNUSU leader Kanhaiya, who unsuccessfully contested Begusarai Lok Sabha election as a CPI candidate and lost it to the BJP stalwart and Union minister Giriraj Singh, refused to make any categorical statement, many Congress leaders said that his joining would give another chance for the party to revive its lost glory. Former BPCC chief Anil Sharma, who was also a former Patna University Students’ Union chief, said the party would benefit from Kanhaiya’s joining. “Kanhaiya Kumar has been into the leadership role and cornering the government on the issues of mass interest in a powerful way. His presence would be able to unite the anti-government clamours and add strength to the fight against the fear of India slipping into dictatorship mode,” added Sharma. Former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, DM Diwakar, however, was sceptical if Kanhaiya or the Congress would anyway be beneficial to each other. “Credibility of the former JNUSU leader would go away once he leaves the CPI, which gave him enough freedom and tremendous opportunity to grow. In Congress, he would not be able to do much as ‘paper tigers’ in the party would not allow him to grow and Rahul Gandhi or the party high command would have little time to listen to him. The Congress still has many potential leaders but they are left to perish under the new kind of a setup where the party in-charge calls the shot,” argued Diwakar. However, former head of the economics department at Patna University, Nawal Kishore Chaudhary says the Congress would be a major gainer on Kanhaiya’s joining. “He is one of the most articulate leaders with a clear vision. He would easily fit into the Congress’s political ideology which is left of the centre. Kanhaiya would have a bigger role to play in the state as well as national politics as the Congress has a pan-India presence,” said Chaudhary, adding that the Congress can bank on Kanhaiya as its youth face in the wake of the rise of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Chirag Paswan in the state politics. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), which has not been keen on the rise of Kanhaiya Kumar in the state politics, however, did not foresee any substantial gain in electoral politics for the Congress. “He (Kanhaiya) is not any factor in a caste-based politics. Allies of the RJD mostly depend on the charisma of Lalu Prasad and Tejashwi Prasad Yadav to win the elections,” said Maner MLA and chief RJD spokesman Bhai Birendra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/will-kanhaiya-kumar-s-entry-to-congress-herald-new-start-for-party-in-bihar-101632672402107.html

If these issues are not addressed then the PMC would likely have to push its admission schedule to next year. One of the key errors pointed out by the NMC team is the shortage of manpower. At present, 48 professors have been appointed. Ravindra Bhinwade, additional municipal commissioner confirmed that this is one of the conditions put forward by the NMC and that the PMC is working on recruiting more teaching and non-teaching staff as per the NMC’s guidelines The appointment of non-teaching staff is also in the final stages. For this, the municipal administration issued an advertisement on Friday. The admission process for medical colleges in the country is conducted through the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET). The first phase of ‘NEET’ has been completed this year and so the PMC would be able to admit students only though the second phase, if the issues raised by the NMC are addressed. The proposed medical college, the first to be built and run by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), had started preparations to admit 100 students by December this year. The admission process will start after the PMC gets formal approval from the Union ministry of Health and Family Welfare. However, before that, the National Medical Commission has sent a letter to the corporation stating that the issues need to be addressed. The NMC team arrived in Pune last week and after meeting PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar had laid out the conditions required to start the college. The team had inspected the proposed site of the college, the building on Sanas ground and also the relevant documents. After their visit they presented a detailed report to the central ministry which points out some of the issues on hand that need to be seen to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/national-medical-commission-raises-staffing-issue-at-pmc-s-atal-bihari-vajpayee-medical-college-101632671981342.html

The Palmetum, which took over three years to develop, has over 110 species of palms. Prof Lalit Tiwari, a professor of Botany from Kumaon University dedicated the Palmetum to the people in Haldwani. Sanjiv Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests (CCF) and in charge of the state forest research wing said the main aim of the establishment of Palmetum is to promote conservation, further research and to create awareness about the importance and ecological role of various palm species. “The project which has been established in an area of approximately 3 acres, was developed over the last three years under CAMPA scheme at a cost of ₹16 lakh”, he said Elaborating on the details of palm species that have been grown in the Palmetum, Chaturvedi said around 4 species are critically endangered, 2 species are endangered, 2 species are vulnerable and 6 species are near threatened as per IUCN categorization, while one is threatened as per the Uttarakhand Biodiversity Board and one is rare as per the Indian Biodiversity Portal. “One palm species is endemic to Uttarakhand. It is called Trachycarpus Takil (Takil Palm) and is the only Palm that can survive sub-zero temperature and has also been declared as a threatened species by the Uttarakhand Biodiversity Board; other endangered/threatened species include Beaucarnea recurvata (Ponytail Palm), Hyophorbe lagenicaulis (Bottle Palm), Dypsis leptocheilos (Redneck palm) , Hyophorbe verschaffeltii (Spindle Palm) and so on,” he said. Chaturvedi said Palm species have diverse uses and play a significant role in many cultures across the world. “Apart from coconuts, many important items come from Palm species; dates, betel nuts, palm oil, acai fruit, Palm wine and so on. In August, the Uttarakhand Forest department had dedicated the High Altitude Herbal Garden situated at nearly 10,500 feet height and believed to be the highest herbal garden in India, to the people. The garden spread over three acres has rare Himalayan herbs including Brahma Kamal, Neel Kamal and Phen Kamal, associated with the trinity of Hindu Gods- Bhahma, Shiva and Vishnu. On September 12 this year, the Forest Department’s research wing also dedicated country’s largest open-air fernery, housing around 120 species of ferns to the public.

26-09-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan ranks 3rd in women unemployment after Haryana and J&K||Not only is Rajasthan leading in crime against women but is also performing poorly in women employment. According to the recent report of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy May-August 2021, Rajasthan ranks third in the country, following Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, in unemployment for women. The national average of women unemployment is 14.28%. India’s average unemployment rate is 8.57%, with 7.9% for men and 14.3% for females, as per the CMIE report. The 17th volume of Unemployment in India, A Statistical Profile by CMIE has estimates generated using data collected during household visits between 1 May 2021 and 31 August 2021. According to the CMIE report, the women unemployment rate in Rajasthan is 65.31%, which is the highest after Haryana (78.97%) and Jammu and Kashmir (72.60%). The male unemployment rate is 21.20%, which is second highest after Haryana with 25.27%. Urban women are more unemployed than women residing in rural areas. The urban unemployment rate of women is 92.1%, and that of rural is 54.8%. The report states that Rajasthan is the most unemployed state after Haryana in terms of overall unemployment. According to the report, the unemployment rate of Haryana is 35.7% while that of Rajasthan is 26.7%. Rajasthan and Haryana are the only states to cross the 20% mark in terms of unemployment. The report tells that 55.75% of the graduates and youths with higher education degrees are unemployed in Rajasthan. On the contrary, this figure stands at an average of 20.21% nationally. The state also has the highest unemployment rate for the uneducated when compared with the neighbouring states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. A total of 28.06% of illiterate youths have no job. Former chairperson of Rajasthan women’s commission, Lad Kumari Jain, said, lack of literacy, higher education facilities and socio-economic and culture setup is the basic hindrance to women development and growth. In rural areas, MNREGA, Aanganbadi, and other welfare schemes are giving employment to women but in urban areas, there are very few job opportunities. “More than 50% of the sanctioned posts reserved for women are lying vacant. The women aren’t still given priority,’ she said. Commenting on the report Paras Banjara, a social activist who is associated with Suchna Aur Rojgar Adhikar Abhiyan, said “Post Covid there is a boom in unemployment and the government has failed to address the issue.

The Patiala Rural MLA is also local bodies minister in the new chief minister (CM) Charanjit Singh Channi’s cabinet. In former CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s cabinet, Mohindra was number two, but in Patiala, power was concentrated only in the New Moti Bagh Palace, the Capt’s residence, from where his wife, Member of Parliament Preneet Kaur, called the shots. From development works, fund allocation, and postings and transfers in Patiala, Preneet managed everything, with assistance from the former CM’s Officer on Special Duty (OSD) Amarpartap Singh Honey Sekhon. Bureaucrats had also been directed to honour Preneet’s writ. Such sweeping powers did irk some Congress MLAs in the region who even went to the extent of revolting and holding a press conference, accusing the ‘OSDs’ of interference in their domain. In spite of all this, power was not shared with the MLAs or anybody else; the New Moti Bagh Palace retained its hold on power. This has been on since 2002, with Mohindra also kept out of the loop. In fact, Mohindra was also forced to shift his constituency from Patiala to Samana in 2002, with former cabinet minister Lal Singh emerging as the new ‘Man Friday’ for Amarinder. Things turned around in the relationship between Amarinder and Mohindra in 2015, after Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa intervened and got the two senior leaders to be friends. Before this, the two were foes, and publicly so.More recently, though Mohindra was seen as next to CM Amarinder in the state government hierarchy, he still did not have the freedom to take decisions relating to Patiala, even for departments under him. Today, Mohindra is the only cabinet minister from Patiala, thus the bureaucracy has to listen to him. His position as the new power centre has been further strengthened by both Amarinder and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, the Nabha MLA, losing their hold on power. “The message is loud and clear that Mohindra is the only power centre in Patiala. It has been conveyed to the bureaucracy in no uncertain terms. Protocol also dictates that officers are bound to follow the directions of cabinet ministers. Officials has been told to do work of MLAs in their respective areas without any outside interference,” said an official. A Congress worker said, “This is same position which Mohindra held before the entry of Amarinder into the Congress in 1998. He has regained power in Patiala after 25 years.” Mohindra has thanked the Congress high command, adding that his doors were open and he welcomed all Congress workers and the public to approach him for development and welfare works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/brahm-mohindra-emerges-as-only-power-centre-in-royal-city-101632669459791.html
26-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court commutes life sentence of husband as he did not intend to kill wife||The Bombay high court (HC) recently commuted the life imprisonment sentence of a man, who was convicted for murdering his wife, to eight years after it was informed that the man had not intended to kill his wife when he assaulted her with a pestle. The HC, while hearing the appeal against the conviction by the trial court, was informed that as the wife had refused to return to her matrimonial home and resolve the dispute, the husband hit her with whatever came in his hand.The HC held that in such circumstances the offence could not be considered without keeping in mind the emotions involved. Court added that as the man had lost his self-control and had assaulted her in a fit of rage he could not be convicted for murder. The court, however, held that as the offence was a culpable homicide, it sentenced him to eight years of rigorous imprisonment.The division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice Sarang Kotwal while hearing the appeal of Ankush Chavan was informed by court-appointed lawyer advocate Lokesh Zade that the October 2016 conviction by the Islampur sessions court was based on the premise that Chavan had assaulted his wife with the intent of killing her, which was not the case. Zade further submitted that the FIR for an offence under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Chavan was registered based on the complaint by the deceased woman’s sister. Zade argued that as Chavan’s wife had left her matrimonial home and was living with her sister, Chavan had only gone to his sister-in-law’s house to convince her to return to her matrimonial home. However, after the wife refused to accompany him, in a fit of rage Chavan had assaulted her which led to her death. Hence, Chavan had neither premeditated the murder nor had he intended to kill his wife the conviction and sentence should be set aside.Chavan and his wife were married in 2002 and had three children. According to the complaint, the deceased woman had disclosed to her sister that Chavan suspected her character and on one occasion had threatened to kill her. Fed up with the nagging by the husband since their marriage the wife left her matrimonial home and went to the house of the sister on April 18, 2015. Chavan had lodged a missing person complaint the next day and gone to his sister-in-law’s house on April 20 suspecting that his wife was there and that is when the fatal incident occurred.The additional public prosecutor, however, argued that the trial court had taken into consideration all aspects of the incident and based on the deposition by witnesses had convicted Chavan for murder and hence there was no need for the HC to interfere with the order.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that Chavan was insisting upon his wife to return to her rightful matrimonial abode with a hope that the crises would be ironed. However, as the wife denied the offer he felt that there was no hope that his wife would return with him and being enraged and deprived of self-control, had assaulted his wife with whatever was available just nearby. “In these circumstances, it would be necessary to read the mind of the offender and not consider the offence devoid of emotions,” the bench noted in its judgement.In light of this observation the court held that the offence would not fall under section 302 but section 304 (Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide) and set aside the sessions court order and commuted the life imprisonment sentence to eight years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-commutes-life-sentence-of-husband-as-he-did-not-intend-to-kill-wife-101632668259673.html
26-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai hospital’s 2018 projects help maintain medical records of 23K Covid patients||A critical Covid-19 patient has to undergo several diagnostic tests daily in a hospital. Maintaining essential reports of thousands of Covid-19 patients is an uphill task for the already overwhelmed medical staffers. However, amid the pandemic, a pilot project of BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai Central that was initially implemented in 2018 — Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) — has provided a sigh of relief to the healthcare workers (HCWs). The project was widely criticised by doctors in 2018. All the medical documents including prescriptions, discharge summary, bed count, X-ray films and CT scans are maintained online with individual unique health identity (UHID) cards of the patients.HMIS is an ambitious project of BMC that is aimed at revamping the structures of the hospitals. Easy to maintain recordsUnder this, ₹100 crore worth system, all the data starting from the medical records and reports will be made online across the civic-run hospitals. Under the pilot project, over 700 high tech Lenovo computers were brought in 2018 to replace the old ones at Nair Hospital to run HMIS. The application has been developed in a joint venture of the IT department of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Nair Hospital, Inspira Enterprise Private limited, Manorama Info Solutions Limited, Med synaptic Private Limited and Dynacons systems and solutions Limited.Since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, over seven lakh individuals have contracted Covid-19 in the city and almost 20% of them have procured treatment in civic-run hospitals. Amid the overflowing of patients during the first and second wave, the medical staffers, especially the nurses, struggled to maintain the records of the patients. Often due to the manpower crunch, several doctors complained of getting the reports from the radiology and laboratory late, which are essential in providing timely treatment to Covid-19 patients.However, the HMIS in Nair Hospital eased up the work of the HCWs.In the last 18 months, the HMIS of the hospital has stored medical records of 23,293 Covid-19 patients. Of these, 449 of them were outpatient department (OPD), 11,159 were inpatient department (IPD) and 11,685 of the patients were in an emergency ward.“With the growing number of Covid-19 patients, it is important to digitally record all patients. For enhanced management of Covid-19 crisis, HMIS is also enabled with different dashboards and advanced analytical reporting that provides a summarised as well as a detailed view of hospital departmental statistics like total registered cases, hospital beds occupancy, symptomatic and discharged patients,” said Dr Ramesh Bharamal, dean of the hospital.Facilitate faster, safer diagnosis of patientsThe radiology department is directly connected with the software which helps in faster and more efficient reporting. Through an advanced technology— Picture Archiving and Communication System, the reports of the CT-scan, X-ray, sonography among others are directly uploaded on the system. This has helped in reducing the dependency on the manpower strength and wastage of the films.“As we have seen, the health condition of a Covid-19 patient can deteriorate suddenly within a few minutes. So, this requires time detection of the health complications of the patient. Now, as the laboratory and radiology department are synced with the system, doctors are being able to access the reports quicker on their desktop, without waiting for the HCWs to physically procure those,” said Dr Sarika Chapane, nodal officer of HMIS.All patients are provided with UHID cards that hold their individual unique number with barcode numbers. The cards also have the name of the patients, locality, age, gender and contact number.Not only that, the record of the daily usage of medicines is being maintained online under the sales registry. The data is uploaded online with the drugs’ batch number, quantity with the UHID number of patients. This helps in maintaining transparency and curb cases of malpractice in the hospital. Due to these live updates, the hospital is able to keep a tab on the availability of drugs and their shortages.In OPD, the patients according to their UHID numbers are separated into new and follow up wards. The hospital has also installed over 15 LED TVs in OPDs which are linked with HMIS. The screens keep updating the patients in the waiting area when they are due for the checkup with their names and UHID numbers.“Amid the pandemic, it is essential to maintain the social distance in the OPD. So, with this system in place, we have been able to disperse the crowd,” said Dr Chapane.The UHID cards have played a pivotal role in reducing the physical contact of the HCWs with the suspected patients on OPD.“So, with the scanning of the barcode on UHID cards, the on-duty doctors or nurses on OPD can see all the detailed medical reports on the desktop without touching the physical files of the patients, this has helped in controlling the spread of the infection,” said Dr Chapane.With the successful implementation of HMIS at Nair Hospital, the system has also been initiated in other civic-run hospitals like Dr RN Cooper in Juhu, Rajawadi in Ghatkopar, Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli and Kasturba Gandhi Hospital in Chinchpokli.In 2018, when the system was initiated, medicos refused to use it without data operating officers. The doctors at Nair Hospital claimed it would only add up to their workload.But now, amid the pandemic, the hospital hasn’t received any such opposition.“When a doctor is new, the data operating officer assists him/her for some time. But eventually, the doctors themselves have to upload the details of the patients. Doctors are also being trained to provide printed prescriptions to the patients in OPD through the system,” said Dr Chapane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-hospital-s-2018-projects-help-maintain-medical-records-of-23k-covid-patients-101632668079277.html

26-09-2021||Lucknow||UPPCL serves charge sheets on 23 engineers||The Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) management has served charge sheets on 23 engineers and three clerks, all of whom are accused of having caused a huge revenue loss to the corporation by issuing a large number of temporary power connections in gross violation of rules in Gautam Buddha Nagar district under the Meerut discom. All the 23 engineers were last week transferred from Noida and Greater Noida to far-off districts in eastern UP while the three clerks were shifted within the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd (PVVNL), also called the Meerut discom. The action comes amid the power engineers regularly holding protests every day in the 18 districts under PVVNL and the UP Rajya Vidyut Parishad Abhiyanta Sangh, an engineers’ body, threatening a state-wide stir against what they term as the “arbitrary” transfer of 23 engineers. UPPCL chairman M Devraj said charge sheets were served on all the accused and further action would be taken against them, depending on how they defend themselves in the reply that they had been asked to file to the charges framed against them. “On Saturday, we served charge sheets on 23 engineers and three clerks, asking them to respond to the charges within three weeks,” he said. “All the accused will get sufficient opportunity of being heard before the competent authorities take further departmental action against them,” he added. Devraj said that a three-member probe committee found that 23 engineers and three clerks issued temporary electricity connections, throwing all the norms to the winds to illegally benefit the consumers concerned while causing huge revenue loss the corporation. The accused include 12 junior engineers and three executive engineers. Temporary power connections, under the rules, are issued for the purpose of construction of house, building and attract a higher tariff than the regular connections that later replace temporary ones after the constriction is over. According to the UPPCL chief, all types of irregularities were committed in issuing temporary power connections in GB Nagar. “For example, connections of lower KWs (kilowatts) were issued for construction of huge buildings where connections of greater KWs needed to be given,” he said.All the 23 engineers, Devraj said, were moved out of the Meerut discom and the three clerks transferred within the same discom on the basis of the probe committee’s findings. He dismissed the Abhiyanta Sangh’s allegations that the accused were transferred without any prior probe. UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma, in the meantime, on Sunday claimed that irregularities in issuing temporary power connections in Noida must have caused the corporation a revenue loss to the extent of ₹100 crore. “We demand the state government intervene into the matter and appoint an independent probe committee to conduct a fair conduct investigation and punish the guilty,” he demanded. “We also demand the government to ensure that the relevant files and documents are taken into safe custody lest the accused destroy the evidence,” Verma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uppcl-serves-charge-sheets-on-23-engineers-101632665919120.html

Mulani and another accused identified as Imtiyaz Shaikh have been booked under various sections of IPC related to fraud and cheating by the Bund Garden police after a complaint was lodged by Pune Regional Officer of the Maharashtra Wakf Board.The judge in his order stated: “At the outset it is necessary to mention here that the issue regarding title/ownership or even trusteeship cannot be decided in the present proceeding. Though much is argued regarding the status of property, from perusal of the papers furnished by the police, it can be seen that, by way of Government Resolution the property of the Trust was declared as ‘Wakf Property’. The documents prima facie clearly indicate that the applicant and Imtiyaz forged a ‘no-objection certificate’ allegedly issued by the Wakf Authority. The main point of concern, at this stage, is transfer of a huge amount of compensation to a private account belonging to Imtiyaz Shaikh. The investigation is in progress. The applicant had played a major role in the entire process. He must be well aware about the documentary evidence. In such a situation, if at this stage, the applicant would be released on bail, the possibility cannot be ruled out that he may hamper or tamper prosecution evidence. Thus, it is not desirable to release applicants on bail at this juncture. Hence the application stands rejected.” The state prosecutor had earlier argued that the role played by Mulani is clearly revealed. He not only impersonated one of the office bearers of the trust, but also aided prime accused Imtiyaz to siphon crores of rupees of the government. The FIR lodged at the Bund Garden police station claims the duo allegedly impersonated the president and secretary of a trust which owns prime Waqf land in Maan near Hinjewadi, and accepted ₹7.76 crore after land acquisition for the fourth phase of the Rajiv Gandhi IT Park. The FIR states that the Tabut Inam Endowment Trust, which is registered with the Waqf board, owns eight hectares in Maan village of Mulshi taluka, Pune district. The government was scheduled to give around ₹9.64 crore to the trust and accordingly sanctioned and released ₹7.73 crore.The Waqf board received a complaint from the trust that they did not receive any compensation from the state . During an enquiry by the deputy collector (land acquisition), it was revealed that the accused, Shaikh and Mulani, had posed as the trust’s president and secretary and submitted a forged document of the Waqf board giving its consent to their appointments, after which the collector’s office released the amount to them instead of the bonafide trust members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hinjewadi-land-scam-additional-sessions-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-2-accused-in-7-76-crore-case-101632665559108.html

The company also thanked Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and state irrigation minister Satpal Maharaj. It said that Maharaj acknowledged the situation of wastage of national resources in view of restricted impoundment of the reservoir and granted the permission to fill the reservoir to its full capacity.The dam’s power plant provides 1000MW of peaking power and more than 3000 million units of energy annually to the northern grid, of which 12% goes to Uttarakhand, free of cost.The permission to fill the reservoir to 830 metre was given last month by the state government. “The reservoir touched elevation level (EL) 828m on September 11 and thereafter filling was done at 0.30m in 48 hrs to reach EL(+) 830m on September 24,” the company said.The Tehri reservoir is the first earth and rockfill dam of such height in India. “THDCIL took every precaution, reviewed available literature about the initial filling of high dams worldwide and consulted eminent hydro project experts to frame the dam filling program along with the program of regular monitoring of the structures through instruments installed and geodetic observations,” the company said.The Tehri Dam project was conceived in 1949. The THDC India Ltd was brought in to finish the project. The company said that it took cognisance of the issues and impact on quality of water and environment due to the dam and set up panels to examine it. “Several government departments and panels of eminent scientists and experts were constituted to deliberate these issues and after their recommendations, construction of the main dam started in 1990 with raising of the upstream cofferdam. Seismic safety of the dam was again reviewed by the Indian and Russian experts,” the company further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/tehri-reservoir-reaches-full-capacity-for-the-first-time-101632664352817.html

They did not, forcing us to take action.” PMC’s water supply chief Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “The site in question is a tar road where underground cables of different service providers have already been laid. No board was put up stating it belonged to the forest department, so we went ahead without realising that it was forest land. The work is part of the PMC’s 24x7 scheme aimed at providing water to the NIBM and Mohammadwadi areas. The issue will be resolved amicably.” The road in question is located between Anandvan and the Gaibi Peer dargah. Nana Bhangire, a corporator from Mohammadwadi, Prabhag 26, said, “It is mandatory to take permission from the forest department before doing any work.

26-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court appoints receiver on property of deceased man after mother alleges usurpation by daughter-in-law||The Bombay high court (HC) while holding that the mother has an equal right in the property of her son at par with the wife and children of the deceased son, recently appointed an interim receiver to take symbolic possession of the numerous properties in the name of the deceased man. The HC appointed the receiver after it was informed that the deceased man’s wife and children had already alienated properties worth ₹1.85 crores and were neither responding nor appearing before the HC and the petitioner mother had an apprehension that her daughter-in-law would alienate her from the entire estate in her son’s name. The HC also directed the issuance of an advertisement in an English and regional newspaper to ensure that the wife and children were sufficiently informed of the case. The single-judge bench of justice Gautam Patel, while hearing the interim application in the testamentary petition of 80-year-old Premlatha Amin was informed by advocates Zubin Behramkamdin and Bahraiz Irani that the petitioner’s son Minil Kumar Amin had died intestate at Udipi in Karnataka in April 2021. The advocates further informed the court that though the properties and estate of the deceased had to be shared between the mother, wife and son equally, the wife was trying to usurp the share of the octogenarian, hence the interim application was filed to restrain the wife from transferring the assets in the name of the deceased to her name. The advocates also informed the bench that though the wife and son of the deceased had been informed of the case they had not appeared before the court, hence a Receiver should be appointed till the petition was decided. According to the petition the deceased Minil was working as a brand manager of a company in Kuwait since the 1990’s and based on his earnings had bought substantial properties in Mumbai and outside. He was married and had a son who was studying in the US. The petition states that Minil and his wife had a strained relationship as a result of which Minil’s had contracted many ailments. Due to the ailments he retired from his job and returned to India in October 2020. The petitions state that after his return, Minil’s wife did not allow the mother to meet or speak to him and finally in April 2021 when the mother came to know that her son’s health had deteriorated she took the help of her daughter and decided to go to Udipi. That is when Minil’s wife informed his brother that Minil had died. Thereafter, the mother had written to all the bank and housing societies where her son had bank accounts and properties informing them of Minil’s death and a request to not transfer anything in the name of the wife as a petition was pending in HC. The advocates informed the bench that despite the letters, one of the banks had allowed the wife to transfer ₹1.85 crore to herself. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that though the wife and son of the deceased had been informed of the case they had failed to be present through video conferencing and hence said, “I believe it will be necessary to take certain protective steps regarding the estate to ensure that it is preserved and, at the same time, to ensure that any case the Respondents may want to put forward is not prejudiced. But the one thing that is unacceptable is for the Respondents to defeat the Petitioner’s claim by remaining absent.” The court while granting one more opportunity for the wife and son to appear appointed an ad-interim Receiver to take symbolic possession of the immovable and movable properties in Mumbai and also directed the mother to serve notice of the petition through advertisements in an English and a regional paper to the wife and son and posted hearing of the interim application and petition to October 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-appoints-receiver-on-property-of-deceased-man-after-mother-alleges-usurpation-by-daughterinlaw-101632663458921.html

26-09-2021||Kolkata||At Bhawanipore, campaign is multifaceted in Banerjee vs Tibrewal contest||A daily routine for Anirban Sarkar, a sales executive, having Punjab-style tea at Balwant Singh’s Eating House after a morning walk has become quite a different experience ever since Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee and her challenger, Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) youth leader Priyanka Tibrewal, started campaigning for the September 30 Bhawanipore assembly bypoll. “The popular eatery on Harish Mukherjee Road seems to be on every politician’s radar because they get to interact with voters from all backgrounds. Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri came to offer prayers at Gurdwara Sant Kutiya located next door. Bhawanipore is often referred to as mini India because of its population. The constituency is home to Kolkata’s oldest Sikh families as well as Gujaratis, Marwaris, Odiyas and Biharis,” said Sarkar. “As a voter, I felt bad when the chief minister did not contest her old seat during the March-April polls. After she was defeated by the BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari in Nandirgram, I somehow knew that she would contest again from Bhawanipore. Minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who won the seat, resigned from the assembly to make way for her. Somehow, the campaigning is far more intense than what we saw when Chattopadhyay was fielded,” Sarkar added. Kuldip Singh, whose family has been running a business for 40 years near the century-old Jadu Babu Bazar on Asutosh Mukherjee Road, said, “Not a single day has passed when politicians from both sides have not knocked on the doors of voters. The agitation in Punjab and Haryana against the Centre’s farm laws is being highlighted by the TMC. Many national issues are figuring in the local election.”Spread over a part of the constituency, Odiya para - a neighbourhood named so decades ago when plumbers and car mechanics from Odisha permanently settled down - has witnessed BJP leaders making multiple trips since last week. “Sambit Patra (BJP national spokesperson) distributed leaflets and said as an Odiya he closely relates to Bengali culture,” said Ramesh Behera, who works at a garage on Dr Rajendra Road.Campaign in the constituency has been vitriolic and passionate with the BJP attacking Banerjee of being pro-minority and riddled in corruption. The CM has sought every single vote and claimed these votes would show the BJP’s its place in West Bengal. Although two other assembly constituencies are going to polls in the state, the most ferocious campaign is happening in Bhawanipore. Vote for Bhawanipore will take place on September 30 along with Samserganj and Jangipur assembly seats in Murshidabad district. The state Congress has not fielded anyone following instructions from the national leadership that apparently wanted to offer a good gesture to Mamata Banerjee in the wake of her efforts to unite national and regional forces against the BJP. The CPI(M) has fielded Srijib Biswas, a low-profile candidate.BJP and TMC leaders said the possibility of a low turnout, a regular feature of bypolls, is not ruled out. Of the 2,06,389 voters in the constituency, only 1,26,592 visited polling stations on April 26 when the state assembly polls happened and 784 exercised their franchise through postal ballot. Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay won and later resigned to vacate the seat for Banerjee. Chattopadhyay won the seat by securing 57.71% votes while BJP candidate, actor Rudranil Ghosh, a debutant in politics, came second with 35.16%. With 5211 votes, the Congress came third while people who did not want to vote for any party and pressed the NOTA (none of the above) button accounted for 1570 votes, the fourth largest in the final tally. According to TMC and BJP leaders, more than 20% of people in Bhawanipore are Muslims while Sikhs and non-Bengali speaking Hindus comprise around 34% of the local population. Of the eight civic body wards in this assembly segment, non-Bengali speaking Hindus comprise almost half the population in three wards. Calcutta high court lawyer Tibrewal, who has been tirelessly walking from door to door, said, “It is wrong to assume that BJP is concentrating only on areas that have more non-Bengali speaking voters. We are reaching out to all. I was born and brought up in Kolkata. I am a Bengali like anybody else.” Though Tibrewal speaks Bengali, albeit with an accent, leader of the opposition in the assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, and the BJP’s new state president Sukanta Majumdar are shuttling in and around Bhawanipore every day. To draw public sympathy, the BJP is highlighting the post-poll violence which, it claims, has taken the lives of 52 workers and leaders till September 22. On Saturday, the BJP held a demonstration with 40 of these families near Hazra Park where the chief minister was assaulted by a Left worker in 1990 when she was a youth Congress leader. The incident catapulted her image. Adhikari has held back-to-back meetings at civic ward No 79 in the Chetla area where Hindu Bengalis comprise the largest chunk of the population. “A cat doesn’t climb a tree unless compelled,” he quipped at a meeting, taking a dig at the TMC’s hectic campaigning. Though Banerjee won the Bhawanipore assembly seat in 2011 and 2016, TMC trailed the BJP in two civic wards in these polls. Although the margins were wafer-thin, the ruling party has kept history in mind. “We have to ensure that Mamata Banerjee wins by a margin of at least 0.1 million votes,” the chief minister’s nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said at a public meeting on Sunday evening when the two campaigned together for the first time. Banerjee has entrusted eight senior party leaders and ministers to monitor the campaign in the eight civic wards. Among them, transport and housing minister Firhad Hakim, a trusted lieutenant of the chief minister, is the most visible. “All voters want Mamata Banerjee because she is the only formidable force against the BJP,” said Hakim. Union minister Smriti Irani, who speaks Bengali and even played the lead in a Tollywood movie during her acting career, campaigned on Saturday in civic ward No 72 where Bengalis are in the majority. With security and Covid protocols stopping her from campaigning on the streets, the chief minister is addressing at least one public meeting in the afternoon or evening after leaving Nabanna, the state secretariat. With Durga Puja, Bengal’s biggest festival, less than a month away and pandals being set up on the streets, Banerjee is reminding voters that before the assembly polls the BJP’s national leadership accused her of not allowing Hindus to organize Durga Puja. “You (BJP) come and see how people from all religions observe their festivals in Bengal. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains live as equals here,” Banerjee said on Friday at a meeting in civic ward No 71 where Bengali Hindus outnumber others. On Saturday, while addressing a meeting in ward No 63 where Muslims live in large numbers, she said, “Our state ranks first when it comes to awarding scholarships to minority students. People used to think they only study in madrasas. More than 0.1 million Muslim students have opted for higher education. They are becoming doctors, engineers and Indian Administrative Service officers. This makes the country proud.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/at-cosmopolitan-bhawanipore-campaign-is-multifaceted-in-banerjee-vs-tibrewal-contest-101632660640154.html
26-09-2021||Mumbai||MoEFCC seeks attention towards construction in Powai lake||For the second time in less than two months, the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) has taken cognisance of alleged violations of environmental law at Powai lake in the city and has directed the government of Maharashtra to “take appropriate action in the matter” and intimate the ministry of the same. The MoEFCC had in August responded to a complaint by a student at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) and asked the state to submit a report on a cycling track being built around the lake, which environmentalists have alleged poses a threat to the ecology of the area. The state’s response in the matter is yet to be submitted.Now, responding to yet another complaint raised by a Omkar Mahadeo Supekar, a PhD student at IIT-B (which abuts the lake), the MoEFCC on September 21 wrote to the principal secretary, Maharashtra forest department, seeking “immediate attention towards construction activities in the ecologically sensitive water catchment area of Powai Lake”. The directive was issued by CB Tahsildar, assistant inspector general of forests (Central) at the MoEFCC’s Integrated Regional Office in Nagpur.In a letter to the Centre on September 6, Supekar highlighted that three of his representations in the matter have not yet been responded to by concerned authorities. Supekar also wrote that “The construction activities fall within 100 metres of the riparian area and will affect the waterbody and ecosystem of Powai Lake”. He also said that a “gabion structure” currently built on-site, to facilitate further construction, “is not at all eco-friendly since it does not provide any space for water percolation and the water permeability is very less. The sand and stone dumped on this structure hardly allow the water to reach the ground.”The has also invited objections from environmentalists, who said that forest and wildlife clearances for the project have not been granted despite being mandatory. In a letter last month, addressed to officials from the Union environment ministry, the central and state pollution control bodies and the state forest and wildlife departments, Stalin D, wetlands committee member and director of non-governmental organisation (NGO) Vanashakti, wrote, “The lake is home to the Indian marsh crocodile, a Schedule 1 protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972... the National Board for wildlife and forest departments have not given any clearance... for this activity.”Local authorities, including the BMC, MPCB and the forest department are yet to respond to any submissions in the matter. A member of the forest department, seeking anonymity, said that since the matter has been referred to a high-level authority, i.e. the principal secretary (forests), it would be resolved at that level. “We have not been given any instruction at a regional level to initiate any action against the work,” the official said.In addition to these construction activities, citizens and environmentalists have also recently highlighted other alleged violations that pose a threat to the lake’s ecosystem. Earlier this month, an MCGM contractor was found to be spraying glyphosate-containing herbicides to rid the lake of water hyacinths, which could pose adverse toxicological effects on aquatic flora and fauna. Last week, it was also alleged that an MCGM contractor was dumping discarded Ganesh idols in the lake after Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations.Ajay Rathore, chief engineer, hydraulics department of BMC, did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment, as did Ajit Kumar Ambi, assistant municipal commissioner, S ward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/moefcc-seeks-attention-towards-construction-in-powai-lake-101632657940692.html

26-09-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: What must you read in a mutual fund before investing in it?||Since the start of this year, asset management companies have announced roughly 100 new mutual funds with each fund catering to different investors with distinct risk profiles. Many of the new fund offerings (NFO) were cheaper with low net asset values (NAVs). Offers of low NAV have enticed many laymen investors blissfully unaware of the details that must be looked into before investing in mutual funds. While a low NAV justifies the rupee cost averaging approach and helps accumulate more units initially, there are hard facts that one must not ignore while reading a fund to evaluate its prospects. Mutual funds differ because of portfolios and risk-return valuations, so before you purchase one, you need to assess and evaluate these aspects:Check for different risk levelsThe risk factor is different for all mutual fund categories. You must check if the mutual fund is very risky, moderately risk or entails low to moderate risk. For example, many people unable to trace and track stock market movements prefer investing in equity mutual funds. Though these are less risky than direct investments in shares and stock, they come with a certain quantum of risk. Before investing in any mutual fund, check for the inherent risk in the pictorial representation of the risk called riskometer. Every mutual fund scheme has a level of risk assigned to it in the riskometer – view that carefully before investing.Portfolio mattersUsually, we talk about portfolios while planning an investment basket or investing in our choice of stocks as per our risk appetite. But did you know that you must also check the portfolio of a mutual fund to check the sector it is invested in the most? Take for instance two midcap funds. Axis Midcap Fund focuses more on financial services sector with up to 17.49% invested in those stocks, while IT stocks constitute 13.97 % of the total allocation. Compared to this, Kotak Emerging Equity Fund has no IT stock and its investment in financial services sector is 12.47 % of its total portfolio allocation. Knowing the sectors that a mutual fund invests in allows you to make informed decisions: what’s happening currently in the IT and financial sectors? How would stocks in companies from these sectors perform differently from that of the hospitality sector or any other that has been marred under the pandemic effect.Quality of stocksCheck for the quality of stocks in the portfolio. Follow the list of names of the companies and the percentage of investments made in them. For example, stocks of TCS, L&T Technology Services, IRCTC, SRF Limited, Godrej Real Estate, etc. are expected to yield higher returns in the long run owing to the nature of their businesses or enjoy monopoly status in today’s times. Check if the highest quality of stocks top the list as their presence in the portfolio reflects the ability of the fund to deliver superior returns on the amount invested. The quality of stocks in the portfolio would be reflected in the returns that underscore your portfolio performance.Direct plans versus regular plansWhile buying a mutual fund scheme, you will be given the option to choose between direct and regular mutual funds. Basically, these differ only in terms of their expense ratios. As is evident from their higher NAVs, direct plans generate higher returns compared to regular plans. The expense ratio of the former is lesser than the latter. This is because direct plans can be invested in sans any intermediaries while the regular plans involve buying through an agent or broker and hence involve commissions and brokerage charges.Consistency of returnsPast performance is not the hallmark of guaranteed returns in future. A mutual fund earning 17% returns in one year that goes down to 10% in the next year is a cause of concern. Compare this with a mutual fund that has been giving 10% returns year on year. Consistency in performance is important as it underscores the fund manager’s ability to hedge risks while earning good returns that beat inflation. A consistent fund has better chances of delivering better returns every year for a prolonged period.Fund Manager PerformancePerformance evaluation of a fund is the key to evaluating a fund manager’s skills. Superior returns of a fund reflect the skilled fund manager’s ability to manoeuvre through the oscillating stock market movement, especially, during situations like the stock market crash in March 2020. Do a background check of the fund managers attached to the mutual fund to ascertain their ability to earn high returns in sync with your financial goal.NAV performanceMany people shy away from investing in mutual funds with higher NAVs. Comparing NAVs is futile as mutual funds with the same portfolio will yield similar returns. However, some funds perform better than others or have more assets under management, thus, explaining their higher NAVs. There is a common misconception that mutual funds with lower NAV are cheaper, and hence, better. Also, just because some mutual funds have high NAVs, they must not be ignored.Periodic rebalancingNever invest in a single mutual fund alone just because its portfolio and scheme details match your financial goals. Check different mutual funds, their portfolios and decide how they can add value to your investment goals. Before you start investing, check for the asset allocation in these mutual funds. Besides, you must frequently visit to check how your mutual funds are performing. Also, do periodic rebalancing of your funds based on your new goals, which means redeem a non-performing fund to invest in a fund that promises higher valuations.Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-what-must-you-read-in-a-mutual-fund-before-investing-in-it-101632655661073.html

The pillion started running towards a nearby lane. He was carrying a blue and black bag on his back. On his suspicious movement, a police party chased him and he was overpowered at some distance,” he added. On preliminary questioning, he disclosed his identity as Sheikh Sunain Yousuf alias Raja alias Sultan, son of Mohammad Yousuf Sheikh of Gadapora in Shopian. “During the search, a star pistol loaded with seven cartridges was recovered from his possession.

The state government has asked all the districts in the path of the cyclone for evacuation.Cyclonic storm Gulab, which lay centred at over northwest & adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal 160 km east of Kalingapatnam and 125 km southeast of Gopalpur by 1.30 pm, would landfall late Sunday evening, India Meteorological Department scientist Umashankar Das said.The southern Odisha district of Gajapati that is likely to be most affected has already started experiencing the initial damages. Officials said landslide at Gumma block of the district led to disruption of road communication between Namangada to Ajayagada. More than 5,000 people have been evacuated from the hillside and low lying areas of Gajapati and Koraput districts fearing a repeat of the October 2018 incident when cyclone Titli brought a copious amount of rainfall in two days causing massive landslides which resulted in 40 deaths.IMD officials said Paralakhemundi, Gumma, Mohana, R.

According to the Chembur police, the incident took place at 3 am on Saturday when an inebriated Dheeraj Singh stopped the victim and her friend in an alley while they were returning home.The police officers said that the victim had gone to Marine Drive for a stroll along with a male friend. At 3 am when they were returning, Singh, who is acquainted with the woman, stopped them. Officials said that Singh was holding an iron rod and when he threatened the woman and her friend, the latter fled from the spot leaving the woman alone with Singh. The accused then threatened the woman saying that he would brutalise the woman in a similar way as the Sakinaka assault victim. Under fear of the impending threat, the woman accompanied Singh to an adjacent vacant lane where he raped her.After the incident, the accused fled the spot leaving the woman. The victim then approached the Chembur police and lodged a complaint. “Two special teams were formed to nab Singh as the woman revealed his name and address.

26-09-2021||Dehradun||SC committee seeks reply on illegal felling in Corbett tiger reserve||Supreme court-constituted Central Empowered Committee has directed Uttarakhand’s chief secretary and secretary Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change to send their replies “at the earliest” on allegations of illegal felling of thousands of trees for Pakhrau tiger safari, construction of structures and water body in Corbett tiger reserve landscape, officials said. The development follows a complaint filed by Supreme Court advocate and wildlife activist Gaurav Kumar Bansal to Central Empowered Committee (CEC), a committee constituted by Supreme Court on September 20. Bansal, in his complaint, alleged that thousands of trees have been uprooted in the name of the establishment of Pakhrau tiger safari as well as in the name of construction of structures near Moregati Range office and a water body between Kalagarh and Moregati. Bansal said a tiger safari is being developed in Gujjar Sot, Pakhrau Block, Sonanadi Range, Kalagarh Division in Corbett Tiger Reserve. Responding to allegations raised in the complaint, Amarnatha Shetty, member secretary CEC in his letter dated September 24 asked both chief secretary Uttarakhand and secretary MOEFCC that “specific comments of MOEF&CC and state government of Uttarakhand in the above-said matter may please be sent to the CEC at the earliest”. Bansal said the Forest Advisory Committee of the MOEFCC had recommended the proposal only after the written assurance from Uttarakhand Forest officials that only 163 will be felled for the setting up of the tiger safari. “Contrary to its undertaking, forest department officials have uprooted thousands of trees in the name of establishment of Pakhrau Tiger Safari and that too within Corbett Tiger Reserve, which is one of the best and oldest national parks in the country. It is not only against the statutory approvals granted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Central Zoo Authority (CZA) and Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) but is also contempt of the 2001 SC order in which the apex court expressly observed that no tree whatsoever shall be felled in the Corbett Tiger Reserve by the state or anyone else”. When contacted, Rahul (who goes by his first name), director CTR said the allegations that thousands of trees were cut for the safari project is incorrect. He said all the required permissions have been sought for the project. “We look into the issues raised in the complaint and the letter of CEC and send our response accordingly” Earlier this month, Bansal had also sent a legal notice to CZA and NTCA to withdraw their “approval” for the establishment of the tiger safari in CTR. Responding to the notice, Sonali Gosh, Deputy Inspector General of Forests at Central Zoo Authority in her September 17 letter to the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and chief wildlife warden Uttarakhand had asked them to verify facts and submit their response for further necessary action · According to the minutes of the meeting of the forest advisory committee (FAC) held on September 21, 2020, the proposal for seeking prior approval of the Centre for non-forestry use of 106.16 hectares of forest land for setting up of the Tiger Safari was recommended by the FAC on certain conditions that all conditions in the statutory approvals obtained from NTCA and CZA would be complied with and the state government would ensure the infrastructure of the tiger safari is created mainly from bamboo and other natural materials. The minutes also noted that as the construction activity over 4000 square metres is carried out under the project, the proposal does not require Environment Clearance and consequent Wildlife Clearance from the Standing Committee of the National Board for Wild Life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/sc-committee-seeks-reply-on-illegal-felling-in-corbett-tiger-reserve-101632650800613.html

26-09-2021||Patna||500 proxy candidates caught appearing in exam in last 5 yrs linked to Bihar||Earlier in September, a second year student of Bachelor of Dental Science (BDS) programme was held from Varanasi while writing the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET), impersonating as an aspirant. She was arrested from the examination centre and confessed to have received ₹5 lakh through her mother from a gang to appear in the prestigious examination. As she was from a poor family, she easily fell into the gang’s trap, a police officer aware of the case said. This is not an exception; a senior police officer said more than 500 such people from Bihar have been arrested from different parts of the country in the last five years. Several arrests have been made from Bihar, which has a dubious record of tampering with the examination process through question paper leaks or impersonation. Ranjit Don was perhaps the most infamous such example from Bihar, associated with serial tampering of competitive examinations.Bihar Police say a well-organised network is involved in this fraud and it preys on willing candidates and hired experts for a price. Not surprisingly, be it Vyapam scam, Railway recruitment Group D, UP service selection commission, assistant professor recruitment, UP civil court staff recruitment, Constable/PRC recruitment, SSC online competitive examination, Chandigarh transport undertaking (CTU) conductor recruitment exam or the NEET, most incidents of tampering or any other irregularity is linked to Bihar due to the presence of organised gangs that have pan-India network. Police said the gangs lure examinees for important competitive exams through their parents in exchange for a hefty sum and pay such poor students, who have qualified that examination before and are willing to appear this time on behalf of real examinees.“The network takes care of the logistics of managing question papers and tampering with admit cards in connivance with some insiders at the level of identified examination centres. As the stakes for the exams are high, both parents of candidates as well as scholars fall for the risky shortcuts,” a police official, who didn’t wish to be named, said.There have been several examinations where imposters have been found operating, including at the police recruitment examination in Sheikhpura in July this year, when 18 persons were caught while appearing in proxy, including for their relatives.Last week, eight imposters, including four girls, were caught in Patna at an examination centre for the teachers’ D.El.Ed exam—a diploma course in elementary education.Even the board examination held in February this year reported such fraud with over 65 proxy candidates getting arrested. Even in the Fauqania exam conducted by the Madarsa boss, imposters were caught appearing for their kin in the month of March. Earlier this month, a similar gang was busted when four persons were arrested while trying to tamper with the Group-D exam of the East Central Railway using hi-tech devices like Bluetooth, sophisticated earphones. They also recovered admit cards of various competitive exams, original certificates etc. from them, pointing to a larger nexus. Last year in November, over 650 real applicants, including 20 women, appearing in the physical efficiency test (PET) for recruitment of constables in Bihar police were arrested since their biometric credentials taken during the written examination did not match with those collected at the PET. Chairman of the Central Selection Board of Constable (CSBC) KS Dwivedi said the imposters might have taken the examination in place of the arrested candidates due to lapses at the examination centres.The modus operandi of the gangs has undergone change with time. Himself a former medical student, Ranjit Don was considered a mastermind of the medical entrance test leak racket. Though he was caught by the CBI in 2003, the beneficiaries of his misdeeds were said to have spread nationwide by then.Reportedly, he made hundreds of crores by helping thousands of undeserving doctors, engineers, MBAs and bankers to get into the mainstream. He proved that no examination system in the country was foolproof. “Now, question-leak is fraught with huge risk due to improved systems and so arrangements are made for tampering the exams real-time through solvers and imposters with the help of managed exam centres.“The imposters use fudged pictures on admit cards and use oil or some adhesive on the thumb for fingerprint to avoid detection during matching. The gangs earn in millions depending on the examination. It could be as high as ₹4 to 5 million per candidate. However, the subject matter experts, hired for the swap, get pittance despite the huge risk involved and are exploited by gangs due to their poverty,” said a senior police officer of the state home department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/500-proxy-candidates-caught-appearing-in-exam-in-last-5-yrs-linked-to-bihar-101632649657657.html

26-09-2021||Chandigarh||Delayed realty projects: GBP Group head now faces up to three-year jail term||In fresh trouble for Satish Gupta, the managing director of Gupta Builders and Promoters (GBP) Group, the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Punjab, has ordered legal proceedings against him, which may lead to a jail term of up to three years.The authority acted on the complaint of a resident of Chandigarh’s Sector 7, who had complained that he booked a commercial space of 100 square feet in GBP Smart City project in New Chandigarh and paid ₹10 lakh. An agreement came about in February 2020. But later, he came to know that requisite approvals were not obtained by the builder. In fact, the group was penalised for the very same project in May 2019, but no remedial steps were taken, the complaint stated, demanding penalty for the builder and refund of his deposit.Accepting the complaint, the authority, presided over by chairperson Navreet Singh Kang, ordered proceedings under Sections 59 (2) and 61 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act against Gupta and the company.Under Section 59 (2) of the Act, a promoter can face a jail term up to three years for not complying with RERA orders, while Section 61 may invite a penalty of up to 5% of the estimated cost of a real estate project.Statutory approvals missingIn May 2019, upon checking the sites, RERA had found that the said project did not have basic statutory approvals, such as CLU, approvals of layout and building plans, and grant of licence to develop a colony. Therefore, a penalty of ₹1.5 crore was imposed and two months deadline was set for remedial measures. The authority held that despite being penalized then, the managing director executed another agreement in 2020 without registering the project.During the proceedings, the respondent’s counsel had stated that the May 2019 order was under challenge before the RERA Tribunal and therefore, the same dispute can’t be adjudicated before RERA. However, the authority did not find any substance in the contentions as there was no stay order, and directed the RERA secretary to initiate proceedings as per law.Over 2,500 investors affected by group’s delaysThe group head is already in the thick of controversy over multiple delayed projects, and a fresh FIR was registered on September 24 against the firm’s management following a complaint by several allottees. The complainants alleged that the GBP Group promised them possession of various commercial and residential properties in 2016, but even after five years, there had been no progress. Some FIRs already stand registered against the promoter, who police say is on the run.The realty firm has several ongoing projects in Mohali, with estimated affected investors over 2,500. Among them, Camelia, comprising residential and commercial units, in Kharar, and GBP Centrum (commercial) in Zirakpur have been under construction since 2016. Athens (residential and commercial) and Aeroze (residential), both on the Airport road, have not seen any construction for years, and construction has not even begun at a residential colony in New Chandigarh, though plots have been sold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/delayed-realty-projects-gbp-group-head-now-faces-up-to-three-year-jail-term-101632608244419.html

26-09-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | O Noor of the Himalayan moors||Not all tricity citizens have been fortunate enough to undertake a pilgrimage to Hemkund Saheb nestling at over 15,000 feet in Uttarakhand. But a lot of them have heard anecdotes of ancestors and friends who have taken the rugged, adventurous route to this pristine gurdwara associated with Guru Gobind Singh. As pilgrim lore has it, sheer exhaustion instantly dissipates upon entering the divine alpine ambience.No pilgrim can forget the ethereal spectacle of the Hemkund slopes garlanded in the monsoons with clumps of the sacred Brahma Kamal flower (Saussurea obvallata),also known as ‘God’s own lotus’. Associated with the image of Lord Brahma cupping a white lotus in one of his four hands, the perennial herb is the state flower of Uttarakhand but declared ‘endangered’ because of over-extraction for religious, cultural and medicinal uses. On the flip side, cynics compare it to a glorified ‘patta gobhi’ (cabbage)...! Its strongly aromatic or smelly flowers can cause a headache, a dicey proposition accruing from the health hazards that haunt high-altitude jaunts. So intoxicating is the effect of the Brahma Kamal blooming in ethereal alpine environs on aesthetic sensibilities that it has found mention in the epics and a particularly eloquent one at that in Kalidas’ Meghdoot: “Land lotuses on an overcast day, neither open nor closed…The lovelorn Yaksha is talking of his wife’s tear-laden eyes...”. Centuries after the mahakavi’s romantic flourish, a Gujarati explorer from Bhavnagar, Bhavesh Visani, ‘translated’ the verses into a truly memorable photographic composition of the Hemkund ambience. Last August, Vasani trekked to the shrine with his son. Brahma Kamals were blooming on the far side of the Hemkund lake with pure white clouds floating low like billowing dresses shed by the cavorting Gods far, far above. The relieved robes fell down in reflections, without so much as a giveaway rustle of silk, upon the floor of a lake tiled with many-splendoured hues.“The ambience is indescribable. The snow-melt waters are crystal clear but turn into an aqua-rainbow due to reflections. The lake changes colours from green to blue to silver and even something like shards of glass, hues so original they can’t even be found in Picasso’s palette. This kaleidoscope of colours casts a magical spell due to the ever-changing light as the sun plays hide and seek with the clouds. These wild Brahma Kamals seem to be Nature’s offerings to the shrine,” Visani told this writer.Meanwhile, mosaics of monsoon magic linger nearer to the tricity due to the rains extending well into September. An enthralling spectacle is of swarms of common mormons mud-puddling in drenched soils along the Shivalik foothills. During monsoon mud-puddling, male butterflies gather on substrates like wet soil, dung and rotting animal bodies to obtain nutrients such as mineral salts, sodium and ammonium ions, amino acids and simple carbohydrates, which may be absent in nectar. Males pass on these collections to females as nuptial gifts through the spermatophore (a sac of nutrients combined with the sperm). Females apportion these gifted nutrients towards improving egg viability.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-o-noor-of-the-himalayan-moors-101632608126069.html
26-09-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column | Embrace the chaos, accept the imperfect||As you read this, the cells in your body are dying and degrading, you are getting older with every passing second, your tea is getting colder, and the floor getting dustier. Zoom out a little – someone lost a loved one, a business deal failed, protests erupted, a relationship ended, and trees were cut down in the rainforests. Zooming out further, the entire universe is heading towards collapse. The universe inches towards chaos, entropy and lack of order, this being the fundament of thermodynamics. Stephen Hawking in A Brief History of Time says, “The increase of disorder or entropy is what distinguishes the past from the future, giving a direction to time”. Chaos and disorder is inevitable, entropy is a measure of this disorder, which further explains why our life gets more complicated as time goes by. By aiming to achieve order, structure and a faultless situation, we are subconsciously giving in to the fact that life is not perfect, and that we are not in complete control. Most modern day youngsters set an overly high personal standard and their self-evaluation is inordinately critical. A constant self-requirement to perform exceedingly well at all stages, be it the work space, home front, as a parent, for a parent, a hobbyist or a socialite. This need for order and toxic perfection has hit young generation particularly hard. A recent estimate shows that almost 30%of undergraduate students experience symptoms of mental unrest and depression, which is directly linked to their hunger for flawlessness and the need to have their lives under control. Science evolved from our everyday lives, making one believe that this law of thermodynamics takes its basis from the entropy in our everyday life. How everything tends towards disorder and our life always seems to get more complicated. The clean home becomes cluttered by the end of the day, the butterflies in the stomach wear off as the relationship progresses, youth fades, hair grey, skills become obsolete time, the house needs repair, paint chips, walls dampen, and the cracks become deeper. Perfection is unattainable, it is imaginary, a fanciful dream. Order is always artificial and temporary, disorder is not an omission, it is the default. A world without imperfection and chaos, would be a world where dreams are fulfilled in the first attempt, where everything stays the way we leave it, where nothing breaks or fails, and everything remains immaculate. This would be the same world without a need for progress and growth, without science, innovation and creativity trying to improve our lives, a monotonous one without efforts to reduce the distortions. The existence of chaos, disorder or entropy is what keeps us on our toes and makes our life purposeful. John Green, in his book, Looking for Alaska, says, “Everything that comes together falls apart. Everything. The chair, I’m sitting on. It was built, and so it will fall apart. I’m going to fall apart, probably before this chair. And you’re going to fall apart. The cells and organs and systems that make you - they came together, grew together, and so must fall apart. The Buddha knew one thing science didn’t prove for millennia after his death: Entropy increases. Things fall apart.” As you read this, pick yourself up, embrace the chaos, the inevitable entropy, clean up the messy room yet again, reheat that cup of tea and accept the imperfect. shazuks@gmail.com( The writer is an advocate at Punjab and Haryana high court, Chandigarh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-embrace-the-chaos-accept-the-imperfect-101632607762198.html

26-09-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali MC relaxes penalty for trade licence renewal||In a major relief for traders and industrialists, the Punjab local bodies department has allowed the Mohali municipal corporation to relax the penalty for renewing trade licences.According to the Punjab Municipal Act, all commercial and industrial establishments within the municipal limits have to get the trade licence renewed every year after March 31.While there are around 10,000 traders in the city, only 1,000 approach MC after expiry of their permits. Earlier, the penalty was ₹1,000 and ₹100 per day till renewal was sought. Now, the fine will be levied depending on when the application is filed.All renewals will invite a ₹1,000 fine. However, if the application is filed in the first quarter of the year, 25% of the licence fee, which ranges from ₹500 to ₹4,500 depending on the trade, will be levied as penalty. The penalty will increase to 50% licence fee, if paid in the second quarter, 75% in the third quarter, and to 100% in the fourth quarter.The relaxation comes after MC forwarded a proposal in this regard in June this year. MC secretary Ranjeev Kumar said, “Earlier defaulters had to pay a hefty penalty, but now they just have to pay a ₹1,000 fine and a portion of the licence fee. So far, trade licences brought in ₹30 lakh a year for MC, but with relaxations, this should increase to ₹1 crore. The traders, who have not applied or renewed their licence, should do it immediately.”Inspectors to check licencesThe civic body has also appointed inspectors and divided the city into four zones to check the licences.Phases 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, and villages Shahimajra, Madanpura and Mohali will be part of Zone 1.Zone 2 includes Phases 3A, 3B1, 3B2 and 7, Sectors 70 and 71, Mataur village, and Industrial Area Phases 7, 8, 8-A and 8-B.Phases 8, 9, 10, 11, Sectors 48-C, 65-A, 66-A, 66, 67, 68 and 69, Kumbra village and Industrial Area Phase 9 are listed in Zone 3.Zone 4 will comprise Sectors 76 to 80 and Sohana village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mc-relaxes-penalty-for-trade-licence-renewal-101632607402335.html
26-09-2021||Chandigarh||Random Forays | The admirable art of laughing at oneself||Blessed are those who retain the innate ability to be able to laugh at themselves once in a while, or even often. A certain amount of calmness and peace-within is obviously needed for an individual to be able to take a dig at himself or herself, in this very demanding world of ours.The entertaining lines of a popular nursery rhyme, that have stayed in the mind since childhood, go like this “Hey, diddle, diddle/ The cat and the fiddle/ The cow jumped over the moon/ The little dog laughed to see such fun/ And the dish ran away with the spoon!”The little dog in question has emerged from my past to be of immense interest to me while I’m writing this piece. While the composite picture of that nursery rhyme has various versions, and parents of toddlers must know it well, the dog’s image, rollicking with uncontrolled mirth as he was, is particularly noteworthy. He represents most of us, when we roll over in gleeful laughter at the expense of someone else, or because someone else may actually be trying to make us laugh, like a baby with his antics.Yet, only a rare human being would ever relish to that extent, a laugh at his own expense, but all dogs might. A child, enveloped in the most pristine sheen of innocence and an animal cub or pup, might thoroughly enjoy themselves even when others are undertaking a royal giggle at their expense.I for one often find myself feeling slightly edgy when the joke is on me! One does try to take it sportingly, and over the years one has improved in many ways. But somewhere down under, the feeling of being able to pull everybody’s legs and not get one’s own pulled, remains present even if dormant. In fact it is a good test for me, once in a while, to analyse my own mindset in such a situation.The British Psychological Society records in an online publication, that, to be capable of laughing at oneself is usually considered a mark of good character and the foundation of a robust sense of humour. Paradoxically, it goes on to add that those with the proclivity of laughing at themselves are not necessarily likely to be the laughing sorts in life as a whole.Yet it is clearly a frothy sense of humour and a lighter outlook, despite the world and its shenanigans that sets such personalities apart. Not for them an ego-centred approach to everything and everyone. Those who can take a joke on themselves sportingly are remarkable people. Their minds are largely uncluttered by thoughts of perception, acceptance and one-upmanship.I have been fortunate to have had the company of several close friends over the years whom I could tease with aplomb, and they would laugh more than I would. In my family, my maternal grandmother stood out. My grandfather was the wittiest gentleman around, who could pull a joke out of a hat at any moment, and nani was usually on the receiving end. All present would be unable to rein in their mirthful tendencies even slightly, in such situations, with my grandfather beaming at having produced yet another gem from his unique repertoire. But nani would never ever complain, and in fact would laugh the very loudest. Once she had understood the joke, that is!My wife, Neena, is another champion of this league. I have had many an occasion to wax eloquent, with tongue in cheek, on her Himachali roots and the quaintness of customs that her family has followed for decades. But she has never ever been even remotely offended, though our conversations have often offered landing stations for my joke missiles. It is another matter that she was much more of a topper than I ever was, and had she started throwing back a few funny punches, my own roots would have been tested to the hilt.Perhaps it is friendship and of course love, which permeate such relationships, and obviate the need to feel cut up when light hearted humour is in the air. The trick is to not go too far. As is the case with everything else in life too.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-the-admirable-art-of-laughing-at-oneself-101632606923481.html

26-09-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout | The smile on Rehmat Masih Matoo’s face||The story today is not about Padree Rehmat Masih Waiz, who was born to a Dalit Muslim family in Narowal in 1857 and wrote soulful hymns in praise of the Lord and Master Jesus Christ after converting to Christianity. The Rehmat Masih that we talk of belongs to the present times and was immortalised in literature in a classic story penned by leading Punjabi Dalit writer Bhagwant Rasulpuri. The storyteller belongs to the second generation of Dalit writers, who along with Gurmeet Karyalvi, Des Raj Kali and many others, have told the story afresh from subjugation to assertion, contrary to earlier writers such as Prem Gorkhi, Atarjit, Nachattar who wrote about the oppression mete out by the upper castes.An unforgettable characterRehmat Masih is a spirited character who comes from the Valmiki community and converted to Christianity but led the same life of not just the poorest of the poor but also that of the shunned and the humiliated. Rasulpuri as the narrator introduces him thus: “I have to talk to you about the person who has just got down the tempo. Yes, he is Rehmat Masih Matoo, Master Rehmat. His bronze face is shining as if he has been unaffected by the dust. Joyfully pulling at his Cavender cigarette he moves along, sometimes in his safari suit and sometimes in a white kurta-pyjama. After retirement he dreams of becoming the Mesiah of the Valmikis.”Thus, we see Master Rehmat in many roles in his journey for survival. As a schoolboy he bunks school and occasionally watches a Dharmendra film or along with his friends learns the art of eating tasty food, such as pakodas, rasgulla and barfi, by turning into a dishwasher at wedding feasts. His talent for sketching leads him to become a drawing master at the village school in the quota reserved for the Scheduled Castes. Thus, he moves through hurdles and caste biases to finally retire from his job, which he almost lost several times.And it is a moment of pride for him when he sees his daughter become a hockey player and marry well and his son buy a motorcycle and proudly putt the letter ‘V’ just above the headlight saying, “When a Jat’s sons can write ‘Singh is King’, why can’t we write V for Valmiki?’ And indeed, there is a smile on the face of Master Masih as the sentiment is echoed by the young Dalit singer Ginni Mahi when she sings ‘Fan Baba Sahib di’ referring to BR Ambedkar, who framed the Constitution of India, or joyously chants ‘Danger Chamar’. The moment has come for him to see caste shame turn into pride.Who is afraid of the word ‘Dalit’?It is this journey from disgrace to pride that is best expressed by eminent scholar Harish K Puri, who pioneered work on the Dalits among the Sikhs: “The term Dalits is used to signify solidarity among the Scheduled Castes of India for a joint struggle for basic rights to human dignity and social equality. Dalits is a hold-all term ,which became more prominent since the launch of the Dalit Panthers Movement among the Maharashtra Panthers so as to emphasise underlying unity in the midst of diversity and post-Ambedkar fragmentation”.He says that it is out of place that a notice be issued against this word, which expresses the changing lives of the Dalits in different parts of the country, Punjab included. He adds it is a moment of psychological empowerment for the Dalits, who see one of them heading the state.Others who are well-versed in Dalit studies such as Ronki Ram, a professor of political science, have pointed out that it is a word of dignity for a people who have been addressed in derogatory terms over centuries. Journalist-writer Des Raj Kali asks: Who is afraid the word ‘Dalit? He is quick to answer his own query, “Certainly not we the Dalit who have earned this word. This is a word that represents assertion of identity and has a history behind it. It is also not a word that is unconstitutional by any means. It is a word that has emerged from a long struggle enriched by sensitive creative minds such as the poet Namdeo Dhasal in Maharashtra or Lal Singh Dil in Punjab”. Storyteller Raulpuri adds, “If V for Valmiki fetches a smile from Rehmat Masih Matoo so does D for Dalit!”nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-the-smile-on-rehmat-masih-matoo-s-face-101632606262102.html

In the 2021-2022 budget, the GIA for the municipal corporation (MC) was set at ₹502 crore. It has now been proposed to be increased to ₹700 crore under the revised estimates. “The revised estimates will be submitted with the Union government within a week, and the GIA’s final quantum will depend on its approval,” said a senior UT official privy to the development. The MC has so far received ₹250-crore GIA in two equal quarterly instalments, and expects to get the enhanced GIA of ₹450 crore, if approved, by early next year for spending within this fiscal. Earlier this year, the UT had also released ₹50 crore for village development in addition to the GIA. For the MC, which is facing a fund crunch, the increased GIA will be a major boost, particularly for carrying out development works. Most of its funds currently are used up in revenue expenditure, including paying employee salaries and utility bills. The corporation started the current fiscal with a deficit budget of ₹670 crore. Its finances received a major setback when the UT administration decided to stay the hike in water tariff till March 2022. The civic body was expecting to earn an additional revenue of ₹90 crore from the hike, which was imposed in October last year. Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said the increased GIA will help bridge the widened gap in revenue after the hike in water charges was rolled back. The funds will also be utilised for new development works and for upgrading the solid waste processing plant. The MC will be able to clear various pending bills as well.Sharma said the administration has also sent reminder letters to the Union government for implementation of the fourth Delhi finance commission’s report in the city. Its implementation will increase the MC’s share in the UT’s overall revenues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-proposes-40-hike-in-mc-grantinaid-101632605182305.html

Realising that the hiked bills could be a hot-button issue, the civic body has been directed to stop distribution of water and sewer invoices for the time being. The bills are issued to around 1.4 lakh properties in the city. However, around 45,000 bills have been re-routed to the municipal corporation offices and the field staff are awaiting orders to restart the distribution process.The MC general house had approved a resolution to hike the water-sewer tariff for different categories by up to 60% in November 2020 and had also revoked the exemption to houses with area up to 125 square yards. The new tariff was imposed in April this year.An MC official, requesting anonymity, said, “There was quite a furore over the revised tariff and many residents had approached Congress MLAs, after which verbal directions were issued to stop the distribution of water-sewer bills.” However, mayor Balkar Sandhu said there was no political interference in the working of the MC. “No such incident has come to the fore in the recent past. MC officials have been directed to speed up recovery of dues from residents.” In June, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) had raised an agitation against the civic body over hiked water-sewer charges and revocation of exemption to houses under 125 square yards.

The secretary was in town to check arrangements for the National Achievement Survey to be conducted in November this year and made an unscheduled visit to Government High School, Ghulal; Government Primary Smart School, Ghulal, Samrala; and a Government School in Bhamia Kalan on Saturday.With the rumour mill working overtime with reports of his visit to schools in the Mangat Block, which was refuted by block primary education officers, teachers and principals called their counterparts in different schools and blocks to confirm his visit and ascertain if he would visit their school as well. Rumours swapped Some union leaders dismissed the photos and videos as dated. “It is unlikely that the secretary visited Ludhiana as teachers here have strongly condemned his inaction in the Punjab School Education Board mid-term paper leak and have also been demanding the transfer of the district education officer,” said a teachers’ union leader.Confirming his visit to the industrial hub, Kumar said, “Yes, I am in Ludhiana and visited a few schools in the district.”An education department officer said, “We received information about his visit around 10 days ago, but the date was not confirmed. His visit came as a surprise to school authorities, and he interacted with students and teachers.”The secretary emphasised on the need to adhere to Covid safety guidelines. Sukhdarshan Singh, president, Anti-Cheating Teachers’ Front, Punjab, who was the whistle blower in the PSEB midterm paper leak controversy, said. “He did not inform anyone about his visit since he did not want to alert the teachers unions who could have questioned him about his inaction against the paper leak in the state.”Protests erupt The Joint Teachers’ Front staged a protest after Kumar’s visit to the district. Union leader Hardev Singh Mullapur accused Kumar of spreading fear and uncertainty among school heads. “The secretary should have informed schools before his visit. We knew that he would visit Ludhiana on Saturday, but he did not reveal which schools he would visit, which is unacceptable,” said HardevAnother leader, Deep Raja, demanded Kumar’s immediate transfer to some other department accusing him of putting students future in dark. “The secretary is pressuring teachers to only focus on NAS and the mainstream syllabus is being compromised. He will ruin the future of the students and should immediately be relieved from his current posting as education secretary,” said Raja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/surprise-visit-of-punjab-school-education-secretary-sends-ludhiana-officials-into-a-tizzy-101632603082997.html

The paediatricians were speaking at a North Zone Pedicon event on Saturday, which was organised by the Chandigarh Association of Paediatricians, in which around 300 delegates participated.PGIMER paediatrician Dr Arun Bhansal said, “The PGIMER had conducted a sero survey for the paediatric population in August, in which it was found that 72.7% of the children, aged six to 18, had acquired natural antibodies against Covid. Despite the spread of the virus among the paediatric population, only a few cases of severe infection were reported in the UT and over 95% children were asymptomatic.” “Besides, children are going to malls, markets and parks, where they can be exposed to the virus, so there is no point in closing the schools where children can actually learn and grow. Due to closure of schools children have been acquiring health problems, psychological and physical, while sitting at home,” he said. “This is the right time for reopening schools as most of adults in our country are vaccinated. Instead of waiting for vaccines, the school management should vaccinate staff”, Dr Bhansal added.The paediatricians also said that PGIMER had recorded multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a post-Covid complication. So far,100 such complications have been reported at PGIMER. The UT education department has reopened classes for students in a phased manner. In July, offline classes had started for students in Class 9 or higher, after which school was opened for Classes 7 and 8 in August, and students of Classes 5 and 6 also resumed classes from September 2. The summative assessment exams for Classes 5 to 8, which will be held between October 4 and October 20, will also be held physically with only genuine exceptions.

26-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC General House meeting: Congress councillors stage walk out||Congress councillors walked out of the municipal corporation General House meeting on Friday to protest against the non-submission of a report on smart parking. Speaking during the meeting, Satish Kainth, a Congress councillor, said, “We were assured in the last House meeting that a report on the working of smart parking will be presented before the house in September. But, no report was submitted on Friday. On one hand, residents are suffering because of poor parking facilities, and at the same time, parking contractors are given undue benefits by the MC. We will demand CBI enquiry into this.” In response, mayor Ravi Kant Sharma, said, “You can speak on the issue during the question hour, but first, we have to discuss the agendas tabled before the house.” Kainth also alleged that the BJP-ruled MC is steeped in corruption. Sharma retorted, “A corrupt party like Congress can only see corruption everywhere. Do you want me to remind you about the rail scam, booth scam and all instances of Congress’ corruption.” The Congress and BJP councillors had heated exchange of words in the well of the house over the issue. Afterwards, the three Congress councillors present walked out. Ruling benches, including the mayor, demanded strict action against erring MC officials for delay in issuance of the allotment letter to IIT Ropar for preparation of the detailed project report and request for proposal for the upgradation of the solid waste processing plant in Sector 25. BJP city chief and councillor Arun Sood, said, “When the House passed the resolution for allotment of the DPR and RFP preparation to IIT Ropar in July, then why would allotment letter be issued only in September. It only shows intent of the officials to delay the start of the project.” The start of the project is set to get delayed, as IIT Ropar’s report is expected by October-end. Earlier, the MC was expecting it by September 15. The work on the project can now only start next year, as tendering process is likely to start after the elections. The solid waste processing plant is working at only 20% of its capacity and most of the city’s solid waste is being dumped untreated. BJP has been trying to showcase an upgraded waste processing plant as one of its major achievements in the coming civic body elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-general-house-meeting-congress-councillors-stage-walk-out-101632600924679.html

Further, the child is to be produced during a hearing on September 28 through video conferencing.The bench of justice HS Sidhu acted on the plea of the NRI father, from UK, who had sought that a warrant officer be appointed to produce the minor child, who is stated to be in illegal custody of the family of the mother in Sonepat.As per the plea, the marriage was solemnised in November 2010 and they have two children, a 10-year-old girl and the boy. Due to marital discord between the couple, the woman had left for her maternal home with both the minors from the UK in March 2020 without informing her husband. When he went to her home, she refused to accompany him. He approached the HC in October 2020 seeking direction to police to get the children released.The plea further claimed that in July 2021, a UK court had directed that the children be made available to spend time with the father for which time was fixed. However, during video calls, he had notice something “unusual” and when in September 2021, he went to meet the children, he was allegedly assaulted by his wife’s family. The father had apprehended that he feared the child could be illegally removed from Sonepat as the wife has gone back to the UK and child could also be taken to an undisclosed location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-asks-sonepat-police-to-ensure-minor-child-is-not-removed-from-district-101632596661412.html

The open session evoked good response as hundreds of people reached there with their grievances.The chief minister said for the past few months such programmes could be conducted but on Saturday, an open session was organised for redressal of grievances of people.Later, the CM inaugurated three developmental projects, including railway overbridge worth ₹13 crore, at the railway station.Reacting to a question about the Bharat Bandh call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on September 27, the chief minister said in a democracy, everybody has the right to protest.“I urge people to remain on their work but nobody will be forced.

We are giving finishing touches to the structure and by October this would be complete,” said Dilip Khamari, superintending archaeologist, Lucknow Circle.The gate of the Imambada collapsed on April 2, 2020, during lockdown.The reconstruction work began on June 23 soon after ASI floated the tender.“The local company that bagged the tender said that the restoration would take within 120 days, but we are trying our best to complete the work before the deadline,” said Nitin Kohli, the contractor and expert who is heading the reconstruction work.ASI officials said that once ready, the gate would look exactly the way it looked in 1847, the year when the construction of Sibtainabad Imambada got completed. Located in the heart of the city, Sibtainabad is among the most beautiful Imambaras.“Reconstruction is way tougher than restoration. In restoration, we restore or strengthen up the existing structure whereas in reconstruction we have to start from scratch,” Kohli said.To give the gate the original Nawabi era look, the entire construction was done exactly the same way as it was done originally during Nawabi era. “Biggest task was the procurement of the old lakhauri bricks that are used in the construction of the gate. We also used surki and lime for binding and plastering in order to give original finishes to the structure,” Kohli added.Mohammed Haider, mutwalli Sibtainabad Imambada said, “The reconstruction of the gate is in its final phase.”Haider also said an anti-encroachment drive was needed as there were many shops that were operating illegally inside the Imambada gate. “District administration and ASI should ensure that the gate is free of any encroachment in future,” he said.According to historians, the 173-year-old gate, was built in 1847 along with the Imambada, which came up during the reign of Amjad Ali Shah, the fourth King of Awadh. But it could not be completed during his lifetime and his son, Wajid Ali Shah subsequently completed the construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/historic-imambada-gate-in-lucknow-reconstructed-in-record-90-days-101632596545754.html

He said more than 80% of cotton crop has been damaged but the Punjab government has failed to sense the crisis faced by farmers. He batted for a crop insurance scheme in Punjab to protect the interest of the agrarian community.“Volume of infestation hints at large scale availability of spurious Bt cotton seeds. The Punjab government should order a probe on how the spurious seeds landed in the state. Rural economy is on the verge of collapse as cotton growers are left with no resources for the next crop,” he said, while demanding a compensation of ₹15,000 each to farm labourers.The call of protest on October 3 has a political significance amid a standoff between the SAD and farmer unions over holding political activities.The event will be held after a month when SAD had to stop all political programmes after SKM activists created a ruckus at Sukhbir’s rally in Moga on September 3.In the last few months, Sukhbir and Bathinda Lok Sabha MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal had to abandon their scheduled visits in villages due to strong opposition from the farmer unions. However, on Saturday, Sukhbir was able to make inroads in the rural areas without any resistance. He visited six villages of Bathinda and Mansa districts.While a section of farmer union activists showed black flags at Sukhbir’s motorcade at Sekhpura village, a number of farmers gathered to welcome SAD president.Lachhman Singh, whose 5-acre crop was affected, said they gathered to welcome Sukhbir to raise the voice of the distressed farmers.Similarly, a large number of farmers at Jajjal, Jaga Ram Tirath and Jhanda Khurd gathered to welcome the SAD chief.3.25 lakh hectares under cotton cultivation in stateA total of 3.25 lakh hectares is under cotton cultivation in Punjab. Nearly 40% of the area under the crop in Bathinda (95,000 hectares) and Mansa (65,000 hectares) is under the pest attack, said the chief agriculture officer (CAO) Manjit Singh for two districts. He said the district administrations have orders girdawri to assess crop loss.Fazilka has an estimated 96,000 hectares and no pest attack was reported till Saturday, said CAO Hardev Singh.Muktsar CAO Charanjit Kainth said of 40,000 hectares in the district, pink bollworm was detected in only two fields of Gidderbaha and Lambi areas and the situation there is under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pink-bollworm-attack-sad-to-hold-protest-in-bathinda-on-oct-3-in-support-of-cotton-growers-101632596361739.html

The disposal rate is about 86% for crime against person, 93% for crime against women, and 94% for cases of the Arms Act,” the CM said.Khattar said this year, paddy procurement will start from October 1 because of heavy rains. Earlier, procurement used to start from September 25.‘BJP never humiliated its ousted CMs’On a question regarding the removal of Captain Amarinder Singh as Punjab chief minister, Khattar said BJP has also replaced its chief ministers but has never humiliated them like the Congress did.“Dissension is also prevalent in the Haryana Congress. Former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda is also treading the same path. For many years, the state Congress has not been able to structure its organisation,” he said.Public interface for volunteering, self-employment launchedKhattar on Saturday launched a ‘Samarpan’ portal which aims to encourage volunteerism. He said people willing to volunteer will get an opportunity to give their services in the field of education, skill development, sports, and agriculture.The voluntary services provided through the ‘Samarpan’ initiative are linked with various programmes and initiatives of government such as education, women and child development, farmer’s welfare, and skill development.The CM said ‘Samarpan’ will provide a platform for volunteers who wish to do something good for the society. He also launched a foreign cooperation department (FCD) official website www.fcd.haryana.gov.in to help non-resident Haryanvis to reconnect, rediscover, and revive their roots in Haryana.FCD’s website will provide comprehensive information about Haryana, Haryanvi culture, reasons to invest in Haryana, and the export performance of the state.Khattar also launched ‘HUNAR’ (Haryana, Udyam, Naukri Aur Rozgar) mobile application developed by Haryana Skill Development Mission.Through this app, the Mission will give training to candidates for self-employment and setting up an enterprise in different activities besides regular wage employment training.In addition to this, students will be given training in industrial, technical, vocational, and competitive courses through the app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-eliminate-paper-leak-gang-khattar-101632596301688.html

The Opposition leaders stressed on forming a front of the regional parties to bring change in the national politics.Former Haryana CM and INLD patriarch OP Chautala said farmers have been protesting against Centre’s three farm laws for one year but the Union government is reluctant to resolve their grievances.“Our party is standing by the protesters and the Centre will be forced to repeal these laws. The government has been delaying Ellenabad bypolls due to fear of losing the BJP candidate’s security deposit. If our party is voted to power, we will waive off all loans and give jobs to every youth as per their qualification,” he added.BJP is lying everyday, says FarooqMeanwhile, Farooq accused the BJP of “dividing people on caste and religion lines” and alleged that the party has done nothing in J&K after scrapping Article 370 from the erstwhile state.“I want to salute Haryana as its youths are protecting our borders. People associated with BJP are lying everyday. They had promised to give 50,000 government jobs in J&K but have done nothing in this regard. They talk of Lord Ram. Ram was of everyone irrespective of religion, but BJP is calling him just theirs,” he said.“Farmers are the backbone of the country but are forced to protest. Government should repeal the three farm laws and bring new laws with farmers’ consent. After BJP came to power, our relations with the neighbouring countries have turned bitter. To ensure peace, we need to keep friendly relations with the neighbours,” he added.“People of J&K had chosen India instead of going to Pakistan during Partition and we love this country. No one can challenge our patriotism,” Farooq added.Devi Lal had united the society: BadalPrakash Singh Badal asked Chautala and KC Tyagi to bring all regional parties on the same platform to fight BJP.“Regional parties can only understand problems of farmers and the rural population. We should make sure that regional parties form government in all states. Devi Lal had united all sections of society and should follow his path,” he added.Farmers earning less than labourers, says TyagiJDU general secretary KC Tyagi said farmers of the country are in distress and are earning ₹27 per day “which is less than what a labourer earns”.“It’s time to review yourself in Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar could not attend the rally as the state is facing a flood situation. He has good relations with Devi Lal’s family and was the lone CM in country who made frequent visits to Tihar jail to meet Chautala. This is the time to assess the challenges being faced by people in country. Chautala should bring like-minded people on the same stage,” he added.BJP’s Birender Singh attends INLD rallyIn a surprise move, former Union minister and senior BJP leader Birender Singh attended Opposition INLD’s rally in Jind.He was welcomed by INLD leaders with the party’s green turban and he wore it.In a veiled attack on BJP, Birender urged the gathering to remain cautious of people who are playing divisive politics.“We need to strengthen our brotherhood and give a befitting reply to those trying to divide us. If Chautala will invite me again next year, I will definitely come,” he added.Birender said Chautala had sent him an invitation to attend the rally and he came to pay tributes to Devi Lal.“Only a few people control maximum wealth in the country which forced farmers to protest for their crop rates. Nowadays, no politician can sacrifice their post but Devi Lal had sacrificed the PM’s post. We need a leader like him to lead us through these tough times,” he added.The senior BJP leader, who had resigned as a Union minister after the BJP fielded his son Brijendra Singh from Hisar parliamentary seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, has been criticising his own party after his son was not accommodated in the Union ministry.Singh has sharpened his attacks against BJP since farmers started protesting against the three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/regional-parties-will-form-front-to-counter-bjp-say-opposition-leaders-at-inld-jind-rally-101632595762457.html

26-09-2021||Pune||Your Space: Allow reopening of offline classes in schools in phased manner||The state health officials have reported a drop in Covid cases during the Ganeshotsav festival as compared to the previous week, and less cases reported than the corresponding festive period last year. As the authorities’ strict norms like online darshan by mandals and no immersion at riversides saw a welcome change, readers share views on resumption of offline classes by educational institutes and reopening of other service sectors... Rural children are missing online classes The Supreme Court has stayed the school reopening decision. It has refused to give directions to the central and state governments to enable students to attend physical classes. Many social scientists are urging to reopen in-person schools as benefits outweigh the risk especially as poor rural children are missing out on online education. According to a survey, only 8% of rural students are studying online regularly. Economist and social scientist Jean Dreze was part of a report which said schools are essential service and it was said that they should be the last to close and the first to reopen. Many doctors of various medical associations are saying that it is safe to resume offline classes after taking all precautions. Unlocking of offline classes may be delayed till Diwali and it is understandable. But post Diwali, all offline classes should reopen. The state of Kerala has already made it clear that it will reopen all schools on November 1. Closed schools are a “looming disaster” and we must not allow it to last longer. Santosh Bhagat Reopen schools under strict safety measures Though schools and colleges have reopened in many other states, the situation in Maharashtra is sensitive. Looking at the current scenario, it has been more than a year that students are taking online learning. However, the issue is that the sudden transformation of the education sector from offline to online has affected delivery of quality education. It was very hard for teachers and students to suddenly change their teaching techniques from offline to online. In today’s context as everything is allowed to reopen, the government should think about taking decisions to open higher secondary school and colleges. However, at the same time steps such as vaccination of age group 12-18 should be started as early as possible. Vaccination of teachers should be ensured. We should not wait for the decision till the cases are zero. Steps should be taken to ensure that the benefits of offline classes that young students have missed should be not be extended for a longer period. We all know that the Covid pandemic is not over yet. Even if the government takes decision to reopen schools - real time monitoring of Covid cases is must so that spread of the virus should be curbed. With strict measures let’s reopen schools to spread the knowledge and let us all take care to check the spread of the virus. Apurv Londhe Reopen businesses to save jobs As we can see that a lot of students are suffering in rural and urban areas due to continuous online classes, reopening of schools will be a good decision. Students are now facing the issue of online fatigue which is affecting their learning. In such a scenario, when we can see that Covid cases have not seen a spike after Ganpati festival, school should start offline. Along with this, other service sector businesses should also resume offline functions as it will help those who are struggling with their jobs. It is equally important that no one forgets that the danger of Covid is not over. Taking all precautions is important to address the third wave. Many of us have lost loved ones in the second wave, and so hand sanitisation, social distancing and most importantly wearing masks should become the new normal. Mansi Waghmare Allow offline classes in phase mode I think that schools and other service sector industries should be reopened, but strictly in phases. As the festival season is not yet over, there are chances that Covid cases may see a rise after Dussehra or Diwali. As many people step outside for festivities and in the festival fervour forget that the virus is still present. But meanwhile, the schools and other places should be reopened in a phased manner. Moreover, vaccination of students from 12 to 18 years should be started soon if offline classes are to be continued. If the children are vaccinated, they will be safer. Most teaching staff at government and private schools are vaccinated. If children are inoculated, they can be free of any added tensions. Offline classes are important as teachers and students can interact much better than online learning. And so I think, with all precautions being taken, if the Covid cases remain low, offline mode should be given a go-ahead. Pragati Kulkarni Reopen schools after Diwali If anyone has suffered the most during the past 18 months, it is students. Online education suddenly was very challenging for students as well as teachers. However, they have time and again coped with the indoor schedule. But now that the Covid cases have dropped, students should get an opportunity to go offline to classes. Also, teachers have been working their best to provide and reach out to as many students as possible. But due to online education, many students are not receiving proper education. The lack of one-to-one interaction has affected weaker students the most. So, it is of utmost importance that students are presented with a possibility of offline school. Many parents can be seen struggling with kids who are not screen dependent for everything. This not only affects the cognitive growth of the child but can lead to obesity among children. Many kids now prefer staying indoors for their evening play with no physical exercises. If the education continues online, it will affect these students the most. However, schools should reopen after Diwali as Covid cases may drop further and it will be safer for the children.

Earlier in July, heavy rains had triggered massive flooding at the two-kilometre stretch on the national highway in Kolhapur, interrupting vehicular movement for four days. Following the floods, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said he will speak to Gadkari about the possibility of building flyovers on the Mumbai-Bengaluru national highway stretch passing through Kolhapur for uninterrupted vehicular movement during flooding. Speaking after laying the foundation stone of a highway project in Karad, the Union minister of roads, transport and highways said all stakeholders will need to understand the project details so that the problem can be solved permanently. “I assure you the road will be a good one and all problems related to it will be solved,” Gadkari said.

BJP MP Sangamlal Gupta was also allegedly attacked by supporters of Congress leader Pramod Tiwari and his daughter Aradhna Mishra ‘Mona’, who is MLA from Rampur Khas. The MP was rescued by police and escorted to a safe place. Congress leader Pramod Tiwari was also manhandled and Aradhna Mishra’s mobile was lost in the melee.

Eye witnesses claimed that the two leaders pushed and shoved each other. The BJP MP’s vehicle also got damaged during the ruckus, a clipping of which went viral on social media. According to reports, BJP MP Sangamlal Gupta was invited as the chief guest at the Mela. He was to reach the block at 1 am but was late. Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari and Aradhna Mishra ‘Mona’ reached the Mela venue at around 2 am.

26-09-2021||Delhi||In major shake-up, 39 senior cops transferred or handed fresh posts||Delhi Police chief Rakesh Asthana on Saturday transferred or handed new posts to 39 senior officers in his first major reshuffle after taking charge as commissioner in July. Several units within the force, such as a community policing unit or a human resources division, were established for the first time as part of the shuffle, and each will be headed by a special commissioner. The 39 officers include seven deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) of the south, south-east, central, north, south-west, Dwarka and outer north police districts. The capital has 15 police districts. Saturday’s reshuffle is significant because DCPs are officers equivalent to superintendents of police (SP) in state police forces, who coordinate with the top brass and junior officers, as well as residents. Among those transferred were DCP (south-east) RP Meena and DCP (south) Atul Thakur, who were moved to police headquarters. DCP (Central) Jasmeet Singh has been transferred to the special cell, which is the Delhi Police’s anti-terror unit. The special cell will now be headed by six DCPs, up from three earlier. Officers in Delhi Police said the increase will ensure there is more focus and scrutiny of cases filed or investigated by the special cell. Among several important cases, the cell is probing the Delhi riots conspiracy case and the recent arrest of six men who are allegedly part of a Pakistan-trained terror module. Among the special commissioners transferred or given new roles, Dependra Pathak, who was special commissioner (special CP) of the intelligence unit, has now been appointed special CP of Zone 1. The zone includes three police ranges — eastern, north and central. Asthana also appointed Virender Chahal as the head of the traffic police. Chahal, who was the special CP of traffic, is now in charge of the traffic management division. To ease law enforcement, the national capital has been divided into thousands of beats. A beat may be limited to a single lane, a group of lanes, a housing colony or multiple colonies. The beats within a particular area make up one police station. Several police stations are clubbed under one police district, each headed by a DCP. Each of Delhi’s 15 police districts has 8-15 police stations. At least two police districts together make up a range. For instance, the north-east and east districts form the Eastern Range. Each range is headed by an officer of the joint commissioner (joint CP) rank. The DCP reports directly to the joint CP. At least two or more ranges form one zone. Effective Saturday, Delhi will have two police zones. While Pathak is the special CP of Zone 1, Satish Golcha has been appointed special CP of Zone 2, which comprises New Delhi, southern and south-western range. S Sundari Nanda, who was earlier in charge of the police headquarters, is now special CP of the human resources division, a new unit, which will deal with managing grievances of the 80,000-strong police force, their training and welfare. Special CP Muktesh Chander, who was in charge of licensing and operations, has been given additional charge of two new units — community policing and the media cell. “The new police chief has implemented several changes [since he took charge of the force]. Till a few years ago, the special cell had only one DCP. Now there are six. The CP office is now called the CP secretariat. There are also two DCP rank officers, who will help the CP. Many posts, such as human resources, community policing or media cell did not exist,” said a police officer, who asked not to be named. “This change is good. There will be more focus by senior officers. Such new initiatives can only happen when someone from outside comes to lead the force.” Asthana, an officer of the Gujarat cadre, who was earlier the director-general of the Border Security Force, was on July 17 appointed Delhi Police commissioner. While this is not the first time that an officer from a different cadre has been appointed as police chief, Asthana is the first such appointment in at least 19 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-1st-major-shake-up-under-delhi-police-chief-asthana-39-senior-cops-transferred-or-handed-fresh-posts-101632594622408.html

Of all the governments in the Indian subcontinent, such a pace of implementation can only be attributed to the DMK government,” he said in a video message posted on his twitter site. This achievement, he said, should not be viewed as a momentary acceleration. “This is how we perform and will continue to do so, every single day. Will meet you once every 3 months to let you know of the progress we made with the list of achievements,” Stalin said.The CM said he would meet the people not as someone who takes them for granted thinking he will have to face them only after 5 years. “It is you and my conscience that drives me. You order. I am waiting to deliver,” he said. Stalin said he has taken charge of chief ministership because of people’s votes. “Each and every vote that was cast serve as a strong base for me to be in Fort St. George. Each one of you cast your votes with the belief that we will always keep up our promises. We will always deliver the best of services to our people,” he said.

Hence, I am talking to you, brimming with pride... presenting the DMK’s election manifesto, I said as Thalaivar Kalaignar (his father and late Chief Minister M Karunanidhi) always says, ‘we say what we do, and do as we say’,” Stalin said. In just 4 months after assuming office the DMK government delivered upon most of the promises.

Loans amounting to ₹2,756 crore lent to women self-help groups through Cooperative Credit Societies were waived, jewel loans lent through Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies were waived,” he said.Reduction of petrol prices by ₹3 per litre, reviving and implementing Anna Marumalarchi Thittam (Anna Renaissance Scheme) in rural areas on an estimated budget of ₹1,200 crore, reviving and implementing the Namakku Naame Thittam with the support of local communities on an outlay of ₹100 crore, cash awards for Olympic medal winners were among the promises fulfilled.Apart from passing resolutions against Centre’s new farm laws and CAA in the Assembly and exemption from NEET, the government announced ex-gratia of ₹25 lakh for the families of doctors who lost their lives during COVID-19 treatment efforts, ex-gratia of ₹25 lakh for families of police officials and personnel who lost their lives during the Covid-19 frontline efforts, enhancing quota for women in government employment to 40%, among others. “Most of our promises have been kept… 51 promises from the Governor’s address, 2 promises from my reply, 43 promises from the budget, 23 promises from the agriculture budget, 64 promises from the announcements by ministers, and 16 promises from other announcements have also been delivered,” he noted. Initiatives which were not part of the DMK’s manifesto like 7.5% reservation for students from government schools on preferential basis in all professional courses, total fee waiver for beneficiaries of this reservation, free travel scheme in government buses extended to transgenders and differently abled, ₹5 lakh fixed deposit for the children orphaned due to Covid-19 pandemic, to name a few were also delivered. “All the above were not announced by us but delivered.

26-09-2021||Delhi||‘Gogi’s assailants planned to escape through judge’s door’: Police||New Delhi: The two men who shot dead gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi in a courtroom in Rohini court complex on Friday may have planned to escape through the judge’s entry-exit door as they had moved towards that direction immediately after pumping bullets into Gogi’s body, but were gunned down by the police personnel who feared that the suspects may harm the judge, said police officials privy to the investigation, quoting the statements of the personnel who were involved in the counter fire.On Saturday, police detained one suspect, who had allegedly dropped the two attackers outside the court in an i10 car around 10am on Friday, nearly three hours before the shooting, and hope his questioning will lead to the people who ordered the hit. The prison department has also sounded an alert in the three jails in Delhi -- Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli -- where several members of Gogi and his rival gangs are lodged.To be sure, the police have not officially shared any information about the suspects’ escape plan as, they say, they are yet to verify it from the prime conspirators who, as per the initial investigation, are Gogi’s arch rival Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuriya, and his associates such as Sunil Rathi, Naveen Bali, Neeraj Bawana,Vicky and Kaushal. Except Vicky, who hails from Haryana’s Sonepat, the other suspected conspirators are lodged in different jails in Delhi and the neighbouring states. The crime branch team that is investigating the case will soon take their custody to question them on the conspiracy, the officials said.According to police, the suspect detained on Saturday was also dressed as a lawyer and drove his car, without the two assailants, to the court premises around 10.30 am using gate number 4. Investigators are scanning the CCTV footage from near the court gates to determine from which gate the attackers entered the premises and to ascertain if they were searched and frisked by the security personnel presents there, said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named.“The special cell team is questioning the suspect to ascertain the identities of the key conspirators,” the officer said.Around 1pm on Friday, Gogi was escorted to court number 207 on the second floor of Rohini court complex by 10 police personnel of the Third Battalion, while 15-20 personnel from the special cell and the Rohini district police were present there in plain clothes. Eyewitnesses as well as police officers said that the judge Gagandeep Singh was seated when the two assailants dressed as lawyers pulled out their guns and began firing at Gogi in front of the judge. The policemen present there responded and killed the suspects in the counter fire.“One of the policemen involved in the counter fire told the senior police officers that the judge rushed to his chamber using the door dedicated for his entry and exit from the courtroom. As the suspects also ran in the same direction, the policeman opened fire thinking that they may use the same door to escape or try to hurt the judge. The other policemen also responded and killed the duo before they could climb the judge’s desk. Since the attackers died, their exact escape plan would be known only when we interrogate the conspirators,” said a second senior police officer, who did not want to be identified.“Had the assailants managed to cross the desk, they would have easily escaped from the court campus as the staircase was just outside that judge’s entry-exit door,” added the officer.Police said they are looking at Tajpuriya as the prime conspirator as he was involved in a bitter feud with Gogi for nearly a decade.The dead assailants were identified as Rahul Tyagi, who hails from a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut, and Jagdeep alias Jagga, from Sonepat in Haryana. Initial investigation and information collected by the police through their criminal intelligence network has hinted that the two were hired for the hit allegedly by Tajpuriya’s close aide, jailed gangster Naveen Dabas, better known as Naveen Bali.The name of another associate of Tajpuriya, Sunil Rathi from Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat, is also being probed in the conspiracy. Rathi is a key accused in the murder case of UP’s dreaded gangster Prem Prakash Singh, better known as Munna Bajrangi, who was shot dead inside Baghpat jail on July 9,2018.Investigators said that information collected so far in the case has revealed that Tyagi and Jagga were kept in a flat located nearly three kilometres away from the Rohini court. It has also been learnt that the suspects had conducted a detailed reconnaissance of the courtroom and its premises a day before the hit.“These are all preliminary information and we are verifying it,” said the officer quoted first.Security arrangements at the Rohini court complex was increased on Saturday in the wake of Friday’s shootout that is considered a major security lapse and because of the fact that Tajpuriya’s physical visit to the court in an old case was also scheduled.Tajpuria was brought to the court from Mandoli jail around 10 am on Saturday amid tight security arrangement and was produced for a hearing at the court but the proceedings could not completed due to a strike announced by the lawyers.The next date of hearing was fixed on September 30 and Tajpuria was taken back to jail around noon.Meanwhile, director general (Tihar prison) Sandeep Goel said that an alert has been sounded inside the prison, following which jail officers are now in touch with the police and are rechecking the records of all members of the Gogi and Tajpuria gangs lodged inside the prison complexes at Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli. At least 15-20 alleged members from each gang are lodged inside the three jails. Separately, jail officers are also keeping checks on Tajpuria security.“It is likely that there will be a reshuffle of all these gangsters. It is possible that Tajpuria will also be transferred to a more secure area inside the prison. We are also in touch with police about the security of prisoners during their court production,” a jail officer, who asked not to be named, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-men-who-shot-gogi-in-rohini-court-may-have-planned-to-escape-through-judge-s-doorway-police-101632594380890.html
26-09-2021||Delhi||New AIIMS master plan: 3,000 more beds, 50 OTs in 7 years||A new master plan for redeveloping the premiere All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) will add 3,000 beds to the hospital, including 300 for emergency services, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Saturday. The hospital will also add 50 new operation theatres and a dedicated infectious diseases ward over the next seven years, he said.The hospital already has over 2,000 beds for the treatment of patients.Dr Guleria was speaking during the celebration of the 66th foundation day of the institute. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya had also been invited to the campus for the celebration.The master plan details the creation of over 4,000 hostel units to replace the currently ageing buildings, as well as a smart library for students. Dr Guleria said the research needs of the institute will also be kept in mind while implementing the comprehensive redevelopment plan. The plan, he said, will dedicate 1.5 lakh sqm of built-up area for state-of-the-art research laboratories, animal facilities, and a clinical trial facility. The plan will also focus on creating “future-ready” IT support, said Dr Guleria.Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya also inaugurated an automated laboratory during the occasion. The laboratory, which will process 50,000 samples a day, will ensure the availability of the most crucial tests needed for emergency and instant decision-making round the clock. It will conduct several sophisticated tests and have a rapid turnaround time of just 2-3 hours, according to the director.“AIIMS, New Delhi, is a lighthouse for the 22 new AIIMS spread across India. The students and teachers from here can help these institutes through their rich experience to replicate the success of this AIIMS throughout India,” Mandaviya said at the event.“Whenever I go to a hospital, I feel very sad to see bouncers [security personnel] where sick people come for treatment, and not to quarrel. But if they are quarrelling, then they must be angry, and this anger must be due to some lack of effort from our end. When a doctor sees the patient as a god, long queues of patients don’t bother them. In fact it this is why patients’ treatment becomes a priority,” he said.A ₹9,053 crore makeover of the institute was announced in 2019 to increase the number of beds in the hospitals to over 5,000 by 2024. The redevelopment plan was also to include ways to integrate the fragmented campus spread across five land parcels.The hospital, before the pandemic, received about 15,000 patients in its outpatient department every day. During the pandemic, the institute saw nearly 800,000 people in the OPD and 150,000 patients in the emergency department, said Dr Guleria. About 80,000 patients were admitted to the hospital, and 50,000 underwent surgeries, he added.Dr Guleria emphasised the importance of digital health and medical education. He said, “We cannot sit on our laurels; healthcare is changing rapidly. Major advances in science and technology have changed the health delivery landscape – from AI, robotics, big data analysis, tele-health, to simulation-based learning--all aspects of health are changing. To be relevant and to train the doctors of the future, we must move faster than before and embrace change. The last 18 months have taught us the immense importance of digital health and online medical education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aiims-will-have-over-3-000-beds-and-50-ots-in-seven-years-guleria-101632594140967.html
26-09-2021||Delhi||Lawyers seek security overhaul after Rohini court shootout left three dead||Judicial work was paralysed in city’s seven district court complexes on Saturday after lawyers abstained from work, demanding modification of security norms in court precincts, a day after the dramatic shootout at the Rohini court complex saw alleged gangster Jeetender Maan (known as Gogi) gunned down by two people from rival gangs, who were then shot dead by the police.Thousands of lawyers abstained from court proceedings on Saturday, which led to several cases being adjourned. The courts, however, passed orders and judgments that were scheduled for Saturday, said Sanjeev Nasiar, spokesperson of the coordination committee of the All District Bar Association.A team of lawyers also met police commissioner Rakesh Asthana on Saturday and discussed security provisions in Delhi’s courts, Nasiar said.During the day, advocate Rakesh Sehrawat, chairman of the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD), had a meeting with Asthana and pointed out security shortfalls inside the Rohini court. Sehrawat said he pointed out that metal detectors, CCTV cameras, X-ray machines were not working inside the court, and that CCTV footage from Friday showed that security personnel did not bother frisk anyone entering the court.“We saw in the footage that the security guard was not vigilant. So, we asked the CP to make a person accountable for the security lapses on Friday. We also asked how such heavily armed people could enter a courtroom and open fire during proceedings,” he said.Sehrawat said that the CP also ensured that action would be taken against the erring officers.“He gave us a positive response and called five special commissioners of police during the meeting. He also assured us that the security systems for all district courts will be upgraded to the level of Supreme Court.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said, “The Rohini district police has been in regular coordination with Rohini court administration and all other stakeholders regarding security of the court premises. Joint commissioner of police (northern range) is already enquiring into the shooting incident in the courtroom and is also conducting a review for further strengthening the court security.”Meanwhile, a plea has been moved in the Delhi high court urging it to direct authorities to take requisite measures for the safety and security of district courts in the city, a day after the shootout inside the Rohini courtroom.The petition, filed by advocate Deepa Joseph, said the Delhi courts had become unsafe for her and fellow lawyers, and are “easy terrain” for gangsters to settle scores.“This shootout inside the court again puts a big question mark on the safety and security of judges, lawyers and litigants inside the district courts in Delhi,” Joseph said.The plea sought direction to the Delhi Police and the Bar Council of Delhi to consider instructing all police personnel at court entrances to ensure they check the ID cards of every lawyer who enters a court.It also sought to direct the Delhi Police to raise security and frisking level of lawyers at par with the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court, and to take disciplinary action against the officers who fail to implement the direction with utmost diligence and seriousness.The plea, moved through lawyers Robin Raju and Blessan Mathews, said the BCD be asked to issue an advisory to all the District Bar Associations in the city to recommend members of their bar to cooperate with police personnel at the main entrance of courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-rohini-shootout-lawyers-in-delhi-abstain-from-work-demand-better-security-101632593964366.html
26-09-2021||Delhi||Forest staff, police to consider joint checks||Officials of the Delhi forest department will conduct a meeting with Delhi Police this week to discuss the possibility of forming joint inspection teams to inspect the forest lands of the Capital, senior officials said on Saturday. A senior forest department official said that they wrote to the police department to schedule a meeting this week to discuss how joint inspections can be conducted in forest areas, such as the central ridge, southern ridge, south-central ridge, Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, etc. “This will help us keep a better watch on forest areas, and prevent encroachment, illegal tree cutting and smuggling in the forests. We are looking at how we can do this with the help of the police. We will work out possibilities and then release more details,” the official said. While the Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Thursday approved a uniform code for the officials of the forest department, assigning uniforms as per their ranks and batons, the teams are still largely unequipped to handle the challenges of protecting large scale encroachment and illegal activities in the forest lands. The total recorded forest area in Delhi is 85sqkm, which is 5.73% of its total geographic area. Of this, reserved and protected forests constitute 91.76% and 8.24% of the total forest area respectively. The forest department is short-staffed and ill-equipped to manage these large forest areas, officials said. In December last year, the forest department informed the National Green Tribunal that the government had started the process to fill 226 vacant posts, including that of 211 forest guards, 11 wildlife guards and four forest rangers. The total number of posts in the department is 434 – 398 forestry staff and 36 ministerial staff. The process of training and recruiting people is still underway. Officials of the forest department said that the meeting with the Delhi Police was prompted by a violent attack on four forest department officials on Thursday at the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. The officials, who were patrolling the sanctuary around 7.30pm in two separate vehicles, were attacked by around 24-25 men carrying sticks, rods and knives. They beat the officials and damaged their vehicles. Deputy conservator forests (south division) Amit Anand said that these attacks were a result of the crackdown initiated by his teams against alcohol smuggling from Haryana to Delhi using forest routes. “Over the last two months, we have confiscated large quantities of alcohol, seized vehicles and have also dug up the regular routes that smugglers use,” Anand said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/forest-dept-to-meet-delhi-police-to-discuss-joint-inspection-of-forests-this-week-101632593960853.html
26-09-2021||Delhi||Drive to send overaged diesel vehicles directly for scrapping||In an effort to push residents to scrap overage vehicles, the Delhi transport department will launch a crackdown from Monday to identify diesel vehicles older than 15 years in the Capital and directly send them for scrapping.Delhi transport commissioner Ashish Kundra said such vehicles will be impounded and sent to the scrapping yard if they are found plying on city roads or parked in public places.According to orders passed by the National Green Tribunal in 2015 and the Supreme Court in 2018, registered diesel vehicles over 10 years old and petrol vehicles over 15 years old cannot operate in NCR. “But for now, we are starting the drive with only diesel vehicles that are above 15 years old because they are technically the oldest and the most polluting ones. As our campaign starts from Monday, we urge all owners of old diesel cars, trucks, tempos or buses that are above 15 years old to scrap their vehicles. We have eight empanelled scrappers, the list of which is available on the website of the Delhi transport department. From September 27, if our enforcement team finds any such vehicle parked in public or running in the city, it will be impounded and sent for scrapping. The money from scrapping will be given to the vehicle owner,” said Kundra.
26-09-2021||Delhi||Waive exam fees for kids in classes 10, 12 : Govt to CBSE||The Delhi government has written to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) requesting a “one-time” waiver of the examination fee of class 10 and 12 students studying in Delhi government and government-aided schools, among others, citing the pandemic-induced financial crisis.In a letter addressed to CBSE chairperson on Thursday, Director of Education Udit Prakash Rai said, “CBSE is requested to waive off the examination fee of all the students of classes 10 and 12 studying in all the government, government-aided, patrachar vidyalaya, New Delhi Municipal Council, Delhi Cantonment Board and Department of Social Welfare schools, for the current academic session 2021-22 as a one-time measure.”Rai pointed out that the “severe” economic impact of Covid-19 had led to job losses across the world: “After a long time, formal education has started once again in schools. Now, the problems regarding paying the CBSE examination fee have emerged before the parents. A number of requests have been received from parents, expressing their inability to pay examination fee due to loss of income in the ongoing pandemic.”CBSE Controller of Examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said, “This is a policy matter. If the government has written to us, it will be looked at from all angles and discussed before responding.”In 2019, CBSE hiked the board examination fee for Class 10 and 12 students in the general category in Delhi government schools from ₹375 and ₹600, respectively, to ₹1,500 for five subjects. For Class 12 students, the fee can go up to ₹2,500, including the extra amount for practicals, additional and optional subjects. For SC/ST candidates in Class 10, the examination fee was increased from ₹375 to ₹1,200, and for Class 12, from ₹600 to ₹1,200.Schools have been asked to collect exam fee and submit the list of Class 10 and 12 candidates to the board by September 30. A majority of schools in the Capital, including 1,030 Delhi government schools, are affiliated with CBSE.Before 2019, students from the SC/ST category were charged ₹50 and the remainder used to be reimbursed by the stategovernment to the board. Now, they have to pay the full fee.In 2019, the Delhi government had paid the examination fee for over 314,000 class 10 and 12 students in government schools after CBSE hiked the examination fee substantially.However, it did not pay the fee last year citing fund crunch, and this year too, students have been struggling to pay the fee on their own. Last year, Delhi government school principals and several civil society members had raised funds to help students who could not pay their own examination fee. This year too, teachers and principals of several schools across Delhi have launched crowdfunding campaigns to arrange money to pay the students’ fee.Class 12 student Kajal Soni, who studies at a government school in New Kondli, said, “The fee has increased substantially in the past two years. We are unable to pay room rent because both my parents are sick and there is no earning member at home. I told my school to strike off my name because there is no way to pay the fee when my mother is hospitalised.”Though CBSE announced on Tuesday that it would offer a fee waiver for those students who lost both their parents to Covid-19, principals and activists said this wouldn’t help all students. All India Parents’ Association has also submitted several memorandums to various authorities on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/citing-covid-crisis-delhi-govt-asks-cbse-for-one-time-class-10-12-exam-fee-waiver-101632592701897.html

Officials have set a target of collecting 28,000 samples for the survey, which began on Friday.“The sixth sero survey started in Delhi yesterday (Friday). 100 samples will be collected from 280 places – 272 municipal wards, the NDMC, and Cantonment board. This is the biggest sero survey. I think it will take about a week to collect the samples and probably another week to get the results,” said Jain in a press briefing on Saturday.Jain referred to the current round as Delhi’s sixth sero-survey as a previous survey, which began in April this year, was cut short because of the increasing surge in Covid-19 cases. The analysis of the 13,000 samples collected in that round showed a sero-positivity similar to the fifth round conducted in January, when 56.13% of the population was found to have antibodies against the virus.The fifth sero-survey too saw collection of around 28,000 samples from across the Capital.“Experts are expecting a high sero-positivity rate; we will have the answer soon,” said Jain.The minister added that although the number of cases and deaths due to Covid-19 has been under control in the city for a couple of months, people must continue wearing masks while stepping out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/results-of-delhi-s-ongoing-sero-survey-in-2-weeksjain-101632592640457.html

26-09-2021||Other||Emblems of Empowerment | Weaving her own destiny, the eco-friendly way||Owing to her father’s heart ailment, Syed Tabasum had to get married immediately after completing higher secondary school in 2003. Within five years of marriage, the couple had two children. They would have retired to a quiet family life had it not been for their younger daughter’s illness. “My husband is a government employee but we were still struggling to meet our daughter’s treatment costs,” she reveals, adding that it was then that she decided to take matters in her own hands. She enrolled herself in a polytechnic course and picked up several skills, including fabrication of garments, canvas paintings and knot-making. After the course, she started working as an instructor in the handicrafts department and trained girls in making jute accessories.But the poor working conditions, which included salary delays and frequent travels to far-off places, put her off. She decided that instead of resigning to fate, she would set up her own unit. In March 2014, she sold her jewellery and set up a jute manufacturing unit in Jawahar Nagar of Srinagar. Her family members were against the decision, but she persisted. As fate would have it, she suffered another setback. The devastating flood of September 2014 washed away all her assets. “I lost around ₹35 lakh in the flood. I neither had registration nor insurance. So I lost everything -- machines, boutique, bridal suits and raw materials,” says the woman with a never-give-up attitude, who was back on her foot the next year.“In 2015, I started again. I took loan from the department of industries and commerce and re-established the jute unit,” she reveals.In 2016, she set up another unit dealing in Kashmiri embroidery, particularly Sozni, which provides employment to around 200 girls, many of them orphans. Now in her 40s, Tabasum has emerged as a prominent eco-friendly entrepreneur in the Valley. She was awarded the best entrepreneur award in 2019 by the government of Jammu and Kashmir. “Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University also presented me with a leadership award after they saw my work during an international conference,” she says.Her textile-manufacturing unit mostly produces jute and leather products, including shopping bags, executive bags, conference bags and folders. She supplies it to universities, colleges and government departments, not just in Valley but also to Lucknow. The unit has an annual turnover of around ₹20-22 lakhs.After the pandemic outbreak, Tabasum’s unit supplied nearly 2.5 lakh masks and PPE kits to the administration.Tabasum says that those who discouraged her when she was first setting out on her journey of entrepreneurship, are now all praises for her. “Back then, everyone asked me why I was stepping out for work when I have two young children to take care of. Now, they come to me for business advice,” she says happily. Her advice to other women looking to change the course of their destiny: “Change won’t come until we take matters into our own hands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/emblems-of-empowerment-weaving-a-new-destiny-the-eco-friendly-way-101632578238587.html
26-09-2021||World||US, Pakistan face off again on Afghanistan threats||The Taliban's takeover of Kabul has deepened the mutual distrust between the US and Pakistan, putative allies who have tangled over Afghanistan. But both sides still need each other.As the Biden administration looks for new ways to stop terrorist threats in Afghanistan, it probably will look again to Pakistan, which remains critical to US intelligence and national security because of its proximity to Afghanistan and connections to the Taliban leaders now in charge.Over two decades of war, American officials accused Pakistan of playing a double game by promising to fight terrorism and cooperate with Washington while cultivating the Taliban and other extremist groups that attacked US forces in Afghanistan.Islamabad pointed to what it saw as failed promises of a supportive government in Kabul after the US drove the Taliban from power after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as extremist groups took refuge in eastern Afghanistan and launched deadly attacks throughout Pakistan.But the US wants Pakistani cooperation in counterterrorism efforts and could seek permission to fly surveillance flights into Afghanistan or other intelligence cooperation. Pakistan wants US military aid and good relations with Washington, even as its leaders openly celebrate the Taliban's rise to power.“Over the last 20 years, Pakistan has been vital for various logistics purposes for the US military. What’s really been troubling is that, unfortunately, there hasn’t been a lot of trust,” said US Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat who is on the House Intelligence Committee. “I think the question is whether we can get over that history to arrive at a new understanding.”Pakistan's prime minister, in remarks Friday to the U.N. General Assembly, made clear there is a long way to go. Imran Khan tried to portray his country as the victim of American ungratefulness for its assistance in Afghanistan over the years. Instead of a mere “word of appreciation,” Pakistan has received blame, Khan said.Former diplomats and intelligence officers from both countries say the possibilities for cooperation are severely limited by the events of the past two decades and Pakistan's enduring competition with India.The previous Afghan government, which was strongly backed by India, routinely accused Pakistan of harboring the Taliban. The new Taliban government includes officials that American officials have long believed are linked to Pakistan's spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence.Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United States, said he understood “the temptation of officials in both countries to try and take advantage of the situation” and find common ground. But Haqqani said he expected Pakistan to give “all possible cooperation to the Taliban.”“This has been a moment Pakistan has been waiting for 20 years,” said Haqqani, now at the Hudson Institute think tank. “They now feel that they have a satellite state."US officials are trying to quickly build what President Joe Biden calls an “over the horizon” capacity to monitor and stop terrorist threats.Without a partner country bordering Afghanistan, the US has to fly surveillance drones long distances, limiting the time they can be used to watch over targets. The US also lost most of its network of informants and intelligence partners in the now-deposed Afghan government, making it critical to find common ground with other governments that have more resources in the country.Pakistan could be helpful in that effort by allowing “overflight” rights for American spy planes from the Persian Gulf or permitting the US to base surveillance or counterterrorism teams along its border with Afghanistan. There are few other options among Afghanistan’s neighbors. Iran is a US adversary and Central Asian countries north of Afghanistan all face varying degrees of Russian influence.There are no known agreements so far.CIA Director William Burns visited Islamabad this month to meet with Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, Pakistan’s army chief, and Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed, who leads the ISI, according to a Pakistani government statement. Burns and Hameed have separately visited Kabul in recent weeks to meet with Taliban leaders. The CIA declined to comment on the visits.Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi noted this past week that Islamabad had cooperated with US requests to facilitate peace talks before the Taliban takeover and that it had agreed to US military requests throughout the war.“We have often been criticized for not doing enough,” Qureshi told The Associated Press on Wednesday. “But we’ve not been appreciated enough for having done what was done.”Qureshi would not directly answer whether Pakistan would allow the basing of surveillance equipment or overflight of drones.“They don’t have to be physically there to share intelligence,” he said of the US. “There are smarter ways of doing it."The CIA and ISI have a long history in Afghanistan, dating to their shared goal of arming bands of mujahedeen — “freedom fighters” — against the Soviet Union’s occupation in the 1980s. The CIA sent weapons and money into Afghanistan through Pakistan.Those fighters included Osama bin Laden. Others would become leaders of the Taliban, which emerged victorious from a civil war in 1996 and gained control of most of the country. The Taliban gave refuge to bin Laden and other leaders of al-Qaida, which launched deadly attacks on Americans abroad in 1998 and then struck the US on Sept. 11, 2001.After 9/11, the US immediately sought Pakistan’s cooperation in its fight against al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. Declassified cables published by George Washington University’s National Security Archive show officials in President George W. Bush’s administration made several demands of Pakistan, from intercepting arms shipments heading to al-Qaida to providing the US with intelligence and permission to fly military and intelligence planes over its territory.The CIA would carry out hundreds of drone strikes launched from Pakistan targeting al-Qaida leaders and others alleged to have ties to terrorist groups. Hundreds of civilians died in the strikes, according to figures kept by outside observers, leading to widespread protests and public anger in Pakistan.Pakistan continued to be accused of harboring the Taliban after the US-backed coalition drove the group from power in Kabul. And bin Laden was killed in 2011 by US special forces in a secret raid on a compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, home to the country’s military academy. The bin Laden operation led many in the US to question whether Pakistan had harbored bin Laden and angered Pakistanis who felt the raid violated their sovereignty.For years, CIA officials tried to confront their Pakistani counterparts after collecting more proof of Pakistani intelligence officers helping the Taliban move money and fighters into a then-growing insurgency in neighboring Afghanistan, said Douglas London, who oversaw the CIA’s counterterrorism operations in South Asia until 2018.“They would say, ‘You just come to my office, tell me where the location is,’” he said. “They would just usually pay lip service to us and say they couldn’t confirm the intel.”London, author of the forthcoming book “The Recruiter,” said he expected American intelligence would consider limited partnerships with Pakistan on mutual enemies such as al-Qaeda or Islamic State-Khorasan, which took responsibility for the deadly suicide attack outside the Kabul airport last month during the final days of the US evacuation.The risk, London said, is at times “your partner is as much of a threat to you as the enemy who you’re pursuing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pakistan-face-off-again-on-afghanistan-threats-101632680056893.html

26-09-2021||World||Israeli troops kill five Palestinians in West Bank gun battles||Israeli troops conducted a series of arrest raids against suspected Hamas militants across the occupied West Bank early Sunday, sparking a pair of gun battles in which five Palestinians were killed and two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded.It was the deadliest violence between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in the West Bank in several weeks. The region has seen an increase in fighting in recent months, with tensions fueled by Israeli settlement construction, heightened militant activity in the northern West Bank and the aftermath of a bloody war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip last May.The Israeli military said it had been tracking the Hamas militants for several weeks and that the raids were launched in response to immediate threats.Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the militants were about to carry out attacks “in real time.” He praised the Israeli forces, saying they acted “as expected. They engaged the enemy and we back them completely.”In a statement, the military said it launched five simultaneous raids and soldiers opened fire after being shot at in two locations. It said five militants were killed and several others were arrested.It also said an officer and a soldier were seriously injured, possibly inadvertently by Israeli fire.The Palestinian Health Ministry said two Palestinians were shot dead near the northern West Bank city of Jenin and three others were killed in Biddu, north of Jerusalem.Hamas confirmed that four of the dead, including all three killed in Biddu, were members of the Islamic militant group. Palestinian officials said a 16-year-old boy was also among the dead, though it was not immediately known if he was a militant.The Palestinian Authority, which administers semi-autonomous areas in the West Bank, condemned the killings and said the Israeli government was “fully and directly responsible for this bloody morning and the crimes committed by the occupation forces.”But Hamas also criticized the Palestinian Authority, which maintains security coordination with Israel in a shared struggle against the Islamic group.Hamas spokesman Abdulatif al-Qanou said that recent meetings between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli officials “encouraged the occupation again to pursue the resistance.”Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip after seizing it from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, praised those killed as “heroic martyrs.” It called on its supporters to “devise tactics and means that harm the enemy and drain it with all possible forms of resistance.”Also Sunday, Israel released Khalida Jarrar, a prominent Palestinian lawmaker, after nearly two years in prison. Jarrar, a senior figure in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, has been in and out of Israeli prisons for years — often without being charged.The PFLP has an armed wing and is considered a terrorist group by Israel and Western countries, but Jarrar has not been implicated in attacks. She was sentenced to two years in prison in March for membership in a banned group but given credit for time already served. She was freed several weeks before her sentence was to end.Recent months have seen a rise in violence in the West Bank, with more than two dozen Palestinians killed in sporadic clashes with Israeli troops and during protests.Many of the clashes have occurred near Beita, a Palestinian village where residents regularly demonstrate against an unauthorized settlement outpost, and near Jenin, which is known as a militant stronghold.Last month, Israeli troops clashed with Palestinian gunmen during a late night raid in Jenin, killing four Palestinians. Sunday's clashes came a week after Israel recaptured the last of six Palestinian fugitives who tunneled out of a maximum-security Israeli prison earlier this month. The escapees were from Jenin, and two were caught there after an extensive search.Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has established dozens of settlements where nearly 500,000 settlers reside. The Palestinians seek the West Bank as part of their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to resolving the conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-troops-kill-five-palestinians-in-west-bank-gun-battles-101632677781744.html
26-09-2021||World||German elections: Projections show polls are too close to call||The center-left Social Democrats lead the conservative CDU/CSU bloc by 0.2%, according to initial projected results. In such a tight race, the possibilities for a coalition are still unclear.The first projected results are in for Germany's 2021 federal election, with the the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) on 24.9%, narrowly ahead of the center-right Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party (CDU/CSU) on 24.7%. However, the conservatives are projected to win one more seat than the SPD.The environmentalist Greens were in third position on 14.8%. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) were on 11.3%, just ahead of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) on 11.2%. The socialist Left party is on 5%.The projections suggest the center-left parties were the biggest winners of the election. The SPD gained 4.5% compared to their result in the last federal election in 2017, while the Greens were up over 6%.The conservative bloc suffered heavy losses as the Angela Merkel era comes to an end. They were down by almost 8% on the previous election and are heading towards their worst result since 1949.What this meansIn such a tight race, coalition possibilities remain unclear.According to these projections, one option is a continuation of the "grand coalition" of the conservative CDU/CSU bloc and the SPD that has ruled Germany since 2013.Other options could see a three-way coalition between the CDU/CSU, the Greens and the FDP.Alternatively, the SPD could also seek to partner up with the Greens and the FDP.The election of Germany's new chancellor by the Bundestag won't take place until a governing coalition has been formed. This could take months.In the meantime, Angela Merkel will remain in office in a caretaker role.What the parties are sayingThe general secretary of the Social Democrats, Lars Klingbeil, says his party "is back again" following the release of exit polls that put the SPD in a dead heat with Merkel's conservatives."The SPD has the mandate to govern," he told public broadcaster ZDF. "We want [SPD chancellor candidate] Olaf Scholz to be chancellor."CDU chancellor candidate Armin Laschet said the conservative bloc would do "everything we can" to form a new government, despite the election setback.Greens federal political director Michael Kellner, meanwhile, expressed disappointment for his party's performance."We have clearly made gains," he told ZDF. "But it is difficult for me to be really happy about this increase."He congratulated the SPD "on a great electoral success" and called the CDU's performance "historically bad."How does the election work?The German electoral system produces coalition governments. It seeks to unite the principles of majority rule and proportional representation. Each voter casts two ballots. The first is for what is called a "direct" candidate from their constituency and the second is for a political party.Any party that gets more than 5% of the votes is guaranteed a place in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag. This ensures that both big and small parties are represented, but has led to the legislature becoming the second-biggest in the world with a possible 900 seats this time around.The reason is Germany's complicated electoral law, and the mandates for the "overhang" seats (Überhangmandate) and compensation "leveling" seats (Ausgleichsmandate) that assure the composition of the Bundestag will be proportionate to the actual votes for the parties.How long will it take to form a coalition?The process of forming could take weeks, or even months.Coalition negotiations in 2017 were the longest in German history, leaving the country without a government for almost six months. This is because the FDP walked out of talks between the CDU and the Green party after a month of negotiations. For the last eight years, the two biggest parties, the CDU and the SPD, have governed together with Angela Merkel as chancellor.It remains to be seen if the process will go quicker this time — especially if the political priorities of the partners are more closely aligned.How is the chancellor chosen?The parties put forward their candidate ahead of the election campaign. Once a new government is in place, the German president nominates a chancellor to be elected by the Bundestag. This is typically the main candidate from the senior coalition partner in the newly-formed government.To be elected, the chancellor candidate needs an absolute majority from lawmakers. So far, all chancellors, including Merkel, have been elected in the first round.Can an election be contested?In Germany, any eligible voter can contest elections. They must send a written formal objection to the election review commission with the Bundestag in Berlin within two months of election day.This commission processes all submissions. A decision is made on each individual challenge, and each objector receives feedback from the Bundestag. The entire procedure can take up to one year.To invalidate the results of a Bundestag election, an objection must meet two requirements. Firstly, there must be an electoral error that violates the Federal Election Act, the Federal Election Code, or the Constitution. Secondly, the reported electoral error would have to have an impact on the distribution of seats in the Bundestag.Objectors can also contest the findings of the election review commission and go all the way to the Federal Constitutional Court.A German national vote has never been declared invalid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-elections-projections-show-polls-are-too-close-to-call-101632677576431.html
26-09-2021||World||Technical issues resolved: Taliban urge international airlines to resume flights||The Taliban urged international airlines Sunday to resume flights to Kabul, saying all technical issues at the country's main airport have been resolved.Facilities at Kabul airport were badly damaged in the chaotic evacuation of more than 120,000 people that ended August 30 with the withdrawal of the last US troops.Since then only charter flights have been operating, although Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Iran's Mahan Air and Afghanistan's Kam Air have run a limited number of special flights.The international community is keen to hold the Taliban to their word that they will allow anyone to leave the country once commercial flights resume.At present airlines such as PIA and Kam Air are charging more than $1,200 for a one-way, 40-minute flight from Kabul to Islamabad.Also Read | Kabul Airport returns to action, plane with civilians flies outEven at that price -- the result of war insurance, according to the airlines -- the irregular flights are heavily oversubscribed.Abdul Qahar Balkhi, newly appointed spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs, said the Taliban hoped proper commercial services would resume shortly."Many Afghan citizens were stuck outside and unable to return to their homeland," he said in a statement."Moreover, many Afghan citizens who have international employment or pursue education abroad are now facing difficulties in reaching their destinations."Services at Kabul airport were restored mostly with technical help from Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/technical-issues-resolved-taliban-urge-international-airlines-to-resume-flights-101632675864313.html
26-09-2021||World||German elections: Merkel's center-right bloc sees worst result since 1949||Germany's center-left Social Democrats were locked in a very close race Sunday with outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right bloc, which is heading toward its worst result since 1949 in the country's parliamentary election, exit polls showed.Officials from both parties said they hope to lead Germany's next government and have their candidates succeed Merkel, who has been in power since 2005.An exit poll for ARD public television put voters' support at 25% each for the Social Democrats — which is putting forth outgoing Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz for chancellor — and Merkel’s Union bloc under would-be successor state governor Armin Laschet.Another exit poll for ZDF public television put the Social Democrats ahead by 26% to 24%. Both put the environmentalist Greens in third place with about 15% support. Those results would be the worst for the Union bloc in post-World War II Germany.The electoral system typically produces coalition governments but post-war Germany has never previously seen a winning party take less than the 31% of the vote that the Union won in 1949. That was also the center-right bloc's worst result until now.Given the exit poll predictions, putting together the next coalition government for Europe’s biggest economy could be a lengthy and complicated process. Merkel will remain as a caretaker leader until a new government is in place.The exit polls also put support for the business-friendly Free Democrats at 11-12% and the Left Party at 5%. The far-right Alternative for Germany party — which no other party wants to work with — was seen winning up to 11% of the vote.The general secretary of Laschet's Christian Democratic Union, Paul Ziemiak, acknowledged that his bloc had suffered “bitter losses” compared with the last election four years ago, in which it scored 32.9% of the vote. But he said it would be a “long election evening” and pointed to the possibility of a coalition with the Greens and the business-friendly Free Democrats.His Social Democrat counterpart, Lars Klingbeil, declared that his party “is back” after languishing for years in the polls and scoring only 20.5% of the vote in 2017. He said "with this, we have the mission to form a coalition.” He wouldn't say which coalition partners would be approached.Scholz could also form a coalition with the Greens and Free Democrats, if the exit polls hold up. The Greens traditionally lean toward Scholz's party and the Free Democrats toward Laschet's. In German elections, the party that finishes first is best-placed, but not guaranteed, to provide the next chancellor.The Social Democrats have been boosted by Scholz's relative popularity after a long poll slump, and by his rivals' troubled campaigns. The Greens' first candidate for chancellor, Annalena Baerbock, suffered from early gaffes and Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, struggled to motivate his party's traditional base.The Greens' general secretary, Michael Kellner, said “we gained considerably, but it’s hard for me to really enjoy it.” He noted that his party has said it prefers to work with the Social Democrats, but said “we are ready to speak with all democratic parties to see what’s possible."Another possible governing combination would be a repeat of the outgoing “grand coalition" of Germany's traditional big parties, the Union and Social Democrats, under whichever of Scholz or Laschet finishes ahead. But neither of the rivals is likely to have much appetite for that after forming an often-tense alliance for 12 of Merkel's 16 years in power.About 60.4 million people in the nation of 83 million were eligible to elect the new Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, which will elect the next head of government.Merkel won't be an easy leader to follow, for she has won plaudits for steering Germany through several major crises. Her successor will have to oversee the country's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which Germany so far has weathered relatively well thanks to large rescue programs.Laschet insists there should be no tax increases as Germany pulls out of the pandemic. Scholz and Baerbock favor tax hikes for the richest Germans, and also back an increase in the minimum wage.Germany's leading parties have significant differences in their proposals for tackling climate change. Laschet’s Union bloc is pinning its hopes on technological solutions and a market-driven approach, while the Greens want to ramp up carbon prices and end the use of coal earlier than planned. Scholz has emphasized the need to protect jobs as Germany transitions to greener energy.Foreign policy did not feature much in the campaign, although the Greens favor a tougher stance toward China and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-elections-merkel-s-center-right-bloc-sees-worst-result-since-1949-101632675696955.html

The speech went viral on social media as many termed this fake news. Imran Khan, in his speech, also mentioned that this is "according to some reports".Here is what Imran Khan said: "Pakistan and the United States trained mujahideen groups to fight for the liberation of Afghanistan. Amongst those mujahideen groups was al Qaeda, various groups from all over the world. There were mujahideen, Afghan mujahideen. These were considered heroes. President Ronald Reagan invited them to the White House in 1983. And according to a news item, he compared them to the founding fathers of the United States. They were heroes," Imran Khan said.PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif said that the video puts all doubts to rest that Imran Khan always trusted fake news over facts. "The embarrassing gaffe about President Reagan's remarks on Afghan Mujahideen has cemented his incompetence and shows his ignorance," Shehbaz Sharif wrote on Twitter. If there was any doubt left that PM has always trusted fake news over facts, it was laid to rest. The embarrassing gaffe about President Reagan's remarks on Afghan Mujahideen has cemented his incompetence & shows his ignorance.Maryam Nawaz Sharif commented that Imran Khan, instead of his speechwriter, should be fired.

There is anguish over the rising rate of unemployment and the hike in prices of day-to-day items in the three years since the PTI has been in power,” she further said.On Friday, speaking at the launch of the Digital Media Development Programme, Khan claimed that during his tenure, 70 per cent of media content was against his government. “We are not affected by the free judiciary and free media as our administration is not corrupt and not breaking any laws at all,” he was quoted as saying by Dawn.The Pakistan prime minister also said that the extent to which the media enjoyed freedom under him could be gauged by the number of channels that are “anti-government” and “pro-government” since 2018, when he was elected to the top post.Hence, the PTI’s founder-chairperson said that his government was the first to give “complete freedom” to the media.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/left-no-chance-to-control-ppp-slams-imran-khan-s-comment-on-media-freedom-101632651679133.html
26-09-2021||World||Kabul residents struggling due to price rise, medicine shortage under Taliban rule: Report||Residents of Kabul, Afghanistan's capital city, are facing issues such as rising food and fuel prices, shortage of medicines, restrictions on cash withdrawal etc. under the Taliban regime post its August 15 power grab in the country, according to a report by Russia's TASS news agency.The rise in food prices in Afghanistan, TASS said, is due to imports from the neighbouring Pakistan and Iran. “Flour prices up by 30 per cent, vegetable costs up by 50 per cent. It is difficult to find certain cereals, while many require pharmaceuticals,” a resident of the Afghan capital was quoted as saying.Fuel prices, too, have risen significantly, another Kabul resident, a driver, said. “Gasoline prices have increased by 20 to 40 per cent as against those during early August,” the driver said, referring to the time when the Ashraf Ghani-led government was still in power, though it was under tremendous pressure from Taliban forces advancing rapidly towards the city. “People who support their daily needs by driving taxis and small shuttle buses hardly earn anything because of the fuel price hike,” he further said.Restrictions imposed on withdrawal of cash from banks have led to further complications, the reported stated. Not more than 20,000 Afghanis (national currency) can be withdrawn from banks, the regime has ruled.“The issue of survival is now at the forefront, and the threat of misery is the primary cause of our despair,” yet another resident said.This is for the second time when the Taliban has come to power in the war-torn nation. Its' first rule, from 1996 to 2001, ended at the hands of the US-led forces which arrived here following the 9/11 attacks. The United States completed the pullout of all its troops in Afghanistan on August 30, a day before self-imposed August 31 deadline. (With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-residents-struggling-due-to-price-rise-medicine-shortage-under-taliban-report-101632647112663.html

26-09-2021||World||World Environmental Health Day 2021: History, significance of day dedicated to our surroundings||Since 2011, September 26 is observed annually as World Environmental Health Day across the globe. It was established that year by the International Federation of Environmental Health (IFEH), a body of 44 member states, with a goal to raise awareness regarding the health of our environment.Every year, the occasion is marked under a special theme, with that for the current edition being “Prioritising environmental health for healthier communities in the global recovery.” The “global recovery” here refers to that from the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The theme is based on the “Manifesto for a healthy recovery from Covid-19” which was released by the World Health Organization on May 26, 2020, and which, according to IFEH, is based on six key ideas.Speaking ahead of World Environmental Health Day, 2021, Susana Paixao, who heads the IFEH, said, “It is necessary for the world to understand that there is an integral connection between the environment, health and economy. Hence, it becomes important to invest in healthy and green recovery, close to all communities, with support from the environmental health workforce, and in collaboration with our organisation. This is how we selected the theme for this year.”Meanwhile, the tagline for September 26 last year was “Environmental health, a key public health intervention in disease pandemic prevention.”As always, various events will take place across the world in connection with the occasion, with the environmental body urging national governments to hold programmes to mark the day. The central theme behind the celebrations is to determine and minimise factors that contribute to the deterioration of environmental health.Headquartered in London, the IFEH was established in 1986. Its work is focused on scientific and technical research on environmental health, and exchange of ideas on the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-environmental-health-day-2021-history-significance-of-day-dedicated-to-our-surroundings-101632626391388.html
26-09-2021||World||Russia in sync with US, China, Pakistan on Taliban issue; working to ensure promises are kept||Russia, China, Pakistan, and the United States are working together to ensure that Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers keep their promises, especially to form a genuinely representative government and prevent extremism from spreading, Russia's foreign minister said Saturday.Sergey Lavrov said the four countries are in ongoing contact. He said representatives from Russia, China, and Pakistan recently traveled to Qatar and then to Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, to engage with both the Taliban and representatives of “secular authorities” — former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, who headed the ousted government's negotiating council with the Taliban.Lavrov said the interim government announced by the Taliban does not reflect “the whole gamut of Afghan society — ethnoreligious and political forces — so we are engaging in contacts. They are ongoing.”The Taliban have promised an inclusive government, a more moderate form of Islamic rule than when they last ruled the country from 1996 to 2001 including respecting women's rights, providing stability after 20 years of war, fighting terrorism and extremism, and stopping militants from using their territory to launch attacks. But recent moves suggest they may be returning to more repressive policies, particularly toward women and girls.“What's most important ... is to ensure that the promises that they have proclaimed publicly to be kept,” Lavrov said. “And for us, that is the top priority.”At a wide-ranging news conference and in his speech afterward at the UN General Assembly, Lavrov criticized the Biden administration including for its hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan.He said the US and Nato pullout “was carried out without any consideration of the consequences ... that there are many weapons left in Afghanistan.”It remains critical, he said, that such weapons aren't used for “destructive purposes.”Later, in his assembly speech, Lavrov accused the United States and its Western allies of “persistent attempts to diminish the UN's role in resolving the key problems of today or to sideline it or to make it a malleable tool for promoting someone's selfish interests."As an example, Lavrov said Germany and France recently announced the creation of an Alliance For Multilateralism “even though what kind of structure could be more multilateral than the United Nations?”The United States is also sidestepping the UN, he said, pointing to the recent US announcement of a “Summit for Democracy" despite, Lavrov said, US President Joe Biden's pledge this week “that the US is not seeking a world divided into opposing blocs.”“It goes without saying that Washington is going to choose the participants by itself, thus hijacking the right to decide to what degree a country meets the standards of democracy,” Lavrov said.“Essentially, this initiative is quite in the spirit of a Cold War, as it declares a new ideological crusade against all dissenters.”Lavrov was asked for Russia's reaction to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' warning last week that the world could be plunged into a new Cold War potentially more dangerous than the lengthy one between the US and the former Soviet Union unless the United States and China repair their “totally dysfunctional” relationship.He replied: “Of course, we see the tension tightening in relations between China and the United States." He expressed “great concern" at the rising tensions, pointing to the Biden administration's recently proclaimed Indo-Pacific strategy — whose objectives, he said, include “deterring China's development,” disputes over the South China Sea, and the recent US-Britain deal to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.More broadly, Lavrov said, relations among the big powers must be “respectful." He emphasized that Russia was “keen to ensure that never will these relations morph into nuclear war.”The major powers have a “great responsibility,” he said, to negotiate and make compromises on the critical issues facing the world and that Russia is now “revitalizing” its proposal for a summit of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council — Russia, China, US, UK, and France. He said discussions are underway on specific questions for an agenda, and “we may perhaps begin with an online meeting.”On other global issues, the United States has been pressing for Iran to resume nuclear negotiations, but Lavrov said it was then-President Donald Trump who pulled the US out of the nuclear agreement, so to declare that “time is running out, anybody could say this — but not Washington.”In his first speech to the General Assembly earlier this week, new Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi criticized the United States but appeared not to rule out a return to the negotiating table for the nuclear accord, saying Iran considers talks useful if their ultimate outcome is the lifting of all sanctions. Still, he stated: “We don't trust the promises made by the US government.”Lavrov said Russia would like to see the resumption of negotiations to restore the original agreement as soon as possible. “We have a very serious hope -- and I think this is well-founded optimism -- that we will achieve results," he said, because “this is something everybody wants."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-in-sync-with-us-china-pakistan-on-taliban-issue-working-to-ensure-promises-are-kept-101632621344619.html
26-09-2021||World||US: Seattle-Chicago Amtrak train derails in Montana; at least 3 dead, several injured||At least three people were killed on Saturday afternoon when an Amtrak train that runs between Seattle and Chicago derailed in north-central Montana, an official with the Liberty County Sheriff's Office said.Dispatcher Starr Tyler told The Associated Press that three people died in the derailment. She did not have more details. Amtrak said in a statement that there were multiple injuries.The Empire Builder train derailed at 4 p.m. near Joplin, a town of about 200, Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams said in a statement. The accident scene is about 150 miles (241 kilometers) north of Helena and about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the border with Canada.The train had about 147 passengers and 13 crew members onboard, Abrams said.Megan Vandervest, a passenger on the train who was going to visit a friend in Seattle, told The New York Times that she was awakened by the derailment.“My first thought was that we were derailing because, to be honest, I have anxiety and I had heard stories about trains derailing,” said Vandervest, who is from Minneapolis.“My second thought was that's crazy. We wouldn't be derailing. Like, that doesn't happen.”She told the Times that the car behind hers was tilted over, the one behind that was entirely tipped over, and the three cars behind that “had completely fallen off the tracks and were detached from the train.”Speaking from the Liberty County Senior Center, where passengers were being taken, Vandervest said it felt like “extreme turbulence on a plane.”Amtrak was working with the local authorities to transport injured passengers and safely evacuate all other passengers, Abrams added.Photos posted to social media showed several cars on their sides. Passengers were standing alongside the tracks, some carrying luggage.The images showed sunny skies, and it appeared the accident occurred along a straight section of tracks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-seattle-chicago-amtrak-train-derails-in-montana-several-injured-101632621000487.html
26-09-2021||World||Taliban hang up kidnappers’ bodies in public in Herat||Taliban authorities in the western Afghan city of Herat killed four alleged kidnappers and hung their bodies up in public to deter others, a local government official said on Saturday.Sher Ahmad Ammar, deputy governor of Herat, said the men had kidnapped a businessman and his son and intended to take them out of the city when they were seen by patrols that set up checkpoints around the city.An exchange of gunfire ensued in which all four were killed, while one Taliban soldier was wounded. “Their bodies were brought to the main square and hung up in the city as a lesson for other kidnappers,” he said. The two kidnapping victims were released unharmed, he said.Herat resident Mohammad Nazir said he had been shopping for food near the city’s Mostofiat Square when he heard a loudspeaker announcement calling for people’s attention. “When I stepped forward, I saw they had brought a body in a pickup truck, then they hung it up on a crane.”Footage of the bloodstained corpse, swinging on the crane was widely shared on social media, showing a note pinned to the man’s chest saying, “This is the punishment for kidnapping”.No other bodies were visible but social media posts said others were hung up in other parts of the city. According to the official Bakhtar news agency, eight kidnappers were also arrested in a separate incident in Uruzgan province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-hang-up-kidnappers-bodies-in-public-in-herat-101632598861753.html
26-09-2021||World||Pakistan hits out at America at UN over fallout of its ‘war on terror’||Prime Minister Imran Khan sought to cast Pakistan as the victim of American ungratefulness and international double standards in his address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Friday.In a pre-recorded speech aired during the evening, the Pakistani prime minister touched upon a range of topics that included the climate crisis, global Islamophobia and “the plunder of the developing world by their corrupt elites” - the latter of which he likened to what the East India Company did to India.The cricketer-turned-politician was indignant and plaintive as he painted the United States as a country that abandoned both Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan.“For the current situation in Afghanistan, for some reason, Pakistan has been blamed for the turn of events, by politicians in the United States and some politicians in Europe,” Khan said. “From this platform, I want them all to know, the country that suffered the most, apart from Afghanistan, was Pakistan when we joined the US war on terror after 9/11 (the 2001 terror attacks in the US).”He launched into a narrative that began with the US and Pakistan training “mujahideen” - regarded as heroes by the likes of then US president Ronald Reagan, he said - during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. But Pakistan was left to pick up the pieces - millions of refugees and new sectarian militant groups - when the Soviets and the Americans left in 1989.Khan said the US sanctioned its former partner a year later, but then came calling again after the 9/11 attacks. Khan said Pakistan’s help to the US cost 80,000 Pakistani lives and caused internal strife and dissent directed at the state, all while the US conducted drone attacks.“So, when we hear this at the end. There is a lot of worry in the US about taking care of the interpreters and everyone who helped the US,” he said, referring to Afghanistan. “What about us?” Instead of a “word of appreciation”, Pakistan has only received blame, Khan rued.Myanmar won’t address, but Afghanistan willNo representative from Myanmar is scheduled to address the General Assembly, a UN spokesman said on Friday, amid rival claims for the country’s UN seat in New York after a military coup ousted the elected government.Competing claims have also been made on Afghanistan’s UN seat after the Taliban seized power last month. The ambassador for the ousted Afghan government is set to give his speech on Monday.“At this point, Myanmar is not speaking,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Myanmar’s current UN ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun - appointed by Aung San Suu Kyi’s ousted government - had initially been expected to address the General Assembly on Monday.But diplomats said China, Russia and the US had reached an understanding, where Moscow and Beijing will not object to Kyaw Moe Tun remaining in Myanmar’s UN seat for the moment as long as he does not speak during the meeting.Dujarric said that “for now, the Afghanistan representative inscribed on the list for Monday is Mr. Ghulam M. Isaczai”. Isaczai is the current United Nations ambassador, who represents Afghanistan’s government that was recently ousted by the Taliban group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-hits-out-at-america-at-un-over-fallout-of-its-war-on-terror-101632598538820.html
26-09-2021||World||Nations backing terror must know it’ll hurt them too: PM||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday cautioned the UN General Assembly (UNGA) about countries with “regressive thinking” that are using terrorism as a “political tool” and called for efforts to ensure no country takes advantage of the “delicate situation” in Afghanistan for “its own selfish interests”. He did not name any county, but he was clearly pointing to Pakistan.Addressing the UNGA in Hindi, Narendra Modi called for the protection of oceans and ocean resources from the “race for expansion and exclusion” saying they must be used and not abused and they are a lifeline of international trade.

26-09-2021||India||SKM-called Bharat Bandh today to mark one year of 3 farm laws||The 10-hour Bharat Bandh on Monday may disrupt road and rail traffic in states ruled by opposition parties as they are supporting the call for a general strike by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a collective of over 30 farmer organisations protesting the three farm laws. In the states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), elaborate security arrangements have been made to prevent farmer bodies and opposition parties to disrupt normal life. Additional security forces have been deployed in all districts in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Bihar.The strike will start at 6am and end at 4pm. “More than 605 farmers have been martyred, including two deaths related to police brutalities. The Modi government is behaving in an extremely undemocratic and inhuman way against farmers, and BJP will certainly bear the consequences of this,” SKM said in a statement on Sunday.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal on Sunday asked all state party chiefs to join the Bharat Bandh. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati extended her party’s support. In Kerala, the Left parties have called for a complete shutdown along with the Congress. In West Bengal, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for the strike and has asked police to ensure there are no untoward incidents.In Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Congress will protest at district headquarters against the Centre refusing to withdraw the three farm laws notified a year ago. In several states, various labour, lawyer and traders bodies have extended support to the call for a general strike. The biggest impact of the strike is expected in Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh, which have been at the centre of the 10-month long farmer protest. Farmer bodies in Meerut said committees have been formed to block traffic at every state and national highway in Uttar Pradesh. Bharatiya Kisan Union’s media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said national highways would be blocked at 14 places in Bijnor, eight places in Meerut, three places in Ghaziabad, 10 places in Muzaffarnagar and in various places in other districts across Uttar Pradesh. “We are committed to ensuring there is no law and order problem in the state during the bandh.

In the two states, all political parties except BJP are supporting the strike and have asked workers to ensure that it is successful. In Haryana, protests are planned at the Delhi-Ambala rail link and national highway, apart from the ones at all district headquarters. In Rajasthan, farmers have requested all market associations and traders keep the markets closed, said Sanjay Madhav, spokesperson of SKM. “Besides farmers and traders’ organisations, the Left and Congress are supporting the bandh,” he said.In Bihar, authorities have instructed all superintendents of police (SPs) in districts to take prompt action against protestors disrupting road and rail traffic or blocking roads that cause inconvenience to commuters. Lawbreakers would be dealt with firmly, said JS Gangawar, additional director general of police (headquarter). “All SPs have been directed to take action against protestors and ensure that law and order is maintained,” he said. All political parties in West Bengal, including the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and except the BJP, are supporting the strike. “Our government does not support bandhs, but the TMC fully supports the issue. The Centre must withdraw the three draconian farm laws immediately,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is contesting the September 30 assembly bypoll at Bhawanipore in Kolkata. The Tripura government-imposed curfew in East and West Agartala areas from September 21 till November 4 to prevent any procession or meetings during the period, even though SKM has given a call to disrupt traffic.In Odisha, Congress and Left unions will try to disrupt rail traffic. State government officials have been asked to attend office by Santosh Bala, special secretary, home.The strike is not expected to have an impact in Goa, Gujarat, most parts of Maharashtra, Assam, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skmcalled-bharat-bandh-today-to-mark-one-year-of-3-farm-laws-101632678642208.html

26-09-2021||India||Jharkhand CM Soren leads delegation to meeting with Shah||An all-party delegation from Jharkhand led by chief minister Hemant Soren met home minister Amit Shah on Sunday and demanded that a caste-based census be conducted in the country.The visit came close on the heels of the Centre telling the Supreme Court that a caste census of backward classes is “administratively difficult and cumbersome” and excluding such information from the purview of Census is a “conscious policy decision.”The delegation led by Soren included the Congress’ Jharkhand unit president Rajesh Thakur, BJP state president and Rajya Sabha member Deepak Prakash, Congress’ legislature party leader Alamgir Alam, AJSU president and ex-deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahato, RJD leader Satyanand Bhoka and representatives of all other parties from the state.“All of us met Home Minister Amit Shah and urged him to ensure that a caste-based census is conducted. We apprised him of our state’s sentiments in support of the caste census,” Soren told reporters after the meeting.The Congress’ state president said the Union home minister gave the delegation a patient hearing and assured that he will “look into the matter”.BJP’s Deepak Prakash evaded a direct reply to reporters question as to whether his party supports caste-census.“The BJP was also part of this all-party delegation. We all know that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government is a well-wisher of the people belonging to backward classes.“The Modi government gave constitutional status to the OBC Commission and also provided for 27 per cent quota to OBCs in medical and dental colleges. The BJP and its government stand by the people belonging to backward classes,” he said.Prakash added that his party is consistently working for the welfare of the OBCs.CPI-ML leader Vinod Singh, CPI’s Buvaneshwar Mahato, CPI-M’s Suresh Munda NCP MLA Kamlesh Singh and MCC leader Arup Chatterjee were also part of the all-party delegation led by Soren.Soren handed over to Shah a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that a caste-based demographic survey be carried out during the proposed 2021 census. The letter was signed by all members of the delegation.It stated, “Due to lack of caste data in census surveys conducted since Independence, people from backward classes are facing difficulties in getting special benefits.””In the proposed census in 2021, the Union government has informed Parliament through a written record that it will not conduct caste census, which is very unfortunate,” it said and underlined it is unfair for people belonging to the backward and extremely backward classes and they are not able to make the expected progress.”If caste census is not conducted now, then neither educational, nor social, political or economic conditions of the backward/extremely backward castes will be properly assessed. This will hamper the formulation of a right policy for their betterment.”In the letter, the all-party delegation said a caste-based census will help remove disparities in society.“In India, people belonging to SC, ST and Backward Classes have faced the brunt of economic and social backwardness for centuries. After Independence, different classes have developed at varied pace as a result of which the gap between rich and poor has widened.”The delegation noted in the letter that economic inequality in India has “a very strong” relationship with caste. Generally, those in the socially backward category are also economically backward, they said.“In such a situation, caste-based data is needed to remove these disparities. By conducting the caste-based census, there will be many benefits in the policy-making of the country,” the letter added.The Centre had a couple of days back filed an affidavit in the apex court saying it has already issued a notification in January last year prescribing the series of information to be collected during Census 2021 and it covers many areas including the information relating to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes but does not refer to any other category of caste.It said the exclusion of information regarding any other caste from the purview of Census is a “conscious policy decision” taken by the Central government.Enumeration of OBCs/BCCs (Backward Class of Citizens) has been always adjudged to be administratively “extremely complex” and even when Census of castes were taken in the pre-independence period, the data suffered in respect of completeness and accuracy, the affidavit stated.The government has also stated that the caste enumeration in Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011 was “fraught” with mistakes and inaccuracies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-cm-soren-leads-delegation-to-meeting-with-shah-101632677741827.html
26-09-2021||India||PM Modi visits construction site of new Parliament building||Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the construction site of the new Parliament building in New Delhi on Sunday evening and spent almost an hour at the site, inspecting the ongoing constructions, news agency ANI reported.The new Parliament building is expected to be completed by November 2022, just in time for the Winter Session next year, officials have projected. Along with this, Central Vista avenue is also being redeveloped and is expected to be completed just in time for the G-20 summit for world leaders. These projects, a flagship scheme of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre, have been subjected to much criticism.The new Parliament building is expected to cost around Rs.971 crore, and till the beginning of August a total of Rs.238 crore has been spent on it, the Union government told Parliament during the monsoon session. The Central Vista revamp is expected to cost around Rs.608 crore, with ₹301 crore being spent till August. Documents accessed by the Hindustan Times in the past have shown that the government aims to complete construction for the new Parliament building and the Vice President’s residence first.The Prime Minister's visit comes a week after he inaugurated the defence office complexes of the Central Vista project at Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Africa Avenue that will together accommodate more than 7,000 defence officials, on September 16.He also hit out at the critics of this project, saying that those who are forcefully opposing the Central Vista project will very cleverly stay quiet on this aspect of the project that offices have been created for 7,000 defence officials because they know that their agenda of spreading lies will be exposed. "But today the country is seeing what we are doing under the project," he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prime-minister-narendra-modi-visits-construction-site-of-new-parliament-building-101632676494203.html
26-09-2021||India||Trinamool Congress likely to formally announce entry into Goa on Monday||The re-entry of the Trinamool Congress into Goa’s political landscape is likely to be formally announced on Monday with former Goa Chief Minister and former Goa Congress President Luizinho Faleiro scheduling a press meet “to make an important announcement”. Faleiro, who has been heavily linked with a move to lead a breakaway group of Congressmen, had earlier remained tight-lipped on his political plans only revealing that he had met members of the Indian Political Action Committee (IPAC) led by political strategist Prashant Kishor as part of their regular surveys in Goa. Faleiro, it is understood, is upset with the decision of the Congress high command to stick with the incumbent state Congress president Girish Chodankar, who succeeded him back in 2017. Late last week, Congress members loyal to Faleiro, as if on cue, addressed the media to say that their leader was treated shabbily by the Congress party. “In 2017 we came to a figure of 17 under Luizinho’s leadership plus one independent. On the night of the counting we had 21 MLAs with us. A letter was made ready to be given to the Governor to stake claim to form the government. Digvijay Singh who was in-charge stopped the letter from being given to the Governor. He wanted at least 24. Digvijay and Chella Kumar stopped Luizinho from giving the letter. All these repeated insults, humiliation must be working on him. I do not know what his decision is. Evidently, he is not happy with what is happening in the Congress,” Agnelo Fernandes, a former MLA and Faleiro loyalist said. He went on to allege that the Congress was manipulated by one or two people. “Loyalists are being side-lined. This might lead to a revolt. Anything can happen. If leaders like this are on the side-lines, for how long can you take this humiliation? People of Goa had given a mandate when Luizinho was president of the party. Those people who demanded his resignation in 24 hours have quit the Congress and joined the BJP,” Fernandes added. Similarly, Surendra Furtado, a former mayor of Panaji too alleged that the Congress was being controlled by a close group of a few people and loyalists were being side-lined. The TMC’s entry into Goa’s political space is likely to further splinter an already crowded political space in Goa. Besides the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress, the Goa Forward Party with three MLA, the NCP and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) with one MLA each are also vying for a slice of power. Besides the MGP, which competes with the BJP for largely the same set of voters, the other political parties are likely to vie for what has traditionally been the Congress vote share. Added to the mix is the Aam Aadmi Party, the Shiv Sena, Goencho Avaaz, a group of civil society activists who have announced plans to contest the upcoming polls, the Revolutionary Goans, a group of youthful activists seeking Goa be reserved for Goans have also announced plans to contest the upcoming polls. Trinamool MLA Derek O’Brien was in Goa over the weekend and announced that the party was “very serious” about contesting the upcoming polls in Goa but didn’t divulge any detailed plans.This will be the second time the TMC enters Goa having unsuccessfully contested the 2012 assembly elections, under the leadership of Dr Wilfred de Souza, a former Chief Minister. The party also unsuccessfully contested one of Goa’s two Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-congress-likely-to-formally-announce-entry-into-goa-on-monday-101632676540150.html

In the states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), elaborate security arrangements have been made to prevent the farmer bodies and opposition political parties from disrupting normal life. Additional security forces have been deployed in all districts in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Bihar to prevent any law and order issues.The Bandh will be in force from 6 am to 4 pm on Monday. “More than 605 farmers have been martyred, including two deaths related to police brutalities. The Modi government is behaving in an extremely undemocratic and inhuman way against farmers, and BJP will certainly bear the consequences of this,” the SKM said in a statement on Sunday.On Sunday, Congress general secretary KC Venugopal asked all its state party chiefs to join Bharat Bandh. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati extended her party’s support. In Kerala, the Left parties have called for a complete shutdown along with Congress. In West Bengal, chief minister Mamata Banerjee supported the bandh and has asked police to ensure that there is no untoward incident.In Tamil Nadu, the DMK and the Congress would hold protests at district headquarters against the Centre refusing to withdraw the three farm laws notified a year ago. In several states, various labour, lawyer and traders bodies have extended support to the call.However, the biggest impact of the bandh is expected in Haryana, Punjab, parts of Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh, which had been an epicentre of the 10-month long farmer protest. Farmer bodies in Meerut said that committees have been formed to block traffic at every state and national highway in Uttar Pradesh. Bharatiya Kisan Union’s media in charge Dharmendra Malik said the national highways would be blocked at 14 places in Bijnor, 8 places in Meerut, three places in Ghaziabad, 10 places in Muzaffarnagar and also other districts across the state. “We are committed to ensuring that no law and order problem takes place in the state during the Bandh. All arrangements have been done and different police units have been put on alert in advance,” UP police Additional Director General, Law and Order Prashant Kumar said. The bandh is not likely to have much impact on the rest of Uttar Pradesh.In Punjab and Haryana, the farmer bodies have announced that they would block all national and state highways and will not allow trains to run. In the two states, all political parties, except BJP, have supported the bandh call and have asked workers to ensure bandh is successful. In Haryana, major protests are planned at the Delhi-Ambala rail line and national highway in Ambala, apart from ones at all district headquarters. In Rajasthan, spokesperson, Sanyukt Kissan Morcha, Sanjay Madhav said all the market associations, traders and others are appealed to keep the markets shut. “Besides farmers and traders organisations, the Left and the Congress are supporting the bandh,” he said, adding that the protest will continue till the demands are met, even after the Bandh.In Bihar, the police have instructed all SPs in districts to take prompt action against protestors disrupting road and rail traffic or putting up road blockades causing inconvenience to commuters. Additional director general of Police (headquarter), JS Gangawar, said lawbreakers would be dealt with firmly. “All SPs have been directed to take action against protestors and ensure that law and order is maintained,” he said. All political parties in West Bengal, except BJP, supported the bandh call. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday denounced the call for Bharat Bandh by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws on September 27, saying disrupting economic activities post Covid-19 was not in the interest of the nation.People have just now started performing various tasks after suffering for one-and-half years due to the pandemic, he said. “They have started their business activities. It is our duty to make sure that people should not face hardship,” Bommai told reporters.“Our government does not support bandhs but the TMC fully supports the issue. The Centre must withdraw the three draconian farm laws immediately,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is contesting the September 30 assembly bypoll at Bhawanipore in Kolkata. The Tripura government imposed Section 144 in East and West Agartala areas from September 21 till November 4 to prevent any procession or meeting during the period even though Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has given a call to disrupt traffic.In Odisha, Congress and the Left union have given a rail roko call across the state. Special secretary home Santosh Bala has asked all employees working in Lok Seva Bhawan, Kharavela Bhawan, Rajiv Bhawan and in the Heads of Department Building of Bhubaneswar to reach Office latest by 9.30 am as gates would close by 10.15 am.The bandh is not expected to have an impact in Goa, Gujarat, most parts of Maharashtra, Assam, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-on-monday-road-and-rail-traffic-disruptions-likely-101632671742329.html
26-09-2021||India||Bharat Bandh: Will shops, markets, banks remain closed tomorrow?||In the 10-month-long ongoing protest of the farmers against the three farm laws passed by Parliament exactly a year ago, the protesting farmers have called for several Bharat bandhs, chakka strike and other types of protest. Apart from the Republic Day tractor rally of the protesting farmers, the earlier all-India strikes called by the farmers have remained peaceful. However, the Bharat Bandh on September 27 is going to be a major one as it marks the one year of President Ram Nath Kovind's assent for the three agriculture laws. But the Samyukt Kisan Morcha has said no force will be deployed.In its statement, the farmers' organisation said that between 6am to 4pm, central and state government offices, markets, shops, factories, schools, colleges and other educational institutions will not be allowed to function. Private and public transport are also to be affected. However, the impact will vary from state to state as several political parties have supported tomorrow's bandh.Will shops, markets be closed?Traders, shopkeepers are not part of the bandh, Bhartiya Udyog Vyapaar Mandal has said. Hence, markets are not likely to be closed. However, in states where state governments are supporting the Bharat Bandh, the impact is likely to be intense.Kerala to come to a standstill as LDF, UDF support bandhLeft parties and the Congress have supported the Bharat bandh. Kerala is likely to come to a standstill as it has the support of both the LDF and the UDF, INTUC state president R Chandrasekharan told PTI.No APSRTC bus to ply in Andhra PradeshThe Andhra Pradesh government has supported the strike and decided to stop the APSRTC bus service from tonight to tomorrow evening.No emergency service will be stalled during the bandh markets are likely to remain open in states where the bandh will not be observed at full force. However, as trade unions have supported the strike, disruptions are likely in transport services. All India Bank Officers Confederation has also decided to join the bandh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-will-shops-markets-banks-remain-closed-tomorrow-101632670976185.html

26-09-2021||India||Amit Shah holds meet with CMs; sets 1-year deadline to end Maoist violence||In a bid to end Left Wing Extremism in Maoist-affected states, Union home minister Amit Shah asked chief ministers of the states facing Maoist insurgencies to take steps to ensure that the problem can be eradicated within a year.He said that there should be a joint strategy to choke the flow of funds to Maoist insurgent groups. Shah was addressing the chief ministers of Odisha, Telangana, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Jharkhand.The home minister said that the fight against the Maoist groups is now in its final stages and a decisive move must be made to end the insurgencies. He said the death toll due to Left Wing Extremism violence dropped to 200 in a year. He urged all chief ministers to take the issue on priority for the next year so that a permanent solution can be found to the problem.The meeting was attended by chief ministers Naveen Patnaik (Odisha), K Chandrashekar Rao (Telangana), Nitish Kumar (Bihar), Shivraj Singh Chouhan (Madhya Pradesh), Uddhav Thackeray (Maharashtra) and Hemant Soren (Jharkhand). Union ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw, Giriraj Singh, Arjun Munda and Nityananda Rai also were present.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan did not attend the meeting. These states were represented by either a minister or senior officials.‘Neutralise their source of income’Amit Shah said that there should be efforts in neutralising the sources of income of the Maoist groups. He suggested that building pressure, increasing speed and better coordination among Centre and state governments could help achieve this objective.Shah discussed means of intensifying operations against the Maoists, action against their frontal organisations, filling up the security vacuum, choking the flow of funds to extremists and concerted action by the Enforcement Directorate, the National Investigation Agency and the state police, people familiar with the developments told news agency PTI.He suggested that regular review meetings be conducted at a chief ministerial, chief secretary level and the DGP level, which could help in resolving several problems. He said the Centre is optimistic of reducing the menace to an insignificant level at the earliest.Record drop in incidents of violenceAmit Shah highlighted that incidents of Maoist violence have come down by 70% from an all-time high of 2,258 in 2009 to 665 in 2020. He said deaths also dropped by 82% from an all-time high of 1,005 in 2010 to 183 in 2020. Shah said that areas under Maoists' influence also dropped with its geographical spread shrinking from 96 districts in 2010 to just 53 in 2020.Amit Shah said the elimination of Maoist insurgency is necessary for spreading democracy to every level and developing underdeveloped areas.“Instead of being satisfied with what we have achieved so far, we need to increase the speed to get what is left,” Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-holds-meet-with-cms-sets-1-year-deadline-to-end-maoist-violence-101632668751270.html
26-09-2021||India||HT This Day: September 27, 2018 — Aadhaar Public, Limited||A majority judgment of a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, but restricted its use to government welfare schemes funded by the Consolidated Fund of India, in a verdict that the government and the Opposition immediately owned.The judgment, however, scrapped, wrote down, or amended key clauses in the UIDAI Act to protect the rights of individuals and prevent misuse of their details, ensuring a partial victory for petitioners.Bank accounts and mobile phone numbers now no longer need to be linked to Aadhaar; and transaction details will now only be kept for six months, as against five years as the law originally mandated.Both the majority and the minority judgments also said decisions of the Speaker could be reviewed judicially, a response to one petition against the government’s definition of the UIDAI bill as a money bill, thereby ensuring that it needed to be passed only by the Lok Sabha, where the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has a majority.The majority judgment, however, refused to overturn the government’s decision to define this bill as a money bill.The five-judge Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra in a 4:1 verdict also added that children cannot be denied school admissions for want for Aadhaar, and asked for ways to deal with exclusions, but said the number would be required for filing income-tax returns, making it necessary to link it with PAN cards.Justice AK Sikri, who authored the main verdict on behalf of CJI Misra and justice AM Khanwilkar, held: “The whole architecture of Aadhaar is devised to give unique identity to the citizens of this country.”Human dignity, he said, is to be treated as a fundamental right and the scheme envisaged under Aadhaar ensures dignity to the marginalised sections of society.“This facet of dignity cannot be lost sight of and needs to be acknowledged,” he said.The court also struck down section 57 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, that permitted corporate entities such as telecom companies to avail biometric Aadhaar data. Such a provision had no rationale nexus to the objective of the law, the court said.Union law and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in an interview that the telecom andfinance ministries would work with banks and telcos to ensure they erased the data of those who have already completed the linkages. However, Prasad also left a window open for the government and said its understanding wasthat it could, with legislative backing, insist on such linkages.This view was separately echoed by Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) CEOAjay Bhushan Pandey.The court said Aadhaar intends to plug loopholes and stem corruption while reaching out to the poor and underprivileged.To this extent, the court said, the law also qualified the test of proportionality because the aim behind the programme was legitimate. Government claims it saved ₹90K crore , a number disputed by activists.Keeping in view the larger public interest, collection of biometrics such as iris scan and fingerprints under the program was a minimal invasion into the privacy rights, the court held. “By no means it can be said that it has disproportionate effect on the right holder,” the order said.Identity bestowed by Aadhaar is unparalleled and “we find that the Aadhaar Act has struck a fair balance between the right of privacy of the individual with right to life of the same individual as a beneficiary,” said the judgment which relied heavily on the Right to Privacy judgment delivered last August.The sole dissenting judge on the bench, justice DY Chandrachud, declared the law as unconstitutional. Clearing it as a money bill was a fraud played on the Constitution, he said. Justice Ashok Bhushan, who wrote a separate ruling, endorsed the view taken in the majority verdict.The SC verdict, running into 1,448 pages, came on batch of 31 petitions with the first one being filed in 2012 when the executive order introducing Aadhaar was challenged before the court. The first petition was filed by former Karnataka high court judge KS Puttaswamy. Subsequently, several activists joined the fray.In 2016, the NDA government brought in a law and pushed Aadhaar enrolment in a big way for its welfare programmes. The hearing continued for 38 days, spanning over four months,before the judgment was reserved on May 10.Advocates say the hearing was the “second longest” one in terms of days of hearing after the Kesavananda Bharati case of 1973.Still, even as it found no fault with the Aadhaar law, the court insisted on safeguards. It ordered data cannot be stored for more than six months and also directed the government not to give Aadhaar to illegal immigrants. The provision that allowed access of data for national security, too, was struck down.The court said that if the government wants to reformulate this provision then a joint secretary-level officer and a judicial officer should be members of the oversight committee to hear complaints against sharing of data.The court rejected the argument that Aadhaar could lead to real-time surveillance, calling it‘far-fetched’. Information of an individual can’t be released with-out hearing him or her, it said.Finance minister Arun Jaitley hailed the verdict as historic, while law minister Prasad said it“empowered democracy”.Welcoming the verdict, Congress leader Kapil Sibal told reporters his party supports theviews of justice Chandrachud. Sibal said it will certainly move court if amendments in the Aadhaar Act brought after this verdict are not brought in Rajya Sabha for discussion. Bengalchief minister Mamata Banerjee welcomed the verdict and termed it as a victory of the people.Advocate Udayaditya Banerjee, who represented the petitioners before the court, said thejudgement will enable citizens to de-link their Aadhaar from their bank accounts or mobile phone accounts. “Although the judgment does not say it expressly, the consequence is that one can de-link Aadhaar now,” he said.The petitioners’ demand to delete data collected prior to the enactment of the law in 2016 was also turned down. The court said the problem can be solved by eliciting “consent” of all those persons enrolled prior to passing the act. “Since, we have held that enrolment is voluntary, those who specifically refuse to give the consent, they would be allowed toexit from the Aadhaar scheme. Those who need to avail any subsidy, benefit or service wouldneed Aadhaar in any case. It would not be proper to cancel their Aadhaar cards,” the courtsaid.The court did not concur with the petitioners’ concern that Aadhaar should be shelved sinceauthentication failure of biometrics resulted in the exclusion of the needy. “We are only highlighting the fact that the government seems to be sincere in its efforts to ensure that no such exclusion takes place and in those cases where an individual who is rightfully entitled to benefits under the scheme is not denied such a benefit merely because of failure of authentication. In this scenario, the entire Aadhaar project cannot be shelved,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-september-27-2018-aadhaar-public-limited-101632668619510.html

The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella organisation of all 40 farmers’ groups protesting against the Centre's three contentious farm laws, called for a Bharat Bandh on Monday. The farmers have been protesting for more than 10 months at Delhi’s borders against the farm laws passed by the government during the monsoon session in 2020A police official familiar with the developments told news agency PTI that adequate security arrangements will be made to maintain the law and order situation in the Capital. “No protester will be allowed to enter Delhi from the three protest sites at the city's borders,” the official said.The official said that the police are ‘fully alert’ and there will be preventive security measures. “There is no call for 'Bharat Bandh' in Delhi, but we are watching the developments and an adequate number of personnel will be on the ground,” Delhi Police said. However, the Aam Aadmi Party has extended support to the Bharat Bandh call.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) also sought support from the political parties and asked them to stand with farmers. “As this historic struggle completes ten months, the SKM has called Monday to be observed as 'Bharat Bandh' against the anti-farmer government,” the farmers’ group said.Leaders of the SKM appealed to citizens to make the bandh a ‘resounding success’. “In particular, we appeal to all organisations of workers, traders, transporters, businessmen, students, youth and women and all social movements to extend solidarity with the farmers that day,” the group said in a statement.The SKM said that the bandh will be held for 10 hours and asked to halt work in all government and private offices, educational and other institutions, shops, industries and commercial establishments as well as halt public events and functions all over the nation.It, however, has exempted emergency establishments and essential services, including hospitals, medical stores, relief and rescue work and people attending to personal emergencies.Farmers from different parts of the country are expected to reach Delhi’s borders on Monday. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh are also expected to reach in larger numbers to extend support to those already protesting at Delhi borders since November last year.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-no-farmers-to-be-allowed-in-capital-delhi-police-tighten-security-101632667840745.html
26-09-2021||India||PM Modi has 3 secrets to keep jet lag at bay||Prime Minister Narendra Modi had three days in hand as he embarked on his recently concluded US trip. Several timezones later, PM Modi landed in the US and spent 65 hours in the country, with the rest of the time spent travelling, and he managed to attend 20 meetings, including the crucial bilateral meeting that he had with US President Joe Biden. Sources told news agency PTI that PM Modi has some secrets that help him fight jet lag.And the first is to keep back-to-back meetings on a foreign trip so that there is no time to feel fatigued which is common after a long flight. In the recent trip, PM Modi has five meetings on September 23 with the CEOs, followed by talks with US vice president Kamala Harris, bilateral interactions with Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga and Australian PM Scott Morrison. Then there were some internal meetings. On September 24, he held his bilateral meeting with Biden and attended the Quad meet. On September 25, he addressed the United Nations General Assembly. Every day, he held many other internal meetings.The second secret is to accommodate some meetings on the flight itself. The PTI report said that on this trip, he held four meetings on the way to and back from the US.The third secret, as PTI reported, is to tune the body and the sleep cycle to the time zone of the destination. That's why he does not sleep on the flight even if it's night in India. "He does the same thing when returning to India and tunes his body and sleep cycle according to the Indian time, ensuring that he is fresh and ready to go when he lands during the day time," the PTI report added.PM Modi also drinks a lot of water s doctors suggest that the air in the plane sucks out moisture in the body, sources told PTI.On his way to the United States, he posted a photo from the flight where he was seen going through some paper inside the flight. As a matter of fact, PM Modi always prefers night flights which is a habit that developed in the 1990s. The report said that when he used to visit the US in the 1990s, an airline used to give a discounted monthly pass. "To make the most of it, Modi would always travel in the night as this ensured that he could visit most places while not having to spend a penny on hotels. His night would be invariably spent at the airport and in the plane," a source told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-has-3-secrets-to-keep-jet-lag-at-bay-101632665468147.html
26-09-2021||India||Cyclone Gulab: 6 fishermen from Andhra Pradesh reported missing||Six fishermen from Srikakulam district in north coastal Andhra Pradesh were reported missing in Bay of Bengal on Sunday evening as the cyclonic storm Gulab moved closer to the shore and is likely to make landfall around midnight. Six fishermen from Palasa, who returning to their native village by sea in a new boat they purchased in Odisha two days ago, were feared missing in the storm. One of the six called his village over phone and informed that their boat lost balance and five of his fellow fishermen were lost in the sea. Subsequently, his mobile phone too went silent, indicating that he too might have gone missing. The villagers brought this to the notice of fisheries minister S Appala Raju, who immediately called the Navy authorities for help to trace and rescue the missing fishers.The three north coastal districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam had been receiving moderate to heavy rain under the influence of Gulab. Andhra Pradesh state Disaster Management Authority commissioner K Kanna Babu said Gulab lay centred around 85 km from Kalingapatnam in Srikakulam district and likely to cross the coast between Kalingapatnam and Gopalpur (in Odisha) around midnight. He reviewed the situation with the district Collectors and other officials in Visakhapatnam and directed them to be on high alert. Meanwhile, the South Central Railway informed in a release that eight trains on the Vijayawada-Howrah route were diverted via Kharagpur, Jharsuguda, Bilaspur and Balharshah. Two other trains that were supposed to begin journey on Sunday, have been rescheduled for Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-gulab-6-fishermen-from-andhra-pradesh-reported-missing-101632664058267.html
26-09-2021||India||Will take ‘sensible’ step to reduce discrimination: Odisha CM Patnaik on caste census||Biju Janata Dal (BJD) supremo and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Sunday said that the state government will do whatever is “sensible” for its people in order to cut down discrimination in the region. His remarks were in response to his move on the caste census in the state. “Our government stands by it and we are fighting for it,” he told news agency ANI.The caste census has caused a tiff between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre and several non-BJP leaders. Earlier in the day, Union home minister Amit Shah chaired a review meeting on Left-wing extremism with 10 states that saw the attendance of Patnaik and his Jharkhand and Bihar counterparts Hemant Soren and Nitish Kumar, respectively.Kumar on Sunday said that caste census is a “legitimate demand” and is the need of the hour. “It is pro-development and will help policymakers frame targeted welfare policies for backward castes. Caste census must take place. We'll hold an all-party meeting over this matter in Bihar,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Patnaik and Kumar’s statements come after Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Tejashwi Yadav on Saturday wrote a letter to 33 non-BJP leaders – including Patnaik, Soren and Kumar —seeking their support on the demand for caste census. In the letter, which Tejashwi shared on his Twitter profile, he mentioned that the purpose behind seeking the support of the leaders were the “shared apprehension and responsibilities” due to the “apathy of the ruling party (BJP) at the Centre towards the same.”Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav – who was among the 33 non-BJP leaders who received the letter from Tejashwi —also took to the micro-blogging site on Saturday to share his displeasure over the Centre’s recent affidavit to the Supreme Court against conducting a caste census in 2022.“By rejecting the long-standing demand for enumeration of ‘OBC’ society, the BJP government has proved that it does not want to count the ‘Other Backward Classes’ because it does not want to give rights to the OBCs in proportion to their population,” Yadav tweeted.The first caste census was conducted in 2011 when the Congress was ruling at the Centre. However, the BJP-led central government recently informed the apex court that the data of the 2011 census has been rendered “unusable” as it is laden with “mistakes and inaccuracies.”The ruling dispensation further stated that inclusion of any other backward caste apart from Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) under the ambit of the upcoming census would be “administratively difficult” and against the government’s policy decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-take-sensible-step-to-reduce-discrimination-odisha-cm-on-caste-census-101632660736726.html
26-09-2021||India||UP Cabinet: Ex-Congress leader Jitin Prasada now a minister of Yogi govt||Former Congress leader Jitin Prasada, who was once close with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, is now a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh as the BJP on Sunday announced a sudden Cabinet expansion with a few months left for the state assembly election. Reports said the ministers were not even aware that they are being accommodated in the Cabinet. The induction of Jitin Prasada will consolidate the Brahmin votes for the BJP in the upcoming election. Brahmins constitute over 10 per cent of UP's voters and the community has already tilted from the Congress towards the BJP over the years.This expansion was announced hurriedly on Sunday indicating that it is the party's emergency move to maximise the representation of castes that matter for the vote bank, though Yogi Adityanath's Cabinet can only include seven new faces as there are already 53 ministers in the UP cabinet. While Jitin Prasada is a Brahmin, Palturam, Dinesh Khatik are SC, Chhatarpal Gangwar represents Kurmi, Sangeeta Balwant Bind,  Sanjeev Kumar Gond ST.  Apart from the six new ministers, Dharamveer Prajapati has also been inducted into the cabinet. The BJP has already announced a pre-poll alliance with Nishad (Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal) party. Hence the induction of Sanjay Nishad, who wanted to be projected as the deputy CM face in the upcoming election, into the Cabinet was being speculated. Another speculated name was former Uttarakhand governor Baby Ranu Maurya, but they have not been accommodated.The Uttar Pradesh Assembly has 403 seats. In the 2017 UP Assembly elections, the BJP won 312 seats while its ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) won nine seats. The Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) too had contested the 2017 assembly polls in alliance with the BJP and won four seats but it walked out of the alliance in 2019.Commenting on the Cabinet expansion, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav said, "It won't help BJP. Even if there are a few new faces, the government ultimately is of BJP...and the people have made up their mind to change the government".(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cabinet-ex-congress-leader-jitin-prasada-now-a-minister-of-yogi-govt-101632658708703.html

Raj Kumar Verka, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Pargat Singh, Amarinder Singh Raja Warring and Gukrirat Singh Kotli also took oathCongress MLA Rajkumar Verka who took oath as a cabinet minister said that he will work to fulfil the hopes of the electorate. “We have less time and have many things to do. We will work to fulfill the hopes of people. I will start working after taking the oath to deliver my duties, whatever is given to me,” Verka was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Punjab chief minister Channi’s cabinet reshuffle came after several rounds of meetings between him and the Congress high command. There was some controversy around the inclusion of Kapurthala MLA Gurjit Singh Rana into the cabinet. Rana was dropped from former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s cabinet due to his alleged connection to the sand mining auction.Channi last week said that he would meet the newly appointed minister every Tuesday along with other MLAs and party functionaries. His office said that a meeting would be held every Tuesday at 3 pm, news agency PTI reported.However, opposition Shiromani Akali Dal said that the new ministers are here to loot the state and make money. Party president Sukhbir Singh Badal said that they will review every decision taken by the new cabinet. Badal also called the ministers ‘dacoits’ and said ‘tainted’ leaders were part of the cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-gets-a-new-cabinet-check-portfolios-of-the-new-ministers-101632658984528.html

If not, Samyukt Kisan Morcha will go to every part of the country, hold meetings and protests against the Central government and campaign in poll-bound states,” Tikait said.SKM has called for a 10-hour long Bharat Bandh on Monday to mark a year of the three controversial farm laws. "A Bharat Bandh has been called on September 27. The top priority is to ensure the success of this bandh. After this, the SKM will take a call on the future course of action for the protest. The BKU will continue its fight for the farmers," SKM spokesperson Saurabh Upadhyay told reporters.The Centre has held 11 rounds of talks with the farmer but the talks have brought forth no solution as the farmer unions insist on repeal and the government continues to claim that the laws are pro-farmer.Tikait also reached out to US President Joe Biden and the Indian American diaspora living abroad seeking their support for the farmers' stir. Tikait claimed that the protests have so far claimed the lives of 700 farmers but the government is not ready to repeal the laws.“We appeal to all Indians living in the US. India's prime minister will be there on September 25 in New York for a programme. All Indians in the US should place a 'farmers' flag on their vehicles and raise banners of 'No Farmer No Food' and register your protest in support of farmers,” Tikait said in a video message.BKU declared their intentions to campaign in poll-bound states in early March, right before the 2021 legislative elections commenced. “We'll send teams to poll-bound states — to West Bengal and Kerala. We will not support any party but appeal to people to vote for the candidates who can defeat BJP. We will tell people about the Modi govt's attitude towards farmers,” BKU leader Balbir S Rajewal had said at a press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skm-will-campaign-in-poll-bound-states-if-farm-laws-not-taken-back-rakesh-tikait-101632658441793.html

26-09-2021||India||Kerala teacher pushes for constitutional education in schools||As India gets ready to complete 75 years of independence, a teacher from Kottayam in Kerala has started a movement to set up Constitution clubs in schools to make youngsters aware of their duties and obligations.Last year, Binu PG wrote about this to Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan, who lauded his initiative and forwarded the letter to President Ram Kovind. Someone who has travelled throughout the country, the 40-year-old freelance teacher says that constitutional values should be taught to children at a young age and citizenship education should be included in curriculum. He said it will help groom a generation that cherishes civic values and responsibilities.“If you ask our students about the freedom movement and our Constitution they will only tell you about some dates or tall leaders. I have been teaching students about Constitutional values for more than one and a half decade and I am sure that by imbibing its spirit, they will become better citizens,” he said, adding youngsters should be groomed about how to respect the law of the land.“I am not saying that all articles and rights should be taught in schools. What we need is literacy in the Constitution. Youngsters should be made aware of their rights, duties and obligations,” he said, adding that citizenship education was taught as a subject in many countries like Singapore and Japan.Binu PG is initially planning to tour Kerala to mobilise support and later take his mission to the national level.“We have around 450 million youth in the country. We don’t have an effective mechanism to groom and channelise their energy for the country. I am sure good lessons will make them good citizens and we don’t need high doses of nationalism at a later stage,” he said, adding that he had prepared a blueprint for constitution clubs.In his letter to the governor, he also mentioned that the contribution of BN Rau, a civil servant and jurist, who played a key role in drafting the Constitution, was not properly recognised and wanted a befitting memorial for him. “Binu is a committed social activist who dreams of a better country. A motivational speaker and teacher, he has been inspiring youth for many years,” said Dr V Reghu, former assistant director of the Centre for Adult Education Board of Kerala University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-teacher-pushes-for-constitutional-education-in-schools-101632657942289.html

26-09-2021||India||Punjab Cabinet: 15 ministers take oath amid row over Rana Gurjit Singh||A total of 15 ministers to be part of the new Cabinet of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi took oath on Sunday at the Raj Bhavan in Chandigarh, a week after Channi's name was announced as the new chief minister of the poll-bound state. After Channi's swearing-in on Monday, rounds of discussion were held to finalise the names of the new ministers. Sunday's Cabinet expansion and swearing-in follow the chief minister's recent visit to New Delhi where the new inclusions have been vetted by the high command. However, at the last moment, a controversy erupted with six MLAs objecting to Rana Gurjit Singh's inclusion in the Cabinet. Rana Gurjeet Singh was dropped from the Cabinet in January 2018 because of his alleged involvement in the mining scandal. The leaders demanded that the cabinet berth should go to a clean Dalit leader.The ministers who took oath on Sunday are Brahm Mohindra, Manpreet Singh Badal, Tripti Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Rana Gurjit Singh, Aruna Chaudary, Razia Sultana, Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Vijay Inder Singla, Randeep Singh Nabha, Raj Kumar Verka, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Pargat Singh, Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, Gukrirat Singh Kotli.Congress leader in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat said the Cabinet, which has seven new faces and eight from Amarinder Singh's Cabinet is a balanced one. Among the new faces inducted, only Rana Gurjit Singh has been a minister before. The rest six are ministers from the first time.Follow live updates of Punjab Cabinet expansion“Those who could not be made ministers today will be accommodated in government setup and organisation. This exercise has been done to bring in young faces and strike a social and regional balance,” Rawat said. The Cabinet expansion has drawn the ire of the ministers of the Amarinder Singh government, who have been dropped from the Channi government. Balbir Singh Sidhu and Gurpreet Singh Kangar held a joint news conference here shortly before the cabinet expansion and asked what was their fault that they had been dropped. Congress leader Manish Tewari waded into the controversy and said it is the chief minister's prerogative to decide who should be a minister. But he said that former health minister Balbir Singh worked exemplarily during the worst days of Covid. https://t.co/ajfRHOBNIZWho should be a Minister or should not be is CM’s prerogative.However I am constrained to point out that @BalbirSinghMLA ( Sidhu Sahib) as Health Minister went way beyond call of duty during the worst days of COVID-19.His selflessness was unparalleled.The new Cabinet has been designed keeping an eye on the upcoming election that the Congress is likely to contest under the leadership of Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, instead of Channi, who is Punjab's first Dalit chief minister. Caste calculation has played a significant role in the new Cabinet as there is a representation of Valmiki, OBC, Jat Sikhs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cabinet-expansion-new-mlas-take-oath-amid-row-over-rana-gurjit-singh-101632653304679.html
26-09-2021||India||Odisha club polls turn interesting as 2 former chief secretaries face off||For decades, Bijay Patnaik, a 1976-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer and Asit Tripathy, a 1986-batch IAS officer not only worked in tandem in the Odisha government but also rose to the highest seat of power in state bureaucracy, becoming chief secretaries. The two bureaucrats were not done after retiring from the Indian Administrative Service and are now locking horns for the post of president of Bhubaneswar Club, the two-day long elections to which began on Saturday. Results will be declared on Monday.While the preparations for the bye-elections in Pipili assembly constituency scheduled next month is a staid affair, elections for the top post of the 71-year-old club, otherwise known as a watering hole of the IAS officers and businessmen in Bhubaneswar, has become rather interesting with Tripathy and Patnaik sending video messages, recorded audio messages and e-fliers to over 1800-odd members eligible to vote.“I am getting so many messages from the candidates that my mailboxes are jammed. I wonder if this has become a college union election with candidates pushing it a bit too much,” chuckled a club member, unwilling to be named.For the last decade or so, elections to Bhubaneswar Club were very dull affairs with its former president Priyabrat Patnaik single-handedly running the show. Patnaik, a former IAS officer, was known more as the president of the club as he paid greater attention to its affairs resulting in retention of its presidency for the last 9 years. He died last year after a long battle with liver cancer.What may have turned an otherwise staid club election to find Patnaik’s replacement interesting is the subtle official support to Tripathy, now principal advisor to chief minister Naveen Patnaik. Finance secretary Vishal Dev standing for the post of secretary of the club has triggered rumours that the government wants to develop an otherwise ordinary-looking club so that business investors can look for some recreation after a hard day’s work in the state capital.“The club is a living heritage of our dynamic city and deserves a beautiful facade and better physical amenities. The premier clubs in other cities are dynamic places where members and their families enjoy warm camaraderie and companionship. I have come forward to contest the election for president of our club along with a group of highly motivated colleagues who are committed to my vision of transformation of our club,” said Tripathy.“I want the club to grow like the India Habitat Centre,” he added.Patnaik, who retired as chief secretary 8 years ago and worked in the CM’s office for 6 years, said he wanted to repay some of his debt to the club. “I have been enjoying the hospitality of the club for more than 30 years. For me, the post of president is not another empire to be conquered or a trophy to be won,” said Patnaik, who was close to Priyabrat Patnaik, former president of the club. Patnaik is backed by outgoing club secretary Ashok Chinchela, who is seeking re-election, and outgoing vice-president Sudipto Das.A key associate of chief minister a decade ago, Bijoy Patnaik after retirement was made chief of Odisha Staff Selection Commission and then member of Odisha Human Rights Commission. Tripathy, after his retirement as chief secretary in December 2020, was promptly appointed as principal advisor to CM and chairman of Western Odisha Development Council. There are speculations that he may be fielded as the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) candidate from Bolangir in Lok Sabha elections with an aim to blunt the influence of the royal family of Singhdeos.Many believe the power struggle for the club would help clean up its past blemishes. In 2007, the club, headed by Priyabrata Patnaik, triggered a controversy after it was revealed that the club was among the applicants for the Khandadhar iron ore mines in Sundargarh district, for which South Korean steel major Posco was also a contender. The club later withdrew the application after the Union ministry of personnel took a serious view of the matter.In early 2000, the club had stirred a controversy by rejecting the application for membership of the then commercial tax commissioner Taradutt, an IAS officer, after his department sent a notice to the club alleging it had not paid sales tax dues. The club then went on an appeal before the sales tax tribunal and got a breather.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-club-polls-turns-interesting-as-2-former-chief-secretaries-face-off-101632653258340.html

September 27 marks the first anniversary of President Ram Nath Kovind giving his assent for the three bills. The umbrella union of the farmers who are protesting against these three laws for around 10 months now has said that Bharat Bandh on Monday will be peaceful and the public will face minimal inconvenience.No public, private transport allowedIn its guideline, the SKM said that during the time of the Bharat Bandh, central and state government offices, markets, shops, factories, schools, colleges and other educational institutions will not be allowed to function. Public and private transport will not be allowed to ply on roads and no public functions will be allowed. However, emergency services including ambulances and fire services will be allowed to function.The main banners or themes for the day would be 'Bharat Bandh against Anti-Farmer Modi Government', 'Modi Brings in Mandi Bandh', 'Farmers take up Bharat Bandh' and so on, the SKM said in a statement.States where the effect of Bharat Bandh is likely to be feltThe farmers' Bharat Bandh has already gathered support from several political parties, including the Congress, AAP, YSRC, DMK, Telugu Desam, Left parties, BSP, RJD etc. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu governments have announced complete support to the nationwide strike. The Andhra Pradesh government has decided to stop APSRTC buses from September 26 midnight to September 27 afternoon.Delhi under security blanketThe Delhi Police have said that no protesters will be allowed to enter Delhi from the three protest sites at the city's border. "The security will be preventive and we are fully alert. There is no call for 'Bharat Bandh' in Delhi, but we are watching the developments and adequate number of personnel will be on the ground," an officer said.No bandh for tradersTraders, small industries, shopkeepers have nothing to do with the bandh, Bhartiya Udyog Vyapaar Mandal has said. "The bandh call by a handful of so-called farmers has been virtually sponsored by the opposition parties from the back door for their political gain and is anti-development and senseless besides being against the interest of traders,” national president Ravi Kant Garg said in a statement.Will bank activities be affected?The All India Bank Officers' Confederation has extended its support to the call of Bharat Bandh. The union said it will join the protest of the farmers in solidarity.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-tomorrow-from-6am-to-4pm-public-transport-likely-to-be-affected-101632651514926.html

26-09-2021||India||Mann Ki Baat: Modi cites Naganadhi to urge communities to revive dying rivers||Prime Minister Narendra on Sunday mentioned about the rejuvenation of Naganadhi river during the 81st episode of his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat.Addessing the Mann Ki Baat earlier today, which coincided with the World Rivers Day, Modi stressed the importance of conservation of rivers and their importance in Indian tradition and cultures.Modi said many people and communities have dedicated themselves to the cause of rejuvenation of dying rivers, including Naganadhi, which flows through Vellore and Thiruvannamalai districts of Tamil Nadu.The Naganadhi river with its catchment area in Vellore and Tiruvannamalai districts had dried up many years ago. The groundwater in the area reduced subsequently making the area bore-well dependent.In 2014, taking the guidance of geologist Lingaraju Yale, ex-director of Karnataka State Remote Sensing and Application Centre and now with the Art of Living River Rejuvenation project, Chandrasekaran, director of the Naganadhi River Rejuvenation programme designed a model to revive the river.An army of over a 1,000 women from 21 villages of a block in Vellore district built recharge wells and check dams to revive the groundwater which, in turn, gave life back to the river.The Prime Minister said women of the area took up the cudgels to rejuvenate their river which had almost dried up.“You would be glad to know that today, the river is brimming with water. And truly, when a river is full of water, it lends such tranquility to the mind…I have actually witnessed the experience,” Modi said.The groundwater recharge work has now been extended to nine other Tamil Nadu districts led by close to 20,000 women.“The government and social service organisations keep undertaking one endeavour or the other in order to rejuvenate rivers throughout the country and cleanse the waters,” the Prime Minister said, adding, “It has been going on for decades now. There are some people who have dedicated themselves to these causes. And it is this very tradition, this very endeavour, this very faith that has saved our rivers.”Modi also cited the example of Sabarmati river in Gujarat. He said parts of the river dried up during the past few decades as there is no for six to eight months every year. However, after Narmada and Sabarmati rivers were linked, it helped rejuvenate it.“If you go to Ahmedabad today, the waters of river Sabarmati fill one’s heart with such joy,” Modi said, while praising the women of Tamil Nadu for their intiative to rejuvenate Naganadhi river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mann-ki-baat-modi-cites-naganadhi-to-urge-communities-to-revive-dying-rivers-101632639599836.html

26-09-2021||India||Amarinder Singh back with NDA batchmates, sings 'o gorey gorey'||Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, who resigned a week ago, expressing much resentment with the Congress leadership, is now spending time away from politics as he is hosting a get-together for his 47 batchmates of National Defence Academy at his Mohinder Bagh farmhouse in Mohali. Captain also designed some special jackets for all his batchmates with their names and course embossed, especially for the get-together. A video of Amarinder Singh singing the Bollywood song, 'O gorey gorey', shared by his media advisor Raveen Thukral has grabbed the attention of social media users at a time when Punjab is getting a new cabinet, not devoid of controversy and lobbying. And there was more merriment….@capt_amarinder seemed in full mood to enjoy the moment. Listen in to him singing ‘O gorey gorey…’ from an old Hindi movie. pic.twitter.com/xbwEzBBCw5Last week, Amarinder Singh resigned making way for Charanjit Singh Channi to become the new chief minister of the poll-bound state. The Captain-Sidhu tug-of-war was going on in the state Congress for several months which could not be put to rest even after Sidhu's elevation to the post of the Punjab Congress chief. However, Amarinder Singh's exit was not smooth as he made it clear that he did not understand why the Congress leadership decided to bring in the change with a few months left before the election. He also termed Sidhu as an 'anti-national' and said he will oppose Sidhu as the CM face in the upcoming polls. The Congress leadership has been misguided, Captain said, referring to Rahul Gandhi as ‘inexperienced’.While Amarinder Singh's future political plan is under the wraps, Punjab's Cabinet expansion is facing a new challenge after the name of the probable inclusion became public. Some senior Congress leaders have now written to Navjot Singh Sidhu against the probable inclusion of Rana Gurjit Singh, who was allegedly associated with a sand mining scam. Reports said five ministers from Amarinder Singh's Cabinet are likely to be dropped while seven new faces will be included in the Charanjit Singh Channi government. Though Channi is the CM now, the Congress is likely to contest the assembly election making Sidhu the CM face, Congress leadership has indicated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-back-with-nda-batchmates-sings-o-gorey-gorey-101632647811256.html

26-09-2021||India||PM Modi salutes ‘Divyang’ trekkers who conquered Siachen glacier, made world record||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday saluted a team of disabled trekkers from India who created a new world record by conquering an otherwise inaccessible terrain on the Siachen Glacier. PM Modi said the team of eight “Divyangs” trekked and hoisted the Indian national flag on the treacherous mountain spot, known as ‘Kumar Post’—a place which is a less-traversed area on the famous glacier 15,000 feet above sea level. Prime Minister Modi, who was addressing the 81st edition of his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme on Sunday, said that the feat achieved by the team of eight “Divyangs” (a term promoted by the Prime Minister to refer to persons with disabilities) was an inspiration for the entire country.Also Read | On Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi urges people to observe World Rivers Day“We all know about the Siachen Glacier. The cold there is so terrible that it is beyond the capacity of a common person to live there. A few days ago, the feat that a team of eight Divyang persons performed in this inaccessible region of Siachen is a matter of pride for every countryman,” PM Modi said. "This team created a world record by hoisting its flag on the Kumar Post situated at an altitude of more than 15 thousand feet at the Siachen glacier," the Prime Minister said, saluting the team of ‘Divyang’ trekkers.Modi then proceeded to name each person on the team, which consisted of – Mahesh Nehra, Akshat Rawat of Uttarakhand, Pushpak Gawande of Maharashtra, Ajay Kumar of Haryana, Lobsang Chospel of Ladakh, Major Dwarkesh of Tamil Nadu, Irfan Ahmed Mir of Jammu & Kashmir and Chongjin Ingmo of Himachal Pradesh.The Prime Minister said that despite the challenges of physical disability, the trekkers conquered the Siachen Glacier with assistance from veterans of the special forces of the Indian Army. “I commend the team for this historic and unprecedented achievement,” he said. “It also shows the spirit of our countrymen to tackle every challenge with a ‘Can Do Culture’, a ‘Can Do Determination’, and a ‘Can Do Attitude.’”Prime Minister Modi also informed that the central government is making special efforts for the welfare of persons with disabilities across the country. “I got a chance to know about one such effort being made in Uttar Pradesh - ‘One Teacher, One Call,’” he said.The unique effort in Bareilly is showing a new path to the ‘Divyang’ children, he said, adding that the campaign is being led by Deepmala Pandey, the principal of a school in Dabhaura Gangapur.During the coronavirus pandemic, as many as 350 teachers joined “in the spirit of service” due to this campaign to come forward to teach the ‘Divyang’ children who were enrolled, the Prime Minister said. He added that these teachers went from village to village calling for the children with disabilities, looking out for them, and ensuring that their process is successfully done in one school or the other.“I deeply appreciate this noble effort of Deepmala ji and her fellow teachers for the sake of the Divyangjans,” said the Prime Minister. “Every such effort in the field of education is going to shape the future of our country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-salutes-divyang-trekkers-who-conquered-siachen-glacier-made-world-record-101632641939435.html

The landfall process will commence from late evening of Sunday,” the IMD said, while issuing a ‘Red Message’ (extreme rain).'"Cyclone Gulab' is currently located 180 km southeast of Gopalpur. Most likely it will make landfall from late evening to midnight, between Kalingapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Gopalpur in Odisha, " Special Relief Commissioner PK Jena told media.Meanwhile, rainfall activity started in Odisha’s southern and coastal regions on Sunday morning in the wake of Cyclone 'Gulab’, which is likely to make landfall between Gopalpur and Kalingapatanam in Andhra Pradesh around midnight. The cyclone lay centred about 140km east-southeast of Gopalpur and 190km east-northeast of Kalingapatnam, the IMD said. “The landfall is expected late evening/night,” IMD senior scientist RK Jenamani told ANI.The Odisha government has already mobilised men and machinery and launched an evacuation drive in seven identified districts in the southern parts of the state.

26-09-2021||India||How was PM Modi allowed in US despite having taken Covaxin? Shiv Sena questions||The Shiv Sena raised questions about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States asking how was the prime minister allowed entry in America when he was had taken doses of Covaxin which is yet to be recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The party questioned how could there be different rules related to the vaccine for the general public and the prime minister for foreign travel.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut in his weekly column ‘Rokthok’ in party mouthpiece Samana, has said that Modi must be feeling relieved as he was able to go abroad after a long time. “The world has recognised Covishield. However, those who have taken the Covaxin vaccine are now in a fix as they are not allowed to travel to many American-European countries. Then how come Modi, who has taken doses of Covaxin was allowed to land in America? Many students, businessmen were not allowed to travel for having taken doses of Covaxin. If we point that such rules are only for common people and not for the high and mighty, the BJP will criticise us saying that with Modi, everything is possible (Modi Hai Toh Mumkin Hai). Who can stop Modi?”In addition, Raut said that in Maharashtra, BJP is on an entertainment spree by levelling baseless allegations against the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. He said that since theatres and auditoriums were closed and people were being deprived of entertainment, the void was being filled by the BJP leaders. The opposition BJP is being ably aided by the central agencies like Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in their mission of entertaining the people, he said.“Former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya gets up every morning and levels baseless allegations against an MVA minister. He then tours the constituency of that minister. Maharashtra has seen many opposition leaders like Madhu Dandavate, Madhu Limaye, George Fernandes who exposed the then governments. Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay Gandhi had to face the music but what is happening now has never been seen before in Indian politics,” Raut has remarked.The BJP had described Raut’s remarks on Modi’s tour as childish. “Their very question on Modi’s American tour exposes their ignorance and displays their childishness,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam. “We have been criticising the MVA government and complaining against them on basis of proof. If the MVA leaders are innocent, why are they afraid of facing the central agencies?” questioned Kadam.Raut has trained his guns on BJP state president Chandrakant Patil. Recently, Patil had reacted to an article and written a rebuttal to Saamna, criticising Raut for his remarks against him. “We published the letter written by Chandrakant Patil in our newspaper. Patil criticised me saying that Sanjay Raut was acting as a spokesperson for the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar. He said that Raut had no credibility in the Shiv Sena. Further, he described me as the man responsible for breaking the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance. How can a man with no credibility break such an alliance in the first place? This only shows their ignorance,” said Raut.The Shiv Sena had fought the 2019 Maharashtra polls in alliance with the BJP. However, the problem started when the Sena insisted on sharing the chief minister’s post with the BJP. The BJP refused and hence the Sena teamed with the opposition parties like Congress and the NCP to form the government. Raut played a major role in forging this alliance and the BJP has been training their guns on him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-was-pm-modi-allowed-in-us-despite-having-taken-covaxin-shiv-sena-questions-101632642397778.html
26-09-2021||India||Nuclear submarines for India? Evolving strategic reality in Indo-Pacific may make India go the Australia way||The Australian decisive recognition of strategic reality in the Indo-Pacific by pitching for nuclear attack and not diesel submarines has forced India and Japan to rethink their naval posture in the wake of the belligerent Chinese navy. While Indian national security planners are now seriously thinking of upgrading its sub-surface naval capacities, the successor of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will have to take a call on the war renunciation clause enshrined in article nine of their constitution. Even though China is one of the largest trade and investment partners of Japan, the latter along with India are the only two Quad powers who have a land dispute with Beijing. For the US it is a superpower competition with China and Australia has a trade dispute with Beijing.Just as Australia took a 180-degree turn from 12 French-built diesel attack submarines to nine US Virginia class nuclear powered and conventionally armed submarines or SSNs, the Modi government will also have to make dyed in the wool admirals understand the deterrence of the nuclear platform. Just like the Indian Navy still carries the imperial Cross of Saint George on its flag, its admirals want 24 diesel submarines as prescribed by a two-decades-old plan along with three SSNs. The 1999 submarine plan was cleared by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at such a time when even mentioning the word potential threat along with China was considered taboo. The then defence minister George Fernandes realised this much to his chagrin as he was pilloried by Indian media and so-called strategists for calling China a potential future threat.The reality in the Indo-Pacific today is totally different with the Chinese navy dominant on the major sea lane to Japan and South Korea and threatening anyone following the rule of the sea with military consequences. The Indian situation may become direr as credible Pakistani defence handles are tweeting about Islamabad acquiring a Chinese nuclear attack submarine. While there is no intelligence to substantiate this, but if this happens, it will change the game in the Arabian Sea and present a clear danger to the vast Indian coastline.With China still blaming India for the June 2020 Galwan clash despite unilaterally trying to impose an already rejected 1959 line on LAC a month before, the Modi government must have robust naval platforms for sea denial to aggressive Chinese Navy in case of the worst-case scenario. And as nuclear attack submarines take more than a decade to build even with all the technology in hand, this decision must come now for the Chinese will be operating three aircraft carriers by 2025 and patrolling the Indo-Pacific.One of the key lessons from the May 2020 LAC transgressions in Ladakh is that Beijing has no desire to compromise on the boundary dispute with India in either western, eastern, or middle sectors. The unilateral aggression shown in May 2020 by the PLA makes it evident that China will not yield an inch for resolution of the six-decade-old boundary issue. Rather than get carried away by the Chinese narrative of a tranquil border, there should be no slack in Indian deterrence on land, air and at sea. Or else the results will be disastrous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/evolving-strategic-reality-in-indo-pacific-may-make-india-go-the-australia-way-101632641058705.html

They said his proposed cabinet slot should go to a Dalit leader from Doaba region instead.The six MLAs who wrote to the Congress leadership were Navtej Singh Cheema from Sultanpur Lodhi, Sukhpal Singh Khaira from Bholath, Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal from Phagwara, Bawa Henry from Jalandhar (north) and Pawan Adiya from Sham Chaurasi.Though the letter claimed that former Punjab Congress unit chief Mohinder Singh KayPee was also part of the dissenting group, KayPee later said that he had not signed the letter.An MLA, who didn’t wish to be named, said the group will meet Sidhu over the matter on Sunday afternoon in Patiala. The oath ceremony for the new Punjab cabinet is to take place on Sunday evening in Chandigarh.In 2018, Rana Gurjit Singh, who then held power and irrigation portfolios in the Punjab cabinet, was dropped amid a controversy over sand mining auction. In the letter, the MLAs said that he was dropped due to a mining scandal involving him, his family and his companies directly.“The Punjab government had forfeited approximately ₹25 crore deposited by his front company Rajbir Enterprises for the auction of 3 sand-mining sites in Punjab. Justice Narang commission brought out a startling fact that the front company of Rana Gurjeet Singh, Rajbir Enterprises had received ₹5 crore gratification for the said mining auction from Gurinder Singh, who was charged by the vigilance bureau in the purported irrigation scam”, the letter read.It also questioned if including Singh in the cabinet was right when the corruption charges against him still stood.“It is amusing that the three ministers proposed to be included in the Cabinet from Doaba region include only Jatt Sikhs and an Other Backward Caste (OBC) Sikh, whereas there is approximately 38% Dalit population in this region. We all request you to immediately drop Rana Gurjit Singh’s name and instead include a clean Dalit face in view of the upcoming elections,” the letter concluded.When contacted, Mohinder Singh KayPee said he had not signed the letter. When asked about his views on Rana Gurjit Singh’s proposed inclusion, he reluctantly said that he was not aware of it and didn’t want to say anything on it. Meanwhile, three MLAs in the group that wrote the letter claimed that KayPee was with them on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cabinet-6-mla-oppose-rana-gurjit-singh-s-proposed-elevation-as-minister-101632640776330.html

26-09-2021||India||Cleanliness is a tribute to Gandhi: Text of PM's speech on 81st Mann Ki Baat||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the campaign for cleanliness continuously gave energy to the nation's freedom movement and it is a great tribute by this country to Mahatma Gandhi. “Mahatma Gandhi had connected cleanliness to the dream of Independence. Today after so many decades, the cleanliness movement has once again connected the country to the dream of a new India,” PM Modi said during his 81st episode of radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’.Here is the full text of PM Modi's 81st Mann Ki Baat:My dear countrymen, Namaskar. You are aware that for an important programme, I have to leave for America…hence I thought it would be apt to record Mann Ki Baat, prior to my departure to America. The day of Mann Ki Baat this September is important on another count, date wise. Routinely, we do remember a lot of days; we even celebrate myriad Days…and if you ask young sons-daughters at home, they are likely to furnish an entire list of Days of the year with their chronological relevance! But, there is one more day that all of us must remember; this day is one that is immensely congruent to the traditions of India. It’s one that connects us with our traditions that we have been following for centuries. That is – World Rivers Day.It has been articulated here – Pibanti Naddhah, Swayameva Naambha…meaning that rivers do not drink their own water…they give it away altruistically. For us, rivers are not mere physical entities; for us a river is a living unit…and that is exactly why we refer to rivers as Mother! Numerous festivals, festive occasions, functions of ours, occasions to rejoice take place in the very laps of these mothers.All of you are aware – with the advent of the month of Magh, in our country, a lot of people perform Kalpvaas on the banks of mother Ganga or other rivers for an entire month. This tradition has ceased now…but in earlier times, it was customary to remember rivers while bathing at home. This tradition of remembering rivers may have gone extinct or exists sparsely…but there used to be a great tradition that would take one on a tour across the vastness of India while bathing early morning…a cerebral pilgrimage! It used to be a source of inspiration to connect with every nook and corner of the country. And of course, in India, it has been customary to chant a Shlok while bathing:Gange cha yamune chaiva Godavari saraswatiNarmade Sindhu Kaveri Jale asmin sannidhim kuruEarlier, at our homes, the elderly in the family would make children memorise the Shlok …this also led to germinating Aastha, faith towards rivers in our country. It would inscribe an illustrated map of the great land of India on the psyche. That used to establish an emotional connection with rivers. It would result in nurturing a harmonious credence towards the very river that embodied the Mother, sentimentally as well as visually…as a way of life too! It was a way to instill ‘Sanskaar’; the value system gamut.Friends, now that we are discussing the significance of rivers in our country, it is but natural for everyone to raise a question…one, in fact, has the right to do so…and answering that question is our responsibility too! Anyone can question – “you are singing so many songs dedicated to rivers, referring to a river as a Mother…then why is it that the river gets polluted? Our scriptures distinctly disapprove of polluting rivers, even a bit! And our traditions have been synchronous with the thought. You know, of course, that the western region of our India, especially Gujarat and Rajasthan, suffer from scarcity of water. They face famines, many a time. Now that is why, a new tradition has developed in the social life there. For example, when it starts raining in Gujarat, Jal-Jeelani Ekadashi is celebrated there. This means, it is synonymous with what we term as ‘Catch the Rain’ in today’s times…accumulating each and every drop of water…Jal-jeelani. On similar lines, after the rains, in Bihar and other regions of the East, the great festival of Chhatth is celebrated. I hope that keeping the Chatth Pooja in mind, preparations for cleaning and repairing riverbanks and Ghats would have commenced. We can very well undertake the endeavour of cleaning rivers and freeing them of pollution with collective effort and support. The Namami Gange Mission too is making advances today…collective efforts of all, in a way, mass awareness; a mass movement has a major role to play in that.Friends, when one is referring to the river; when Mother Ganga is being talked about, one is tempted to draw your attention to another aspect. When Namami Gange is being referred to, one thing is certain to draw your attention…especially that of the youth. These days, a special E-auction is being held. This electronic auction pertains to gifts presented to me by people from time to time. The money that accrues through this E-auction is dedicated solely to the Namami Gange Campaign. The affectionate, warm spirit, with which you present me gifts …that very sentiment gets bolstered through this campaign.Friends, in order to rejuvenate rivers throughout the country; in order to cleanse waters, the government and social service organizations keep undertaking one endeavour or the other. And this is not about the present day; it has been going on for decades now. There are some people who have dedicated themselves to these causes. And it is this very tradition, this very endeavour, this very faith that has saved our rivers. Whenever such news comes to my notice, from any corner of India, it evokes immense respect in my heart for people who embark upon such tasks…and I also feel like sharing that with you. Take a look at Vellore and Thiruvannamalai districts of Tamilnadu, whose example I wish to cite. A river named Naagnadi flows there. Years ago, the Naagnadi had all dried up. Because of that, the water level there had gone down terribly. But, the womenfolk there took up the cudgels to rejuvenate their river. And then…lo and behold – they got people connected, dug up canals through public participation, constructed check dams and recharge-wells. Friends, you too would be glad to know that today, the river is brimming with water. And truly, when a river is full of water, it lends such tranquility to the mind…I have actually witnessed the experience…Many of you might be aware that on the very banks of river Sabarmati, Mahatma Gandhi set up the Sabarmati Ashram…during the last few decades, the river had dried up. 6 to 8 months a year, no water was even visible there. But river Narmada and river Sabarmati were linked…today, if you go to Ahmedabad, the waters of river Sabarmati fill one’s heart with such joy! Similarly, our sisters from Tamil Nadu are undertaking myriad such tasks…many such tasks are being done in various corners of the country. I know for sure that many of our saints, our gurus associated with our religious traditions are doing a lot for the sake of water and rivers, along with their spiritual pursuits…many of them are running campaigns to plant trees along riverbanks…at places, dirty water is being prevented from flowing into rivers.Friends, when we are celebrating ‘World River Day’ today, I praise and greet all dedicated to this work. But to all people living near every river; to countrymen I will urge that in India in all corners at least once in a year a river festival must be celebrated.My dear countrymen, never make the mistake of treating minor issues, little things as small. Through tiny efforts, at times, very significant changes occur, and if we look towards the life of Mahatma Gandhi ji we will find every moment how even small things had so much importance and how using small issues he accomplished big resolutions. Our youth today must know how the campaign for cleanliness continuously gave energy to our freedom movement. It was Mahatma Gandhi who turned cleanliness into a mass movement.Mahatma Gandhi had connected cleanliness to the dream of Independence. Today after so many decades, the cleanliness movement has once again connected the country to the dream of a new India. And this is also becoming a campaign to change our habits too and we must not forget that this cleanliness is a programme. This cleanliness is a responsibility of the transition of sanskar from generation to generation and when the campaign for cleanliness continues generation after generation in the entire society cleanliness as a trait gets imbibed. And that is why this is not a subject of a year or two; of one government or the other government. Generation after generation, with alertness, continually, without being tired or stopping, with high reverence we have to remain associated with cleanliness and continue the campaign for cleanliness. And I have said earlier too that this cleanliness is a great tribute by this country to revered Bapu and we have to keep paying this tribute every time; continuously.Friends, people know that I don’t ever let go any chance to speak in connection with cleanliness and possibly that is why a listener of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, Shriman Ramesh Patel ji has written to me that learning from Bapu, in this “Amrit Mahotsav” of freedom, we should take the resolve of economic cleanliness too. The way the building of toilets enhances the dignity of poor, similarly economic cleanliness ensures rights of the poor; eases their life. You are aware of the campaign that the country started regarding Jan Dhan accounts. Today, because of this the rightful money of the poor is getting credited directly into their accounts and because of this, obstacles like corruption have reduced very significantly. It is true that technology can help a lot in economic cleanliness. It is a matter of delight for us that even in villages, the common person is getting connected in the direction of digital transactions through fin-tech UPI… its prevalence has begun increasing. I will tell you a figure which will make you proud; during last August, 355 crore UPI transactions took place in one month, that is more than nearly 350 crore transactions, that is, we can say that during the month of August UPI was used for digital transactions more than 350 crore times. Today, on an average, digital payments of more than 2 lakh crore Rupees are happening through UPI. Through this the economy of the country is acquiring cleanliness and transparency, and we all know that now the importance of fin-tech is increasing a lot.Friends, Bapu had connected cleanliness with independence; the same way he had made khadi the identity of freedom. Today in the 75 th year of freedom when we are celebrating the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence, we can say with satisfaction today that our young generation today is giving khaadi the place of pride that khadi had during the freedom struggle. Today the production of khadi andhandloom has increased multiple times and its demand too has increased. You too know that there were many such occasions when business of more than a crore rupees has been transacted in the khadi showroom in Delhi. I too would like to remind you again that on the 2 nd of October, on revered Bapu’s birth anniversary, let us together aim for another new record. In your city wherever khadi is sold, handloom is sold, handicraft is sold and now that the festival of Diwali is there.., for the festive season, every khadi, handloom, cottage industry purchase of yours should strengthen the campaign for ‘Vocal for Local’, it should break all old records.Friends, in this period of Amrit Mahotsav, a campaign to disseminate to everyone the untold stories of the history of freedom is also going on… and for this, upcoming writers, youth of the country and the world were called upon. For this more than 13 thousand people have registered till now and that too in 14 different languages. And for me a thing of joy also is that non-resident Indians from more than 20 countries have expressed their wish to join this campaign. There is another interesting information- more than nearly 5000 upcoming writers are searching out tales of struggle for freedom. They have taken the lead to write something on those who are unsung heroes, who are un-named, whose names don’t appear on the pages of history, on the theme of such unsung heroes, on their lives, on those events, that is the youth of the country have decided to bring forth the history of those freedom fighters who were not even discussed during the last 75 years. I appeal to all the listeners; I appeal to all those connected with the field of education. You too motivate the youth. You too come forward and it is my firm belief that during the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence the people who are working for writing history will make history as well.My dear countrymen, we all know about the Siachen Glacier. The cold there is so terrible that it is beyond the capacity of a common person to live there. With snow spread far and wide, there is no sign of any vegetation anywhere. The temperature here dips to even minus 60 degrees. A few days ago, the feat that a team of 8 Divyang persons performed in this inaccessible region of Siachen is a matter of pride for every countryman. This team created a world record by hoisting its flag on the Kumar Post situated at an altitude of more than 15 thousand feet at the Siachen glacier.Despite the challenges of physical ability, the feats that these Divyangs have achieved are an inspiration for the whole country and when you get to know about the members of this team, you will also be filled with courage and enthusiasm, just like I was.The names of these brave Divyangs are – Mahesh Nehra, Akshat Rawat of Uttarakhand, Pushpak Gawande of Maharashtra, Ajay Kumar of Haryana, Lobsang Chospel of Ladakh, Major Dwarkesh of Tamil Nadu, Irfan Ahmed Mir of Jammu and Kashmir and Chongjin Ingmo of Himachal Pradesh. This operation to conquer the Siachen Glacier has been successful because of the veterans of the special forces of the Indian Army. I commend the team for this historic and unprecedented achievement. It also shows the spirit of our countrymen to tackle every challenge with a “Can Do Culture”, a “Can Do Determination” and a “Can Do Attitude”.Friends, today many efforts are being made for the welfare of Divyangjan in the country. I got a chance to know about one such effort being made in Uttar Pradesh - “One Teacher, One Call”. This unique effort in Bareilly is showing a new path to the Divyang children. This campaign is being led by the principal of a school in Dabhaura Gangapur, Deepmala Pandey ji. During the Corona period, due to this campaign, not only did the admission of a large number of children become possible, more than 350 teachers have also joined it with a spirit of service. These teachers go from village to village calling for Divyang children, looking out for them and then ensuring their admission in one school or the other. I deeply appreciate this noble effort of Deepmala ji and her fellow teachers for the sake of Divyangjans. Every such effort in the field of education is going to shape the future of our country.My dear countrymen, the condition of our lives today is such that the word Corona resonates in our ears many times a day… the biggest global pandemic in a hundred years, COVID-19 has taught every countryman a lot. Today there has been an increase in curiosity and awareness about Healthcare and Wellness. Traditionally natural products which are beneficial for wellness and health are available in abundance in our country. Patayat Sahu ji, who lives in Nandol, Kalahandi, Odisha, has been doing unique work in this area for years. He has planted medicinal plants on one and a half acres of land. Not only this, Sahu ji has also carried out documentation of these medicinal plants. Satish ji of Ranchi has shared another similar information to me through a letter. Satish ji has drawn my attention to an Aloe Vera Village in Jharkhand. The women of Deori village near Ranchi had undergone training in Aloe Vera cultivation from Birsa Agricultural School under the leadership of Manju Kachhap ji. After this they started cultivating aloe vera. Not only did this farming benefit in the field of health; the income of these women also increased. They had good income even during the Covid pandemic. One of the major reasons for this was that the companies making sanitizers were buying Aloe Vera directly from them. Today a team of about forty women is involved in this work. And Aloe Vera is cultivated over many acres. Whether it is Patayat Sahu ji of Odisha or this team of women in Deori, the way they have linked agriculture with the field of health is an example in itself.Friends, the 2nd of October also marks the birth anniversary of Lal Bahadur Shastri ji. In his memory, this day also teaches us about those who attempt new experiments in agriculture. To promote start-ups in the field of medicinal plants, an Incubator by the name of Medi-Hub TBI is operational in Anand, Gujarat. In a very short time, this Incubator associated with medicinal and aromatic plants has supported the business idea of 15 entrepreneurs. Sudha Chebrolu ji has launched her start-up only after getting the help of this Incubator. Priority is given to women in this company and they are also responsible for innovative herbal formulations. Another such entrepreneur is Subhashree ji who has also received help from this Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Incubator. Subhashree ji's company is working in the field of herbal room and car fresheners. She has also created a herbal terrace garden which has more than 400 medicinal herbs.Friends, the Ministry of Ayush has taken an interesting initiative to increase awareness about Medicinal and Herbal Plants among children and Professor Ayushman ji has taken the lead. It is possible that you must be wondering who Professor Ayushman is! Actually Professor Ayushman is the name of a comic book. In this, short stories have been prepared through different cartoon characters. Along with this, the usefulness of healthy medicinal plants like Aloe Vera, Tulsi, Amla, Giloy, Neem, Ashwagandha and Brahmi has been mentioned. Friends, in the current context, with the trend of people around the world regarding medicinal plants and herbal products increasing, India has immense potential. In the past, there has been a significant increase in the export of Ayurvedic and herbal products.I urge scientists, researchers and people associated with the start-up world to pay attention to such products, which not only increase the wellness and immunity of the people, but also help in increasing the income of our farmers and youth.Friends, moving beyond traditional farming, novel initiatives and options are being done in agriculture and are continuously creating new means of self-employment. The story of two brothers from Pulwama is also an example of this. The way Bilal Ahmed Sheikh and Munir Ahmed Sheikh found new avenues for themselves in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, they are an example of New India.39 years old Bilal Ahmed ji is highly qualified, he has obtained many degrees. He is now using his experience of higher education by launching his own start-up in agriculture.Bilal ji has installed a unit of Vermi composting at his home. The bio-fertilizer prepared from this unit has not only benefited a lot in agriculture ; it has also brought employment opportunities to the people.Every year, farmers are getting about three thousand quintals of Vermicompost from the units managed by these brothers. Today 15 people are also working in this Vermicomposting unit. A large number of people are reaching to see this unit, and most of them are young people who want to do something in the agriculture sector. The Sheikh brothers of Pulwama took a pledge to become a job creator instead of a job seeker and today they are showing a new path not only to Jammu and Kashmir, but to the people across the country as well.My dear countrymen, the 25th of September is the birth anniversary of a great son of the country, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji. Deen Dayal ji is one of the greatest thinkers of the last century.His economic philosophy, his policies aimed at empowering the society, the path of Antyodaya shown by him remain as relevant in the present context and are also inspirational. Three years ago, on his birth anniversary, the 25th of September, the world's largest health assurance scheme – Ayushman Bharat scheme was implemented. Today, more than two and a half crore impoverished people of the country have got free treatment up to ₹5 lakh in the hospital under the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Such a massive scheme for the poor is dedicated to the Antyodaya philosophy of Deen Dayal ji. If the youth of today inculcate values and ideals into their lives, it can be of great benefit to them. Once in Lucknow, Deen Dayal ji had said – “How many good things, good qualities there are – we derive all these from the society itself. We have to pay the debt of society, we must think on these lines .” That is, Deen Dayal ji taught us that we take so much from society, from the country, whatever it be, it is only because of the country ; thus we should think about how we will repay our debt towards the country. This is a significant message for today's youth.Friends, from the life of Deen Dayal ji, we also get a lesson to never give up. Despite the adverse political and ideological circumstances, he never wavered from the vision of a Swadeshi, home grown model for the development of India. Today many young people want to move ahead by breaking away from the oft-treaded paths. They want to do things their own way. Deen Dayal ji's life can teach them a lot. That is why I urge our youngsters to definitely know about him.My dear countrymen, we touched upon many topics today. Like we were discussing, the time to come is for festivals. The whole country is also going to celebrate the festival of the victory over untruth by Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram. But during this festival we have to remember about one more fight - that is the country's fight against Corona. Team India is making new records everyday in this fight. With regards to Vaccination, the country has made many such records which are being talked about the world over. Every Indian has an important role in this fight. We have to get the vaccine administered when our turn comes, but we also have to take care that no one is left out of this circle of safety. Those around you who have not got vaccinated also have to be taken to the vaccine center. Even after getting vaccinated, the necessary protocol has to be followed. I hope that once again Team India will keep the flag flying high in this fight. Next time, we will discuss some more topics in ‘Mann Ki Baat’. Wishing you all, every countryman the best for the forthcoming festivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cleanliness-is-a-tribute-to-gandhi-text-of-pm-s-speech-on-81st-mann-ki-baat-101632637847077.html
26-09-2021||India||World Rivers Day 2021: All you need to know||Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated a significant portion of the latest episode of his Mann Ki Baat radio address to World Rivers Day, which is being observed on Sunday. PM Modi, in fact, began his speech by acknowledging the occasion, and used early parts of his address to highlight the significance of rivers and the need to ensure their cleanliness.Also Read | On Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi urges people to observe World Rivers DayHere's all you need to know about this day:(1.) The website worldriversday.com describes the occasion as a “celebration of the world's waterways.” The day highlights “the many values of our rivers” and strives to increase public awareness about all rivers in the world, says the website.(2.) The maiden celebration of World Rivers Day took place in 2005, following the launch that year of the Water for Life Decade, by the United Nations. The proposal for such a celebration was initiated by renowned Canadian river advocate Mark Angelo.(3.) Since being celebrated by dozens of countries 16 years ago, the day has continued to grow, and, in 2020, was celebrated by millions of people in up to 100 countries.(4.) World Rivers Day is based on BC Rivers Day, founded and led by Angelo in his native country since 1980. The “BC” here refers to the Canadian province of British Columbia. The festival is the largest river appreciation event in the North American nation.(5.) However, it is to be noted that September 26 is not the fixed date for World Rivers Day celebrations. This is because the Canadian event takes place on fourth Sunday of September every year. Therefore, its global counterpart, the world's largest river festival, too, is observed on fourth Sunday in the ninth month of every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-rivers-day-2021-all-you-need-to-know-101632635277189.html
26-09-2021||India||Cleanliness is a responsibility to transfer values: PM Modi in Mann Ki Baat||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said cleanliness is a responsibility to transfer values through generations. “Cleanliness is a responsibility to transfer values through generations and when it is being followed, it becomes the characteristic of the entire social life,” PM Modi said during the 81st episode of his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat.PM Modi also said that he doesn't ever let go of any chance to speak about cleanliness. “…possibly that is why a listener, Ramesh Patel ji has written to me that learning from Bapu, in this Amrit Mahotsav of freedom, we should take a resolution of economic cleanliness too,” he added.The Prime Minister urged the people to follow the principles of Mahatma Gandhi "who had done the work of making cleanliness a mass movement" and keep the rivers clean. "In our scriptures, even a little pollution in the rivers is said to be wrong," he said.'Bapu' (Mahatma Gandhi) was a proponent of cleanliness, he made cleanliness a mass movement and associated it with the dream of independence," PM Modi added.PM Modi launched the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' (Clean India Mission) on October 2, 2014, on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's 145th birth anniversary.In his August 29th address of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, PM Modi had asked the citizens of the country to maintain the momentum of 'Swachh Bharat' mission, especially in the times of Covid-19 pandemic.The radio programme comes after his recently concluded visit to the United States where he addressed the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cleanliness-is-a-responsibility-to-transfer-values-pm-modi-in-mann-ki-baat-101632634982085.html
26-09-2021||India||Sonia Gandhi could have named Sharad Pawar PM in 2004: Ramdas Athawale||Union minister Ramdas Athawale, often known for his controversial remarks, said on Saturday that the fuss over Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi being of foreign origin is “meaningless”. Pointing out that if Indian-origin Kamala Harris could become the vice president of the United States, the RPI(A) chief asked why Sonia Gandhi cannot become the prime minister of India. Following this line of reasoning, Athawale said that Sonia Gandhi could have become the prime minister of India when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) won a majority after the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.“When the UPA got a majority in the 2004 elections, I had proposed that Sonia Gandhi should become prime minister,” Athawale told reporters in Indore. “I was of the view that her foreign origin issue had no meaning.”“If Kamala Harris can become the vice president of the US, then why couldn't Sonia Gandhi, a citizen of India, the wife of Rajiv Gandhi (a former prime minister) and elected Lok Sabha MP, become the Prime Minister?" Athawale was quoted as saying by the PTI news agency.Athawale also said that after the 2004 elections, if Sonia Gandhi was not willing to take up the post of prime minister, veteran politician, and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar could also have been asked to take the office instead of Manmohan Singh. Incidentally, Union minister and RPI(A) chief Athawale's comments came a day ahead of former prime minister Manmohan Singh's birthday on September 26.The Union minister said that had Pawar become the country's prime minister in 2004, the Congress' position would have been strengthened and that party could have been saved from its present precarious condition. Praising the NCP chief for his role as a veteran public leader and calling him a deserving candidate for the prime ministerial post, Athawale said, “He [Pawar] should have been made PM in place of Manmohan Singh but Sonia Gandhi did not do so.”Notably, Sharad Pawar was expelled from Congress in 1999 for raising the issue of Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin. He later formed the NCP. Manmohan Singh served as prime minister from 2004 to 2014 and was succeeded by Narendra Modi after the BJP came to power with a resounding majority.Athawale also appealed to Amarinder Singh, who stepped down recently as Punjab chief minister owing to a power tussle in the state party unit, to join the BJP or the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in view of "humiliation" meted out to him by Congress. “If Singh joins the BJP, the party's position will be strengthened in the upcoming Assembly elections in Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-could-have-named-sharad-pawar-pm-in-2004-ramdas-athawale-101632630570746.html

If you ask the young sons and daughters in your house, they will be able to give you a list of such days. But there is one more day that we all should remember and this day is consistent with the traditions of India,” PM Modi, who concluded his official three-day visit to the United States, said during the 81st edition of Mann Ki Baat. "It is about connecting with the traditions with which we have been associated for centuries. This is World Rivers Day," he added. World Rivers Day is observed on the fourth Sunday of every September and celebrates the world’s waterways. According to the site dedicated to the day, it highlights the many values of rivers and strives to increase public awareness and encourages the improved stewardship of rivers around the world.Also read | In Mann ki Baat, PM Modi urges people to cherish and preserve SanskritPM Modi also said that proceeds from the ongoing special e-auction of the gifts he receives will be dedicated to the government’s flagship project 'Namami Gange'. The government has set up a dedicated site — pmmementos.gov.in —  to display and e-auction the mementoes that are priced between ₹100 and ₹30,000. Visitors to the site can filter through the mementoes on the basis of the price range."The spirit with which you give me gifts, this campaign will be strengthened with the same spirit… The work of cleaning rivers and making them pollution-free can be done with everyone's effort and cooperation. The Namami Gange Mission is also progressing and so the efforts of everyone; public awareness, and mass movement, plays a big role," he added.Namami Gange is the Centre's integrated conservation and rejuvenation programme launched in June 2014.The Prime Minister said that our scriptures warn against polluting rivers and the country’s western part, especially Gujarat and Rajasthan, where there is a severe shortage of water have started following a new tradition. “As the rain begins in Gujarat, we celebrate Jal Jhulni Ekadashi. This means that in today's era, what we call 'Catch the Rain' is the same thing as capturing every drop of water or Jal Jhulni.”The Prime Minister also urged people to follow the principles of Mahatma Gandhi, who he said worked towards making cleanliness a mass movement, and keep the rivers clean.Last month, PM Modi talked about Sanskrit, legendary hockey player Major Dhyanchand, forays made by young Indian entrepreneurs in the field of space and India’s growing startup ecosystem during the Mann Ki Baat programme. The Prime Minister also urged the country to continuously maintain its commitment to the Swacchh Bharat, or Clean India campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-mann-ki-baat-pm-modi-urges-people-to-celebrate-and-honour-rivers-101632634361318.html
26-09-2021||India||‘Decision soon’, says TS Singh Deo on Chhattisgarh power-sharing formula||In light of the political uncertainty over the reported two-and-a-half-year power-sharing formula between Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and health minister TS Singh Deo, the latter on Saturday said that the issue will be resolved soon. “…This question (power-sharing formula) comes up each time and everywhere, hence I believe that the solution will come soon” said Singh Deo, responding to a media question. Singhdeo further said, “...if the media is asking what will happen next, it is after listening to what people are discussing in the state (about the power-sharing formula) …. I just want to appeal that the people should not get distracted by these things and (know) that we are working for the welfare of the people and whatever happens next, the welfare will continue.” Earlier, both Singh Deo and Baghel were seen in a programme organised by the Chhattisgarh unit of the Indian Pharmaceutical Association in Raipur on Saturday. Baghel, during the programme, responded to a bunch of his supporters’ slogan of “Kaka Zindbad” (Long Live Kaka), in his speech and said, “Kaka Abhi Zinda hai” (Kaka is still alive). The video clip of Baghel’s statement was widely shared by his supporters and leaders of Baghel camp on Twitter and Facebook. Baghel himself also shared the clip on his Twitter and Facebook accounts, making it a political statement. “Baghel is trying to assert to his supporters that he is still the CM of the state to address their confusion over the issue (power-sharing row). I believe that it is better for the high command to take a decision over the power-sharing formula as soon as possible,” said Sudeip Shrivastava, a political commentator based in Chhattisgarh. In the same programme, Singh Deo also praised Baghel and said that the CM redressed all demands of all departments of the state and was very sensitive towards them. “...this is the reason that the CM sanctioned 3,900 posts for the health department… Chhattisgarh is now leading in many fields in the leadership of honourable CM …People in the country are now talking about Chhattisgarh Model,” Singh Deo said in his speech. On August 28, in a long meeting with the Congress high command over suggestions that Baghel should step aside because of a two and a half-year power-sharing agreement with Singhdeo, Baghel seemed to have bought some time. He said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will visit the state next week, especially Bastar, to see for himself the work that was being done. The next day, when Singhdeo returned, he said he too had spoken to the leadership and they had “reserved their decision” on the matter. In December 2018, in the aftermath of a dominant Congress performance with the party winning 68 of the 90 assembly seats in the state, choosing a chief minister became a problem in Chhattisgarh with four state leaders, Baghel, home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, speaker Charan Das Mahant and Singh Deo all eyeing the chief minister’s post. After Mahant settled for the speaker’ s position, continued friction between Baghel and Singh Deo initially tilted the scale in Sahu’s favour, however, realising that a third leader will be advantaged in this political fight, Baghel and Singh Deo, along with Punia and Gandhi, reportedly arrived at a power-sharing arrangement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decision-soon-says-ts-singh-deo-on-chhattisgarh-power-sharing-formula-101632634896725.html

Singh, the brain behind the 1991 economic reforms as the Union finance minister under then prime minister PV Narasimha Rao, was a surprise choice of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) after it won the 2004 general elections by defeating the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).On his birthday, his party, the Congress, took to Twitter to wish the celebrated economist, dedicating several posts to the Rajya Sabha MP. “The words of Dr Manmohan Singh exemplify the vision of a true Indian leader. Today, as we celebrate his birthday, we renew our commitment to uphold the idea of India,” the party said in one of its tweets. The words of Dr. Manmohan Singh exemplify the vision of a true Indian leader.

From 1982 to 1985, he was the governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and, from 1985 to 1987, was the deputy chairperson of the Planning Commission. In 1991, he was appointed as the chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC).Singh's term as prime minister came to an end in 2014, when the BJP, under his successor and incumbent PM Narendra Modi, won general elections that year.

26-09-2021||India||Cyclone Gulab: Here are dos and don'ts ahead of a cyclonic storm||Cyclone Gulab will make landfall by Sunday evening, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said and issued an orange alert for Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.“The Cyclonic Storm 'Gulab' over northwest and adjoining westcentral Bay of Bengal moved nearly westwards lay centered at 0530 hrs IST of 26th Sep, over northwest and adjoining westcentral Bay of Bengal about 270 km east-southeast of Gopalpur & 330 km east of Kalingapatnam,” the IMD said in its latest bulletin.The IMD has issued several do’s and don’ts to ensure the safety of citizens.Here are the dos and don'ts to be followed in case of a cyclone:Dos1. The IMD advises people to check houses, secure loose tiles by cementing wherever necessary and repair doors and windows.2. Check the area around the house. Remove dead or dying trees, anchor removable objects like lumber piles, loose bricks, garbage cans, sign-boards, loose zinc sheets etc, the IMD said in its list of precautions.3. Keep some wooden boards ready so that glass windows can be boarded. If you do not have wooden boards handy, paste paper strips on glasses to prevent splinters from flying into the house.4. Keep a hurricane lantern filled with kerosene, flashlight and enough dry cells and keep them handy.5. Promptly demolish condemned buildings.6. Those who have radio sets should ensure that the radio is fully serviceable. In the case of transistors an extra set of batteries should be kept handy. Keep your radio on and listen to latest weather warnings and advisories from the nearest AIR station. Pass only the official information you have got from the radio to others.7. Get away from low lying beaches or other locations which may be swept by high tides or storm waves. Leave sufficiently early before your way to the high ground gets flooded. Do not delay and run the risk of being marooned.8. Be alert for high water in areas where streams of rivers may flood due to heavy rains.9. Get extra food, especially things which can be eaten without cooking or with very little preparation. Store extra drinking water in a covered vessel.10. If you are in one of the evacuation areas, move your valuable articles to the upper floors to minimise flood damage.11. Check on everything that might blow away or be torn loose. Kerosene tins, cans, agricultural implements, garden tools, road signs and other objects become weapons of destruction in strong winds. Remove them and store them in a covered room.12. Make provisions for children and adults requiring special diets.13. If the centre of the 'eye' of the storm passes directly over your place, there will be a lull in the wind and rain, lasting for half an hour or more. During this period stay in a safe place. Make emergency repairs during the lull period if necessary, but remember that strong wind will return suddenly from the opposite direction, frequently with even greater violence.14. The IMD advises people to be calm and to remain in shelters until informed by those in charge that one may return home.15. Any loose and dangling wire from the lamp post should be strictly avoided.16. People should keep away from disaster areas unless one is required to assist.17. Anti-social elements should be prevented from doing mischief and reported to the police.18. Cars, buses, lorries and carts should be driven carefully.19. The houses and dwellings should be cleared of debris.20. The losses should be reported to the appropriate authorities.21. Relatives should be promptly informed about the safety of the persons in the disaster area. Don'ts1. The IMD advises people to avoid being misled by rumours.2. Don't leave shelters until informed by the rescue personals.3. Don't leave the safe places.4. Minor repairs can be carried out.5. Don't touch loose and dangling wires from lamp posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-gulab-here-are-dos-and-don-ts-ahead-of-a-cyclonic-storm-101632627284278.html
26-09-2021||India||Bharat Bandh: Which political parties support September 27 farmers' strike?||The Bharat Bandh or the nationwide strike declared by farmers on September 27 to protest against the three central farm laws has garnered support from several political parties. The strike on Monday, which is to be led by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) – an umbrella body of farmers' unions spearheading the anti-farm law protests – has now received support from the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Andhra Pradesh government; meanwhile, the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). And the Left parties have already extended support to the Bharat Bandh earlier.YSR CongressThe YSR Congress-led Andhra Pradesh government is the latest political quarter to throw its weight behind the September 27 Bharat Bandh called by the farmers.The announcement was made by Andhra Pradesh information and transport minister Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani) said on Saturday. He said that the state government, led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, has extended its ‘full support’ to the Bharat Bandh on September 27 in solidarity with the concerns of farmers. Additionally, the Andhra Pradesh government is also supporting the concerns of the Visakhapatnam steel plant workers, who have been opposing privatisation attempts by the central government.In view of this, Nani said the Andhra Pradesh government has decided to stop APSRTC buses across the state from September 26 midnight to September 27 afternoon. The minister, however, appealed for peaceful protests in the Bandh.Aam Aadmi PartyThe AAP has also supported the Bharat Bandh call issued by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha on September 27. Announcing the party's support for the nationwide strike in solidarity with the farmers, AAP leader Raghav Chadha said on Saturday that party supremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has always stood by the farmers against the “black laws.”CongressThe Congress on Saturday extended its support to the Bharat Bandh and demanded that discussions be initiated with the protesters. Calling for a “peaceful” strike, Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said the party and all its workers are in support of the Bharat Bandh call given by farmer unions against the Centre's three farm laws.The Congress leader also demanded that the MSP should be given as a legal right to every farmer “as they do not want only 'jumlas' (rhetoric)” and referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise to double the farmers' income by 2022.Telugu Desam Party and Left partiesn a bid to make Bharat Bandh called by San successful, a meeting was held on Wednesday at Andhra Pradesh's Communist Party India (CPI) office by left parties, Congress, and Telugu Desam Party (TDP).During the meeting, Donepudi Sankar, CPI State leader said, “Farmers have been agitating for nine months in Delhi, so this Bharat Bandh will be held to support them.”In a joint statement, the Left parties – the CPI, CPI(M), All India Forward Bloc, Revolutionary Socialist Party, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) – urged people to extend support to the Bharat Bandh, noting that the “historic” farmers' struggle demanding the repeal of the agri-laws is now in its tenth month.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav extends supportLeader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav extended his support to Samyukta Kisan Morcha's (SKM) call for Bharat Bandh on September 27.In a tweet on Friday, Tejashwi Yadav said, “In the meeting of the top leaders of the Mahagathbandhan parties held at the residence today, it was unanimously decided to participate and support the Bharat Bandh called by the United Kisan Morcha on September 27, in protest against the anti-farmer policies of the NDA government. We are firm with the farmers.”Meanwhile, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday denounced the call for Bharat Bandh by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha against the Centre's three contentious farm laws on September 27, saying disrupting economic activities post-Covid-19 was not in the interest of the nation.The Bharat Bandh has been called by the farmer unions to protest the three contentious agricultural laws passed by the central government, against which the farmers have been demonstrating The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers' protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.The three laws—The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020—were passed by the Parliament in September last year.Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the mandi and minimum support price (MSP) procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced and asserted that these steps will help increase farmers' income. The Supreme Court in January stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a panel to resolve the impasse. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-which-political-parties-support-september-27-farmers-strike-101632626399511.html
26-09-2021||India||‘Need to break mental walls to avoid another trauma of partition’: Ram Madhav||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary Ram Madhav on Saturday said “mental walls of separation” within the country needed to be pulled down and elements backing “separatism” and “communal separation” needed to be discouraged to build one united Indian society and avoid another trauma of partition.While speaking during a webinar hosted by the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), themed “India, Partition and its Aftermath: Remembering the Horrors of History”, Madhav described the partition as a “cataclysmic event” and a result of “errors of judgement”. He also alleged that Pakistan’s founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah was allowed to “grow into a monster” during the partition struggle.The event was held in the light of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to observe August 14 as the ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’ in the memory of the struggles and sacrifices of people during the partition.“Partition of India, unlike many other partitions seen in other countries in that period, was not a simple redrawing of boundaries... and it also took place on a false premise that Hindus and Muslims were separate nations, even though they had been living together despite their different practices...It is a known fact that the driving force behind India’s partition was the Muslim League. But it’s also a fact that the Muslim League never represented the entire Muslim community,” he said.Madhav added that there was a need to learn from the “mistakes of the past”, and attempts should be made to “build bridges”. “The Partition of India was not just a partition of territories but also a partition of minds... We need to build a united Indian society. And, that can happen only if the leadership and elements believing in separatism and communal separation are discouraged, and the sense of one nationhood is encouraged,” he said.“We need to pull down the walls of mental separation and create one united Indian society so that India shall not have to bear another trauma of partition. And, the next step will be to build bridges with those who left us to become another entity...We need to find ways to build bridges that will be the real undoing of the Partition. Maybe, geographical, political and physical boundaries will remain, but the mental boundaries, the boundaries of divided hearts can be erased,” he added.JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said the writings on the history of the partition of India are “largely influenced by western thought process and a prejudiced mindset”. “These historians seem to have underplayed and deliberately tried to suppress the fact that partition and creation of Pakistan was the result of religious fundamentalism and the idea of (a) religiously-defined community. In India, on the other hand, for centuries, we always welcomed and respected anyone irrespective of what personal faith they followed. The collective memories of suffering resulting from the partition of our country cannot be forgotten. It should be visited and revisited so that we learn lessons and should not repeat the horrific history,” Kumar said.A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member Of Parliament (MP) in Rajya Sabha and the president of Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) Vinay Sahasrabudhhe also participated in the webinar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-break-mental-walls-to-avoid-another-trauma-of-partition-ram-madhav-101632628293361.html

Air Canada is likely to operate the first direct flight between the two countries on Monday, whereas Air India will also resume services on the same day.Making that announcement, Transport Canada tweeted, “Beginning at 00:01 EDT on September 27, direct flights from India can land in Canada with additional public health measures in place.” That time translates to 9.30 am IST.“Travellers must have proof of a negative Covid-19 molecular test (RT-PCR) from the approved Genestrings laboratory at the Delhi airport, taken within 18 hours of the scheduled departure of their direct flight to Canada,” it added. They will have to “present the test report with a QR code issued by this laboratory to the air operator before boarding”, an updated travel advisory from the Canadian government stated.Those who “have previously tested positive for Covid-19 can present a positive molecular test report issued by a certified laboratory in India. The date of collection must be between 14 and 180 days before their scheduled departure to Canada”, it said.“Airlines will refuse boarding to any traveller who’s unable to meet these requirements,” it stressed.India’s high commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria welcomed the move and tweeted that it was “great to see a decisive step towards normalising air mobility” between the two countries. He added that they were “working with Canadian partners to further ease travel”.The ban was lifted after test results of passengers who flew to Canada from New Delhi on September 22 aboard three Air Canada flights came out to be negative.Prior to the ban in April, the two airlines were operating daily direct flights from India to Canada under an air bubble arrangement between the two governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiacanada-direct-flights-to-resume-with-air-canada-flight-from-delhi-101632623192446.html

The Union home minister will meet the chief ministers and hold a detailed discussion on the Maoist-affected areas in their respective states – including a review of the security situation in the fringe areas and the ongoing counter-insurgency operations against the Maoists.According to officials familiar with the development, those who have been invited for the day-long physical meeting at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi are the chief ministers of Chhattisgarh (Bhupesh Baghel), Maharashtra (Uddhav Thackeray), Jharkhand (Hemant Soren), Odisha (Naveen Patnaik), West Bengal (Mamata Banerjee), Telangana (K Chandrashekar Rao), Andhra Pradesh (Jagan Mohan Reddy), Madhya Pradesh (Shivraj Singh Chouhan), and Kerala (Pinarayi Vijayan).A media report, however, indicated that Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy might be missing from the meeting on Sunday after sustaining an injury.

I am confident the India-USA relationship will grow even stronger in the years to come. Our rich people-to-people linkages are among our strongest assets,” PM Modi tweeted ahead of his return from the United States.PM Modi addressed the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly, attended the first in-person Quad summit meeting and held bilateral and multilateral engagements, including with US President Joe Biden, US vice president Kamala Harris and his Australian and Japanese counterparts—Scott Morrison and Yoshihide Suga—respectively. The spokesperson of the ministry of external affairs (MEA) Arindam Bagchi said the Prime Minister’s US visit was “landmark".During his first visit to the US since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, PM Modi started his engagements on Thursday by meeting five top American corporate leaders from key sectors ranging from drones to 5G, semiconductor, and solar and encouraged them to step up their investments by highlighting the vast opportunities in India. Two of them were Indian Americans—Shantanu Narayen from Adobe and Vivek Lall from General Atomics. He also met Cristiano E Amon from Qualcomm, Mark Widmar from First Solar, and Stephen A Schwarzman from Blackstone.Watch PM Modi's full speech at UN General Assembly: Terrorism, China, climate, Covid highlightsPrime Minister Modi held his first in-person meeting with US vice president Kamala Harris at the White House on Thursday, a day ahead of his highly anticipated bilateral meet with US President Joe Biden. Modi praised Harris as a "source of inspiration" and extended an invitation to her to visit India. This was PM Modi's first in-person meeting with Harris after she made history by becoming the first Indian-origin person to become the vice president of America. Harris called upon Pakistan to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil to ensure they do not threaten the security of both the United States and India and underscored the need to closely monitor Islamabad’s support for terrorism.On Friday, Prime Minister Modi received a warm welcome from Biden at the White House as they held their first bilateral meeting. The two leaders discussed a wide range of priority issues, including combating the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, economic cooperation and ensure stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Biden said that the relationship between the two countries is “destined to be stronger, closer and tighter”, as PM Modi rolled out a 10-year road map for growing ties based on four Ts of talent, technology, trade, and trusteeship. Biden even recounted a story he has told many times before that of people in India with the same surname as his. Modi said that since Biden last told him about it, he got some research done into it and has brought along some genealogy documents for the president.Later that day, PM Modi attended a meeting of the leaders of the United States, Japan and Australia for the Quad Summit and pledged to work together for ensuring peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific and the world. President Biden said the four democracies have come together to take on common challenges from Covid-19 to climate. He also said that the group has democratic partners who share world views and have a common vision for the future.On Saturday, PM Modi addressed the UNGA session and cautioned about countries with “regressive thinking” that are using terrorism as a “political tool”. He called for efforts to ensure no country takes advantage of the “delicate situation” in Afghanistan for “its own selfish interests”. He did not name any county, but he was clearly pointing to Pakistan. He underscored the strength of India’s democracy as he talked about his own rise from a tea seller at a railway station to that as prime minister.PM Modi will bring home 157 artefacts and antiquities, which were handed over to India by the US during his visit. The Prime Minister and US President Biden expressed their commitment to strengthening efforts to combat theft, illicit trade and trafficking of cultural objects. According to an official statement on Saturday, nearly half of the artefacts are cultural, and the rest are figurines related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism—including the one-and-a-half metre bas relief panel of Revanta in sandstone of the 10th CE to the 8.5 cm tall, exquisite bronze Nataraja from the 12th CE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-return-home-after-landmark-us-visit-lists-strongest-assets-101632617241120.html

26-09-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee steps up attack against Congress for second consecutive day||West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee sharpened her attack against the Congress for the second consecutive day while campaigning for the Bhawanipore by-elections scheduled on September 30.“The Congress has got frightened. They sometimes manage you (BJP). But you cannot manage Mamata Banerjee,” she said during her poll campaign in Bhawanipore on Saturday.“TMC will work across the country. The Congress couldn’t. Only we can do it. To uproot the BJP from this country TMC alone is enough. We don’t want anyone else. If we have the public with us, we will fight, win and come back. This is my promise,” she said at a second meeting in Bhawanipore, while taking on the BJP. This comes less than a month after Congress president Sonia Gandhi called a virtual meeting with 19 ‘like-minded’ non-BJP parties on August 20. TMC chief Mamata Banerjee attended the meeting.On Friday, Banerjee had attacked the Congress saying that the BJP doesn’t consider them and hence no central agency went after any Congress leader other than former finance minister P Chidambaram.The Congress, however, has lashed out saying that Congress leaders were not involved in any scam like coal and cattle smuggling and hence the need of being arrested by a central agency never arose.This is, however, not the first time that the Congress has come under attack from the TMC despite the former not fielding any candidate against Banerjee for the Bhawanipore by-election.Earlier this month the chief minister’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee had attacked the Congress alleging: “If the BJP thinks that the TMC will get frightened, bow down and accept defeat like the Congress and other political parties, then let me tell them that TMC will fight with renewed vigour. We will expand to all the BJP-ruled states and take them head-on. Do whatever you can.”Then too, the Congress had objected saying that only inexperienced people talk in such a manner and beat their own drum.“Congress never said that we will need Mamata Banerjee to fight against the BJP. The fight between the Congress and the BJP is both political and ideological. Even a few years back Mamata Banerjee was in the BJP’s ministry at the Centre. She never admitted that she had done something wrong. Nor did she say that bringing the BJP to West Bengal was her biggest fault. She is a hypocrite,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-steps-up-attack-against-congress-for-second-consecutive-day-101632598401500.html
26-09-2021||India||Kanhaiya Kumar, Jignesh Mevani to join Congress on Sept 28||Youth leaders Jignesh Mevani from Gujarat and Kanhaiya Kumar from Bihar are set to join the Congress party on September 28 in New Delhi in the presence of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.Setting to rest speculations that they may join the party, Jignesh Mevani, Independent Dalit MLA from Gujarat said, “Yes, Kanhaiya and I are joining the Congress party in Delhi on September 28.”This follows their hectic parleys with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, a person familiar with the development said.When asked about the reason, he said, “This will be explained in a press conference on that day.” And answering a query on if they would join in the presence of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, as rumoured, Mevani said, “That would be the party’s decision.”Jignesh Mevani was elected from a reserved Scheduled Caste seat of Vadgam in North Gujarat’s Banaskantha district in 2017 as an Independent. Held by the Congress party, the seat was vacated for him.He recently inaugurated the state’s biggest 13,000-litre oxygen plant by any elected representative after a battle in the Gujarat High Court, where he sought a direction to the state government to let the legislators use their discretionary MLA funds to create facilities to tackle the Covid-19 crisis.The Congress party also subsequently joined as the litigant. This had prompted the state government to take this decision for all 182 MLAs.Mevani, a strong critic of the ruling BJP, moved the high court in May 2021 after the account of an NGO, “We The People Charitable Trust”, through which he started a crowd funding initiative was frozen by the Charity Commissioner of the State, stating that the MLA is not its trustee.People close to Mevani claimed that for over a year he was weighing various options, including joining the Aam Aadmi Party of which he was earlier a spokesperson and also exploring some national front of like-minded youth leaders.He was reportedly in constant touch with Kanhaiya Kumar and Patidar leader Hardik Patel, people familiar with the development confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanhaiya-kumar-jignesh-mevani-to-join-congress-on-sept-28-101632597321381.html
26-09-2021||India||Cong may struggle to retain 3 parliamentary standing committees chairmanships||The Congress could struggle to retain its chairmanship in three parliamentary standing committees in the upcoming reshuffle of the panels owing to its current strength in both Houses of Parliament, according to people aware of the matter.The Congress now has 33 members in the Rajya Sabha, down from 56 in 2019. It has 52 MPs in the Lok Sabha. “Some Bharatiya Janata Party members have pointed this out and demanded that the Congress should not retain three chairman’s positions as the BJP deserves one additional chairman’s post,” a senior parliamentary official said, asking not to be named.All members of Parliament are entitled to get a seat in the standing committees. But the chairperson’s position in these 24 panels is decided on the basis of the combined strength of each party in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha. While all chairpersons have been nominated by either Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla or Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, there is a strict quota system for these nominations.In 2019, the Trinamool Congress lost one such position after its Lok Sabha tally decreased from 34 in 2014 to 28 in 2019. The party, which headed two panels, now has just Sudip Bandyopadhyay as the chairman of the food and consumer affairs panel.Each panel is constituted for a span of one year. At the end of each year, panels are reshuffled. All existing panels are scrapped at the end of a Lok Sabha’s term and new panels are formed in the new Lok Sabha.The Congress currently chairs the home affairs, information technology and environment standing committees. Some BJP leaders have already argued with the Lok Sabha top brass that as the Congress’s tally is down by more than 20 MPs, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor can be replaced by a BJP leader. BJP leaders including Nishikant Dubey earlier wrote to the Lok Sabha Speaker to remove Tharoor from the chair after major arguments in the panel over the submission of subjects and calling of witnesses.There are 24 parliamentary standing committees to oversee the work of all Union ministries. Sixteen of these are in the Lok Sabha’s jurisdiction and the remaining eight fall under the Rajya Sabha’s ambit.“The process of rejigging the panels is now at the final stage. Some smaller parties are yet to submit their nominations for various positions and following those steps, the panels will be reshuffled,” an official said on condition of anonymity.Chairmanship is decided on the basis of strength of a party in both Houses of Parliament. The quota is arrived at by dividing the total strength of Parliament by 24 or the number of department-related standing committees. Apart from these 24 panels, MPs are also nominated as chairpersons in other standing committees. Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury chairs the Public Accounts Committee.A third official also suggested that even if the Congress manages to retain its chairmanship in the three standing committees, it might find it difficult to keep those seats next year as the BJP’s tally in the Rajya Sabha is expected to rise further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-may-struggle-to-retain-three-parliamentary-standing-committees-chairmanships-101632595522398.html

The accused also filmed the entire act and threatened her, police said.When the complainant approached Lohar’s mother, Nirmala, (56) over the matter, the latter reportedly tried to extort ₹1 lakh from her, they added.“The woman belongs to Neemuch and is presently posted in Indore. On September 13, she filed a complaint against her friend Pawan Lohar, alleging that he invited her to Manasa for a birthday party and raped her along with three others. They also shot a video of the incident and threatened her with dire consequences,” Neemuch superintendent of police Suraj Kumar Verma said.An uncle of the accused also threatened the woman, police said.“Upset with regular harassment, the constable filed a complaint on September 13,” Verma said.The survivor did not register a complaint earlier citing threat and social stigma. “Fearing social stigma, I did not share my ordeal with anyone but when the matter went out of control, due to regular mental torture and threats, I decided to file the case,” she said.Following the constable’s complaint, a first information report against the four accused was filed at women police station under sections 376 d (gang-rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation), and the main accused’s mother under section 506 of Indian Penal Code on Saturday.The remaining accused were identified as Dhirendra Lohar (34), Vijay Lohar (33) and Omprakash Lohar (36).The woman police station in-charge, Anuradha Girwal, said, “During investigation, we found that the woman constable was gang-raped and the accused were blackmailing her.”She was sent for medical examination and the reports is awaited, police said.( with inputs from Mustafa Hussain of Neemuch)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constable-raped-threatened-with-video-leak-in-madhya-pradesh-two-arrested-101632595161924.html

We have instructed officials to administer as many vaccines as possible against the targeted 15 lakh during the third mega vaccination Camp scheduled for Sunday,” he told reporters here.Till date, 44.1 million people have been inoculated, including the 2.5 million who received the vaccines in private hospitals. The total number of those who had received the vaccination was expected to breach five crore soon, he said.“We appeal to members of the public to extend their cooperation during the third mega vaccination camp,” he said. In Tamil Nadu, 56 per cent of the population have received single dose of the vaccine and 16 per cent double doses, he said.“Through the camp tomorrow (Sunday), we are planning to inoculate 20-25 lakh. With this, the number who got the single dose was expected to reach 60 per cent,” he said.In the first mega vaccination drive on September 12, a total of 2.9 million were vaccinated. Again on the second edition of the mass vaccination programme held on September 19, 1.6 million were covered, he said.Referring to the Kalaignar Insurance Scheme introduced by the DMK, he said it benefited 30,548 people since the government assumed office on May 7. Following chief minister M K Stalin’s instruction, 1,850 people affected by black fungus virus were also included in the scheme, he added. Tamil Nadu on Saturday added 1,724 new Covid-19 infections, pushing the caseload to 2,655,572, while the death toll mounted to 35,476 with 22 more deaths.

There was firing and bloodshed of innocent people but no NHRC team visited that state. NHRC teams visits only Bengal frequently. It is a matter of shame,” she said.Alleging that “goonda Raj” prevails in BJP-ruled Assam, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh, Banerjee said TMC delegations are prevented, harassed and come under attack in those states.“We don’t say anything about BJP leaders who keep visiting and peddling falsehood in West Bengal as free movement is everyone’s democratic right,” she said.Banerjee flagged the floating of bodies of alleged COVID-19 victims in the Ganges as a failure of the UP government and pointed to selective deletion of names of tens of lakhs of people in the exercise to create a National Register of Citizens in Assam. “It (deletion of names in the final NRC) shows the anti-people nature of BJP. In contrast we have already said there will be no NRC in Bengal,” the TMC supremo said.She also accused the opposition BJP of fomenting trouble in Bhabanipur, where she is a candidate in the by-poll. “BJP only carries on `goondagiri’ (violent or thuggish behaviour), peddles false propaganda. Please foil their game plan,” Banerjee said.Listing the acheivements of the TMC government, the chief minister claimed that Bengal occupies number one position in respect of vaccination against COVID-19 and in the education sector.The TMC supremo said no processions are being taken out by her party in the campaigning in Bhabanipur as directed by the Election Commission in an oblique hint that the BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal is not adhering to the norms.She also criticised the spike in fuel prices and sale of PSUs and urged the people to defeat the “anti-people and pro-rich BJP”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-did-not-let-me-to-go-to-rome-global-peace-meet-out-of-jealousy-mamata-banerjee-at-bhabanipur-bypoll-campaign-101632594801552.html

The police have arrested 27 persons and sent two more, who are minors, to a juvenile remand home in Bhiwandi in Maharashtra.One of the accused had posted a compromising video in the WhatsApp group when she refused to meet him in May, the survivor said in her statement, according to the police officer.“Ever since they got access to the video recorded in January, in which the main accused was sexually assaulting the victim, the accused had repeatedly been calling the victim. They would ask her to come to various locations, where several of them would force themselves on her,” the Manpada police officer said, requesting anonymity. “On May 16, one of them called her and made a similar demand. When she refused, he posted the video of her and the main accused in a WhatsApp group named ‘Friends’, of which the victim was also a member.”The survivor said in her statement that she then agreed to meet the accused. Subsequently, he picked her up from near her residence on his motorbike and took her to Rabale in Navi Mumbai, where she was forced to drink alcohol and was sexually assaulted by seven people. She had to be hospitalised after the ordeal, the survivor said in her statement.Police have obtained details of all the members of the WhatsApp group. They will be making inquiries with other members of the group as well as the group administrator to find out if any of them, other than the accused, had knowledge about the survivor’s plight.The survivor had refused to meet the accused in this particular occasion because earlier in the same month, they had forcibly restrained her for nearly a day, leading to her parents filing a missing person’s report, said the police officer cited earlier.“The victim was finding it increasingly difficult to come up with convincing lies to explain her frequent absences from home, and at the same time was terrified of the videos being made public if she did not bow down to the demands of the accused,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-group-at-centre-of-thane-gang-rape-case-under-police-lens-101632594561924.html
26-09-2021||India||Will persuade farmers to remove blockades: Haryana govt to Supreme Court||Haryana government will continue to persuade protesting farmers to remove blockages on state and national highways, although the farmers did not meet the panel constituted to resolve the issue of agitation on public spaces, the state has told the Supreme Court.in an affidavit submitted to a bench led by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, the state highlighted that the general public continued to face “great hardship” due to the farmers’ prolonged agitation, and all efforts are being made to persuade them to keep the roads clear. “Sincere efforts are being made to remove the blockades from interstate roads and national highways and to resume free flow of traffic on these roads for the convenience of general public by way of persuading the farmers and farmers’ organisations to cooperate,” the affidavit stated. Thousands of farmers are camping on the borders of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and on highways along these states since November last year, protesting three controversial laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy. Traffic at many points have been diverted, adding to commuting times, besides affecting commercial activities along these routes. In Haryana, the blockades are chiefly along National Highway 44 in the Ambala-New Delhi stretch, especially near the Singhu border with Delhi in Sonipat district. The court is considering a woman’s complaint that it is taking her almost two hours, instead of 20 minutes, to travel from Noida to Delhi due to frequent blockades and protests. Petitioner Monicca Agarwaal, who works in an information technology firm, has stated in her petition that her commute between Delhi and Noida has become a “nightmare”. The petitioner alleged that directions by the apex court in several cases to keep roads clear, including the Shaheen Bagh protest in 2019-20, are not been followed. Her plea said she is a single mother with medical issues, and she was facing a harrowing time because the authorities have failed to enforce the court’s orders. During the last hearing on August 23, the Supreme Court had said it is the responsibility of the Centre and the states to ensure agitations do not block movement on public roads. It insisted that the Centre and the states should coordinate with each other to ensure if the protests continue, traffic should not be stopped in any manner. In its affidavit, the Haryana government said that after the direction of the top court, a meeting was convened on September 10 through video conferencing under the chairmanship of the Union home secretary. The meeting was attended by the chief secretaries and the home secretaries of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and the national capital territory (NCT) of Delhi and the states’ senior police officials. It was decided in the meeting to make efforts to clear the interstate and national highways on both sides of the Delhi-Haryana border, the state government said. The Haryana government also apprised the court of the constitution of a state-level committee after a meeting chaired by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on September 15. The committee, under the chairmanship of the additional chief secretary of the Haryana government, was set up to resolve the issue of blockades of interstate roads and national highways by holding discussions with the farmers and farmers’ organisations so as to avoid any inconvenience to the general public. The state submitted before the court that this committee scheduled a meeting with farmer groups on September 19 at Murthal in Haryana in the presence of divisional commissioner (Rohtak division), Inspector General of police (Rohtak range), deputy commissioner and superintendents of police of Sonipat and Jhajjar districts. “Unfortunately, the farmers and farmers organizations did not come forward for discussion with the state level committee in spite of being invited,” the state government said, adding that representatives from various industrial establishments of the surrounding areas, however, attended the meeting and described the difficulties faced by them. The affidavit maintained that “the state level committee would continue to persuade farmers and farmers’ organisations to hold discussions to resolve the issue” while local administrations would also hold regular deliberations with them in attempts to convince them to remove the blockades. The Supreme Court will hear the matter again on Monday. During the hearing of this petition in April, the court had emphasised that protesters cannot block roads and continually inconvenience the public, while regretting that despite several judicial pronouncements on keeping public roads free, the situation has not improved. The Union government and Delhi Police took a stand that the authorities were trying their best to remove blockades and make the commute in Delhi-NCR smooth. In its affidavit, the Uttar Pradesh government said efforts were underway to make the farmers understand the “grossly illegal act of blocking roads” but most of the protesters are aged farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-persuade-farmers-to-remove-blockades-haryana-govt-to-supreme-court-101632594502279.html
26-09-2021||India||10 states to join meeting on left wing extremism with Amit Shah today||Chief ministers from 10 states or their representatives will attend the meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah on left wing extremism at Vigyan Bhawan in Delhi on Sunday, people aware of the development said, adding the states will give their feedback on the existing situation on the ground and raise the developmental activities that should be carried out.The meeting comes in wake of the home ministry reducing the number of left wing extremist affected districts to 70 from over 100 three years ago, with maximum increase in the fall in Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand. The MHA had also said there was a drop of 47% in Maoist related incidents since 2014, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government came to power.The CMs are also likely to discuss on how to reduce Maoist influence further, focusing on security enhancement and pushing infrastructure development in the Naxal-hit areas. As per the meeting agenda shared with the states, the meeting will be held in two sessions---first on security enhancement measures and the second on development projects.Intensifying operations against LWE, filling up the security vacuum, action against front organisations, choking flow of funds to banned Communist Party of India (Maoists) through concerned action by state police, ED and NIA, focused investigation and prosecution of cases, coordination among states besides capacity building in terms of intelligence, special forces of states and fortified police stations are listed among the major talking points on security front, people cited above said.On the development front, the main agenda of discussion will include strengthening road connectivity both by the ministry of transport and highways and ministry of rural development, widening the coverage of mobile and postal service by the department of telecommunication and department of posts, besides speedy implementation of the ongoing construction of Eklavya Schools---residential schools for students from the scheduled tribe category---in the tribal areas by the tribal affairs ministry, according to the agenda.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren reached New Delhi on Saturday with top officials to attend the LWE meeting to be chaired by Shah.Earlier this week, Soren held a review meeting with the concerned departments over the prevailing situation in the state in terms of anti-Naxal operations and allied work. The state DGP had made a presentation before the CM about the security related issues.“In terms of the presence of the Naxals in the state, it’s largely localised in three major pockets. It includes Parasnath hills in Giridih, Saranda forest area in Kolhan and Burha Pahar in Garhwa district bordering Chhattisgarh. The state government would raise the issue of more co operation from Chhattisgarh government in dealing the menace in Bitha Pahar as it shares borders with the northern part of Chhattisgarh. This area is not on priority of the Chhattisgarh government as the Naxals strategically don’t do any activity on Chhattisgarh side of Burha Pahar,” said a senior official in Jharkhand government, requesting anonymity.The official said the chief minister would also raise the issue of pressure bombs being the preferred mode of Maoists in harming the security forces than their previous medium on targeting the force on main roads through mines. “Now the security forces prefer to patrol on foot so the Naxals are using pressure bombs planted in the forest to target the force,” the official added.On the development side, Soren is likely to raise the issue of relaxing norms for the Eklavya Schools, besides requesting strengthening of the rural roads that would help in better movement of forces, the official said.Top police officials in Chhattisgarh said the issue of filling up the security vacuum in the Maoist-affected districts will be discussed in the meeting scheduled by the MHA on Sunday.“Since the number of proposed camps in Chhattisgarh is still to be set up by the state government, the MHA will be surely instructing the state government to speed up the works of comp establishment in Maoist affected districts of the state,” said a senior IPS officer of Chhattisgarh.The officer further said the progress of roads in Maoist-affected districts of the state is also not satisfactory, which will surely be addressed in the meeting.“Other issued which will be taken up by the union government include – more aggressive operations in core Maoist areas, which is matter of concern for the Union government,” said the officer.The number of districts affected by left-wing extremism (LWE) has declined sharply to 70 in 10 states for the first time in over three decades, with Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand showing the biggest improvement, according to a map of the Maoist insurgency redrawn by the ministry of home affairs.Only 25 districts in eight states are now categorised as ‘most affected’, while Uttar Pradesh is now free of Maoism, according to the MHA’s revised list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-states-to-join-meeting-on-left-wing-extremism-with-home-minister-amit-shah-on-sunday-101632594320915.html
26-09-2021||India||IMD sounds cyclone Gulab alert for Andhra Pradesh, Odisha||A deep depression over east-central Bay of Bengal intensified into a cyclone on Saturday and an orange alert has been issued for north Andhra Pradesh and adjoining south Odisha coasts, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Gulab is likely to cross the north Andhra Pradesh-south Odisha coasts between Kalingapatnam and Gopalpur, with a wind speed of 75 to 85 kmph gusting to 90 kmph on Sunday evening, the weather body added. According to scientists, cyclones are formed often at the end of monsoon or during the post-monsoon period. The orange alert is issued as a warning of extremely bad weather with the potential of disruption in commute with road and rail closures, and interruption of power supply.The depression over Bay of Bengal was formed on Friday and gradually intensified on Saturday morning. At 5.30 pm on Saturday, cyclone Gulab lay over northwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal, about 370 km east-southeast of Gopalpur in Odisha and 440 km east of Kalingapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.The system is expected to bring widespread rainfall to parts of east India on Sunday and Monday and to central India after it weakens into a well-marked low pressure system, officials in the weather department familiar with the developments said. This is the second depression formed over the Bay of Bengal in September and this season. No depressions were formed between June and August. The first deep depression of the season was formed on September 13. Normally, five to six depressions form during the monsoon season and bring extensive rainfall to central and west India.“Conditions like ocean heat potential, above-normal sea surface temperature (28 to 29 degrees) and low vertical wind shear are favourable for cyclogenesis. When it (cyclone Gulab) crosses the Odisha coast around Sunday, very heavy rain is expected there and over Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh as well after it weakens into a well-marked low pressure area. We are not expecting further intensification of Gulab now. There is a trough in the lower levels which is extending up to the Pacific where cyclonic circulations are forming one after another. The remnants of these circulations are leading to formation of low pressure systems over Bay of Bengal,” Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD, said.The weather body has also predicted tidal waves of about 0.5 m height which are likely to inundate low lying areas of Srikakulam, Sompeta, Vizianagaram and Ganjam districts when the cyclone makes landfall.Fishermen have been advised not to venture into east-central and adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea on Saturday and Sunday.In view of the weather alert, the Andhra Pradesh government hoisted the “First Warning Flag” at Visakhapatnam port while in Odisha, the district administration began evacuations in several districts. The Andhra government also put the three north coastal districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam and ports of Gangavaram and Kakinada on alert. “Under the impact of the deep depression, coastal Andhra has already started witnessing light to moderate rains in many parts and heavy rains at scattered places,” state disaster management commissioner K Kanna Babu said. Two teams of national disaster response force (NDRF) have been deployed in Srikakulam district, which is expected to have more impact from the cyclone, and another in Visakhapatnam. A state disaster response force (SDRF) team has been positioned in Visakhapatnam for emergency response.Srikakulam district collector Shrikesh B Lathkar said officials belonging to all departments, including revenue, police and electricity, have been kept on standby to meet emergencies. “In all, three teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been pressed into service to take up rescue operations in the event of any emergency situation,” he said. The Odisha government has directed collectors of seven districts to evacuate residents in vulnerable areas. It has already initiated deployment of 173 teams of Odisha disaster rapid action force, NDRF and fire services. Additional chief secretary Pradeep Jena said the cyclone may cross south Odisha-North Andhra Pradesh coasts around Kalingapatnam by Saturday evening, triggering heavy to very heavy rainfall in Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Kandhamal, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur and Koraput districts. “We are preparing for all possible devastation.There may be landslides in Gajapati and Rayagada districts as faced during very severe cyclonic storm Titli in 2018,” Jena said.Jena added that holidays of all officials at Gajapati and Koraput district were cancelled on Friday and Saturday in view of the situation. Meanwhile, the IMD has also predicted the formation of a new low-pressure system near the coast of Myanmar, which, in all probability, will dump heavy rain in West Bengal’s southern districts next week.Kolkata and its adjoining areas, which are still reeling under the impact of torrential rain that occurred earlier this week, should brace for heavy showers next Tuesday and Wednesday owing to this new weather system, the IMD said in its forecast.“As of now, we are not evacuating anyone. But if required, we would do so. The army and NDRF have been asked to remain on standby as there could be heavy water logging. The districts in south Bengal received heavy rain earlier this week and some areas are still inundated. We are keeping relief materials ready, including dry food, water pouches and medicines,” a senior official of the state’s disaster management department said, seeking anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-sounds-cyclone-gulab-alert-for-andhra-odisha-101632593421029.html
26-09-2021||India||Poll strategist Prashant Kishor becomes a Bhawanipore voter, Mamata’s home turf||Poll strategist Prashant Kishor has been enrolled as a voter of Bhawanipore, a south Kolkata constituency from where Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee is contesting the upcoming by-polls. Veteran TMC leader Saugata Roy said that if one wants to contest the Rajya Sabha elections it is necessary to become a voter of that state. “I see nothing wrong in this. He is an Indian citizen and can become a voter of any state. Secondly, if anyone wants to contest the Rajya Sabha polls, he has to be a voter of that state. I don’t know his plans. He is staying in a house and that’s why he became a voter,” Roy told the media. When asked whether he was suggesting that the TMC would be nominating him for the Rajya Sabha Roy, however, said that he ‘did not know’. Earlier this month TMC MP Arpita Ghosh had resigned from the Rajya Sabha on the instructions of the party. The seat is still vacant. After achieving a resounding victory over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the recent West Bengal assembly elections, the TMC has renewed its contract with the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC), the company launched by Kishor, till the crucial 2024 Lok Sabha polls in which Mamata Banerjee wishes to see her party playing a bigger role in national politics. “Many times we get to hear men and women settling in a particular city for their career. But this is the first time, I am getting to hear the same thing about a contractual labour. The ECI needs to check whether his name in his home town in Bihar has been deleted,” said Rahul Sinha, senior BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poll-strategist-prashant-kishor-becomes-a-bhawanipore-voter-cm-mamata-s-home-turf-101632593300851.html
26-09-2021||India||Captain loyalists to be kept out of new cabinet||Newly appointed Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi is likely to induct at least seven new faces in his cabinet and drop five MLAs, who were a part of the Amarinder Singh-led government, Congress functionaries familiar with the matter said Saturday.The new Punjab cabinet was finalised after three rounds of discussions with the Congress leadership, the functionaries said.With under five months to go for the state elections, Captain Amarinder Singh resigned as chief minister last Saturday after the Congress summoned a meeting of its lawmakers in the state, saying that he felt “humiliated”.Channi, who was elected for the top post a day later, met governor Banwarilal Purohit at the Raj Bhavan on Saturday, seeking time for cabinet expansion to fill 15 berths on his council of ministers.“The oath-taking ceremony for the new ministers will take place at 4.30pm on Sunday,” Channi said after the meeting.His meeting with the governor came barely hours after he returned from Delhi after a final round of discussions with the party high command on the cabinet formation.According to party functionaries, Channi called the MLAs likely to be part of the cabinet expansion personally to inform of the development.Kuljit Singh Nagra, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Pargat Singh, Raj Kumar Verka, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Gurpreet Kotli and Rana Gurjit Singh are likely to be inducted in the new cabinet, the functionaries said.While Verka hails from the Valmiki community, Gilzian represents the other backward classes (OBCs). The five other MLAs are Jat Sikhs.According to experts, after Amarinder’s resignation, the Congress is trying to balance caste equations in the poll-bound state.While Channi, a Dalit leader, was elected as the Congress Legislature Party leader, the party picked Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, a Jat Sikh, and OP Soni, a Hindu, to be his deputies.A consensus on the names for the cabinet expansion was reached during his meeting with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and other senior party members in Delhi, the functionaries said.Channi was summoned to Delhi by the Congress high command on Friday to discuss the cabinet formation. The visit came within hours of him returning from the national capital.The party leadership has reportedly given its approval for dropping five ministers from the previous Amarinder Singh cabinet. These include Balbir Singh Sidhu, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Rana Gurmeet Sodhi, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Sundar Shyam Arora.Eight ministers from the previous cabinet -- Brahm Mohindra, Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Manpreet Badal, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Aruna Chaudhary, Razia Sultana, Vijay Inder Singla and Bharat Bhushan Ashu -- will be retained in Channi’s council of ministers, the functionaries said.The Congress high command has decided to accommodate almost all senior leaders keeping in mind the tough postures taken by former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, a senior leader said.The Punjab cabinet can have 18 MLAs, including the CM and his two deputies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/captain-loyalists-to-be-kept-out-of-new-cabinet-101632593181392.html
26-09-2021||India||Culprits of 26/11 Mumbai attacks must be brought to justice, say India, US||India and the United States bilaterally, and with Quad partners Australia and Japan, on Friday strongly denounced “cross-border terrorism”, usually a pointer to Pakistan, the use of terrorist proxies and the need to cut logistical, financial and military support to terrorists.Terrorism along with Afghanistan, a free and open Indo-Pacific, the fight against Covid-19 pandemic and climate change emerged as key issues of concern and discussion for the two platforms that met one after the other at the White House on Friday.US President Joe Biden hosted his first bilateral summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then the first ever in-person summit of the Quad, joined by Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga. The American and Japanese leaders ended the day with their separate bilateral meet.At the India-US bilateral summit, the two sides agreed that the issue of terrorism remains important. “Counterterrorism efforts in cooperation between the two countries will be given a lot of emphasis,” India’s foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said while briefing reporters on India’s participation in the two meetings. “Both sides denounced any use of terrorist proxies and emphasized the importance of denying logistical financial or military support to terrorist groups, which could be used to plan or launch terror attacks.”The India-US joint statement said the two leaders reaffirmed that the United States and India stood together in the shared fight against global terrorism, and will take concerted action against all terrorist groups, including groups proscribed by the UN Security Council. The statement condemned cross-border terrorism, and called for the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks to be brought to justice.Pakistan’s continued support of terrorism came up a in the context of Afghanistan, where the Taliban has seized power after the US army withdrew from the country, and Pakistan’s continued support for a “certain approach” that is not seen to be conducive to the international community’s expectations of what Afghanistan should be like.Pakistan’s support of terrorism was brought up by Vice-President Kamala Harris, unprompted, during her discussions with Prime Minister Modi on Thursday.As a long-time victim of terrorism, most of it emanating from across its western border, India has made counterterrorism a key foreign policy objective. It has been a part of the India-US dialogue for years. On Friday, it also became a key element of the Quad’s agenda at India’s insistence.“I think we are looking at fairly strong language with regard to the Quad’s commitment on terrorism and the need to counterterrorism, anywhere in the world,” India’s foreign secretary said, speaking of India’s role in making counterterrorism an issue for the Quad as well. “It reinforces the Quad’s thinking on this issue, and the need to combine efforts to deal with this common scourge.”“We denounce the use of terrorist proxies and emphasized the importance of denying any logistical, financial or military support to terrorist groups which could be used to launch or plan terror attacks, including cross-border attacks,” the Quad said in a joint statement.Afghanistan was discussed at length at the Modi-Biden meeting. The two leaders resolved that the Taliban must abide by a UN Security council resolution that was passed in August during India’s presidency and ensure that Afghan soil is never again be used to threaten or attack any country or shelter and train terrorists, or plan and finance terrorist attacks. The meeting underscored the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan. The Taliban should grant free and safe passage to Afghans and foreign nationals, respect the rights of all Afghans, especially women, children and minorities, and afford access to agencies providing humanitarian aid.The two sides also discussed the need to reinvigorate trade talks, enhance cooperation on defence production, intensify joint efforts on fighting the Covid-19 pandemic through vaccines, climate change, people-to-people ties, which included H-1B visas for specially skilled workers, and other issues that the two sides are engaged in at the same time.The India-US agenda is so exhaustive that President Biden said the summit meeting should have been allocated two days, Shringla said. The meeting overshot its scheduled time by 30 minutes.At the historic first in-person summit, the Quad announced the launch of several new initiatives, such as an annual fellowship for 100 students in science and technology, a working group to enhance cooperation between the four countries on space, a new infrastructure partnership, formation of a green shipping network, establish a clean hydrogen partnership; and publish a Quad statement of principles on the use of technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/culprits-of-26-11-mumbai-attacks-must-be-brought-to-justice-say-india-us-101632593180897.html
26-09-2021||India||Pakistan still hails Osama Bin Laden as ‘martyr’: India at UNGA||India has rubbished Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s criticism of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir at the UN General Assembly, and said the neighbouring country has misused global forums to spread false propaganda while openly using terrorism as an instrument of state policy. As in recent years, India fielded a young woman diplomat – Sneha Dubey, first secretary at India’s UN mission in New York – to exercise the right of reply to respond to allegations made by the Pakistani premier at the General Assembly. Dubey described Pakistan as “an arsonist disguising itself as a firefighter”. India said in its response that Khan’s recorded video message to the General Assembly was another attempt to tarnish the image of the UN by bringing in India’s internal matters and to “spew falsehoods on the world stage”. “Regrettably, this is not the first time the leader of Pakistan has misused platforms provided by the UN to propagate false and malicious propaganda against my country, and seeking in vain to divert the world’s attention from the sad state of his country, where terrorists enjoy free pass while the lives of ordinary people, especially those belonging to the minority communities, are turned upside down,” Dubey said. Pakistan, she added, has been globally recognised as a country that is “openly supporting, training, financing and arming terrorists as a matter of state policy”, and holds the “ignoble record of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN Security Council”. UN member states are also aware that Pakistan has an “established history and policy of harbouring, aiding and actively supporting terrorists”. The world has not forgotten that the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks in the US, Osama Bin Laden, was given shelter in Pakistan, and that “even today, Pakistan leadership glorify him as a ‘martyr’”, Dubey said. “Regrettably, even today we heard the leader of Pakistan trying to justify acts of terror... We keep hearing that Pakistan is a ‘victim of terrorism’. This is the country which is an arsonist disguising itself as a firefighter,” she said. Pakistan’s policy of nurturing “terrorists in their backyard in the hope that they will only harm their neighbours” has affected the region and the world, and it has even tried to “cover up sectarian violence in their country as acts of terror”, she added. India’s response reiterated that the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh “were, are and will always be an integral and inalienable part” of the country, and this includes “areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan”. Dubey said: “We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.” Outlining India’s position, Dubey said: “We desire normal relations with all our neighbours, including Pakistan. However, it is for Pakistan to work sincerely towards creating a conducive atmosphere, including by taking credible, verifiable and irreversible actions to not allow any territory under its control to be used for cross-border terrorism against India in any manner.” India’s response also referred to Pakistan’s “despicable record” of genocide against the people of Bangladesh, and said the minorities of Pakistan, including Sikhs, Hindus and Christians, live in “constant fear and state-sponsored suppression of their rights”. “Dissenting voices are muzzled daily and enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings are well documented,” Dubey said, adding that pluralism is “very difficult to understand for Pakistan, which constitutionally prohibits its minorities from aspiring for high offices of the State”. In his recorded message to the General Assembly, Prime Minister Khan had spoken about issues such as the need for a global dialogue to counter Islamophobia and steps to promote interfaith harmony, but a majority of his address was focused on India and Afghanistan. He alleged that the “worst and most pervasive form of Islamophobia now rules India” and criticised the BJP government, referring to what he said were incidents of mob lynching and a discriminatory citizenship law. Khan was particularly critical of the Indian government’s handling of the Jammu and Kashmir issue, and referred to “illegal and unilateral measures” imposed since August 2019, including the jailing of political leaders, clampdown on the internet and suppression of protests. “Pakistan desires peace with India, as with all its neighbours. But sustainable peace in South Asia is contingent upon resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” Khan said. He said Pakistan had reaffirmed the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in the hope that it “would lead to a rethink of the strategy in Delhi”. He added, “Sadly, the BJP government has intensified repression in Kashmir and continues to vitiate the environment by these barbaric acts. The onus remains on India to create a conducive environment for meaningful and result-oriented engagement with Pakistan... It is also essential to prevent another conflict between Pakistan and India.” While speaking on Afghanistan, Khan referred to fake news that said former US president Ronald Reagan had compared Afghan mujahideen to the “founding fathers of the US”. His remarks that Pashtun people in Pakistan’s tribal belt had “strong sympathies” with the Afghan Taliban and that Afghan refugees have affinity with the Taliban were widely criticised on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-still-hails-osama-bin-laden-as-martyr-india-at-unga-101632592880945.html

The eviction drive was initiated with an agreed principle that the landless will be provided 2 acres each as per land policy and the representatives agreed. I appeal to the left-centric people to raise the voice of Assamese people.""This eviction drive was urgent. It was not done overnight. Congress delegation had met me and agreed on land allotment to landless. 27,000 acres of land have to be used in a productive manner. There was a temple, which was also encroached upon by people," he added.Earlier in the day, while addressing the media, Darrang district Additional Superintendent of Police Rupam Phukan, had told that the authority initiated action only after the locals started pelting stones at the police.Violence broke out on Thursday in Sipajhar of Darrang district in Assam during an anti-encroachment drive.Darrang SP Sushanta Biswa Sarma had said that people at the spot pelted stones and attacked police personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cm-orders-cbi-probe-hints-at-pfi-role-in-eviction-drive-firing-101632592700685.html
26-09-2021||India||Balakot, Galwan clear signals to aggressors: Rajnath||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday called for greater synergy among the armed forces in military strategy and responses. While addressing graduates of the 59th National Defence College (NDC) course during their convocation in New Delhi, he said the government’s bold approach on border disputes and terrorism has made India stronger. “Threats to internal and external security will no longer be tolerated. Our actions in Balakot and Galwan are clear signals to all aggressors,” the minister said.The world is witnessing destabilizing implications of terror, including the threat posed by radical forces attempting to gain legitimacy, Singh said. There is now a greater realisation among nations to come together and combat terrorism, he said. The NDC, he said, can play a key role in fostering a common understanding among friendly countries against terrorism and finding long-term solutions to deal with it.Highlighting the uncertainty of current geopolitics, specifically in reference to latest developments in Afghanistan, Singh said, “The only certainty about evolving geopolitics is its uncertainty. Changes in state boundaries may not be as frequent today. However, the fast-transforming structure of states and the influence that external powers can have on it is clearly evident.” The minister emphasised the need to draw lessons from the situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban has seized power after the US armed forces withdrew from the country..“Injustice, however powerful, cannot and will not defeat the collective power of the goodness that is inherent to human existence,” Singh said. “This sentiment is evident from an increasing number of world capitals, which have lent their voice in favour of liberalism, inclusivity and respect for international norms of governance and behaviour.”The minister urged NDC to focus more on new and fast-emerging areas such as cyber, space, artificial intelligence and big data analytics. “The world has witnessed rapid transformation in all these areas of scientific knowledge. This technological progression must be accompanied by its military interpretation within the strategic community,” he said. In addition, he reiterated the government’s resolve to achieve atma nirbharta (self-reliance) in the defence sector, saying that “no country that aspires to develop as a knowledge-based economy can sustain such reliance on defence imports.”Singh highlighted the relevance of NDC’s guiding principles — knowledge, wisdom and statecraft — in the rapidly changing regional scenario. “Knowledge allows us to understand the historical, social, geopolitical and economic realities of a country and a region. Wisdom helps interpret this factual understanding to facilitate far-sighted decision making. And, statecraft brings to bear the understanding of strategic thought and culture to everyday realities. It facilitates decision-making in pursuit of long-term interests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/balakot-galwan-clear-signals-to-aggressors-rajnath-101632592345555.html
26-09-2021||India||Centre will bring changes in laws to strengthen cooperatives: Amit Shah||The central government will soon bring changes in laws to strengthen cooperatives, home and cooperation minister Amit Shah said on Saturday, while detailing an agenda to reset governance in a sector critical to the rural economy. In July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi shuffled his cabinet, carving out a new ministry of cooperation, which was earlier a department under the agriculture ministry. “We are bringing within a short time changes to the Act to smoothen processes in areas like multi-sector cooperatives. This will be a big step in our march towards development,” Shah told a conference of cooperative societies. “We have (also) decided that shortly we will have a new cooperation policy.” Shah did not specify any particular law. Cooperatives in India are governed by two main laws at the central level: the Cooperative Societies Act, 1912, and the Multi-state Cooperatives Societies Act, 2002. Outlining his plans, Shah said his ministry would focus on building cooperative societies as a pivot of a whole gamut of economic activities in the rural sector, from farm inputs to credit. Cooperatives are collectives of small producers who pull in their resources to achieve scale and collective bargaining power in markets. India’s cooperative sector is the world’s largest and covers almost 98% of the countryside, with over 900,000 societies with a membership of about 290 million people, according to data from the National Cooperative Union of India. While there are some iconic cooperative businesses in the country, such as dairy giant Amul and seasoned flatbread maker Lizzat Papad, as well as the fertiliser chain IFFCO, the sector in many areas is hobbled by inefficiencies and opaque patronage systems. ““We will bring changes to the Act to strengthen the cooperative sector. Cooperatives are not a new concept in our 10,000-year-old history. It will be a model for India’s development and play a key role in India becoming a $5 trillion economy,” Shah said.” Shah said, addressing an international conference on cooperatives in the capital. Shah said a national software platform, which will be available in local languages, will link primary agricultural credit societies (PACS), district cooperative banks, and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), potentially creating an integrated financial grid. Cooperative banks, both urban and rural, are lending institutions registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, 1912. They are usually run by an elected committee. In March, Parliament passed a law to bring them under the oversight of the Reserve Bank of India after several such banks faced financial crises. The minister said processes governing cooperative institutions will have to be made transparent, which are likely to be reflected in the proposed law. New changes are aimed at bringing ease of doing business for cooperatives and development of multi-state cooperatives, he said. “The main mandate of my ministry is rural development, agriculture and development of the small individual. Our target is to create 300,000 PACS, so that for every one or two villages there is one PACS,” Shah said. PACS are village-level lending networks that are often the first stop for farm loans in a country where big scheduled commercial banks still don’t adequately cover the poor. Shah said there was a debate that the cooperative sector came under the jurisdiction of states. “I can explain it legally, but I don’t want to get into this issue. We will work for all states.” According to Shah, digitisation of the cooperative sector would be the key to its transformation. “The potential of everything from Kisan credit cards to all kinds of priority sector lending will be increased,” he said, adding the “cooperative sector is central to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Atma Nirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-will-bring-new-law-for-cooperatives-amit-shah-101632563658202.html
