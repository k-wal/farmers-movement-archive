Submitting the memorandum with Mishra, who was in the city to review different flagship schemes of union government including smart city mission on Friday, BJP leaders led by district president Pushpinder Singal had also accused the Congress leaders and MLAs of wasting the public money by wrongfully designing the development projects in absence of any public participation. The Congress leaders took a dig at the BJP, stating that the secretary was satisfied with the ongoing projects. Slamming the BJP leaders over the allegations, the officer on special duty (OSD) to mayor Balkar Sandhu and former councillor Parminder Mehta alleged that BJP leaders who are aspiring for party tickets in the upcoming assembly elections are levelling baseless allegations to gain political mileage. The projects are being taken up with transparency, and secretary Mishra was also satisfied with them. “The projects are planned by the authorities keeping in mind the needs of the public. The public representatives only monitor them to keep a check on quality and expedite them. BJP is levelling baseless allegations just to gain political mileage,” said Mehta. Meanwhile, district BJP president Pushpinder Singal stated that there are several discrepancies in the smart city projects, including the project to retrofit Sarabha Nagar main market and the Malhar road project. “The width of Malhar Road has been reduced from 120 feet to 46 feet, which is a major blunder and will affect the movement of traffic at large. Most of the projects under the smart city mission have been allotted to a single contractor. The secretary had also criticised the working,” he said. “We have demanded that the union government should appoint a nodal officer in the city to look after the projects and the funding. The Congress leadership is involved in corrupt practices, and we will also take up the matter with the union government soon,” Singal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/smart-city-projects-congress-bjp-trade-barbs-over-corruption-charges-101631989775735.html

18-09-2021||Pune||After Nick Jonas’ ‘Solapuri chaddar shirt’ attracts attention, manufacturers eye profit||PUNE Solapuri chaddar, cotton sheets, came into the limelight last week after actor Priyanka Chopra’s pop-star husband Nick Jonas flaunted a printed shirt resembling the same fabric and design.Once very popular, the customer base for Solapuri chaddars have shrunk. Hence manufacturers are emphasising the changes in the weight, colour and designs without compromising the identity of the brand and are hoping that Jonas’s fashion trick would help in rebranding of the chaddarsNow more looms in Solapur are producing ‘terry towels’ and napkins, which are the popular export material, manufacturers.“The looming business of Solapuri chaddar was huge from 1993 to 2003. In 2006 20,000 looms were producing the chaddars. We have carried out a survey in Solapur after the second wave of Covid-19. Now there are only 16,000 functional looms. Out of these 12,000 looms produce ‘terry towels’ and 4,000 are jacquard chaddar looms. At least 50,000 workers are directly or indirectly dependent on the industry,” said Raju Rathi, president of Solapur Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture and secretary of Solapur Yantramag Dharak Sangh.When Jonas’s photo wearing a shirt with a similar design of Solapuri Chaddar posted on social media platforms went viral and everyone noticed the logo of the ‘Chatla’ manufacturing industry of the chaddar on the shirt, much to the amusement of netizens.Govardhan Chatla, the owner of Chatla Textile Industries in Solapur, said that it was a pleasant surprise for them as well. Chatla also emphasised the innovations in the designs and texture of the Solapuri chaddar without compromising its true identity to remain relevant in the business.“Earlier there were few options in the beading and customers used to prefer low cost, durable and dark coloured chaddars. Gradually the needs of the people changed. They have started to prefer light and easily washable options. We made changes in the manufacturing accordingly. We now produce light chaddar which can be washed in the machine,” said Chatla.He also said that customers should buy only original Solapuri chaddars as the many imitated items have now come into the market which is hampering the business of manufactures.Though Jonas flaunted a shirt with a design like Solapuri Chaddar, manufacturers do not think it would be a popular fashion choice in the local market. But they are hoping that it would help in the rebranding of the GI tagged product.“Solapuri chaddar is thick. The jackets made out of it may not go well in our market considering our climatic conditions. But initiatives like these surely help to make the product popular and draw people’s attention to it,” said Rathi.Apart from the chaddars, Solapur’s garment industry has become a huge producer of the popular export item ‘terry towels’.“The terry towels on jacquard are exported and they are in demand from abroad. Whereas chaddars are not exported. Terry towels and napkins have dominated the space in Solapur’s garment industry,” said Suhas Rawade, manufacturer of the terry towels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-nick-jonas-solapuri-chaddar-shirt-attracts-attention-manufacturers-eye-profit-101631988997868.html

Leader of the outfit, Dharmendra, came down heavily on chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and said, “When we didn’t spare Mahatma Gandhi and killed him to protect Hindus, do you think we will spare you?” “Temples were demolished by the government in Chitradurga, Dakshina Kannada, and Mysuru. Who is running the government? If this had happened during the Congress regime, do you think the situation would have been the same? As long as the Hindu Mahasabha is there, we are not going to allow you to demolish Hindu temples,” he added. The statements come days after a video showing the Mysuru district administration demolishing a temple went viral. The Karnataka high court had pulled up authorities for failing to take action against illegal structures built on government land, prompting the Mysuru district administration to act. On August 12, the HC said the Supreme Court has stated that all illegal religious structures that were built after September 29, 2009, shall not be tolerated. The leader further posed the question as to why mosques and churches were not demolished as part of this drive. “If our Constitution guarantees us the right to equality, why are only Hindus being targeted?” he asked. Responding to the controversy, The Karnataka government on Wednesday said that it was not informed by the Mysuru district administration of its temple demolition plans and termed the action as ‘wrong’, assuring to discontinue the drive. KS Eshwarappa, minister for rural development and panchayat raj, said all deputy commissioners will be asked not to take any hasty action. “The government will sit, decide, and then direct what needs to be done,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/mahatma-was-also-not-spared-to-protect-hindus-says-hindu-mahasabha-leader-on-temple-demolition-in-karnataka-101631988996574.html

Addressing the BKU’s monthly meeting at its headquarters in Sisauli in Muzaffarnagar, the farmer leader said, “We had advised the saffron party leaders to refrain from visiting villages but people have reported about their increasing activities and meetings.” Warning the BJP leaders he said, “They should not take our silence as our weakness. They will not find their party flags on their vehicles.” Tikait cautioned farmers and people about the anti-farmer and anti-people activities of the BJP and said, “It will ruin farmers and farming if the party is voted to power in the coming UP assembly elections.” Tikait also honoured the volunteers and people who arranged ‘langar’ ( free meal) and other facilities for farmers during the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’s Mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on September 5. He called upon farmers to be united to get their demands fulfilled. “They (BJP) will try to divide us but we have to unite people,” said Tikait.

The victim, Jitendra Solanki, said a couple had checked in the guest house on Wednesday (September 15) night in Sector Beta 2. “The couple, who identified themselves as friends, had told me that they came to Greater Noida to appear for an examination,” Solanki said.Three police personnel from the Pari Chowk check post came to the guest house to conduct a raid. “They took me and the couple to the police check post and demanded ₹1 lakh to release us, else they would put us behind bars in connection with an immoral trafficking case. The cops also took away ₹30,000 from my pocket,” Solanki said, adding that the cops had also beaten him.“Later, I called my brother, who got ₹20,000 more for me. They took away ₹50,000 in total from us... Meanwhile, we shot a video of the incident secretly and shared it on social media,” he added.A police team launched a probe, being headed by Praveen Kumar Singh, assistant commissioner of police (1), Greater Noida, in the matter on Friday.“Primary investigation shows that the cops had allegedly taken ₹20,000 from the guest house owner’s brother. In case of an immoral activity, the police personnel should have informed senior officials and acted according to the law,” Singh said.Police have also launched a departmental inquiry against the suspended officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/3-cops-suspended-for-extorting-money-from-g-noida-guest-house-owner-101631988398506.html
18-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Residents of Mandla village forced to perform cremation in open during monsoon||Sukhbir Singh, a resident of Loni’s Mandla village who lost his 55-year-old wife on Thursday, had to face difficulties while performing the last rites at the village’s cremation ground amid heavy downpour as there is no shed at the ground. “My wife died after suffering high fever for several days. We took the body to the cremation ground. But when I lit the funeral pyre, it started raining heavily. It was a helpless situation for us as there was no shed at the cremation ground. Some of my friends arranged for a sheet of iron that we placed over the burning pyre to prevent it from rainwater, and this is how we had to complete the cremation,” Singh said. Some of his relatives also prepared a video of the incident that highlighted the plight of the family. “It is happening with the villagers for the past several months. The authorities must intervene immediately and erect a shed at the cremation ground,” Singh added. Mandla has an estimated population of about 2,500, while the cremation ground also caters to some small localities like Ram Vihar and Brij Vihar. Shalini Gupta, executive officer of Loni Nagar Palika, said that the cremation ground’s shed was in a dilapidated condition, so the municipality got it removed a few months ago. “The old shed was removed as we do not want the Muradngar-like incident to happen here. The villagers are facing problems. We have initiated the process to float a tender that will be opened in the next 10 days. The construction of a shed, which will cost about ₹3.36 lakh, will start next month,” Gupta said. When asked about the issue, Loni MLA Nand Kishor Gurjar said, “The problem has come to my knowledge, and I am told that the officials have initiated the process for floating a tender for erecting a shed at the cremation ground. I will personally see to it that the work is expedited. It is a genuine problem the villagers are facing nowadays.” According to Gurjar, the village was brought under the jurisdiction of the Loni Nagar Palika about four years ago.In January this year, the roof of a shelter at Ukhlarsi cremation ground in Muradnagar had collapsed, killing 25 persons. The under construction structure allegedly collapsed due to structural issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-residents-of-mandla-village-forced-to-perform-cremation-in-open-during-monsoon-101631988399094.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai records 8 positive, 77 suspected dengue cases – most in last 4 years||The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has recorded the highest number of dengue patients this year compared to the last four years. With increase in dengue patients, NMMC chief, Abhijit Bangar, has directed his officials to do the targetted testing of houses in Navi Mumbai.Currently, Navi Mumbai has eight dengue positive cases while reports of 77 suspected samples are awaited from NIV, Pune.In 2020, there were 27 suspected cases of which none was found to be positive. According to NMMC officials, last year, all were confined to their homes due to the lockdown while this year, with everything opened up and people back from native, the breeding spots have been formed.In a review meeting taken by Bangar on Friday, officials were asked to take immediate action if any suspected dengue patient was found. The samples of the suspected dengue patients are sent to NIV, Pune, while the malaria test is conducted in Navi Mumbai itself. Instead of waiting for a confirmation on dengue, Bangar asked the officers to find if there is any breeding spot and to destroy the same the moment a suspected patient is found.“Just like in Covid cases, we have definite hotspots for dengue as well and effective action would be implemented for preventive measures by focusing on the area where the suspected dengue patient is found. In areas where there are more cases, more attention would be paid to mosquito breeding,” Bangar added.He also asked to give special attention to the sites where construction is under way. The engineering department has been asked to provide information on construction sites in the city to the health department.“The rain pattern right now is most favourable for the breeding of mosquitoes and hence people should take extreme care to make sure that there is no stagnant water anywhere in the house including the pots,” Medical Health officer Pramod Patil, said.He added that stagnant water even in a bottle cap can become a breeding spot. “Currently, Navi Mumbai has had eight cases of dengue since January and to avoid the surge, we will have micro planning and increased surveillance. Besides, most important is awareness among people and cooperation from them in making sure that they do not indirectly create any breeding spot for mosquitoes,” Patil added.A Google form has been sent to all major hospitals in Navi Mumbai and they have been instructed to inform all monsoon-related water-borne and vector-borne diseases daily. “The Google sheet includes details of the patient and the diagnosis. This will help us in knowing the daily trend and timely intervention can be taken,” Patil said.This year, Navi Mumbai has had 222 suspected cases of dengue of which eight have been confirmed and reports of 77 are awaited. In 2019, of the 283 suspected cases, six were found positive. Of the 60,320 samples checked for malaria, 19 were found to be positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-records-8-positive-77-suspected-dengue-cases-most-in-last-4-years-101631987990549.html

The police suspect that he could be the same person whose name came up during interrogation of six alleged members of a Pakistan-backed terror module. Officers aware of the matter said the man, who claimed his name is Baidur-Rehman, could be the same person, whom Delhi police are on the lookout for since Monday afternoon. On Monday, the police arrested Jaan Mohammad Shaikh (47), Osama alias Sami (22), Moolchand alias Saaju (47), Zeeshan Qamar (28), Mohamed Abu Bakr (23), and Mohammed Amir Javed (31) from Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Investigating officers, who asked not to be named, said it was Baidur who had handed the RDX to suspect Zeeshan Qamar. Baidur’s interrogation could help police find missing links in the module. “ We recovered about 1700 gram of RDX from Zeeshan. It was given to him by Baidur Rehan. His interrogation could help us unearth the source of the explosive,” said one officer, who asked not to be named. Baidur ,a resident of Kareli area in Prayagraj, is also a relative of arrested suspect, Osama. Osama is a resident of Jamia Nagar in Delhi.Of the six men arrested on Monday, police said Zeeshan and Osama were trained in Pakistan to make Improvised Explosive Devices(IEDs), and using guns and grenades by their handlers from Pakistan spy agency, ISI.Announcing the arrest of the six men on Tuesday, the Delhi Police claimed that the six men were in the “advanced stage” of their preparations to launch serial blasts in at least three states. Police also claimed that interrogation of the arrested suspects revealed that Anees Ibrahim, brother of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, currently suspected to be hiding in Pakistan, was connected to this module and was smuggling arms and ammunition into the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-leaves-for-prayagraj-on-trail-of-man-who-supplied-rdx-to-pak-terror-module-members-101631987855359.html

The bodies were found in Bahraich district last week and police arrested the man and his two accomplices from Maharashtra on Saturday.Confirming the arrest, Sujata Singh, superintendent of police (SP), Bahraich, said,” We have arrested Nanku Ali, Salman Khan and Danish Khan all residents of Bahraich in connection with four murders that took place in the district on September 10. The deceased have been identified. Nanku is the main accused.” The accused have been booked for murder.According to the police, Nanku used to work in a restaurant in Thane, Maharashtra, where he met Mary Kashi (35). The woman had separated from her husband a few years ago and had three children Rajati, 11, Joseph, 7, and Saundrya, 4. Nanku began a relationship with the woman.“A few months ago Mary sold her house and gave the money to Nanku when the latter promised to marry her. So that he would not have to return the money, Nanku asked Mary to travel to Bahraich and marry him. But Nanku was already married and his real intention was to kill Mary and her children and not return the money he owed her. Nanku also involved his friends Salman and Danish in the crime,” said the SP.Nanku reached Baharaich with Mary and the children by train via Lucknow on September 10. He met with the other accused and murdered Mary and her children by slitting their throats. They later dumped the bodies and returned to Thane on September 13.“The bodies of Mary and her children were found on September 11. There were no leads initially because nobody could identify the bodies. However, with help of local intelligence and mobile surveillance we were able to track the accused and arrest them,” said the SP.The state government has announced an award of ₹1 lakh to the investigating team that cracked the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/throats-of-maharashtra-woman-her-3-kids-slit-in-up-s-bahraich-101631987556074.html
18-09-2021||Noida||Surajpur wetland inundated; avoid visits, says forest department||The Surajpur reserve forest and wetland, the city’s only official wetland and a major birding site, has been waterlogged for the past few days, officials from the forest department said. The officials have asked birders to not visit the wetland for one week. According to the forest department, heavy rainfall over the past few days led to excessive water inlet into the reserve forest area through a large drain. While most of the areas of the park have been inundated, at certain places the rainwater has levelled with the lake, the officials said, adding that they are currently cleaning the drain that passes through the wetland.“The Surajpur reserve forest is a low-lying area. Also, a stormwater drain passes through the lake and another drain goes out. Due to rain, excessive water has been fed into the drain and thus it is clogged now. Several parts of the forest areas are submerged and the level of lake has risen. We are working to clean the outlet drain, and hope that waterlogging will be cleared in next three days,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest department, Gautam Budh Nagar.A stormwater drain called Havelia originates from Hapur, and one of the streams of Havelia goes into Surajpur while the other meets Hindon river near Kasna area.The officials said that though Surajpur wetland doesn’t have a ticketing system and visitors and birders are allowed inside on “goodwill to promote birding”, it is not advisable to visit for a week.“A few birders had arrived at the wetland, though it is not advisable for people to visit currently. We would request birders to avoid the wetland for a few days,” added Srivastava.Spread over an area of 308 hectares, of which 60 hectares is lake, Surajpur wetland is the city’s largest reserve forest and one of three major birding hotspots with others being the Okhla Bird Sanctuary and Dhanauri wetland.The Surajpur wetland was the only habitat in GB Nagar that showed the sign of healthier habitat, as the numbers of migratory and resident waterbirds at the wetland increased this birding season, according to a census held in January this year.According to the census held by the Asian Waterbird Census-2021 held by the Wetlands International South Asia and the forest department, a total of 3,107 birds of 40 species were found against 2,092 birds from 39 species in January 2020 and 3,034 birds of 42 species in January 2019. The census recorded a total of 40 species of water birds, of which 17 were resident species and 23 migratory species.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/surajpur-wetland-inundated-avoid-visits-says-forest-department-101631987554745.html
18-09-2021||Noida||Noida: Discom installs energy meters at power sub-stations to check theft||Noida: Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) -- the power distribution company in Noida -- has installed energy meters on feeders at all power sub-stations to prevent power theft in the region. The energy meters provide actual figures of the electricity supplied to the people -- officially consumed and line losses -- said officials on Saturday.With the help of these energy meters, the discom is identifying areas where power theft and line loss incidents are the maximum, said Virendra Nath Singh, chief engineer of PVVNL, Noida divisional.“These energy meters give actual details of the power supply with respect to the power consumed by the bona fide consumers. We have found that in many rural and semi-urban areas like Baraula, Salarpur, Hindon Vihar, Gejha, Bhangel, Sarfabad, Jhundpura, Nayabans, and Nithari the power consumption is less than the figures in energy meters of the feeders concerned. The difference in the figures is mainly due to power theft. To check the pilferage, we will initiate a massive crackdown on power theft incidents in these areas soon,” Singh said.He also said that the discom has decided to inspect meters of heavy-load connections regularly. “Out of the total 76 feeders in urban areas, we have identified 66 from where line loss of over 50% is being reported. Prima facie, it appears power theft is the main reason behind this, amounting to aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) loss. We have started checking heavy-load meters in areas where electricity is being supplied through these 66 feeders,” Singh added.Stating that the overall line losses in Noida is around 18%, Singh said that the city is one of the biggest revenue generating areas in Uttar Pradesh. “On the basis of a survey conducted by a private agency, officials of the Uttar Pradesh power department said that 66 feeders in urban areas and 43 in rural areas have been identified as feeders prone to heavier line losses. The crackdown on power thieves will certainly bring down the power loss to less than 15% in these areas in two months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-discom-installs-energy-meters-at-power-sub-stations-to-check-theft-101631987434698.html

When Kolte found out about the money being credited into her account, she approached the ACB and lodged a formal complaint. The bribe attempt was made after Kolte had taken action against a truck involved in illegal sand transportation in Shewalwadi area of Hadapsar on September 18. According to the investigators, when Kolte had asked Pingle to stop his strike, he fled from the spot with the keys. After that she informed the regional officer Venkatesh Chiramulla and asked him to send staff for further action.

He said that the promise had forced a state minister to even comment that AAP was trying to make the people freebie-lovers. Singh who was in Prayagraj on Saturday to attend an AAP function in Kareli and Naini areas of the district, addressed mediapersons at the Circuit House and said that in a state where the ministers and MLAs were all enjoying free power supply, AAP’s promise to extend the same electricity to the people free of cost was being dubbed by nervous BJP leaders as getting people used to freebies, which was actually an insult to the common man.“Actually, the promise of giving free electricity of 300 units each month to every household of the state was a masterstroke of AAP which obviously has the BJP leaders worried,” he claimed. He said that AAP workers will spread awareness regarding the offer of free electricity to people across the state. He said that a ‘Jan Jagrukta Abhyan’ will be launched on October 5, with the aim to take AAP’s vision of the state to the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aaps-free-power-in-up-promise-has-bjp-worried-sanjay-singh-101631987075705.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||₹65 crore spent on road repair in Kalyan-Dombivli, yet roads full of potholes||In last five years, a total of around ₹65Cr has been spent on road repair works in Kalyan-Dombivli. However, despite spending so much on roads, there are complaints of bumpy rides due to potholes raised by motorists every monsoon.Commuters claim that the situation is the same every year as almost the same roads develop potholes during the monsoon.“We can see the civic body filling the potholes, repairing the road and asphalting them. However, what is the point when every monsoon, the roads develop different sizes of craters. There is nothing permanent when it comes to the roads in Kalyan-Dombivli. For how many years will we keep spending crores of rupees on the roads,” said Mahendra Singh, 39, a motorist who takes the Subhash Bridge in Kalyan (W) to connect to Kalyan (E) daily to reach his shop.According to KDMC, the road in the city develops potholes due to several reasons including lack of funds for regular resurfacing of roads, climatic conditions, no proper storm water drainage system along these roads, encroachments and the continuous increasing movement of vehicles in the city.Some of the roads in Kalyan-Dombivli that develop potholes every year are Haji Malang Road to Chetna School, Chakkinaka Road towards Nandivli Village, Katemanivali, Vitthalwadi cemetery and Chinchpada road in Kalyan (E), Gandhari Road, Wadeghar, Parnaka, Tilak Chowk to Shankar Rao Chowk in Kalyan (W).In KDMC, there are roads that cover 480km, out of which 450km are asphalt roads and the rest 30km are cement concrete roads.“These roads require resurfacing and strengthening every four to five years, which we don’t do on all the roads due to lack of funds. What we do is repair the roads on a yearly basis without resurfacing. Strengthening is done depending on the vehicle load, traffic situation of the existing roads, ensuring there are no potholes. This is one major reason why the potholes are developed,” said Sapna Koli, city engineer, KDMC.As per the KDMC, resurfacing is carried out on roads considering the vehicular traffic on the stretch. Depending on this, the layer of tar is given. It also includes the work of drainage lines along the roads.“Another major reason for potholes is the lack of proper storm water drain. This year, the rain intensity was higher in a short period of time and there is no proper place for the water to flow from the road. Proper drainage lines make a major difference to the condition of the road,” added Koli.The KDMC has taken up mastic asphalting at different stretches. It lasts longer than the regular asphalting. The Subhash (Waldhuni) bridge in Kalyan was covered with mastic asphalt three years ago and no potholes were seen on the bridge until a few were seen during this monsoon.“The life of mastic asphalting is for three years. We did the F-Cabin Road and are doing mastic asphalting on Thakurli Bridge in Kalyan,” added Koli.Around ₹50 lakh was spent for mastic asphalting on the Subhash Bridge. However, this type of asphalting is not feasible for all the roads as it has disadvantages of road turning slippery during the monsoon.“What I have noticed is the tender for the road repair work is done for six months right before the monsoon. For the remaining six months, no major works for roads are undertaken. The civic body should utilise these six months to ensure the roads are repaired in a proper way,” said Sreeniwas Ghanekar, founder of Alert Citizens Forum. “The work done is also sub-standard in which both the contractors and the civic officials need to be blamed. There is no proper inspection of work. The civic body spends crores of rupees every year and still there is no permanent solution to this.”Meanwhile, irked with the bad roads in Ulhasnagar, the traders association and auto rickshaw union in the city have warned that they would beg in public places and collect funds for repairing the roads if the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) fails to fill potholes in three days.“This is the only way now we can get the roads repaired and be free of potholes. Most roads in the city have huge potholes. It is very difficult to commute. The auto drivers at Ulhasnagar railway station have also extended their support to our decision. We will literally beg and collect funds and fill the potholes,” said Sonu Ahuja, president of Shivshankar Shopkeepers Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rs65cr-spent-on-road-repair-in-kalyan-dombivli-yet-roads-full-of-potholes-101631986716768.html

NHAI officials said that the authority has decided to build four major flyovers, five road over bridges, seven minor bridges, and 11 bus bays, among others.At present, there are several locations on the highway such as Manesar, Bilaspur, and Dharuhera, which witness heavy congestion during peak hours. Manoj Arya, project director, NHAI, said that the authority has already floated a tender for the infrastructure upgrade. “The last date for submitting the tender is September 30. The work on this highway will be completed in one and half years, and it would greatly improve traffic movement and prevent accidents,” said Arya. Arya said that presently Manesar, Bilaspur, Dharuhera and Kapriwas, all in Haryana, are among the most congested and accident-prone areas on the highway. “The construction of elevated roads, underpasses and road over bridges will prevent accidents to a great extent. The congestion at these points will also reduce,” he said. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who was in Gurugram on Thursday, also said that to improve this road, the ministry had already approved several projects at Manesar, Bilaspur and Kapriwas at the cost of ₹250 crore. Apart from this, several other improvement works will be carried out by NHAI, he said.“I have a dream to build the first electric highway on this road so that buses and trucks can move using electricity. All these plans are part of our vision for futuristic transport,” Gadkari had said. A senior NHAI official, who wished anonymity, said that a road project to bypass traffic at Dharuhera has also been approved. “This will also ease traffic woes at this location,” he said. With the primary focus on improving safety at these locations, NHAI officials said that adequate road safety measures will be taken. These include roadside signs, overhead signs and curb mounted signs along the identified stretches on the highway. The new structures will also have provision of W-beam crash barrier at the high embankment locations, the officials said. Referring to the proposed projects on the Delhi-Jaipur highway as a positive step, Union minister and Gurugram MP Rao Inderjit Singh said that this infrastructure upgrade was much needed. “These flyovers should come up fast. But another important need is to recarpet the entire highway to ease travelling. The authority must also improve the condition of service roads,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/major-infra-upgrade-planned-for-delhi-jaipur-highway-by-2023-to-improve-traffic-101631985695644.html

Officials said due to the strict crackdown this year, the number of challans issued for wrong-side driving in the last eight months has exceeded the total number of violations registered under this category in 2020 and 2019. According to data available with the traffic police, the traffic police issued 52,746 challans for wrong side driving till August 31,with officials stating that the drive against the offence will be taken up on a large scale till the end of this year. As part of their enforcement drive this year, traffic police officials said they have identified four spots in the city —Vatika Chowk, IFFCO Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, and Rajiv Chowk — where instances of wrong-side driving are maximum and deployed traffic marshals round the clock to keep an eye out for those committing the offence. “We observed many fatal accidents were occurring due to wrong-side driving across the city and accordingly, deputed our resources to curb the violation. Based on the feedback from our traffic marshals, we identified four major spots in the city, where the instances of wrong-side driving are maximum, which accounts for nearly 20-25% of all violations in the city,” said Ravinder Singh Tomar, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Gurugram traffic police.Tomar said wrong-side driving at the four spots was not due to engineering defects but primarily due to a behavioural issue.“At all the four points, the distance to the next possible U-turn is less than a kilometre. Despite this, commuters drive on the wrong side to take a shortcut and save the little distance that they otherwise have to take for the U-turn. Enforcement and heavy penalties are the only solution to bring about a change, and hence, we have deployed traffic marshals at these spots 24x7,” said Tomar adding that traffic police are identifying more such spots in the city, where the offence is common and requires deployment of more marshals. While traffic police said that there has been a drop in wrong side driving at Vatika Chowk, IFFCO Chowk, and Hero Honda Chowk, the violation is still common at Rajiv Chowk, especially during waterlogging.“Often during heavy rains, the Medanta underpass gets flooded and so does the CH Bakhtawar Singh road. The underpass is closed as a precautionary measure. With limited road space available and congestion on the carriageway, many people take to wrong side driving. We are working with concerned departments to address waterlogging and curb violations,” said a senior traffic police official.According to data available with the traffic police, 39,765 challans were issued for wrong-side driving last year and 49,761 challans in 2019. Traffic police said that although there was less traffic for most part of last year on account of the Covid-19 outbreak, the enforcement in 2019 was much more.“Our efforts to curb wrong-side driving will continue throughout the year. Our main aim is to reduce collisions caused by wrong-side driving and save lives of citizens while also sensitising them,” said Tomar.Wrong-side driving has resulted in fatal accidents this year. On January 18, a pilot died after his car was hit by a speeding truck that was being driven on the wrong side near Sector 114 on the Dwarka Expressway.On February 8, a 32-year-old man died after his car collided with a truck driving on the wrong side at the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) near Badshahpur.Traffic police also mentioned about the change in the department’s approach against wrong-side driving. In February, traffic police announced that wrong-side driving can attract FIRs against the offender under Section 279 (rash driving) of the IPC. Similarly, in January, traffic police announced that the licence of anyone found driving on the wrong side will be suspended while a repeat offence may lead to termination of the licence. Along with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), this year, the traffic police have installed red light violation detection cameras (RLVD) for monitoring at least 25 major crossings round the clock. Over 230 such cameras have been installed at key junctions, such as HUDA City Centre, Subhash Chowk, Bristol Chowk, Signature Towers, and IMT Chowk.Tomar said the traffic police tower in Sushant Lok 1 and the GMDA’s integrated command and control centre (ICCC) in Sector 44 have been monitoring traffic violations through RLVD cameras, especially over the past two months. Despite the efforts by traffic police, commuters said some stretches, like the one between Moulsari Avenue metro station-Ambience Mall, opposite the entrance to park drive on Golf Course Road (GCR), and MG Road U-turn flyover are prone to wrong-side driving. “Every time I exit from the club drive on to GCR, I have to keep checking vehicles coming from the other end, driving on the wrong side. Just soon after, where a U-turn allows commuters to head towards Bristol Chowk, two-wheelers can be spotted regularly driving on the wrong side,” said Sandeep Kumar, a resident of DLF 5.“Besides heavy enforcement, Gurugram traffic police also needs to identify the reasons leading to wrong-side driving. If the reasons are due to engineering defects, the same should be addressed and rectified along with local government bodies,” said Sewa Ram, associate professor and urban transport systems design expert at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi.Talking about other solutions to check wrong-side driving, Sewa Ram said supervising intersections and junctions via CCTV cameras would help curb the offence. “If commuters are wary that they are under constant surveillance, their instinct to commit traffic violations would be kept in check. This method has proven effective in bringing down traffic violations across major cities such as Delhi and Chandigarh,” said Sewa Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-50k-fines-issued-for-wrong-side-driving-in-gurugram-till-august-101631985395338.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||Bhiwandi turning from power loom capital into pothole haven due to bad roads||Lakhs of people travel in and out of the loom town on any given day of the week, thanks to its many power looms and warehouses. Comparatively, a meagre ₹30Cr is spent on repairing the roads in this city over the last five years.The Bhiwandi-Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) has claimed that it does not have sufficient revenue generation for road repairs. For over a month, residents, political parties and activists have been raising the issue of pothole-filled roads all across Bhiwandi.The poor road conditions and the huge craters resembling little ponds or pools have become the brunt of trolls on various social media platforms. While the BNCMC is awaiting a dry spell to fill the potholes and level the roads, residents claim they face this situation year after year.Bhiwandi city has many warehouses of popular e-commerce retailers and is also the power loom capital of India. At night, many heavy vehicles with goods regularly travel on the roads that connect Bhiwandi to Kalyan, Thane and Wada areas.BNCMC officials claim that the low budget available with the corporation is not sufficient for road repairs for such a vast city. “The limitations related to income sources are one of the key reasons that the road repair work is not undertaken frequently. Every year, there is around ₹5Cr- ₹6Cr budget for road repairs. However, we require this much only to fill potholes, thus making it difficult to maintain all the roads,” said Sudhakar Deshmukh, Commissioner, BNCMC.BNCMC has an overall budget of ₹10Cr for roads this financial year. From among this, they have spent around ₹7Cr only on flyovers across the city till now. Laxman Gaikwad, city engineer, BNCMC, said, “During heavy downpour, the force of the rain water causes deep penetration on the roads, leading to such potholes. The continuous rainfall in the last couple of weeks has led to potholes in different parts of the city. We have appointed engineers in each ward to conduct regular surveys of all roads and fill the potholes. We also have made vehicles available to flatten the stretch of road after filling the potholes to avoid uneven patches. We are awaiting a dry spell to repair the roads. Two days ago, a few youth protested on the Bhiwandi-Wada road by rowing an inflatable boat on craters filled with rainwater. They held a placard that said ‘Enjoy boat rides amidst Ganesh festival on Bhiwandi-Wada road’.Taj Khan, 43, resident of Kalyan Road, said, “The internal roads are the most affected with potholes. The road connecting Thane to Mankoli Naka is a 14km stretch that takes around three hours to travel during peak hours. This traffic jam is due to the umpteen potholes on these roads. There is a stretch of road from Gaibi Nagar to Shanti Nagar that has been in the same condition for more than a decade now. It has not been repaired properly.”Most roads within the city are in a poor state including Mangal Bazar Road, Agra Road near Kamla Hotel, Rajiv Gandhi Flyover, Bhiwandi-Wada Road, Anjurphata till Kasheli, Thane to Mankoli naka and the stretch near Kalyan Naka.“Bhiwandi is well connected by road to Thane, Kalyan and Wada. Often, people traverse through the Bhiwandi-Wada route to reach Gujarat. As there is no connectivity by train, these stretches of roads are very important as they are the only means to connect Bhiwandi with rural areas and the neighbouring cities. Despite this, it takes hours to commute on this road due to the ill-maintained condition of the road,” said Saumya Srivastava, 38, resident of Padma Nagar in Bhiwandi who drives till Majiwada, Thane, twice a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhiwandi-turning-from-power-loom-capital-to-pothole-haven-due-to-bad-roads-101631985337702.html

Hexavalent chromium is a heavy metal ion that is used in different industries and is responsible for health problems in humans like cancers, kidney and liver malfunctioning and infertility, said researchers Dr Vishal Mishra and his Ph.D student Veer Singh.Dr Mishra said this new strain -- Microbacterium paraoxydans strain VSVM IIT(BHU) -- was able to tolerate large concentrations of hexavalent chromium. “It is very effective for removal of hexavalent chromium from wastewater compared to other conventional methods. This bacterial strain showed fast growth rate in the Hexavalent chromium-- Cr (VI)-- containing aqueous medium and gets easily separated from the aqueous medium after the treatment process,” he said.He said this bacterial strain doesn’t require an extra separation process after removal. Bacterial mediated wastewater treatment process is very inexpensive and non-toxic because there was no involvement of expensive equipment and chemicals, he said. The researchers have tested hexavalent chromium removal capacity of this bacterial strain in industrial and synthetic waste water and have found satisfactory results. They also tested the mechanism in bacterial cells. “The research showed that several heavy metal tolerance mechanisms get activated in bacterial cells when they are grown in hexavalent chromium containing growth medium,” he added.The research work has already been published in reputed international journal “Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering (Impact factor 5.9). This research is focused on cost-effective and eco-friendly method for removal of toxic metal ions such from water. “This bacteria can easily cultivate and remove hexavalent chromium in an effective way. No skilled labour is required for this. It is inexpensive, non-toxic and easy to use/employ. Also, separation after usage does not require large energy input and removes hexavalent chromium until the discharge limit of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB),” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iitbhu-researchers-isolate-bacterial-strain-that-separates-toxic-metal-from-waste-water-101631984735152.html

The Congress has admitted its complete failure on all fronts in Punjab. The mafia raj in the state would prove to be the last nail in the Congress’ coffin in Punjab,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/panicky-cong-will-be-decimated-in-punjab-bjp-s-chugh-101631984615018.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||Motorists face problems as resurfacing of flyovers not done before monsoon||With the work of asphalting on seven flyovers along the Sion-Panvel Highway not undertaken before the monsoon, almost all of them have developed craters and the motorists are facing a lot of issues.In the first week of April, the Public Works Department (PWD) had announced that they would resurface these seven flyovers between Vashi and Kalamboli with asphalt coating. They had also set aside a budget of ₹15Cr for it, but the work was never undertaken due to lack of response to tenders. These flyovers are located in Vashi, Sanpada, Nerul, Belapur, Kharghar, Kamothe and Kalamboli.On July 28, the highway saw a severe traffic jam at Nerul after a minor accident occurred on LP bridge. The traffic officials blamed the worn-out surface of the flyover for that accident.Sarika Desai, deputy engineer, PWD, said, “Our plan was to complete the resurfacing work on all the seven flyovers before the monsoon and floated the tenders accordingly. However, we did not receive response to the tenders on time and thus could not start the work. Now, we have completed all the formalities and the work will be started by the first week of October.“We will first remove the existing three layers of asphalt on the flyovers and then refill those with new coatings. We will also coordinate with the city traffic department so that we can partially block the highways in those areas where we initiate the work.”According to another senior PWD officer, the length of the flyovers is not the same and hence they will have separate deadlines for finishing work on each flyover. “We hope to complete the entire work within two months,” he said.According to PWD sources, they have not resurfaced the flyovers on Sion-Panvel highway since 2014.RM Bhosale, 51, a resident of Kharghar said, “It has become very inconvenient to drive on the worn-out surfaces of these flyovers. During peak hours, a lot of vehicles cross the flyovers at the same time, and then you don’t have the option of avoiding the craters as there’s no space. If anyone tries to avoid the craters by taking a side, an accident may take place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/motorists-face-problems-as-resurfacing-of-flyovers-not-done-before-monsoon-101631984555226.html
18-09-2021||Chandigarh||PU senate polls: Former student leaders, ex-senators in fray from graduate constituency||Former student leaders of Panjab University (PU) are all set to contest the senate election from the registered graduate constituency this year. The polling will be held on September 26, for the election of 15 members to the senate. The candidates said their main objective is to bring students’ issues to the forefront. Amit Bhatia, who was president of the Panjab University Campus Students’ Council (PUCSC) in 2009, is contesting in the senate for the first time. “Despite being important stakeholders, no one talks about the students’ issues in the senate. I am contesting the polls to represent them and their welfare will be my key agenda, if I get elected,” said Bhatia, who is currently an assistant professor at DAV College in Sector 10. As many as 43 candidates are in fray from the constituency. Of the eight constituencies of PU senate, the registered graduate constituency is the largest with around 3.61 lakh voters, who elect 15 members to the senate. Polling booths are set up across seven states/UTs.Ravinder Singh, who was active in the Panjab University Students Union (PUSU) from 2009 to 2014, is also contesting senate polls for the first time. After the polling for the graduate constituency was deferred by PU last month, Ravinder was on protest outside the V-C’s office for 25 days. “This constituency is for youngsters and leaders who are associated with students. Our purpose is that students get proper representation in the senate,” he said. Another former student leader, Simranjit Singh Dhillon, who was the president of PUSU in 2009 and 2010, is contesting the senate polls for the second time. “The students’ council is not represented in the senate like the teachers and employees’ associations. They also need their representation so that their issues are raised with the governing body,” said Dhillon, who was later associated with Students Organisation of India (SOI). A number of ex-senators are also in fray from the constituency. “My primary concern is to save the democratic structure of the university and work for the interests of students,” said Rabinder Nath Sharma, who is a former senator and has been contesting from the graduate constituency since 1992. Sharma has remained a senator for six terms so far.So far, the elections for seven constituencies have been conducted, from where 32 members have been elected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-senate-polls-former-student-leaders-ex-senators-in-fray-from-graduate-constituency-101631984255130.html

18-09-2021||Mumbai||Won’t surrender to misuse of central agencies, says Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut||A day after chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray created a flutter in political circles with his “future colleagues” remark, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will complete full term and they would not bow down or surrender just because central agencies are being misused against its leaders and ministers. Raut also dismissed speculations that Thackeray’s remark had upset Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar.The Sena leader on Saturday clarified that Thackeray’s statement meant if Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders want to come and join the MVA, they can become future colleagues. He also said that Thackeray’s comment was not sudden but a deliberate one. The CM, while speaking at a government event in Aurangabad on Friday, referred to the dignitaries, including BJP’s minister of state for railways Raosaheb Danve and minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad, on the dais as “my current, former, and if we come together, my future colleagues”.Thackeray’s statement, if viewed in the backdrop of Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) action against his close aide and minister Anil Parab, suggested that the party could have extended an olive branch to its former ally. However, Raut dismissed it and said, “If somebody has garbage in their minds that we will do whatever they want us to do or surrender ourselves [just because] the manner in which they have misused central agencies against MVA leaders and minister, they can continue to think so. We will not bow down.”Amid buzz that Pawar and some leaders in the Congress and NCP were upset over the remark, Raut met the CM and Sena chief at Varsha bungalow. “I don’t think that anybody is upset, nor has any said so... I am in regular touch with key leaders of the two parties and there is nothing like that. All is well, everything is running smoothly,” Raut said after meeting the CM on Saturday afternoon. NCP spokesperson and skill development and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik denied that Pawar was upset. “There is no such thing. These are baseless news floating around,” he said. Earlier in the day, Raut defended Thackeray and said it is a “small matter,” and added, “Nowhere has Uddhav ji said that there will be a new alliance or the government will fall.” He also said, “It is not a sudden statement by the CM, but a deliberate one. He had said that the former colleagues want to become future ones, and some people are in touch to join MVA. There are many in Maharashtra who are keen to join,” he said without naming any particular leader.Raut, who is the co-architect of MVA, said there were no difference within the three-party alliance and it will complete its full term. “The government has the commitment to run the government for five years and the Shiv Sena is known to keep its word. It never backstabs anyone,” said the Sena chief spokesperson.Ruling out any alliance with the BJP, Raut said that alliance cannot be formed with a party that uses the language of demolishing Shiv Sena Bhavan — the party headquarters, and with a party where its ministers speak ill about the Sena chief. Raut agreed with Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, who on Friday said there was no possibility of reunion between the two parties. “Devendra ji has spoken very practically that nothing will happen now, nor will anyone let it happen. There are some people in the BJP who have openly said they would ransack Shiv Sena Bhavan. Some Union minister has spoken about attacking the chief minister. How can there be an alliance with a party that considers the Sena its enemy?”Meanwhile, BJP leader and Leader of Opposition in legislative Council Pravin Darekar said Thackeray’s remark could have been a warning to the other two ruling parties. “There is pressure on the CM over various issues and he is compelled to change his decisions within hours because of the pressure. I think by his remarks the CM has tried to give a warning to two other parties that he has the option of the BJP open for alliance. This is nothing but the pressure tactics being adopted by the ruling party. There is discontent and one-upmanship but none of them will try to pull out of the government because of their hunger for power,” he said.Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, former Congress leader who switched loyalties ahead of 2019 election and joined BJP, said anything was possible in politics. “There is no permanent friend or foe in politics. Any miracle can take place anytime. The incumbent ruling alliance in the state is an unnatural partnership without any common ideology. They have come together for the sake of power. The Sena-BJP alliance had been together even without power. It would not be a surprise if the old allies come together,” the former minister said. BJP legislator Nitesh Rane, meanwhile, alleged that the remarks by the CM were to divert the attention of the people from the MMRDA bridge collapse. “Was the Sena-BJP alliance statement only given to divert media attention from the MMRDA bridge collapse in BKC? Seems like it,” Rane tweeted on Saturday morning. He was referring to the collapse of an under-construction bridge at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) in which 14 workers injured on Thursday. The BJP has held state government and MMRDA responsible for the mishap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wont-surrender-to-misuse-of-central-agencies-says-shiv-sena-leader-sanjay-raut-101631982634715.html
18-09-2021||Pune||No more water tankers: Bamboo plantation project a boon for villagers of Bajar Wahegaon in Jalna district||PUNE Bajar Wahegaon, a village located in Jalna district, is reportedly free of dependency on tanker water due to the collective efforts of villagers and Vanarai’s bamboo plantation project.Vanarai, a social organisation working for environment conservation and rural development, undertook the project with support from Crompton CSR Foundation. The project not only helped the village to go tanker free but also improve the income of families in the village.The collective efforts of the villagers paid huge dividends. The annual income per family went up multi-fold from ₹20,000 in five years since the inception of the project in 2016.Sonu Kale, a villager, said, “Bunds and trenches further helped groundwater recharge. Now the farmers produce wheat, soybean and tur dal which ensures returns all through the year. Water conservation paved the way for increased agricultural activity leading the village to a sustainable livelihood.”For over a decade from 2005, the gram panchayat with a population of about 5,000, spend ₹15-18 lakh on water tankers in April and May. They required about three tankers per day for drinking purposes and general use. The two natural nullahs which were the primary source of water in Bajar Wahegaon had transformed into narrow water streams. The depleting groundwater level only added to the woes.Most of the land on the banks of the nullah is under cultivation. The natural water streams dried up over the years. Farming, which is the primary source of income for the villagers, was restricted to cotton cultivation due to water scarcity. This meant that the land would be under cultivation only for few months a year.The fertile soil on the sides of the nullah fell into the water leading to the deposition of silt which further reduced water flow. The villagers decided to start with desilting the nullahs. They removed silt from the nullah.Sagar Dhariya, trustee, Vanarai, said, “Our efforts are sustainable development at rural development. Credit goes to villagers and Vanarai guided them which helped to transform the village.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-more-water-tankers-bamboo-plantation-project-a-boon-for-villagers-of-bajar-wahegaon-in-jalna-district-101631982394860.html
18-09-2021||Delhi||To help drivers polish skill, Delhi govt to likely share video of failed driving test||New Delhi: People who fail in their driving tests in Delhi could soon get access to the video of their performance to improve their skills, in view of the higher failure rate on city’s automated test tracks, senior government officials said on Saturday. The state transport department is working on a project to provide permanent driving licence (DL) applicants a video of their driving test, in case they fail. “We have received feedback from several regional transport offices (RTOs) that test takers often seek a copy of their video. It is mostly to understand where they went wrong, so they can improve their driving skills. Hence, we are looking at a system in which the driving test video of the applicant is sent to him/her maybe via Whatsapp. It is still in the pipeline,” said a senior transport official. “In accordance with court orders, every driving test for a permanent licence is videographed in Delhi. So, we are checking the legality of making it available to the applicant. Also, the service could also be introduced strictly as an on-request facility,” a second official said. Results of the first one year of the automated tracks, accessed by HT, showed that at least 48.91% applicants failed the driving test at the three tracks that were opened by July 2019. Before the automated tests were introduced at the three centres, the rate of failed applicants was only 16.24%, records showed. The Delhi government introduced the city’s first automated driving test track (ADTT) in February 2018. By now, the state transport department has made automated tracks operational in 10 locations. An applicant is marked on 24 skill sets on these automated test tracks, which have 10 different track patterns – seven for four wheelers and three for two-wheelers. An applicant needs to reverse their car on S-shaped tracks, drive uphill and also swerve at bends shaped like an ‘8’. The driver is also judged on their behaviour as there are separate tracks to test decisions on overtaking and at traffic junctions.In December 2020, transport minister Kailash Gahlot reviewed the performance of these tracks. He said it was found that many are failing the driving tests on the automated test tracks despite having good driving skills because of the sensors and cameras being “over sensitive”. The transport department was asked to check the entire system of the operational automated test tracks and also revisit videos of those who have failed the tests to understand the problems better.Before these automated tracks were introduced, driving tests were conducted on the main road with usual traffic, where an applicant had to drive straight for less than a kilometre while being supervised by a motor licencing inspector. The test result was totally at the discretion of the licencing officer. Now, the licencing officer oversees the test, take a print-out of the result and sign it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/to-help-drivers-polish-skill-delhi-govt-to-likely-share-video-of-failed-driving-test-101631982274758.html
18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder Singh says Sidhu is ‘anti-national’; vows to oppose him as Punjab CM||The tussle between former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and party’s state chief Navjot Singh Sidhu received some fresh steam on Saturday after the latter, only hours after resigning from the top post, said that he will fight “tooth and nail” to stop any move of making Sidhu the new chief minister of the state.Calling Sidhu an “anti-national…unstable, incompetent man,” the Captain further said that the former is a “security threat” for both Punjab and India. “I cannot allow such a man to destroy us, I will continue to fight the issues that are bad for this state and its people,” the outgoing chief minister said.Notably, the feud between Singh and Sidhu heads back to 2019 when the latter resigned from the former-led state cabinet after months of infighting inside the system. The Captain was fiercely against Sidhu’s controversial step of hugging Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and also attending the swearing-in ceremony of the country’s Prime Minister Imran Khan.Also Read | How Amarinder Singh resignation as Punjab CM unfolded: A timelineThe matter reached such a stage that it required the attention of Congress president Sonia Gandhi for which she even formed a committee – led by the former Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge. Following discussions, an overhaul occurred in July this year that saw Sidhu becoming the party’s state chief while the Captain continuing in the top post as the chief minister.The solution hardly made any difference as in August two of Sidhu’s advisors – Malvinder S Mali and Pyare Lal Garg, came under fire and received open backlash from the outgoing chief minister of Punjab for their comments on Kashmir and Pakistan, respectively.Also Read | Captain Amarinder Singh, Navjot Sidhu aides spar as Punjab crisis deepensWhile Mali referred to Kashmir as a “land of Kashmiri people,” Garg indirectly criticised the Singh-led state government. “When a government does good work, we appreciate it, but if it does poorly, then also we criticise it,” Garg had said at the time.This issue later resulted in the resignation of Mali.Maintaining his stand against Sidhu and his ideologies, Singh on Saturday said that everyone has seen Sidhu “singing praises” for Khan while Indian soldiers were losing their lives at the India-Pakistan border every day. The Captain emphasised that he will fight Sidhu every step of the way if the latter is made the face of Congress for the chief minister’s position in next year’s Assembly elections.Earlier in the day, Singh said that he “felt humiliated” by the Congress leadership in the previous two months after the MLAs were called to Delhi twice before the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting was summoned today.Also Read | Amarinder Singh resigns as Punjab chief minister, says ‘I felt humiliated’Singh was the only Congress MLA to have skipped today’s meeting, which also saw four Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) rebels who recently joined the party in attendance.

18-09-2021||Mumbai||Air India bid process successful; employees seek dues, await revival||The government successfully managed to receive financial bid for the national carrier Air India, making the possibility of the airline getting privatised stronger. Tata Sons was among the bidders. While a section of the airline’s employees is eagerly awaiting its revival by the new owner, some others want their dues and arrears to be successfully cleared before the government concludes this process.The government is seeking to sell 100% of its stake in the state-owned national airline, including Air India’s 100% shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50% in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd. As per the Air India expression of interest floated by department of investment and public asset management (Dipam) in January 2020, the airline has a total debt of ₹60,074 crore as of March 31.“We are happy with the process of privitisation and that Tata Sons have bid for the airline. The old Air India was made by Mr Tata. Though our issues are still on, we are getting sorted. We have to wait and see what happens on matters of wages, medical and all those things that are pending, which our government has assured that they are looking into. However, taking over the airline by the new bidder will take time,” said a senior cabin crew of Air India.If Tatas emerge successful, it will mark the return of Air India to the Tata fold after 67 years. The Tata Group founded Air India as Tata Airlines in October 1932 and the government nationalised the airline in 1953.“We definitely intend to put our best foot forward and help the future owner bring Air India back to its former glory. We hope that the process will also enhance employees working conditions for a harmonious productive environment under the new owner,” said a committee member of the Indian Pilots’ Guild, airline’s Boeing pilots’ union.A senior engineer of Air India said, “It is essential for the government to clear the dues of all the employees. The airline management has assured us to resolve all the matters before the airline is privatised. We are hoping for the best.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/air-india-bid-process-successful-employees-seek-dues-await-revival-101631982094747.html

With this, the state has so far (till 6 pm on September 18) has administered more than 4.98 crore doses, of which more than 4.06 crore are first dose and 92.57 lakh are second dose, as per the CoWin app. Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat followed Bihar in vaccination drive on Friday.Earlier in August, the state has administered 27.5 lakh doses in a single day.Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday congratulated the residents of Bihar for the record and said the state had written a golden chapter in history by vaccinating the highest number of people among states and Union territories on the occasion. “Hope the Health Department will continue working with this dedication,” he said in his message. “It’s a big achievement that Bihar surpassed its target to inoculate 30 lakh people to mark the occasion,” he said.Kumar had earlier announced that his government would carry out a massive vaccination drive on the occasion of the prime minister’s birthday. The BJP had directed its workers across the state to facilitate vaccination drive on the prime minister’s birthday as part of its ‘Seva Aur Samarpan Abhiyan’.The state had in July set a target of vaccinating six crore people in six months. “I would like to thank all the health workers and other staff who have been involved in this historic vaccination drive,” said health minister Mangal Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/vaccination-on-modi-s-birthday-bihar-on-top-with-over-33-lakh-doses-in-a-day-101631981854764.html
18-09-2021||Patna||Bihar schools reopen after Covid disruption, but wait for books continues mid-session||In Bihar, availability of books is never ensured for students in schools at the start of the academic session in April and often stretches beyond mid-session. This year, it’s is no different despite the Patna high court’s directive a few years ago to the government to ensure their timely availability.After the Bihar government failed to ensure timely availability of books to students studying in thousands of government schools year after year, it sought approval from the Centre in 2017 for giving commensurate amount to students through direct benefit transfer (DBT) in the bank accounts of parents of wards below 10 years of age for purchase of books from the open market. After initially refusing permission, the centre later agreed.However, that has not been able to solve the problem. Even in September this year, as the schools reopened after a long gap due to Covid-19 pandemic, lakhs of students continue to wait for the money to purchase books from the open market, if available. Strangely, Bihar still has a big set-up of the Bihar State Textbook Publishing Corporation, which earlier supplied books to students.In many cases, money has been deposited, but books still not purchased for varying reasons ranging from non-availability to reluctance.A school headmaster said that providing books timely to the students would have been the best option, as the small amount provided with delay in the name of books is invariably misused or is of no use, as aware parents of students don’t wait for it and manage it on their own. “The schools remained closed for over a year and reopening without books does not serve the purpose. We are also managing it for students. The preparations should have been made beforehand,” he said.After September, there will be long holidays for Dussehra, Diwali and Chhath and before winter vacation, it will be time to fill up forms for exams. In between, there is panchayat poll, training for it and other non-academic engagements for teachers. That will leave the students, already affected due to almost missing education in the schools during the Covid period, as reflected through different surveys, with very little time even to flip through the books whenever made available.Managing Director of the Bihar State Text Book Publishing Corporation, Manoj Kumar, said the process had been initiated to transfer amount in the bank accounts of students. “We have sought information from the district level officials. We have got ₹402 crore for disbursal of amount for this year and the process has begun. The printers have said the books are available with the retailers and the students can get it. The money will also reach them,” he said.The MD said that camps would also be organised at the local level later this month to make books available. “We held a meeting with the printers also. The district officials have been asked to monitor that all students purchase books,” he said.Sanjay Kumar, principal secretary (education), had on September 1 issued guidelines to all district-level officials regarding purchase of books by students with the money transferred in bank accounts of students. He expressed displeasure on September 9 over reports that books were not being purchased. “Availability of prescribed books is of paramount importance for quality education and this must be ensured through inspection. The report regarding availability of books should also reach the department in the prescribed format every Monday,” he wrote to all the district education officers and district programme officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-schools-reopen-after-covid-disruption-but-wait-for-books-continues-midsession-101631981674844.html
18-09-2021||Delhi||To fuel passion for the arts, Delhi government launches mobile music classroom||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Saturday launched a mobile classroom that will be used for skilling and motivating students with a passion for the arts. As part of the Music Bus project, a bus equipped with an in-built studio and other facilities will reach out to government school students across the city, and children from economically weaker sections to encourage them to learn audio production, graphic designing and filmmaking. Launching the mobile musical classroom, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said children will no longer need to go out to learn music. “The music bus would reach the children at large, identify their artistic passion and lay a foundation upon which the School of Specialized Excellence would build upon and assist these children in pursuing their passion and achieve success in that field,” said Sisodia, adding that the initiative will help children with artistic talent who are often asked to prioritise academics over art. While the idea for the bus was floated by a group of government school students, it is funded as part of a CSR tie-up. Under the project, a bus has been transformed into a mobile music class equipped with a music recording studio and a performing stage. The mobile studio is also equipped with a Smart TV, which will be used to share digital educational music videos on issues related to social-emotional health and well-being, the government said in a press release. Talking about the new project, Sisodia said the government started the School of Specialized Excellence to encourage students to focus on their passion from a young age. He said the performing and visual arts domain of the School of Specialized Excellence will ensure that, for an artist, art is also treated as education. School of Specialized Excellence offer specialised education to students of classes 9 to 12 in four domains — science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), humanities, performing and visual arts, and ‘high-end 21st-century skills’.“Until now, only science was considered as the subject of specialized education but School of Specialized Education will change this perception where children will be given specialized education in various fields. If we are not able to bring the talent of the children in front of the country and society, then this is not the fault of the child but the system. The School of Specialized Education will work to overcome this shortcoming,” he said. The government aims to reach 5000 children from government schools as well as low-income communities who will be given the chance to learn music through regular workshops conducted by trained facilitators, as part of the music bus project. Weekly music workshops and monthly happy circles for the betterment of social and emotional health of children will also be conducted through the music bus.“The overall aim is to deliver happiness to children and enable them to discover their potential, through music as a creative tool of transformation,” the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/to-fuel-passion-for-the-arts-delhi-government-launches-mobile-music-classroom-101631980895888.html

Our team had to break it open as it was locked from outside,” said a senior police official.Police said the girls, most of who were brought from Jharkhand, were confined to the flat for over three months.They were produced before the Rajouri Garden sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) who ordered a case and handed over the victims to Nirmal Chhaya in Hari Nagar. A case under sections 370 (buying or disposing of any person as a slave), 374 (adulteration of drugs), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC was registered. Police said they have arrested one woman, Sarita Tirki (22), who has been sent to judicial custody, and are on the lookout for another woman, Sunita Yadav.Police said the women also run an operation in Shakarpur area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-bust-human-trafficking-operation-in-rajouri-garden-rescue-20-women-101631980595587.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||Rather than a new wave, Covid pandemic will continue to smoulder, says immunologist||Hindustan Times talks to Satyajit Rath, immunologist and visiting professor at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, to know more.The Delta variant is predominating the pandemic across the globe. Genome sequencing shows that the situation is similar in Maharashtra too. So, what role will the Delta variant and Delta plus variants play in the anticipated third wave outbreak in the state?I do not think that any of this is easily predictable. The trend with Sars-CoV-2 has so far been that more transmissible variants tend to survive and spread. However, none of them has been more drastically ‘lethal’. I see no reason to think that this trend will change, so it is unlikely that a more ‘lethal’ variant will emerge. The lineage of delta variants is already quite strongly transmissible, but it remains possible that an even more transmissible new variant might emerge. Since large-scale vaccination campaigns are going on the world over, it also becomes possible that new variants that can establish infection even in vaccinated individuals might emerge and spread in vaccinated groups. However, again, there is no reason to expect that such new variants will be much more ‘lethal’.On this background, I guess that, rather than a new ‘wave’, the epidemic will continue to smoulder, with ups and downs, with local outbreaks waxing and waning in different places.It has never been particularly useful to think about the idea of a ‘wave’ for the epidemic. The disease does not spread uniformly in countries, states or even cities; it spreads in neighbourhoods. So the patterns of the outbreaks have always been local and much more complicated than any idea of a uniform ‘wave’.Data on the Genome Surveillance portal shows there has been a gradual rise of AY.4 sub-lineage in Maharashtra. Your comments on epidemiological characteristics of the variant or its transmissibility.So far, the AY.4 sub-lineage is a type of delta variant; one of many. While it has indeed been growing in proportion in some places such as in Karnataka, it has not done so in other places. So its significance is unclear as yet, and needs more studies. It is not dramatically more ‘lethal’, as far as current evidence shows. It is not growing in proportion in Kerala, for example, though Kerala’s vaccination rate is quite high, so it may not correlate with so-called ‘breakthrough’ infections. We will have to await more studies.What should be the main cause of concern for the public health department in Maharashtra?The main causes for concern for public health departments remain the same as they have been for a year and a half; - we need much more durable, systematic and large-scale Covid-19 surveillance, we need community partnerships in covid-appropriate behaviour with special emphasis on mask usage, we need expansion of an equitable vaccination campaign, we need durable, long-term expansions of decentralised public health care facilities including community outreach for both Covid-19 and for other currently neglected illnesses, and beyond this, we need support for marginalised livelihoods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rather-than-a-new-wave-covid-pandemic-will-continue-to-smoulder-says-expert-101631980542186.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||Delta variants still predominant in Maharashtra but sub-lineage AY.4 gaining pace||In the second wave, a significant proportion of Covid-19 infections were attributed to the highly transmissible Delta variant (lineage B.1.617.2). Whole-genome sequencing of over 15,000 swab samples done till August shows that the Delta variant is still predominant in the state. But data from centralised portal Indian Covid-19 Genome Surveillance (ICGS), maintained by CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), has revealed that last month 44% samples sequenced from the state were identified with the new sub-lineage of Delta variant—AY.4— which was higher than other Delta variants.Emphasising the need for more genome sequencing (study of changes in the structure of the virus over time), medical experts said the prevalence of AY lineages might be more in the anticipated third wave.Can AY4 lineage be a new threat?Variants of Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 are divided into three categories—variant of interest, variant of concern and variant of high consequence. The four variants of concern have been named Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. The AY.4 sub-lineage of the Delta variant was first identified in Maharashtra in April when 46 swabs tested positive for novel coronavirus infection.In July, out of the samples sequenced, around 4% were identified with AY.4. But to everyone’s surprise, the number jumped to 44% in August, becoming the predominant sub-lineage, as per data on the ICGS portal. Since April, Maharashtra has been sending 100 samples (from all 36 districts) every month to CSIR-IGIB for genome sequencing.The Delta variant is one of the three subtypes of the Sars-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage. As per the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), the Delta variant causes more infections and spreads faster than earlier forms of the virus that causes Covid-19. In total, there are 12 sub-lineages AY.1-AY.12 of Delta variant. AY.4 to AY.11 are predominantly found in the United Kingdom.At present, AY.4 is a ‘variant of interest’ but medical experts fear that it could become a contributory factor in the anticipated third wave. “It could become the dominant strain and needs to be watched closely. So far there is no indication to suggest that it is more transmissible, or more likely to cause breakthrough infections or immune escape when compared to earlier sub-lineages of the Delta variant. But monitoring its spread, and severity of disease caused will be important,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist and epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital, Khar.The state public health department is keeping a close eye on all the international passengers. There were 30 arrivals and 30 departures of international flights under Vande Bharat mission in August. In August, an order was issued by Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte stating that all international passengers arriving in Maharashtra will have to carry a negative RT-PCR report even if they are fully vaccinated.However, medical experts have raised the need to run more genome sequencing on swab samples of international passengers. “After 18 months of the infection when globally over thousand variants of Sars-Cov-2 have been reported, we need to boost genome sequencing. An RT-PCR only confirms if a traveller is carrying a mutated variant,” said T Jacob John, a virologist who was formerly with Christian Medical College, Vellore.As AY.4 is a new sub-lineage of the Delta variant, scientists lack knowledge about its transmissibility. Experts associated with the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), a group of 28 laboratories in the country monitoring genomic variations, said sporadic spikes observed in various regions are due to different sub-lineages.States like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are also recording a rise in AY.4 in India.On Wednesday, a bulletin by INSACOG stated that AY.4 was the most frequently seen sub-lineage in the recent sequences from India, as well as globally.“In terms of AY. 4, a few cases have come positive in terms of genome sequencing; we need to continue doing genome sequencing regularly, so we are aware of what is growing,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, part of the state’s Covid-19 task force.Dr Pinto highlighted that as India has already been widely exposed to Delta variants, newer variants are going to be a constant threat, especially if such variants are endowed with mechanisms to evade immune responses to vaccines or past infection.Delta variants are still the most dominant strainFrom December 2020 till August,15,263 samples in Maharashtra have been analysed by INSACOG— the highest in the nation followed by Kerala. Data collected from its surveillance portal shows the Delta variant started becoming dominant in March when the pandemic curve was at its peak in the state. In March, 13% of the sequenced samples were identified with B.1.617.2 which gradually started increasing with the rise in Covid-19 cases. In April, 57% samples tested for the same which further shot up to 87% in May. In the following month, almost 83% samples were identified with the Delta variant and 86% in July. However, in a change of trend, in August, only 36% samples were identified with the Delta variant in the state.“The Delta variant remains the dominant variant across the country. Maharashtra is not different. We have to be certain the Delta variant doesn’t mutate to another variant, which is a big concern amongst healthcare providers and intensivists, that we don’t have to deal with another strain of the virus. That would probably mean that the third wave would be problematic,” said Dr Pandit.Dr Jacob said the incubation period of the Delta variant is short and symptoms generally appear within four days which increases the transmission.The number of the Delta Plus (AY.1)— a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2) haven’t witnessed a sudden surge like AY.4 variant. The Surveillance data shows that the positivity rate of Delta Plus has remained around 1% among the sequenced samples.The civic-run Kasturba Gandhi Hospital that sequenced 564 samples from Mumbai in the last three weeks, didn’t find any Delta Plus variant except Delta variants. But experts claim it is too early to see it as a silver lining.“The third wave could be of Delta or Delta plus variant; more or less, a large proportion of the population has been impacted by the Delta variant anyway. So, we should be worried about the Delta variant which is more transmissible in itself, and the Delta Plus variant which has shown traits similar to the Delta variant,” Dr Pandit.Need for more genome sequencingAll viruses, including Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, change over time. Most changes have little to no impact on the virus’ properties. The World Health Organisation (WHO) states that some changes may affect the virus’s properties, such as how easily it spreads, the associated disease severity, or the performance of vaccines.Thus scientists are emphasising conducting more genome sequencing especially for a populated state like Maharashtra which was the major contributor to the total caseload in India. In mid-March, the state was contributing 62% of India’s daily new cases and had a share of 58% in the country’s active cases.Medical experts said the current rate of genome sequencing is inadequate. In Maharashtra, between December 2020 and August 31, 46,36,050 people contracted Covid-19 but as the Surveillance portal shows only 15,263 samples have been sequenced in the consecutive time.Dr Anita Mathew, infectious disease specialist, Fortis Hospital, Mumbai said every breakthrough infection, critical patients and people with reinfection need to undergo genome sequencing. “Viruses are known to mutate, so mutations will continue. There is no predictability on whether the mutation is for the better of the virus (in the form of increased transmissibility) or is detrimental to the virus (in the form of less transmissibility and virulence). Genome sequencing, therefore, is the best step ahead,” she added.INSACOG in a bulletin said that they are conducting the highest number of sequencing from Maharashtra and Kerala.Dr Pinto also emphasised the need for more sequencing with the fear of new variants which can evade immune mechanisms that a person has by past infection or vaccination. “Such a variant could lead to a surge in vaccine breakthrough infections and reinfections. We will need to constantly monitor such a possibility with large scale genome sequencing and correlations with severe disease and mortality,” he added.Dr Sujit Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control told HT that at present, there is no new variant in India. Also, a single new variant alone can’t cause a spike in cases. “The infection will become more manageable with the increase in vaccination and presence of antibodies.Just like other flu, Covid-19 will be there but will become easier to handle. We believe, in the next six months, we will see it’s ‘endemic’,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/delta-variants-still-predominant-in-maharashtra-but-sub-lineage-ay-4-gaining-pace-101631980534615.html
18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Emblems of empowerment: A spirited champion who’s building future talent||Hailing from the remote Train village, situated in the foothills of tourist resort Gulmarg, Jabeena Akhtar says her desire to learn self-defence amid stone-pelting incidents in the Valley spurred her to pick wushu in 2008.As she continues to champion the martial art nationally and internationally since, the 34-year-old is also cultivating young talent – having already trained over 1,000 boys and girls in wushu.“I have taken hundreds of boys and girls under my tutelage, and I hope they will bring medals for Jammu and Kashmir, and the country in the coming years,” says Akhtar, who has set up training academies at several places in northern Kashmir without any government support.At her maiden global outing in 2017, Akhtar won a bronze for the country at the International Wushu Championship in Armenia.Continuing her medal run back in India, she secured a bronze at the 27th Senior National Wushu Championship in 2018.Closer home in J&K, she had already brought in gold medals at the 13th and 14th editions of the J&K Wushu Championship in 2016 and 2017, respectively, before a bronze each at the 15th and 19th editions.First post-graduate in her villageAkhtar is not only the first woman from Kashmir to get an international medal in Wushu, but also the first post-graduate from her village, giving younger girls in her area a female role model to look up to.Nominated as brand ambassador of the Beti Bachao Beti Padao campaign, the mother of a four-year-old girl, says, being a sportsperson in a remote village was never easy. “I couldn’t simply wear a tracksuit for practice and had to cover it up with an abaya (gown). Taunts were frequent, but I didn’t lose focus,” she says.From cricket to wushuLong before she learned the ropes of martial arts, Akhtar had grown up playing cricket, which she went on to pursue at the state and national level. “I was a cricket player and even participated in national events. While training in Ganderbal, where stone-pelting was frequent, I wanted to equip myself with self-defence skills. Wushu seemed interesting, and once I took it up, there was no going back,” she says.Akhtar credits her success to three people – her late father, Hafizullah Sheikh, coach Kuldeep Handoo and husband Khursheed ul Alam, a government teacher: “I won an international medal only after getting married in 2016, and it wouldn’t have been possible if my husband didn’t have my back.”Despite multiple medals under her belt, Akhtar hasn’t been able to land a decent job in the sports or its allied departments. Instead, she currently works in the social welfare department as an anganwari worker, where also she has won several awards and accolades for her dedication.“I got the national award for exceptional achievement in child development by the Union ministry of women and child development in 2017-18,” says Akhtar, who holds a masters in physical education through Kashmir University, apart from a certificate course in nutrition and childcare.“Whatever the shortcomings, I try to work hard and excel in my field. I am a sportsperson, so I am always ready to face challenges,” she says, smiling over young girls playing in her neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/emblems-of-empowerment-a-spirited-champion-who-s-building-future-talent-101631980474493.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra speeds Covid vaccination drive: 13,20,581 inoculated on Saturday||Amidst the apprehensions over the third wave of the pandemic, Maharashtra is currently speeding up its vaccination drive. On Saturday, 1,320,581 doses were administered, which is the second-highest one day figure to date. The highest was on September 8, when 1,517,311 doses were administered.Maharashtra currently leads the nation in terms of fully vaccinated citizens. Till now Maharashtra has administered a total of 73,257,136 doses, of which 20,600,374 citizens have been fully vaccinated. This means that 22.88% of the targeted population have been fully vaccinated. The target is to approximately vaccinate 90,000,000 citizens. The Maharashtra government has the infrastructure to vaccinate 1.50 million daily.“Maharashtra is doing a good job in vaccination, and this will help us to face the third wave, if any,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor, Government of Maharashtra on Covid-19 management.“Unlike last year, we now have a major population which is vaccinated, and this will be our greatest weapon to fight the third wave,” he added. However, he cautioned, “The challenge today is how effective the vaccines are against the variants,” he added.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, describes the fully vaccinated people figures as abysmally low. “The current pace shows that we can reach our target by only next year and by that time, we may have to face the third wave.

18-09-2021||Mumbai||CBI court rejects bail pleas of Rana Kapoor’s wife, daughters||A special CBI court on Saturday rejected the bail applications of Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor’s wife Bindu Kapoor and daughters Roshni and Radha Kapoor Khanna and remanded them in judicial custody in the Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) case. Rana Kapoor, DHFL, its promoter Kapil Wadhawan, Doit Urban Ventures Ltd are booked in the case on the charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption. The court had granted Bindu and Radha interim relief on September 4 till their main bail applications were heard. On Saturday, special CBI Judge SU Wadgaonkar rejected bail applications of the three and sent the three to judicial custody.Advocates Vijay Agrawal and Rahul Agarwal had filed the bail applications for the three and had argued that the CBI had already filed a charge sheet in the matter without arresting them and hence as per apex court orders they were entitled for bail.Other courts and coordinate courts have been granting bail in such type of matters where charge sheet is filed without arrest, Agrawal had argued.He also pointed out that in December, 2020, the PMLA court had already granted them bail in the ED casen which is an off-shoot of the present case. The completion of trial was likely to take time, the accused had deep roots in the society and is not likely to be flight-risk, nor tamper evidence or no chances of influencing witness, he had added.It is alleged that Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crores in DHFL and in return DHFL gave Kapoor ₹600 crore as bribe in the forms of loans to a firm controlled by the latter’s wife and daughters.CBI alleged that Rana Kapoor extended financial assistance to DHFL to get substantial undue benefits for himself and his family members via companies held by Kapoor and his family.The case was registered in March 2020.The agency had filed a supplementary charge sheet in the matter on August 20, 2021, after which the court had summoned Bindu Kapoor and Radha Kapoor. In the first charge-sheet the agency had named Rana Kapoor and his daughter Roshni as accused.The court was told by CBI on Saturday that the Byculla women’s prison didn’t take any accused without an RT-PCR report, which is mandatory due to Covid-19 situation. The court then asked the CBI to keep the three in their custody till RT-PCR report of the three came and posted the matter to Monday for further hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-court-rejects-bail-pleas-of-rana-kapoor-s-wife-daughters-101631978734868.html

Earlier, Khurshid arrived at the Bamrauli airport at 11.30am and directly went to the slum near Bakshi Bandh in Daraganj. Here, he and other senior Congress leaders interacted with the residents.He also led the interaction with farmers, traders, women and students during his stay at Kalyani Devi.

However, during an inspection the district administration found the gurdwara allowing visitors. “The executive magistrate, sub division Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, has submitted a report that the management of Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, BKS Marg, New Delhi, has allowed visitors/prayers inside the gurdwara which is violation of… the order dated September 15, 2021 of DDMA Delhi.

The proposal at the green belt has invited opposition from environmentalists and residents. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which had earlier opposed the plan initiated by Aba Bagul of the Congress has also supported the Rs120 crore proposal. The original project that includes seven theme gardens such as nakshatra, bamboo and local species also has a cricket stadium for women, gym, study room and solar panel-covered parking. A five-acre cricket stadium named Sa Du Shinde has already been developed on the hill. Bagul said, “The plan was proposed in 2018 though leaders of some political parties opposed it. Now the administration has okayed the project and submitted it before the PMC standing committee for approval. Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar has given nod to the plan and it is expected that all parties would approve the project. The project will be carried out in phase wise manner.” The project invited controversy as some green activists challenged it. Following the opposition, various meetings were held in PMC regarding the project. During a presentation of the project, NCP members Subhash Jagtap and Ashwini Kadam had challenged it. The project was on paper since 2018 because of opposition from political leaders and activists. Meanwhile, NCP leader Sharad Pawar and Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan inaugurated the Sa Du Shinde cricket stadium and Nakshatra garden. With several changes, Taljai hill has become a popular destination in the city amid with many citizens visiting it for walk. In March this year, the state government sanctioned ₹13 crore for the development of forest and greenery on the hill. Sources said that as Ajit Pawar held a meeting with party leaders recently to discuss the proposal. Following the meeting, party leaders said that the project could get a green signal this time.

For two decades, Punjab has seen the Patiala Royals maintain an important link to power. Capt’s wife, Preneet Kaur, is a four-time MP; mother was a former MP; he has been a MP himself and a state minister as well. Since 1998, the politics of the Punjab Congress has been controlled from his New Moti Bagh Palace in the city. This was the time when he had rejoined the party, after resigning to protest against the Operation Bluestar in 1984.Since then, the Capt’s clout has ensured that almost two dozen of his lieutenants from Patiala have been appointed chairman, vice-chairman of important state government undertakings.A war veteran, politician, military historian, author and shooter, Amarinder dons many hats. In politics, old-timers say he has a habit of reinventing himself and making a comeback. His leadership drew the country’s attention when he got the Punjab assembly to unilaterally enact the controversial ‘Punjab Termination of Water Agreements Act of 2004’, against the wish of his party. When asked to prove himself, he contested and won against BJP heavyweight Arun Jaitley. Since then, he has also been referred to as the ‘Savior of River Waters’. He had the Badals jailed in a corruption case, which failed in court. Later, when the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) came to power, he was booked in the same case. In his long political innings, Amarinder ensured that no Punjab Congress president could work independently, be it Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, Shamsher Singh Dullo, Partap Singh Bajwa or others. His close aides Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa led major coups against state Congress chiefs. These leaders, however, turned against their political master, when he failed to act on their demands of justice in sacrilege cases; scrapping Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and action against drug mafia. Amarinder still remains the tallest leader of the state, but this time, perhaps, he could find himself all alone. His failure to address allegations of a quid pro quo arrangements with the Badals has also been a great undoing. Narinder Dogra, former head, political science department, Punjabi University, says, “Amarinder has lost credibility for ignoring leaders loyal to him. With advancing age, resurgence is very difficult. No one else in the royal family can match him in ability.”Congress leaders in Patiala agreed, but claimed that it was the bureaucracy that had dented the Capt’s image. Dogra added that over-dependence on bureaucracy and failure to sort out issues with PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu contributed to Amarinder’s downfall. “With Amarinder not the CM, the development of the city will be hit. Patiala will lose its say in decision-making within the Congress,” said Navtej Singh, a Congress leader from Patiala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/its-curtains-for-patiala-royal-brand-of-politics-in-punjab-101631972793762.html

Only the Char Dham replica has some work left after which we will be ready to inaugurate the park. We are trying to open it by the end of the month or early October,” said a senior corporation official working closely on the project.The park is inspired by the corporation’s Waste to Wonder park in Sarai Kale Khan, which has replicas of the seven wonders of the world, similarly built using scrap material.The official added that discussions are on about the entry fee for visitors.“The fee amount is still being worked upon. It may be the double of waste-to-wonder park, which is ₹50 on weekdays. It is still to be finalised,” the official said.The waste-to-wonder park charges ₹50 entry fee for visitors aged between 12 and 65 years on week days and ₹100 on Sundays.The park has replicas of major architectural sites from across the country, including Hawa Mahal, Meenakshi Temple, Khajuraho Temple, Konark Temple, Charminar, Mysore Palace, Junagarh Fort, Nalanda ruins, Sanchi Stupa, Hampi ruins and Ajanta and Ellora caves, among others.The park also has amphitheatres for cultural events, a walking track of 1.5 km, fountains and ponds.SDMC standing committee chairman Colonel (retd) B K Oberoi said that the park aims to offer a tour of the country’s major sites within two hours.“The park is in its final stage and shall be thrown open very soon. We are also going to have a children’s park and smart illumination of all the replicas. We also plan to come up with a little train for children to take them around the replicas,” said Oberoi, adding that they will also open a food lounge to offer cuisines from across the country.Oberoi further said that another park featuring statues of heroes of Indian history from across the country, “such as Jhansi ki Rani, Maharana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji, among others”, is also in the works and a proposal will be presented in the standing committee soon.“The park is in planning stage at present. We plan to bring together freedom fighters and national war heroes depicting India’s history. Also, it will have inscriptions and a brief history of the story associated with a particular legend. It will provide a glimpse into the lives and history of the country’s heroes in one go,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/south-mcd-to-throw-open-bharat-darshan-park-in-punjabi-bagh-within-two-weeks-101631972373645.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay scientists develop new technique to accurately measure soot||Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay have developed a new data-processing technique to measure low amounts of soot accurately. This will help designers build better combustion-based devices such as internal combustion engines in cars.In simple terms, soot are tiny black particles that rise from a flame. Soot is formed when the fuel doesn’t burn entirely. When fuel burns properly, a blue flame is seen, whereas the flame is yellow when the soot is formed during burning and it becomes hot. Soot can cause cancer and respiratory and cardiac disorders; it can also reduce the life of machine parts.However, accurately measuring small amounts of soot can be a challenge and has spawned several research projects. In a recent study by a group of five researchers from IIT-Bombay led by Neeraj Kumbhakarna, professor from the department of Mechanical Engineering, demonstrated a new technique to effectively reduce measurement errors when soot is present in low amounts. This study was published in the June issue of the Journal of Aerosol Science and jointly funded by the Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre, IIT-Bombay and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).The researchers analysed digital camera pictures of burning fuel to guess the temperature of the fuel and use the information to estimate the soot volume. The amount of soot can be measured using methods such as collecting and weighing the soot and studying a light beam shone on soot particles. The current study uses the last method.The researchers passed a beam of red laser light of a specific frequency, through a droplet of burning fuel and took images as it burnt. The light falling on the camera also contains the light from the burning fuel. The researchers used a narrow band filter to let only the laser light pass and filter out the light emitted by the burning fuel. “When a flame having soot particles is shone with light, called background light, the particles absorb and scatter some of this light, so light reaching the camera is less bright,” said Anand Sankaranarayanan, a post-doctoral researcher from IIT-Bombay and co-author of the study.The researchers used the relation between the initial brightness of the laser light, the brightness of the light falling on the camera and the soot volume to calculate the amount of soot. They then used a data-processing technique to compute the values of brightness from their images. Their challenge was to estimate the initial brightness of background light falling on soot particles since this isn’t directly captured in the images.The researchers predicted the brightness of background light at every moment instead of using an average. They observed the flickers in background light at areas present outside the flame of the burning fuel, where there is no soot. They used it to estimate the background light falling on the soot particles. “Using our new data processing technique, we got lower errors, especially when the amount of soot produced is low. Our technique does not require any additional equipment or extra expenditure, which is an added advantage,” said Sankaranarayanan.To further reduce errors in the experiment, the researchers passed the laser light beam through a fixed and a rotating diffuser — a glass sheet that scatters light — before the light was incident on the burning fuel. A diffuser gives an evenly bright light and avoids the many speckles in the camera image. Speckles need to be removed while processing the data, leading to a loss of information. The researchers also validated their data processing technique. They used it to calculate the amount of soot for some previous measurements reported in the literature and verified the results. They also qualitatively checked their experimental observations.They burnt a droplet of toluene (a carbon-based fuel) and compared their experimental observations with that in the literature. “We observed a similar peak value of the amount of soot. As expected, we saw high amounts of soot slightly inside the outer edges of the flame, where temperatures and fuel concentration are high,” Sankaranarayanan added.“Quantification of soot is crucial from an environmental perspective. This is an important study as an effective method to quantify soot will help in identification of strategies to mitigate combustion-based practices in India,” said Darpan Das, a post-doctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Bloomberg School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, who was not a part of the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-scientists-develop-new-technique-to-accurately-measure-soot-101631972253641.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Sindhudurg airport gets aerodrome licence||Sindhudurg airport has received an aerodrome license from the Director-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The aerodrome license will now enable the airport operator to throw open the new aviation facility for the airlines and general public.Sindhudurg’s Chipi airport, an SPV of IRB Infra, has a 2,500-metre-long runway and can handle 200 departing and 200 arriving passengers during peak hours.The DGCA in the license issued to the company stated, “The license authorises the aerodrome to be used as a regular place of landing and departure to all persons on equal terms and conditions by aircraft requiring specifications of the runway and associated facilities including granted exemptions equal to or less than those indicated in the Aerodrome Manual.”Virendra Mhaiskar, chairman and managing director (CMD) of the company said, “We are very happy to achieve yet another milestone in the current year and see the airport receive the license to operate after successful completion. With a concession period of over 90 years and a compelling regional proposition, it offers meaningful avenues of growth. We now look forward to opening the facility for airline operators and the general public soon.”This comes after the Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, last on Thursday, unveiled a 100-day ambitious plan to bring major reforms in the aviation sector, including operationalising five airports, six heliports and 50 new routes under the regional connectivity UDAN scheme that included Sindhudurg airport.Before this, Scindia had also written to chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to speed up the process of commencing operations from the airport.Sindhudurg airport with a cost expenditure of approximately ₹800 crores and a concession period of above 90 years is the first of its kind in the south Konkan region, which is aimed at enhancing air connectivity of the region with western Maharashtra and southern states.“The airport will not only generate passenger traffic but will also be a boon for the economic development of the region as it will facilitate and boost cargo transportation, generate direct as well as indirect employment and other business opportunities for the local people,” read the statement from IRB. “It has potential to become a cargo hub of the western region as there is ample space for handling the cargo, and is expandable to meet the future growing needs,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-sindhudurg-airport-gets-aerodrome-licence-101631972133697.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||Three arrested for trying to extort from 76-year-old doctor in Mumbai||Unit 12 of the Mumbai crime branch on Friday evening arrested three people, including a 21-year-old woman, who allegedly posed as members of a naxalite group and tried to extort a sum of ₹50 lakh from a 76-year-old doctor.According to the police the three had used a letterhead with the words Lal Salaam to threaten Dr Wadilal Shah, who owns a clinic in Goregaon (East). The arrested trio, identified as Hayat Shah, 50, Vikrant Sirat, 45, resident of Virar and Baisakhi Wishwas, a resident of Ghansoli in Navi Mumbai, had planned the extortion for the past one week. To learn the skill of extortion, the three had searched YouTube videos.Police officers said that Hayat was Shah’s patient for two decades and perhaps knew how much he earned.“Hayat and Sirat are estate agents and knew each other. The two came up with the plan and enrolled Wishwas to deliver the letter,” said an officer from crime branch.On September 15, Wishwas visited the doctor’s clinic in disguise of a woman patient, wearing a burkha, and dropped the letter addressed to the doctor at a medical store next to his clinic. Due to several patients waiting in line, the doctor accepted the letter but did not open it till he reached home.Police officers said that on opening the letter he saw that there was a red mark on it with words saying that they would kill him and his son if he did not pay them ₹50 lakhs.After reading the letter in the evening, the doctor approached police and reported the incident. The first thing that the police did was to scan the CCTV footages of the areas where the burkha clad woman walked. The officers then saw Wishwas removing her burkha and showing her face kilometres away from the clinic.Based on her phone location, the officers arrested Wishwas from Ghansoli. Wishwas then gave up the names and addresses of the other two accused who were arrested on Friday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/three-arrested-for-trying-to-extort-from-76-year-old-doctor-in-mumbai-101631972013651.html

The minor lived with her aunt who notices abrasions and scratch marks on her arms while giving her a bath and inquired about it. The girl eventually told her that the school sweeper would take her to a room during recess and sexually assaulted her. He had allegedly threatened the girl against telling anyone about it.The minor’s family then approached the court and the sweeper was arrested after investigation.The prosecution examined nine witnesses including the minor, the investigating officer, school staff and a videographer who recorded the girl’s statement. They also relied on several documents such as medical reports, birth certificate of the girl, forensic report along with spot panchnama. Advocates Nilesh Ojha and Abhishek Mishra, for the accused, had argued there were material contradictions and omissions in the minor’s testimony. They claimed that the accused was not present on the date of the offence, and said there were no eyewitnesses. They further claimed that the accused was falsely implicated by a person who wants get the school vacated.Special Pocso judge Sanjashree S Gharat observed that the accused was unable to produce any evidence to support his claim and held the accused guilty for commission of offence punishable under 376 (2) (n) and 506 (2) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 6 of Pocso Act in view of the provisions of section 42 of Pocso Act.Responding to an application for the discharge of the accused filed by the complainant, the court observed that the application was filed after the accused was held guilty and was set for sentencing and hence dismissed it. The accused was then sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment and a ₹30,000 fine under one charge and 1 year imprisonment and ₹10,000 for another. Both the sentences would run concurrently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pocso-court-school-sweeper-gets-15-years-term-for-sexual-assault-of-minor-101631971713673.html

The action is taken under a special drive undertaken in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and rural areas.The commodities which are seized are from Circle 5 (rural Pune).Also, 12 sweet shops have come under the scanner for not following the norm of ‘displaying best before date’ on the packaged items.While from the Pune division which includes - Pune, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, Kolhapur, FDA officials have seized food items worth ₹1,538,477. (see graphic)“The seized commodities are from sweet-marts and grocery shops. Till the samples are not cleared from the lab we cannot allow the sale of the items which are under surveillance,” said Shivaji Desai, joint commissioner, (food), FDA Pune.The drive was undertaken in the five circles of the Pune zone, headed by assistant commissioners and respective food safety officers.Pimpri-Chinchwad area comes under Circle 4, while under Circle 3 – Camp, Hadapsar, Lonavla, Talegaon and nearby areas. Peth areas, Market yard, Kondhwa, Mundhwa, Katraj comes under Circle 2 and Baner, Shivaji nagar, Aundh, Khadki, Khardi comes under Circle 1.“More samples have been taken from sweet-marts, their testing is still underway in the labs. Issuing compounding penalties also becomes important as it makes more impact as violators have to pay a fine at the same time when they are caught. Otherwise, court cases go long and violators keep finding ways to not pay fines,” added Desai.In the Pune zone, from Circle 1, ₹5,000 was collected as a compounding penalty from one shopkeeper while from Circle 3, ₹21,000 were collected from four shopkeepers.The food samples are tested at the State Public Health Laboratory, Camp.“As per norms sample reports should come from labs in 15 days, but with only one lab available the process is delayed and sometimes results even come after 30 days,” added Desai.Meanwhile, ₹43,000 fine was also collected from Sangli with 23 sweet-mart owners failing to follow the ‘best before date’ norm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fda-seizes-food-items-worth-rs-1-4-lakh-in-pune-rural-action-against-12-sweet-shop-owners-101631970813781.html

The editorial also stated Modi was taking “bold” steps and doing the “repair work” ahead of the 2024 general elections. The Saamana editorial, however, slammed Union minister Amit Shah saying he lost West Bengal election for the party and lost 25-year-old ally Shiv Sena when he was at the helm. “PM Modi is the real face of the BJP and everyone else is a torn mask. Without Modi, many of the present masks of the BJP will be defeated in the municipal elections. Being aware of this, he has started taking bold steps to prepare for 2024,” the editorial said.It said that since the time JP Nadda became BJP president, the party has been undergoing constant changes. The Marathi daily also said that Modi and Nadda have taken corrective action on BJP-ruled states and steps for 2024 general elections. “The Modi-Nadda duo replaced chief ministers in three states. In Gujarat, they uprooted all old trees and planted new saplings (referring to replacing Vijay Rupani and his full cabinet). [Now], Modi and Nadda are keeping a close eye on chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Himachal [Pradesh] and Haryana.”The BJP has started “repair work” through Nadda to overcome the defeat of the party in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Maharashtra, Sena spokesperson and associate editor of Saamana sanjay Raut claimed in the article. Attacking Shah, the editorial said, “A campaign was started that Amit Shah can win any contest, but during his tenure 25-year-old alliance of Sena-BJP was broken and now the BJP has to sit in the opposition benches. Due to the same reasons, Modi along with JP Nadda is now engaged in repair work.” As a policy, state BJP unit does not respond to Saamana editorials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pm-modi-real-face-of-bjp-says-saamana-editorial-slams-shah-101631969493551.html

18-09-2021||Pune||Curtain call: On my way to stage experience of a lifetime!||When I was growing up, I was always intrigued with going abroad, to more developed nations. My father used to travel abroad to teach at various universities and he used to be away for months. Since there were no video calls or emails during that time (yes, I realise that I am old), I used to rely on my father’s description of his experiences and physical copies of pictures that he had clicked there. I had insisted on travelling with him more than a few times, but he had decided that his sons should travel abroad on their own dime. My elder brother picked the correct path by becoming an engineer and travelled for further studies. I, on the other hand, had chosen the Commerce stream and (to make matters worse!) had started taking a lot of interest in theatre and films. As luck would have it, my first international trip materialised because of theatre. And serendipitously, I flew to the UK the next day after appearing for my graduate exams! While I will write in detail about that later, I distinctly remember planning to watch as many plays as I can over there. And I was dismayed by just glancing at the ticket prices! It was 2008 and I was not conditioned to pay more than 50 GBP to watch a show! But after a few days, I made up my mind and zeroed in on two plays. I watched them at the coveted Westend area in London and it blew my mind. The shows were visual spectacles of course. But for me, the experience started with entering the theatres. The architecture, the aesthetics and most importantly how painstakingly it had been maintained. I loved it. What I loved most was their ability to use modern technology in old buildings. I returned to India and reminisced about the experience from time to time. A few of my friends went to the UK for further studies in theatre and I would listen to their experiences and feel envy. A few years later, in 2016, I directed a version of the classic “Sangeet Saunshaykallol” which was produced by the theatre stalwart Prashant Damle and it starred him and Rahul Deshpande as primary characters. Damle is a veteran and has tirelessly built an audience in various countries too. Most of the shows which are performed abroad are in smaller venues and ill-equipped halls. But with a play like “Sangeet Saunshaykallol” he had an exciting plan! He envisioned that a play like “Sangeet Saunshaykallol” should be performed at a venue fit for it. Just the thought of performing at a venue in Westend was exhilarating and Damle, the amazing producer that he is, started converting his vision into action. With the help of his contacts there and a few sponsors, he managed to secure a century old venue – The Peacock Theatre. The date was set nearly six months in advance – October 9, 2016. Almost all Maharashtra Mandals in the UK lent their support. We were supposed to ship our set around three months before. But since we were also performing in India actively, we built an exact replica of the set just for this one show and shipped it. I was surprised at the extravagance of it all. But Damle had secured a show in the US in July 2017 and had already planned to keep the set in storage in the UK and ship it to the US from there itself. He had calculated that it made more sense to keep it there, rather than ship it back to India and then re-ship it to the US, as it had already travelled half the distance. I was very impressed with his future planning. While other groups cut down on their teams while travelling abroad to cut costs, we took our entire team. Because this wasn’t like any other show. A total of 22 people travelled there. Five of us travelled before the rest of the team for a technical check. It felt good to travel again to the country where I had first watched large-scale productions. Only this time, I was going to be a small part of it! Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-on-my-way-to-stage-experience-of-a-lifetime-101631968834492.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai police on high alert ahead of last day of Ganesh festival||Mumbai Police is on high alert and security has been beefed up across the city for the 10th and last day of immersion of Ganesh idols on Sunday, especially in the wake of recent arrests of terror suspects, an official said. The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad on Friday nabbed one person from Mumbai in connection with an alleged terror plot unearthed by Delhi Police. The ten-day Ganesh festival will come to an end on Sunday. The celebrations have been subdued this year due to the restrictions imposed in view of the coronavirus pandemic. Processions, the hallmark of immersion days, are banned. Anti-sabotage measures are being taken and security around vital installations has been increased, said deputy commissioner of police S Chaitanya, the Mumbai police's spokesperson, on Saturday. Apart from intensified patrolling in sensitive areas, there will be heavy deployment of security personnel at immersion points, he said. Extra lights, cranes, swimmers/life guards, ambulances and fire brigade teams would be arranged to handle any eventuality, he added. As many as 100 additional officers and 1,500 personnel from the Local Arms and other branches will be deployed, the DCP said. Besides, at least three companies of the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), one company of CRPF, 500 home guards and 275 constables from outside units will be stationed in the city. The police are also keeping tabs on known criminals and have increased surveillance at hotels, lodges, vital installations and sensitive locations. Officials also held meetings with Ganesh mandals, peace committees, mohalla committees and others stakeholders, the police spokesperson added. The Delhi Police's Special Cell had on Tuesday busted a terror module with the arrest of six men, including two Pakistan-trained terrorists. One of them was a resident of Dharavi in Mumbai, police claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-on-high-alert-ahead-of-last-day-of-ganesh-festival-101631967825845.html
18-09-2021||Pune||Your Space: Public transport safety norms||The recent two incidents of kidnap-rape of minor by autorickshaw drivers have exposed the security measures in place at public areas. Even as the Pune police and RTO have taken steps to penalise rickshaw drivers for various violations, it is a step taken as an afterthought. Readers share steps that could be taken to gender sensitise rickshaw drivers and better public transport safety norms. Let her travel safely 24x7 If India is to attain real gender equality, then we must ensure that Indian women and girls are able to travel safely and easily 24x7 to the destination of their choice, at par with Indian males. Thus, ensuring safe public transportation is a step towards gender equality, enhancing their ability to participate in educational, professional, and social activities and overall improved participation of women and girls in public life. After the Nirbhaya rape case in 2012, the subject of women’s safety especially in public transport came in the forefront. Justice Verma Committee was constituted to investigate the women’s safety issues. The committee was assisted by a team of young lawyers, law students and academics. The committee has submitted its report in 2013 itself, but unfortunately many recommendations of the committee have not been implemented even till date. Proactive approach can play a huge difference in reducing social and heinous crimes like rape and sexual harassment of women and girls. Checking of documents, imposing fines on autorickshaw drivers form part of the ‘reactive approach’, are important, have disciplinary impact which unfortunately fades away over a period if not implemented continuously. A multi-disciplinary approach must be implemented. Social and reformative actions to deal with the core of social norms and values of the people engaged in plying autorickshaws and similar public transport modes is the need of the hour. Providing safe transport environment to women is directly linked with attaining gender equality guaranteed in the Constitution of India. Every autorickshaw driver and staff employed in public transport system must mandatorily be required to undergo a one full day workshop on gender sensitisation and related subjects every year, wherein character checks become an integral part. Education on women related laws and punishments for violations must become part of such workshops. Such workshops can also help in developing common database of autorickshaw drivers and other public transport operators. Such workshops must be held round the year at all districts across India. A ‘Women Transport Commission’ must be constituted, and such workshops and the system can be implemented through such a commission, which may work under the ministry of women and child development. Police system alone cannot deal with the subject. The police mechanism can on the other side work on the disciplinary and punitive approach. Government must significantly invest in public transport which leads to offering safe and convenient transport system for women, thereby reducing their dependence on private modes and autorickshaws. Today women are forced to travel by overcrowded buses which is very unpleasant for them. Police patrolling and vigilance through CCTV should be increased at isolated spots. Sexual harassment mostly happens at crowed places or isolated spots. Satya Muley Issue driver’s licence only after sensitisation programme The basic reason for this crime is lack of understanding of law, education and value building. A study of rickshaw, cab and truck drivers has found that most of them are Class 10th pass being given commercial licence. If the government authorities have made Class 10 as mandatory qualification for driving public transport vehicles, a training class also should be made compulsory for them. In Germany, one need professional qualification or certification as basic requirement for starting any business and drivers have to undergo compulsory 15-day orientation based on value building and ethical way of doing business and financial understanding. The country also rewards those who carry out work earnestly and honestly. India should also formulate such programmes for those starting businesses and in service sector. Background verification of those who are given driver’s licence should be done like it is carried out for issuing passport. A guarantor should be taken for commercial licence basically a indemnifier who is responsible for the behaviour of the person could be another way of looking at it. While these steps will be strict, it needs to be implemented to check these kinds of crime. Generally, autorickshaw drivers face a lot of public criticism because of their work style. CCTV camera surveillance on major roads will help keep a check of their activities. A 24x7 helpline facility like ambulance could be introduced for public transport where a distressed passenger can seek assistance. Sachin Bendre PMPML in bad shape for a reason Policy makers have intentionally kept public transport utility Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) an underdeveloped public asset for decades to aid the auto, petroleum and ancillary industries. This has sabotaged PMPML being the safest primary choice of intracity transport for the masses. Mismanagement in operations of PMPML have run it into losses. This has resulted in poorly maintained buses with no comfort or security systems, features commonly found today across the globe in other developing countries like India. Pushkar Kulkarni Overhaul public transport system Women who use public transport feel exposed to physical or verbal aggression, sexual harassment and other forms of violence or unwelcome behaviour. It is an issue that has ripple effects that can last a lifetime, not only for the person impacted but for families and communities. The painful truth is that our community are not immune to these societal problems. Technology can help law enforcement to investigate reports of crime, and hold people accountable for their behaviour. All trips arranged in-app GPS tracking for every trip means that there is a record for the exact time and location of trips - providing accurate, objective information. Team of law enforcement professionals who are on call to work with police 24/7 to respond to urgent needs. For this we need cooperation among stakeholders, education and training of transport employees, increasing public awareness, and the use of digital technology. Vaishali Patkar Promote women autorickshaw drivers Promote women autorickshaw drivers. An OTP-based app by road transport office (RTO)/Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) where a user input autorickshaw registration number and the OTP will be approved by passenger and autorickshaw owner to monitor start and end journey. Compulsory SOS system in such public transport facility should also be put in place. Bhushan Chincholkar Self-defence is only solution Women drivers can help in empowerment too. There is a need for more security cameras, and strict actions against offences, even minor ones. There should be an open data on rickshaw registration number to check details before boarding an auto. The drivers should have training and orientation before giving and renewing auto licence. Also, the authorities should look at increasing bus frequency. It will also help if we had some basic martial arts training and safety moves training for children and working women. The last one here is not for victim blaming but to put auto drivers on guard, something similar to gun philosophy in the US, not trusting anyone and focusing on self-defence. Subversion of women is not given importance even by women, let alone men, in our Indian society. Except may be for a few thinkers. I am not really sure what the solution can be. Education to some extent, but just that won’t be enough. Aditi Kale Punish the guilty The kidnap-rape cases of minors are a matter of grave concern. Pune was considered safe for women. The need of the hour is “safe” Pune and not “smart” Pune .The ones in power - the politicians, the police and the judiciary - needs to raise above politics and religion and ensure that the guilty are not be spared. Justice delayed is justice denied. The punishment should be swift and severe. All autorickshaw and taxi unions should themselves have a system to verify the credentials of their members and a set of guidelines.

18-09-2021||Pune||Pune startup mantra: Let the robot clean it up - faster, cleaner and safer||PUNE Pune-based ‘Peppermint’ start-up has designed and built an industrial floor-cleaning robot that leverages a combination of physical scrubbing, chemicals and ultra-violet light to facilitate seamless cleaning of floors. These robots help in automating housekeeping and service operations across industries, warehouses, airports, offices and public spaces. This B2B service robotics company (Aubotz Labs) is now coming up with “commercial real-estate friendly” robots. In the beginning… Peppermint was founded by serial entrepreneurs Runal Dahiwade and Miraj C Vora. Dahiwade is orginally from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh while Vora was raised in Kolkata and has currently settled in Bengaluru. Dahiwade and Vora initially met in 2006 during a quiz competition in Bengaluru. Dahiwade was pursuing his engineering and Vora was graduating in business administration then. Dahiwade was curious about entrepreneurship and startups, with Flipkart and Redbus sparking his introspection, and inspection, then. He got an opportunity to intern with Redbus after which he founded his first startup, Carkhana, in 2011. Vora also founded a profitable startup - a gamified sales-enablement software, Outsell. He wanted to make a global impact and knew Dahiwade had the same thoughts. Says Dahiwade, “I was interested in the automotive sector. Carkhana was an ecommerce marketplace for automotive spare parts and accessories. While we were looking for angel investment in 2012, we met Naveen Kumar Kshatriya, who then was managing director of Castrol India. In 2013 Kshatriya retired and started his own company TopWheelz and offered to acquire us. We accepted the offer. I stayed with the company for next three years. Later, I joined another company, Refreshed Car Care, in 2016 as its chief operating officer.” Robotics Dahiwade scaled the new company, but in 2019 there was an interesting turn of events. Dahiwade says, “Refreshed Car Care (RCC) was a car washing service business, which was human resources dependent. As we scaled, we turned into a manpower aggregator instead of a service provider. RCC Founder Chirag Shah, who is now also an investor in Peppermint, acknowledged the problem and asked me to find an automation solution. I quit my job and went back to Kshatriya for guidance. He suggested we look at a broader use case, critical for daily operations.” “Commercial housekeeping in public spaces, working spaces like airports, hospitals, schools, colleges, warehouses, industries, railways, was one such case. It was predictable, completely global and scalable. Interestingly, commercial housekeeping workflows globally are also same. Automation could solve all problems related to workforce dependence and quality of execution of work. I was convinced that housekeeping robots is the way to go,” said Dahiwade. Automation ecosystem Housekeeping is usually outsourced to facility management companies. Dahiwade met them to understand the nuances of business and operations. So Dahiwade says, “In Mumbai, compared to Pune, the engineering talent pool is not deep. Mumbai is also an expensive city, so we chose Pune. Besides, Pune also has a good ecosystem for automation companies. I shifted in March 2019 to Pune. We scouted for locations and finalised the Narhe-Ambegaon area. Since the renowned PARI company (Precision Automation and Robotics India) is situated here, there are plenty of automation suppliers – who adhere to global standards due to PARI’s requirements – in Narhe. Peppermint was officially founded in May 2019 and initially we were just four in our team. By November-December 2019 we knew this that we can build this in India.” IIT Bombay incubation Dahiwade went to the Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE) at IIT Bombay, but since it was premature idea for incubation, they routed him through the Nidhi (National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations) and Prayas (Pomoting and accelerating young and aspiring technology entrepreneurs) grant, a pre-incubation initiative by Department of Science and Technology of the government of India. Peppermint received the grants in June 2019. Says Dahiwade, “By August 2019 it was clear that we were on the right path. Some investors from Carkhana supported us including Naveen Kshatriya. We raised a pre-seed round in September 2019. In November 2019 we got formally incubated at SINE. It gave us access and resources, because as a hardware startup, unlike software, our costs are way beyond manpower. Manpower is just one aspect. We have to plan for other basic necessities like machinery purchasing. We soon realised that we have to be wise or else we will spend our resources. We paced our goals and figured out we would require six more months to have a good product ready.” Product launchPeppermint launched its first robot in February 2020. Dahiwade said, “It was not open for deliveries, but for showcasing to potential customers and to assess feedback. In Mumbai it was done at IIT Bombay and in Pune at Narhe. We had a virtual incubation for six months in Venture Centre. Dr V Premnath helped us. Our hypothesis was proved and now the journey needed more people and more guidance.” Vora joined Peppermint full time in March-April 2020. He oversees all business and sales while Dahiwade oversees all product development and productions. By April 2020, in the middle of first lockdown, Peppermint was ready to start demos. Lockdown boonIn May 2020, Peppermint we got clearance as an essential service provider to government agencies. Says Dahiwade, “In June 2020 we did demos for some essential industries. We realised that in the next six months our prototype will turn into an actual product. We needed more resources and so we did a seed funding round in June 2020 led by Venture Catalysts. Existing investors also topped up.” “We moved our R&D team and operations team to Narhe and began scaling. By September 2020 we deployed the first few robots. These were paid customers including some from the pharmaceutical sector. In January 2021 we entered batch production. Now we have operations in Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Chennai, Indore and Goa. In March 2021 we set up our first overseas distribution channel based out of Dubai. In July 2021, our first delivery of the Peppermint robot happened,” he said. Traction and the overseas market Says Dahiwade, “We knew we had enough traction. We had 10 customers including JSW Steel, Godrej and other large industries in India. We realised if they are finding value in our robots, it’s time to scale further and make Peppermint truly world-class. We decided to invest in production and so we raised another round of funds - Rs5 crore in June. This was led by Venture Catalysts, Indian Angel Network and supported by Vinners group.” Prakash Kelkar, a Punekar and one of the investors from Venture Catalysts, suggested eying the overseas automation robotics market. Says Dahiwade, “We see Peppermint as a global robotics company. There is no difference between a Delhi or Detroit or Doha. We had our plans to go overseas in 2022, but we said to him that we can expedite if you help us.” “After-sales support is an issue globally, especially in the Middle East. We as Indian manufacturers care for customers. We found that people appreciate that and realised that our philosophies and fundamentals are very good. In the Middle East we have three cities, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha, where we have our channel partners,” says Dahiwade. With fresh round of funds, a world- class manufacturing capability is next. “We have the building blocks in place and now we have to convert into seamless assembly lines. We should exit this financial year with very stable manufacturing operation,” he added. Future plans Peppermint has regional service centers in Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru. Dahiwade says the future is more of sales and that their distributors can rent or lease. He said, “At present we have industrial robots. By end of 2021 we will have commercial real estate friendly sized robots which will be slightly smaller in size for use in offices, hotels. These products will be dryer machines like vacuum cleaners, carpet cleaners, dry moppers. Our existing robots have payloads as per floor cleaning systems. We can program these same robots to bring tea, for material movement in warehouses, room service in hotels. Our game plan is to be a ‘B2B Service’ robotics company – the best and the largest in its space.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-startup-mantra-let-the-robot-clean-it-up-faster-cleaner-and-safer-101631962112892.html
18-09-2021||Kolkata||Uncertainty over Bengal BJP’s Durga Puja celebrations after party’s poll debacle||Less than a month remains for the biggest festival in West Bengal, the Durga Puja celebrations, to take off, but uncertainty still looms over the fate of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s puja celebrations this year.In October 2020, the party organised Durga Puja for the first time in the state with much fanfare. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had virtually addressed the people of West Bengal on the occasion of Durga Sasthi on October 22. This year, however, no such initiative and plans have been made so far, senior party leaders said. Even though the five-day-long Durga Puja starts this year from October 11, the festival extends for more than a week every year. Mahalaya this year would be held on October 6 and the immersion process would continue till 17.“I was not among the puja organisers last year. Some of those who had organised it are not there in the party anymore. As far as I know, no preparations have been made yet. I don’t know whether those who were there in the cultural cell of the party and had organised the puja last year, are doing anything this year. I had told last year too that it is not the party’s job to organize a puja. Some people went ahead and did it. I don’t know what are their plans this year,” said Dilip Ghosh, BJP’s president in West Bengal. In May, the party suffered a debacle in the assembly polls. While top leaders of the BJP including, the PM and Union home minister Amit Shah, had claimed that BJP would form the government with more than 200 seats, the party could manage only 77 seats. The TMC returned to power with a sweeping victory winning 213 seats and Mamata Banerjee took oath as the chief minister for the third consecutive row on May 5. “Last year, on the instructions of the party, the puja was organised by the party’s cultural wing, women’s wing and youth wing. This year, no such instructions have come,” said Amrita Banerjee, BJP youth leader. Senior BJP leaders, including the then Union minster Babul Supriyo, party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta were seen beating the dhak (drums) on the dais last year during the puja, while others such as MP Locket Chatterjee, the then vice president of the party Mukul Roy and BJP leader and former mayor of Bidhannagar Sabyasachi Dutta had played important roles in organizing the puja at EZCC in Salt Lake.“Last year, the durga puja was organised in the auditorium of the central organization named Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre. The assembly elections were ahead (scheduled in 2021). Now there are no elections. Again, they would organize another Durga puja ahead of the 2024 parliament elections,” said Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, TMC Rajya Sabha MP.While Mukul Roy has shifted to the TMC, Locket Chatterjee has been appointed as a co-in charge of the BJP in Uttarakhand for the upcoming Assembly election 2022. Babul Supriyo had said he was quitting politics even though he and Swapan Dutta had been made the party’s star campaigners for the upcoming Bhabanipur elections. Both Supriyo and Dasgupta had contested in the recently held assembly polls and had lost. Dutta has fallen silent. While Supriyo has joined TMC. The Durga Puja in West Bengal would be held this year following all the Covid-19 protocols, mandated by the high court and state government, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said.While at least 36,000 community pujas are held across the state, in Kolkata alone 2500 community pujas are held by various clubs. These are just the clubs that are registered with the state government. This apart there are pujas held in housing societies and residences. There are around 1500 pujas which are organised by women only. In 2020, the Calcutta high court had banned the entry of visitors inside puja pandals. A cap was put on the number of committee members, local residents and dhakis (drummers) who could enter the pandal as part of the celebrations. Last year, puja was celebrated in a muted manner which prevented a major spike in Covid-19 cases.According to a study commissioned by the state government in 2018, the economic value of the creative industries that crop up around the Durga Puja – the biggest festival in West Bengal – is worth ₹32,377 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/uncertainty-over-bengal-bjp-s-durga-puja-celebrations-after-party-s-poll-debacle-101631961289208.html
18-09-2021||Patna||Chirag writes to CM Nitish to recommend Ram Vilas Paswan for Bharat Ratna||After the first death anniversary of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) founder and former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Chirag Paswan wrote to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, demanding a recommendation for his late father for Bharat Ratna. He also pressed for the installation of his father’s life-size statute and his birth anniversary to be declared a state holiday.“A resolution in this regard has been passed by the LJP’s national executive in view of the late leader’s invaluable contribution in his nearly five-decade-long political career, during which he had the privilege to work with six prime ministers. He always strived to work for the nation’s development and build an egalitarian society without any discrimination,” Chirag Paswan wrote to the CM, with a copy to both the deputy CMs.Chirag Paswan’s demand comes in the backdrop of PM Modi’s emotional message on the late leader’s first death anniversary. The prime minister described Ram Vilas Paswan as a “close friend, a great son of the nation, Bihar’s pride and a strong voice for social justice”. Chirag had criticised the chief minister for staying away from the death anniversary function of his father, though Kumar did pay a tribute by issuing a statement. The bitterness between Chirag Paswan and Kumar deepened after the LJP announced candidates against the JD(U) in the last year’s assembly elections.The letter to CM from Chirag follows similar demands from the RJD and the BJP, as well as the split-group of the LJP led by union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras in the past. Soon after the split in the LJP, Chirag had also appealed to PM Modi for Bharat Ratna to his father after the national executive meeting was held in New Delhi.Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi had also made a demand to declare the birth anniversary of the late leader a state holiday and installation of his statute. RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has also been echoing the same. Former Bihar minister and senior BJP leader Prem Kumar had also demanded Bharat Ratna for Ram Vilas Paswan.Paras, who also visited Chirag’s home to attend the death anniversary function for the first time since the split, also reiterated the demand for Bharat Ratna and on Friday and organised a function to pay tribute to his elder brother Ram Vilas Paswan. Later, he said that he would like Nitish Kumar to forget political differences and recommend the LJP’s founder’s name for Bharat Ratna.Former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi had also made this demand. Manjhi recently also wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind, with an additional demand to convert the late leader’s 12, Janpath bungalow in New Delhi, to a memorial. The bungalow was in the news after Chirag installed a statute of his father, barely a few days after he was served notice to vacate it.JDU spokesman Neeraj Kumar said that everyone has the right to write to the CM. “But here, the matter is not to be decided by the state alone. He is the lone MP from his party and his party split due to his own policies. Now that he has written, he should be patient,” he added.BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said that it was for the government to decide on the letter. “We respect Ram Vilas Paswanji to the core.

18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana gears up to douse paddy stubble burning||Haryana has put in place a robust strategy, including incentives and punitive steps, to put out farm fires ahead of the paddy stubble burning season. The harvest of paddy crop, spread over 34 lakh acres in Haryana, is set to start in a week. The challenge before the state government is to check farmers from burning the crop residue, blamed for poor air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR). Also read: PPCB chairman urges farmers to shun stubble burning practiceMonetary incentives to farmers, more custom hiring centres (CHC), staggered paddy harvesting, panchayats passing the zero-stubble burning resolution, awareness campaigns and committees from village to district levels to monitor farm fires and police complaints are among enforcement measures the government has planned to overcome the challenge. Micro-level planning for zero stubble burning Last year, farm fires in Haryana’s paddy fields dipped. There was an 11% reduction in stubble burning cases. 9% of the reduction in stubble burning was noticed in 20,900 hectares. Haryana reported 5,678 active fire locations (AFL) in the 2020 kharif season against 6,364 in 2019 and 9,225 in 2018, according to official data. The aim of the state agriculture department is to further reduce the number of farm fires and increase the area with zero stubble burning. According to additional chief secretary (ACS), agriculture, Sumita Misra, micro-level planning has been done on the basis of previous year active fire locations in red and yellow zones of the state. She said under the radar will be 922 (199 in red zone, 723 in yellow zone) hotspot villages. Fatehabad, Kaithal, Jind, Karnal, Sirsa and Kurukshetra districts are in the red zone. All applicants in the red and yellow zones have been allowed to buy the crop residue management machines this year. “The monitoring and enforcement measures have been chalked out in detail,” said Misra, who is also the Haryana State Pollution Control Board chairperson. Funds for crop residue management  ₹141 crore released for 2021-22 under the crop residue management (CRM) scheme will be used in curbing crop residue burning, while ₹58 crore, which was unspent under a particular plan, will also be utilised this year. Nodal officers are being deployed at the district, sub division, block and village levels. Two officials in the red category and one in the yellow category have been deputed in each village for ensuring farmers don’t burn crop residue. A team, comprising officers of the departments of pollution, revenue, panchayat, police, and agriculture, is being constituted at the village, block and tehsil levels for taking enforcement measures, such as issuing challans and lodging police complaints/FIRs, against defaulters. Staggered harvesting, awareness blitzkrieg Ensuring staggered harvesting is on the agenda for better machine availability. In Haryana, 57% of the 34.1 lakh acres of paddy is under basmati which matures two weeks later then the non-basmati type. Another paddy variety, Muchchal, covers 2 lakh acres and matures after basmati. Thus, staggering is automatically done because of this difference in maturity, officials said. Further staggering plan has been prepared by shifting baler units from one area to other. The machine operators/owners prefer to exhaust the GT Road belt first. Then they move towards the Sirsa-Fatehabad belt prominent for the 1401-Muchchal variety. The nodal officers at the village level have been asked to further advise the farmers to stagger their harvesting schedule. Plans are afoot to launch an awareness campaign that includes drawing 1,175 wall paintings in hotspot villages, erecting 800 banner hoardings at prominent places, and deploying 30 vans for demonstration and enforcement. About 1,900 camps in villages, 96 camps at the block level and 13 at the district level will be held to educate farmers about policies and incentives government has been offering to stop stubble burning. In these camps farmers, custom hiring centre owners, and youngsters of hotspot villages will be trained regarding the operation and maintenance of the crop residue management machinery. Prevention of crop residue: Broad strategies Haryana has launched an incentive-driven flagship scheme, Mera Pani Meri Virasat, for diversification from paddy to alternate crops. The government gives ₹7,000 per acre incentive to the farmers. In 2020-21, the government said 96,000 acres of paddy was diversified with alternate crops and over ₹45 crore incentive was disbursed among the eligible farmers. This year, farmers have registered 98,000 acres for diversification. At least 1,000 custom hiring centres (CHCs) at 80% subsidy will be established and 3,550 individual category machines at 50% subsidy will be provided, Misra said. While an incentive of ₹1,000 per acre will be provided to the farmers for baled paddy straw output, a tie-up is being made with gaushalas, brick-kilns, cardboard, paper, packaging, furniture, and handicraft industries utilising crop residue. The farmers are being made aware about these industries for disposal of the residue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-gears-up-to-douse-paddy-stubble-burning-101631958332340.html

He, however, cautioned the state that if safety protocols are not observed, tourists, foreigners, will not arrive. Addressing state officials and health workers during an interaction to congratulate the state for having ‘officially’ completed vaccinating 100% of the population with the first dose - a target that has been achieved one and a half months after the deadline that was initially set - the Prime Minister said vaccination was key to revive the sector. “India’s vaccination drive is not (only) a cover for health, but a cover for livelihood too. It is important that tourism destinations open as soon as possible… the Char Dham yatra in Uttarakhand. Goa’s 100 percent vaccination has become important to revive the tourism sector,” Modi said. “You imagine, hotel industry people, taxi drivers, hawkers, shopkeepers... Once everyone is vaccinated (then) tourists can come to Goa with peace of mind. Politics aside, Goa is a part of a select group of tourist destinations where people are vaccinated,” he said. “Tourism can resume in the coming tourism season just like before. We are planning to allow foreign tourists to come here. Domestic and international tourists can take pleasure in coming here. This will be possible when we give as much importance to corona precautions as much as we have given for vaccinations. It is our duty,” he added. “Today, the number of cases have come down, but we still cannot take this virus lightly. You will get as many tourists and travellers depending on how much importance you give to safety and hygiene,” he said speaking during the online interaction. The prime minister also announced ‘fully guaranteed’ loans up to ₹10-lakh to people involved in the tourism industry and up to ₹1-lakh to registered tourist guides. “The central government is taking steps to welcome foreign tourists back. The government has decided to give 5-lakh tourists free visas. Travel and tourism stakeholders will be given loans up to 10-lakh with a 100% guarantee by the government. Tourist guides are being given the facility of taking a loan of up to ₹1-lakh. In the future too, the Central government will be ready to help those to take up the tourism sector forward,” the Prime Minister said. Responding to the prime minister, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said the industry will reopen fully when it is deemed safe to do so. “Tourism is the main business in Goa. He mentioned Sikkim and Kerala as touristic states that are nearing 100 percent vaccination,” Sawant said. “Tourists coming to Goa will consider themselves safe because of the 100 percent vaccination coverage, which will end up attracting national and international tourists to Goa. He (the prime minister) is very much concerned about the taxi drivers, hotel workers dependent on the industry,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/foreign-tourists-will-be-allowed-in-goa-soon-pm-modi-101631955873709.html

The dissenting cabinet ministers and MLAs, who are close to newly appointed Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu and had met Congress general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat last month to seek Capt Amarinder’s ouster, have been demanding a meeting of the legislature party to settle the issue. Also read: Punjab cabinet okays free insurance for 15 lakh more families, milling policyBoth the Capt Amarinder and Sidhu camps are claiming support of a majority of party MLAs in the state. The Congress has 80 MLAs in the 117-member assembly and the state elections are less than five months away. Liberate Congress moment: Mustafa “The high command’s decision to call the meeting means they have heard us and want to settle the matter. There can be no other reason to summon such an urgent meeting. We will speak our mind there,” an MLA from the dissenting group said, requesting anonymity. However, Sidhu’s principal strategic adviser Mohammad Mustafa called it a “liberate Congress moment” for 79 of the 80 party MLAs to redeem the party and its honour. “Punjab gave Congress 80 MLAs. Sadly, paradoxically Congmen didn’t get a Cong CM as yet. Time to have one after a long agonising wait of 4 and half yrs with an opportunity to choose one and reelect Cong again to have party CM with pain of Punjab and Punjabis at heart for five years (sic),” tweeted the former Punjab DGP. Mustafa’s wife Razia Sultana is a cabinet minister in the Congress government. Capt hosts lunch for supporter MLAs While Amarinder is still to comment on the high command’s move, he has gone into a huddle with his political aides and has called MLAs supporting him for a luncheon meeting at his farmhouse before the CLP meeting. While the chief minister is the leader of the CLP and calls the meeting, the AICC’s move to call the meeting at the party headquarters and direction to the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee to facilitate is seen as unusual. Ajay Maken, Harish Chaudhary to be observers The Congress leadership has appointed party leaders Ajay Maken and Harish Chaudhary, who will be accompanying Rawat, as observers for the CLP meeting. ‘They will probably have a one-on-one meeteing with each MLA and then a one-line resolution is likely to authorise the Congress president to take a decision,” said a senior party leader. Rawat had made the announcement about the CLP meeting on Friday night. “The AICC has received a representation from a large number of party MLAs, requesting to immediately convene a meeting of the legislature party of Punjab,” he posted on Twitter, asking all MLAs to attend the meeting at 5pm. Minutes later, Sidhu also took to the microblogging site to inform the party MLAs. “As per the AICC directive, the Congress Legislative Party meeting has been convened at @INCPunjab PPCC Office, Chandigarh, on 18 September 2021 (Saturday) 5pm,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-heads-for-showdown-at-clp-meet-today-101631948611473.html

He also asked the officials to set up the museum with audiovisual equipment for explaining to the students about the scientific knowledge and type of technology used in the construction of dams.Development commissioner Pradeep Jena asked the officials to select the dams closer to the towns and growth centres having more potential for attracting people. It was decided to take up 3 to 4 such dams in the first phase and gradually expand the intervention to other popular dams based on the learnings from the first phase. It was estimated that around ₹4 crore would be invested for the development of the area around each dam.Odisha has around 20 medium and small dams with Hirakud dam in Sambalpur district topping the list. The dams are Lower Indra in Kalahandi district, Salia dam in Khurda, Upper Jonk (Patara dam) in Nuapada, Upper Kolab dam in Koraput, Samal Barrage in Angul, Balimela dam in Malkangiri, Harabhangi dam in Gajapati, Kuanaria dam in Nayagarh, Ghodahad dam in Ganjam, Badanalla dam in Raygada, Bhanjanagar dam in Ganjam, Pitamahal dam in Sundargarh, Kanjhari dam in Keonjhar, Kansabahal dam in Sundargarh, Salandi dam in Keonjhar, Sanamachhakandana MIP in Keonjhar, Dhanei dam in Ganjam, Khadkhai dam in Mayurbhanj, Indrvati dam in Kalahandi and Hadagada dam in Keonjhar district.Hirakud dam with a length of 21 kilometres, is the longest dam and forms the largest artificial lake in Asia. It has an area of 746 sq km and a shoreline over 640 kilometres.From April this year, water sports on the right dyke of Hirakud dam with jet ski, speedboats, water scooter, bumper boat, banana boat, kayak and paddleboat rides were to be started at the reservoir.

18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal cabbage crop hit by fungal disease||Cabbage crop in a dozen villages of the remote Chhota-Bhangal valley in Kangra district has been hit by a fungus causing blackleg disease. Scientists visited Dyot, Kothikohar, Nalhota, Badagran and Lohardi villages, the main cabbage-producing areas, earlier this week to examine the vegetable crops, particularly cabbage. Also read: Rawat & team in Chandigarh today for meet as Punjab Congress continues to boil“The cabbage crop has been hit by blackleg disease, caused by a fungus called Phoma lingam. It attacks many brassica crops and spreads rapidly. Plants can be affected at the seedling stage or at any stage in the field. Common symptoms are slight lesions on stems at cotyledon scars which elongate, turn brown with a black to purplish border, and become sunken, causing the stem to girdle and blacken,” said Arun Sood, the principal extension specialist, extension directorate of Chaudhary Sarwan Kumar Himachal Pradesh Agriculture University (HPAU), Palampur. Farmers told about sprays to treat crop Infected plants wilt, lodge, and die. On root crops, symptoms occur in the form of cankers on the fleshy roots and a dry rot may appear in storage.Sood said black rot has been found infecting the cabbage crop. “Farmers have been told to treat the crop by spraying a solution of 3gm copper oxychloride per litre of water or 1% Bordeaux mixture,” he said.Farmers have been advised to treat the seed with Bavistin fungicide while sowing.The infected plants must be uprooted and destroyed and drainage of water in fields should be ensured, the scientist said. A total of 152 hectares is under cabbage cultivation in the valley.Monoculture increases disease riskKangra deputy director, agriculture, Jeet Singh Thakur said farmers have been urged to adopt the crop cycle to avoid infection. Continuous cropping increases the possibility of disease spread. The farmers in Chhota-Bhangal grow only one crop in a year. This is also an off season crop there.Phoma lingam can survive for up to four years in the seed and three years in infected crop debris. “So, crop rotation is the best way for disease management. Radish, potato, coriander and French beans could be options. They can rotate these crops for the next two-three years so that the pathogen dies in the soil,” he said, adding that farmers of Chhota Bhangal have abandoned potato farming otherwise it was grown there in abundance.The scientists found that the kidney beans crop was also affected by angular leaf spot disease, which can be treated by spraying 1gm Bastivin/litre of water solution.Besides Sood, the team of experts comprised district agriculture officer Sushil Kumar and specialist Renu Sharma.Chhota Bhangal valley is a remote village in Baijnath sub division of Kangra district. The main source of income of locals is cultivation of cash crops such as cabbage, cauliflower, and kidney beans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-cabbage-crop-hit-by-fungal-disease-101631941230816.html

18-09-2021||Other||‘Despite CRZ notification, built-up area along Goa’s coast grows manifold’: Study||Despite the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification being in force since 1991, which disallows any fresh construction up to 500 metres from the high tide line along the coast, Goa’s popular beach stretches have seen an increase in built-up area by as much as 20 percentage points since then, largely fueled by tourism, a study that analysed satellite imagery to track development along the coast has found. The study, which was presented as a conference paper late last year, focused on two of Goa’s most populous talukas - Bardez that is home to beaches such as Candolim, Calangute and Anjuna and Pernem which is home to beaches like Morjim, Arambol and Tiracol - and has tracked reducing vegetation, water bodies and increase in the built-up area consisting of permanent residences, hotels, resorts, temporary tourist facilities, shacks, etc. “The built-up has increased from 19.6% to 40.3% (as a percentage of the total area), from 1991 to 2019 within the 500mts buffer... (and) from 15.12% to 36.79% within the 200mts buffer from 2012 to 2019. This includes permanent residential houses, resorts and temporary shacks. Whereas the 50mts buffer from HTL shows built-up and vegetation as 36.79% and 36.91% respectively in the year 2019,” the study said. The CRZ notification issued first in 1991 prohibited any construction between 200 metres from the coast which was to be considered a no-development zone and regulated construction between 200-500 metres from the coast. Except for the reconstruction of preexisting structures belonging to the traditional fishing communities on the existing plinth, no other constructions were to be permitted. This comes even as the Goa government delayed by more than six years the finalization of the Coastal Zone Management Plan and has now sought yet another month to complete the exercise. The study further states that according to a host of people they interviewed, the increased built-up area would serve to destroy the tourist’s experience of the coast. “With changing CRZ regulations, huge beach areas which today are public spaces will be used for commercialization under the banner of development. Tourists visit Goa for its beauty and open space where land meets the sea. If these spaces are taken over, the tourism industry which survives on natural beauty will be at stake as beaches will be already crowded. Neither tourists nor locals will have proper access to the beaches. The coast as a resource will not remain sustainable in future,” the study stated. Speaking to HT, Goa environment minister Nilesh Cabral admitted that there were “a lot” of coastal CRZ violations. “There are a lot of violations but we are acting and demolishing them as and when they are detected. People (the violators) also approach the courts and secure a stay on demolitions. But we have taken action against even big violators and resorts,” Cabral said. “A part of the problem is up to now we have been relying on the 1996 CZMP (Coastal Zone Management Plan) for which detailed scaled maps are not available. Once we are done with the current process of finalizing the CZMP plan for the CRZ 2011 then we will have a base on which to tackle violators,” Cabral said. “The government intends to have real-time monitoring of at least some portion of the coast that is prone to violations using satellite imagery for which we have to finalise the current plan first,” he added. Gaps in coastal regulation in Goa has for long been marred by patchy enforcement despite repeated adverse orders from the Bombay High Court at Goa. As far back as 2009, the Bombay High Court at Goa initiated a suo moto petition against illegal constructions along the coast and had asked coastal panchayats to detail what actions they propose to take against the violators. More recently, the High Court noted “an extremely disturbing feature as to how constructions are put up in CRZ areas without bothering to obtain any permissions from any authorities and thereafter some sort of immunities are claimed based on the completion of such constructions at breakneck speeds” by taking advantage of lax enforcement. This the High Court said was possible because the violators “are firmly convinced that as long as they race to complete the illegal construction and occupy the same, the law will never be able to catch up with them. The attempt thereafter is to institute all sorts of proceedings and delay the action against the wholly unauthorized construction put up in an eco-sensitive zone without seeking permissions from any authorities.” The NGT too had called for an ‘effective monitoring mechanism.’ “We may add that the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) appears to be working only based on complaints against illegal structures and a large number of illegal structures continue to exist despite the directions of the High Court… It may be desirable to have an inventory prepared in respect of such structures based on an independent annual survey, to be updated periodically to avoid selective action against the violations of the CRZ,” the NGT bench led by chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel, said. “An effective monitoring mechanism needs to be set up by GCZMA to advance the rule of law,” the NGT bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/despite-crz-notification-built-up-area-along-goa-s-coast-grows-manifold-study-101631936971812.html

The Congress government in the state, however, said that the bill has been brought on the basis of a Supreme Court order.“It will be a black day for the assembly if this bill is passed. Does the assembly permit us to unanimously allow child marriages? By a show of hands, we will be permitting child marriages. The bill will write a black chapter in the history of the assembly,” BJP MLA Ashok Lahoti said, according to news agency ANI.Rajasthan parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal, however, said that the amendment does not say that child marriages will be valid. “You say that child marriages will be validated. Nowhere does this amendment say that such marriages will be valid. A marriage certificate is a legal document, in the absence of which a widow won't receive the benefit of any govt scheme,” Dhariwal was quoted as saying by ANI.The bill passed in the Rajasthan assembly will now allow the government to appoint an additional district marriage registration officer (DMRO) and block marriage registration officer to register marriages. Before this, only the DMRO was authorised to register the marriages in the state. Under Section 8 of the Compulsory Registration of Marriages Act, If the girl's age at the time of marriage is less than 18 years and the boy's age is less than 21, then her parents will have to inform the registration officer within 30 days.The opposition objected to the amendment of Section 8 of the 2009 act, saying that it should be done away with. The bill was passed by voice vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-passes-bill-to-register-child-marriages-oppn-calls-it-a-black-day-101631936261255.html
18-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: His meals on wheels||His midday meal is always like a moveable feast, each day in a different setting. Vishal Kumar is lunching today here on Mathura Road. Yesterday he had his lunch in distant Anand Vihar. The day before he lunched in Moti Bagh. There is no knowing the site of tomorrow’s lunch. “Depends on the sawari (passenger) I’ll get,” he says, tearing a piece of roti as gently as a sensitive man might pluck a rose.An auto driver, Mr Kumar never eats “bahar ka khana”, the outside food, not even any light snack. He rides his auto across the city from morning to evening, and during these long hours of exhaustive work, he eats only once, which is the lunch. It’s always home-made.Every morning at 6, while he’s still asleep (and so are the kids Arjun and Adisha), his wife, Rekha, quietly starts her day with the chores of dawn. And that principally involves cooking the lunch. “Rekha prepares the food for all of us in one go so that she doesn’t have to cook again in the day,” explains Mr Kumar. Today’s menu is sukhe aloo, channa-urad mixed dal, and rotis. “Sometimes Rekha keeps four rotis, sometimes she keeps five rotis.”As is the case with the wives of most auto drivers, Mr Kumar points out, “my wife too constantly worries for me the whole time I’m out… particularly these days when it’s raining so hard and so often.” She calls him numerous times on mobile to assuage her anxieties, and repeatedly asks the same two questions. The first is: “Khana kha liya (had your food)?” This query naturally ends with the lunch. The other most frequent question remains — “Abhi kahan par ho (where are you right now)?”Mr Kumar never enquires into his wife’s lunch plans and eats whatever she gives him for the day. “When there is a festival or a birthday, she cooks rajma chawal, my favourite.”One evening two weeks ago, he casually expressed a craving for this dish. Without giving him any hint, Rekha left a bowl of rajma beans to soak in water overnight and the next day’s lunch was a pleasant surprise. “Rekha works so hard,” Mr Kumar observes.By now, the meal is done. He drinks water from a bottle, carefully puts back the empty metallic lunch boxes inside the red thermos, and prepares to resume his business. Mr Kumar will return home to his family in Rohini by 9 in the night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-his-meals-on-wheels-101631925393980.html

This stretch was scheduled to be inaugurated on August 6 but it was postponed to over a month later due to issues with an approach road to the station.On May 20, a portion of the road near the then under construction Dhansa Bus Stand Metro station caved in due to heavy rainfall, following which Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot undertook an inspection of the area on May 21 and directed an inquiry.The Dhansa bus stand metro station on the Dwarka-Najafgarh-Dhansa Bus Stand corridor will house the first-ever underground floor dedicated to the parking of vehicles. This integrated parking facility will allow commuters to park their vehicles and move to the concourse area directly, DMRC said in July.The Dhansa bus stand metro station has been decorated with artwork and photographs displaying the heritage, culture, flora and fauna of the national capital region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/najafgarhdhansa-bus-stand-extension-of-delhi-metro-s-grey-line-to-be-inaugurated-today-101631923731508.html

18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Don’t know why PM gets angry when I talk about holding dialogue with Pak: Mehbooba||The president of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and former J&K chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, on Friday said that Centre’s tall claims of Articles 370 and 35-A being the biggest impediments in the development of Jammu and Kashmir were “totally wrong”. She also asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi why he does he get “angry” whenever she talks about holding dialogue with Pakistan. Addressing party workers during her visit to Manjakote and Thannamandi in Rajouri district, Mehbooba again recalled how her father late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed convinced the Centre to open border routes with Pakistan for trade and people-to-people contact. “I told the PM that if you talked to Pakistan and restored ceasefire on the borders, then why you don’t take up the matter of resumption of trade from Muzaffarabad and Rawalakot. I also asked him why does he get angry when I talk about holding dialogue with Pakistan. Didn’t Vajpayee ji talk to them? Wasn’t there talk before with Pakistan? Pakistan is our neighbourer and if you don’t talk, then how will you move forward? Was Vajpayee an anti-national when he went to Pakistan and extended a hand of friendship from the land of Kashmir?” she questioned. She added, “The tall claims of development do not match the ground reality. Wherever people met me, they complained of erratic electricity, poor roads, and unemployment.” “Even recruitment rallies for youth in the border areas for jobs in battalions are not taking place. Youths with graduation, postgraduation and even PhDs are jobless,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-know-why-pm-gets-angry-when-i-talk-about-holding-dialogue-with-pak-mehbooba-101631919028396.html

This year so far, forces have killed more than 100 terrorists in various encounters.The latest review meeting was held on Thursday at Shopian district in south Kashmir, which is considered one of the most sensitive districts in South Kashmir.The DGP told the officers to continue to put in their best efforts not only to maintain peace and order in Jammu and Kashmir, but also to ensure that the dividends of a peaceful environment are further consolidated. “Jammu and Kashmir Police, along with the other security forces, have contributed in a big way in building the current conducive security scenario and would not allow enemies of peace and people to disturb it.”He said the peaceful atmosphere has been achieved after a lot of sacrifices and hard work and the police would not allow anybody to disturb it. “Forces should remain more vigilant in view of increased infiltration bids by terrorists from across the International Border and Line of Control so that nefarious designs of anti-peace elements are foiled,” he added.The DGP said that many successful operations on the borders have not only thwarted infiltration bids considerably but also killed many infiltrating elements. He told the officers to intensify operations against those involved in the narco trade as well. He said that Pak-sponsored elements were also trying hard to spread false and fabricated stories and propaganda by circulating some old videos and warned that strong action will be taken against those involved in such activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wont-allow-enemies-of-peace-to-disturb-it-j-k-dgp-101631917948002.html

He was speaking at a function to felicitate sitting and former members of HP Vidhan Sabha after the President’s address in the state assembly. “Instead of talking about who contributed and who failed to perform, we need to work collectively for the betterment of the state,” he said. If everyone starts speaking about the works done by them or by their government then only division would be created and the programme would become a political event, he said. It is seen as a counter remark to leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, who had listed contribution of Virbhadra Singh in development of the state.Thakur said Himachal developed in terms of roads, infrastructure building, and hydropower production. The state has protected its forests which are like lungs of the country, he said. “We need to chalk out a road map to make Himachal number one state in the country. Public opinion should be taken into account while setting the agenda,” he added. “As the President has asked to make Himachal ‘Sirmaur’ (top) state in the country, we need to work together to achieve the target,” said Thakur.Thakur, who also holds the youth services and sports portfolio, said besides the political leaders, the citizens should also get united and contribute towards the development journey by any possible means. He requested the speaker of Himachal Vidhan Sabha, Vipin Singh Parmar, to open the library of the assembly for students so that they can take a peek into its glorious past and where Himachal has reached today. All the quality speeches of the former members should be compiled and shown to the students, he added. Himachal Pradesh is celebrating the 50 years of its statehood. The state government had planned series of 51 events to be held round the year to mark the special occasion.These events were slated for last year but couldn’t be held due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rise-above-party-politics-anurag-tells-himachal-leaders-101631916748163.html

Among these 16 were in urban areas, 11 in rehabilitation colonies and three in rural areas. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people were sampled, and 80.2% of them were found having antibodies against the virus,” said hospital director-principal Dr Jasbinder Kaur.At 84.1%, urban population was found with highest sero-positivity, followed by rehabilitation colonies with 77.8% and rural areas with 69%.A similar survey conducted for paediatric population, by PGIMER in August, had revealed that 72.7% of the children, aged six to 18, had acquired antibodies against Covid-19.‘Third wave may harm adults, kids equally’Dr Kaur said, “The survey results suggest development of herd immunity in Chandigarh. Besides, UT has also achieved 100% first dose coverage among the eligible population. But people should not be complacent. Covid-appropriate behaviour must be followed to avert the third wave.”“Children as well as adults have acquired antibodies, but new variants of coronavirus, which can be more transmittable and destructive, can affect any person,” she cautioned.“People must get vaccinated at the earliest and follow Covid guidelines. Hospitals must also ramp up their infrastructure for both paediatric and adult population before the third wave arrives,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.Walk-in OPD to resume at GMCH-32 from Sept 20In view of the decline in Covid-19 cases, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, has decided to resume its walk-in OPD facility from September 20 (Monday). “Patients can either walk-in for physical consultation or take prior online appointments.

The house belongs to Amrik Singh Randhawa, the son of late actor and wrestler Dara Singh. The victim, Sajid Kumar, 34, hailing from Bijnore in Uttar Pradesh, and currently living in Zirakpur, was working at the house to fix the roof damaged due to water seepage. While he was working, a part of the roof gave way, burying him under debris. Police and fire brigade rushed to the spot, along with an ambulance. But the victim could not be rescued for nearly an hour in the absence of a JCB machine. It was eventually arranged from a site near Matka Chowk, but that took around 40 minutes. “The JCB machine with the disaster management team was occupied somewhere, so we had to arrange one. All this while, we continuously kept talking to the labourer to boost his morale,” said Charanjit Singh, DSP (Central), Chandigarh. After being rescued, Sajid was rushed to PGIMER where he was treated for a fractured foot. Amrik and his two daughters were away at Mumbai when the incident took place.

Apart from the reporter, Sunil, who works for Dainik Bhaskar, a Hindi daily, the Ambala Cantt police station also booked the newspaper’s zonal news editor, Sandeep Sharma.

Despite this, Sunil published the news without any verification,” he alleged. The Ambala police claim that the arrest was not made from the said location. Therefore, the report created an environment of “panic and terror”. While Ambala Range IG Bharti Arora and SSP Hamid Akhtar remained unavailable for a comment, inspector Vijay Kumar, station in-charge, Cantt police station, said, “The reporter was arrested and a search is on for the other person. The matter is under investigation.” The FIR against the duo has been lodged under Sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 177 (furnishing false information), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 505 (2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) of the Indian Penal Code.Legal expert Rohit Jain said except Section 505 (2), all were bailable offences, adding that if proven guilty under the said section, the accused can be imprisoned up to three years.

18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh traffic police to get own station soon||The Chandigarh Police will soon send a proposal to set up a dedicated station for the UT traffic police on par with other major cities. UT director general of police (DGP) Praveer Ranjan announced this at Sukhna Lake on Friday. He was speaking at a function where the initiative to install convex traffic mirrors in the city was launched.The DGP said most cities had a separate station for the traffic police. “We will go over the cases and in due course of time, a proposal regarding this will be sent to the authorities,” he said.Mohali and Panchkula already have dedicated traffic police stations with a station house officer. In Chandigarh, people pay challans and collect impounded vehicles from Traffic Lines in Sector 29. A Children’s Traffic Park is also set up in Sector 23 to spread awareness about road safety. Senior superintendent of police (SSP, Traffic) Manisha Choudhary said, “The idea behind a dedicated traffic police station is to ensure scientific data collection of road accidents and to thoroughly investigate all fatal and non-fatal road accidents. In a regular police station, investigation of road accidents may be neglected due to law and order, and other sensitive crimes happening. This concept is already prevalent in southern states like Karnataka, Pondicherry.”More sub-divisionsThe traffic police are also working on creating more traffic sub-divisions, in line with the police proposal to increase sub-divisions of local police from three to five. The traffic police have three sub-divisions right now, including central, east and south divisions.“Chandigarh has around 100 fatal and 200 non-fatal accidents every year. Because the volume of traffic has increased, road capacity is decreasing and innovative solutions are required,” said Ranjan.He explained how cameras had already been installed for an Intelligent Traffic Management System in the city and a control room to man these will be set up by the municipal corporation. The DGP also said the decrease in fatal accidents in 2020 was not only due to the lockdown but also due to enforcement by the traffic police.107 convex mirrors to be installed in cityA total of 107 convex mirrors will be installed in the city to provide better visibility at blind spots. The mirrors have been provided by ICICI Lombard as part of their corporate social responsibility initiative. Speaking about this, DGP Ranjan said, “The traffic police have identified 97 blind spots in the city. These convex mirrors with their wide-angle view will provide greater visibility, preventing accidents.”The first of the mirrors was unveiled at Sukhna Lake by UT adviser Dharam Pal in the presence of various officials of the UT administration, municipal corporation, ICICI Lombard and police. The remaining will be installed in the coming days by the UT administration and MC authorities, along with the traffic police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-traffic-police-to-get-own-station-soon-101631914292344.html
18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Police crack Sector-27 robbery with arrest of two||From a makeover to staying in hotels to consuming drugs, the main accused in the Sector 27 robbery – a cook and a car washer – fulfilled all their desires after robbing a model-cum-actor of ₹6.2 lakh on September 7, police said on Friday.On the run for 10 days, the main accused, Arjun, alias Nepali, 26, of Shahimajra village, Phase 1, Mohali, and Arjun Shrestha, 24, of Mataur village, Mohali, have finally landed in police net. Having spent most of the booty to enjoy a lavish lifestyle, the accused were found in possession of just ₹40,000. “They visited several places in Himachal Pradesh after hiring cabs and stayed at expensive hotels. They also spent big on getting a makeover, including tattoos, and hair rebonding and colouring,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. He added, “Both are addicted to drugs and went to Kasol, Himachal Pradesh, where they purchased more intoxicants. They were arrested from the Sector 43 ISBT after they returned to Chandigarh.” Apart from the two accused, police have already arrested their other two accomplices, Sunil, alias Sunny, alias Bihari; and Prem, alias Motu, an auto-rickshaw driver. ₹11,000 in total and the victim’s Apple AirPods were recovered from them. One stood guard outside, three robbed victimOn September 7, while Prem stood guard outside the 27-year-old victim’s house, the other three entered her house. They easily made their way into the premises around 12.30pm, as the door was left open by the domestic help. Holding the home-alone victim captive at knifepoint, they took her debit card and forced her to reveal the PIN, following which Sunil and Prem left to withdraw money from her account.As the two other robbers started to search the house for valuables, the victim grabbed the ₹6 lakh kept in a room and locked herself in the bathroom. But she handed over the cash after Nepali cut open the bathroom’s mesh window. Visited sister for Rakhi after robbery After the robbery, Nepali and Shreshta returned to Phase 1, Mohali, in an auto-rickshaw, and using the looted money, went on a shopping spree for clothes and shoes. They also visited Nepali’s sister in Mundi Kharar, where they celebrated Rakshabandhan. After presenting her ₹4,000, the duo returned to Chandigarh, where they stayed at a hotel in Sector 52 for three hours, before leaving for Bhunter, Himachal Pradesh. Main accused already convicted of burglaryNepali has already served a three-year sentence at the Ropar jail in a burglary case and was released in May this year. He was lodged in the Patiala jail also in connection with another case. A trained cook, who works at a furniture shop in Mohali, Nepali has been arrested thrice previously by the Mohali Police as well. Shrestha earns a living by washing cars. The victim had identified Nepali, as one of the four men who had delivered furniture at her house on August 30, after his saffron patka came off during the robbery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-police-crack-sector-27-robbery-with-arrest-of-two-101631914289679.html

18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali MC approves policy for taxi stands||The fund-starved Mohali municipal corporation has approved a policy for taxi stands and also increased vending sites for coconut sellers to rake in more revenue. Both revenue heads are expected to raise ₹15 lakh per month. The policy is also aimed at reining in mushrooming of illegal taxi stands. Currently, the city has nearly 40 taxi stands, of which only eight are approved. The illegal stands are mostly located in parking areas of markets.Under the policy, all illegal stands will need to be regularised, with payment of arrears since the stand started operating. A refundable security of ₹10,000 will also be levied.A taxi stand owner will have to pay ₹1,000 per taxi per month to the civic body, and each stand shall not have less than 10 taxis. The area for the stand will be provided on rent, with provision for 5% annual hike. The pre-fabricated structures for these stands will be approved by MC for uniform appearance across the city. Each taxi stand should have a proper toilet, and washing of vehicles and clothes will not be allowed. Taxi fares will be regulated and displayed at each stand.City mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu said taxi stand owners had encroached upon parking lots and other places with impunity: “No taxi will be allowed to function beyond the allotted space.”Meanwhile, the vending sites for coconut sellers have been increased from 18 to 38. “MC expects to generate ₹5.5 lakh from taxi stands and ₹10 lakh from coconut vendors every month,” said Kamal Kumar Garg, MC commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mc-approves-policy-for-taxi-stands-101631913691204.html

18-09-2021||Dehradun||Ludhiana number-one in Punjab in crimes against women||The most populous district and the industrial hub of the state has also earned the unsavoury tag of being the most unsafe for women, leading as it is in crimes against women, as per data released by the National Crime Records Bureau. Though Ludhiana saw an improvement in the number of crimes against women reported in the district as compared to 2019 and 2018, it still reported more cases than other districts. Punjab cumulatively registered 4,838 cases of crimes against women in 2020, of which 418 were reported in the Ludhiana Commissionerate. Patiala was second in the state with 340 cases, while Jalandhar and Amritsar reported 221 and 227 cases, respectively.The district had recorded 595, 662 and 535 crimes against women in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cops attribute the improvement in statistics to the pandemic-induced lockdown. An official, requesting anonymity, said, “Movement was restricted due to the lockdown. Moreover, minor girls, who are vulnerable to sexual assault, especially in labour quarters, remained safe as their parents were with them all the time.” Of the 37 rape cases reported in 2020, 36 were against women who were of age. Forty-five cases of use of criminal force against women with intent to outrage her modesty, 12 cases of cyber crime and 74 cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act were also registered.

18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana witnesses waterlogging, traffic jams||Incessant rain, which continued through the night, left most areas in the city inundated, due to which commuters had to navigate waterlogged roads and long traffic jams on Friday morning. Potholed roads exacerbated the commuters’ misery. Waterlogging was primarily seen at BRS Nagar, Model Town Extension, Dugri, Chaura Bazar, and Haibowal. Water also accumulated on the Model Town-Jawadi Road, Ferozepur Road, Chandigarh Road, Gill Road, Dholewal Chowk, and Dugri road and the underpasses on Ferozepur Road and Lodhi Club. The situation outside the deputy commissioner’s residence near Rakh Bagh and at Malhar Road (which is being developed as a smart road) and the parking area outside the municipal corporation’s Zone C office was not any better. Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Memorial Trust member ,Tribhuvan Thapar, said the area outside the freedom fighter’s ancestral house was flooded and that authorities had failed to resolve the issues despite multiple complaints.  “People have to wade through the accumulated water, which also breeds vectors,” said Thapar. Paramjeet Singh, a resident of Sector-39, Chandigarh Road, said,”We had registered a complaint with the chief minister’s office also, but to no avail. It is difficult to step out of the house after a downpour and overflowing sewer lines stink up the area. Potholes, which cannot be seen due to the flooding, put commuters’ lives at risk. MC superintending engineer, Rajinder Singh, said, “Our staff was on the field and the accumulated water was drained out within in a few hours. Complaints regarding choked sewer lines will be resolved at the earliest.” ‘Newly developed Leisure Valley lacks sound drainage’ In absence of a sound drainage system, the recently developed Leisure Valley in Bhai Randhir Singh (BRS) Nagar was inundated after the downpour on Friday. The Valley, which has become one of the favourite haunts of joggers, is in dire need of maintenance. A BRS Nagar resident, Gursharan Singh, said, “Creating a green belt was a good initiative and the number of people coming to the area for morning and evening walks was also increasing by the day. However, people are now avoiding the area as it is not being maintained and the drainage system is not up to the mark.” Ludhiana Improvement Trust superintending Engineer , Buta Ram said that the contractor has been directed to clear the accumulated water. “Staff has already been deployed and the water will be drained out in soon . The contractor has also been directed to make concrete arrangements to avoid water logging in future as well.Portion of Hambran Road caves in A portion of Hambran Road, where interlocking tiles were installed by the LIT a few months ago, caved in after the incessant rain. The incident took place near the Kali Mata Temple and no accident was reported on the spot.Buta Ram said that the field staff had been directed to inspect the site and take required steps to repair the portion. The reason behind the incident is not known so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-witnesses-waterlogging-traffic-jams-101631912009762.html
18-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad administers over 73k Covid jabs in fifth mega vaccination drive||The goal for Friday was to administer 85,000 Covid-19 vaccination shots -- the highest single-day target set for Ghaziabad district till date. And while the district failed to meet that goal, it ended up administering 73,328 doses by 8.50pm, according to the Co-WIN portal on Friday. The district officials pointed to weather conditions and a lack of awareness for them not being able to meet the target. Friday was the fifth mega vaccination day in Ghaziabad -- the district administered 79,822 doses in the first mega drive on August 3; 42,444 doses in the second drive on August 16; 67,040 doses in third drive on August 27, and 69,248 doses during the fourth drive on September 6. “We are still hopeful of getting closer to the 85,000 mark. The entries are getting uploaded slowly on Co-WIN portal. However, we have done well despite the weather conditions that kept people indoors and also the lack of awareness about Friday’s drive,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer. However, officials privy to the mega drive said the health department only had a stock of about 95,000 doses, of which only 70,000 were Covishield, the vaccine most preferred by people. “We had 70,000 doses of Covishield and about 22,000 doses of Covaxin. Since beneficiaries prefer Covishield more, they were reluctant to take Covaxin doses which were sent to different Covid vaccination centres. That is why we could not achieve our set target,” said an officer from the district health department, asking not to be named. The district on Friday operated the mega drive with 165 vaccination centres. According to the Co-WIN portal figures, with 2,442,067 doses administered so far, Ghaziabad ranked second in the state. The district has a second dose coverage of 598,748 till date. Of the 75 districts, Lucknow is first in terms of total doses-- the district administered 3,328,335 doses so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-administers-over-73k-covid-jabs-in-fifth-mega-vaccination-drive-101631911828832.html

Terming the appointment of Gursher Singh, the minister’s son-in-law, as patently illegal, former minister Bikram Singh Majithia said it was a cruel joke on lakhs of youth of Punjab who had trusted chief minister Amarinder and his promise to provide one job in each household of the state. “Forget providing any job to meritorious and needy youth, the government is bent on adjusting kin of its leaders by bending the rules. Earlier, former chief minister Beant Singh’s grandson was given the job of a deputy superintendent of police even though he was not eligible for the post,” Majithia said. “Two more appointments — those of the sons of Congress legislators Fatehjang Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey — were also cleared by the cabinet but their joining was averted after a vociferous protest by the SAD and people at large,’ he added. The Akali MLA said the Congress government had not learned from its mistakes. “The revenue minister’s son-in-law has property worth crores of rupees which makes him ineligible for an appointment on compassionate grounds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ghar-ghar-naukri-scheme-meant-for-cong-leaders-kin-sad-on-job-to-kangar-s-soninlaw-101631911827549.html

Glitches in the Co-WIN portal slowed down vaccination pace at several centres, they added.Chief medical officer Dr Sunil Sharma said despite allowing walk-in vaccinations at several centres, technical issues were reported by officials at vaccination centres. “The health officials were facing a lot of problems in uploading the details of beneficiaries on the Co-WIN portal. As a result, such vaccination centres couldn’t achieve their target for the day,” he said.Sharma, however, claimed that since the district health department has already given the first jabs to around 95% of the eligible population in the district, the low jab rate on Friday will not have much effect on the district’s overall vaccination performance. “We have informed the higher authorities about the glitches in the portal and it’ll soon be rectified,” he said.Dr Neeraj Tyagi, the district immunisation officer, said of the total 25,160 beneficiaries who took their jabs on Friday, 16,492 took their first vaccination doses. “The remaining received their second doses. The nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme began on January 16 this year. In the time since then, Gautam Budh Nagar has administered 2,299,193 jabs, and 653,910 have received both doses of the vaccine. Over two million jabs administered in the district are Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, while a bulk of the remaining doses are Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/against-single-day-target-of-32-000-covid-jabs-gautam-budh-nagar-inoculates-over-25000-101631911707633.html

Out of the total 13 dengue patients in the district since September 6, 2021, only one patient is under treatment at the district hospital, they added.“Since September 6, the Child PGI has reported five dengue cases (till September 15), and the district hospital has reported eight cases. Some suspected dengue cases have also been reported at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, but because they tested negative for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa), they are not being counted in the district tally,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.The district has also reported three scrub typhus cases, all of which have recovered now. “Last month, a private hospital in Greater Noida reported two scrub typhus cases, and the district hospital reported one case which was referred from Ghaziabad. At present, there are no active cases of scrub typhus in Gautam Budh Nagar,” Sharma added.Meanwhile, the total number of malaria cases in the district stands at 23, as a monthly report for the same is yet to be compiled.Talking about the preparations to tackle vector-borne and viral fever cases in the district, district magistrate Suhas LY said that the health department is fully equipped to handle any crisis situation. “The district health department is on alert regarding the dengue cases, and cleanliness and sanitation drives are being carried out across the district to prevent breeding of mosquitoes which cause such diseases. The health department has also prepared rapid response teams (RRTs) to handle emergency situations, and have also reserved beds in case such a situation arises. City authorities, local bodies, nagar panchayats, and gram panchayats have all been instructed to create awareness among the people regarding dengue, and measures to be taken to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-reports-2-fresh-dengue-cases-in-24-hours-tally-reaches-13-101631911467628.html
18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Eyebrows raised as SGPC seeks police deployment in Golden Temple complex||The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has written to police seeking deployment of their personnel in the Golden Temple complex, particularly the parikarma (circumambulation around the holy ‘sarovar’), to check “criminal and anti-social elements” active there. The move, which comes nearly one-and-a-half months after the SGPC observed the anniversary of the 1955 police entry into the shrine to contain Akali Dal activists during the Punjabi Suba movement, has drawn a flak from members and office-bearers of the gurdwara body itself. The entry of police personnel in 1955 was widely opposed by sections of the Sikh community. Slamming the move, SGPC member Kiranjot Kaur said, “It is to demand security from the police for the shrine. It is tantamount to admit that we are not able to manage the gurdwara and asking the police to take over it. The SGPC employees get salaries in lakhs What are they doing? What is the use of its task force if it cannot curb criminal elements active in the shrine complex?”SGPC executive committee member Amrik Singh Shahpur said, “It is quite unfortunate that we cannot guard the shrine on our own. Are we not competent to guard our holiest shrine? Where is the SGPC task force?” Shrine chief manager Gurinder Singh Mathrewal, who wrote the latter to Amritsar police commissioner Vikramjeet Duggal, said, “We are yet to receive a response from the police official in this regard.”In the letter, Mathrewal said the galliara near the shrine complex has turned into a haven for drug addicts. “We often receive complaints of such people looting the devotees. It brings a bad name to the shrine,” it reads. “Also, both men and women police personnel should be deployed round the clock around the parikarma, serais and the langar hall in plainclothes. Entrances of the shrine should also be guarded to prevent any untoward incident. Senior police officials must carry out screening in the area themselves,” it further reads.Entry of police into the shrine complex has never gone well with various Sikh bodies. The SGPC has been targeted by the Sikh bodies for allowing police to “interfere” in the affairs of the shrine which is visited by an average 1 lakh devotees daily. However, police personnel, including senior officers, are deployed at the shrine on June 6, the anniversary of Operation Bluestar, every year, to avert any clash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/eyebrows-raised-as-sgpc-seeks-police-deployment-in-golden-temple-complex-101631911347523.html

18-09-2021||Noida||Family faked woman’s abduction in Greater Noida: Police||Police on Friday found a 20-year-old woman in Gonda district, a day after her family alleged that she was abducted from Badalpur, and said the family had lodged a false complaint. The woman had gone to a friend’s house on Wednesday, and the family filed a false complaint on Thursday morning, said police. The woman’s father, in his police complaint, had said that the four siblings usually go for a morning walk in the neighbourhood. “As usual, they had left home at 5am on Thursday. My older daughter was walking ahead while her three siblings were following her. When they neared Rail Vihar colony, some people reached the spot in a white car. They started harassing my daughter. When she resisted, they tore her clothes, pulled her inside the car, and abducted her,” he said.He also said that when the other three siblings tried to rescue their sister, the suspects beat them up. A case was registered against unknown persons under Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), Section 354 (assault of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and Section 364 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code at Badalpur police station. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that the police formed five teams to investigate the matter. “We found the statements of woman’s parents and siblings inconsistent. We scanned the woman’s call record details and found that she had been in touch with a man for two years. The woman recently bought a new SIM card,” he said. Chander said this new mobile phone number’s location pinged in neighbouring Acheja village in Greater Noida. “The location was subsequently traced to Ghaziabad, Sahibabad, Dankaur, Mathura and Agra and then it was found to be switched off,” he said.Ankur Agarwal, additional DCP Noida Central, said the woman’s previous mobile phone’s location was active in Gonda. “A police team was sent to Gonda where the woman was found at her friend’s house,” he said. He said the woman had met the man through social media two years ago. He added that she had caught a bus and gone to his place on Wednesday, and her family knew about it. However, the family hid the information. “We will take action against her family members for filing a false complaint and blocking the road in protest,” Agarwal said. Police said it appeared the family faked the incident to cover up the woman’s elopement. Police have not taken any action against the woman and her friend as they are adults. Chander said the police scanned multiple CCTV cameras in the neighbourhood but the suspects’ car was not spotted in anyone of them. The police then started investigation from other angles. He said the woman’s uncle is an assistant sub-inspector in Delhi Police and had allegedly assisted the family in creating this plot. Chander said the sub-inspector will be questioned.Vrinda Shukla, DCP, women’s safety, said that the woman’s family had also asked their minor children to lie and mislead the police. “They had also blocked NH-91 for two hours in protest. This had created a negative image of police among the public,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/family-faked-woman-s-abduction-in-greater-noida-police-101631910987493.html

The suspects were identified as Ram Khiladi (50), a resident of Firozabad; Shakir (36), a resident of Bulandshahr; Kuldeep Kumar (30), a resident of Karawal Nagar in Delhi; and Aslam (28), a resident of Khoda Colony in Ghaziabad.

Thakur Singh, the factory’s administrative executive, filed a complaint at Sector 20 police station. “The workers had left the factory at night. We reached the office in the morning and found the lock damaged. Finished leather products and raw materials were stolen from the factory,” said Thakur in his complaint. Kumar said on Thursday night, police received information about the movement of some suspects in a Maruti Suzuki Baleno in Noida’s Sector 8. “The police team put up a barricade and asked the suspects to stop for checking. The suspects opened fire at the police team and tried to flee.

18-09-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Interest on default amount for Yamuna eway plot allottees reduced||In a major relief to plot allottees, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) has brought a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme by reducing the rate of interest on the defaulting amount for the plot allottees. Plot owners, except realtors, who own group housing land, will now have to pay a lesser amount for defaulting, officials said on Friday.The move came after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed Yeida to only levy simple interest on a defaulted amount, and not a compound interest. According to the rules, Yeida considers a plot or flat allottee as a defaulter if he or she fails to pay three installments at least. On the defaulted amount, Yeida imposes a compound interest up to 15% or even higher, instead of a simple interest such as 8.5%, they said.The move, which will benefit 32,000 property allottees who bought properties from 2009 to 2021, will be open for the people from October 1 to November 30, 2021, according to the officials.“Property allottees will have to pay a compound interest on the defaulting amount after November-end. If they want to avail the benefit of the scheme, they must deposit 30% of the total default upfront between October 1 and November 30,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO), Yeida.Yeida allots properties on an installment basis: It first takes 30% of a property’s total cost, and then the remaining 70% in installments. If the defaulting amount keeps increasing, the authority, too, increases the compound interest, which the plot allottees claim to be a “financial hardship” for them. Thus, the Uttar Pradesh government introduced the OTS scheme to provide relief to the people amidst the Covid-19 crisis, said the officials.Many plot allottees have welcomed the move. “We have been asking for an interest waiver for the past two years, amidst the coronavirus pandemic. We have also demanded a waiver of interest for a period, as the authority delayed possession of plots. Yeida has finally given a waiver on the compound interest. It is a welcome step,” said Rishabh Nigam, secretary, Yamuna Expressway entrepreneurs’ association (YEEA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-interest-on-default-amount-for-yamuna-eway-plot-allottees-reduced-101631910447629.html

18-09-2021||Noida||Arun Vihar residents oppose Noida authority’s vending zone plan in Sector 29||Residents of Arun Vihar in Noida Sector 37 have opposed the Noida authority’s plans to establish a vending zone in Sector 29. They said that the pavement is meant for pedestrians, and the proposed zone will pose serious health hazards, especially to senior citizens, and security issues to the people.The residential area in Arun Vihar, opposite Sector 29, majorly houses retired armed forces personnel.The Noida authority put up a board opposite Arun Vihar-Ward 11, from the road along Christ Church in Sector 29 to Ambedkar Nagar market in Sector 37, on Wednesday. The board says that the area on both sides of the road has been marked for Vendor Zone No-1 for 100 vendors.This has riled up the residents of Arun Vihar, who said that the area is meant for the pedestrians, and if occupied by vendors, the residents will not get any space to walk there.Colonel (retired) IP Singh, chairman of Arun Vihar residents’ welfare association (RWA), said that the residential area already has a “crowded” shopping area -- Brahmaputra Market -- in Sector 29, and inviting more street vendors there will only create nuisance for the residents.“Under the new vending zone policy, the Noida authority is creating vending zones on both sides of the road from Christ Church in Sector 29 to Ambedkar Nagar market in Sector 37. There is a lot of resentment among the residents regarding this as the authority did not consult them about the move. Once the vending zones are allotted, it will become difficult for us, especially the senior citizens, to even reach our homes as the vendors may end up crowding near the entry gates of our localities. Moreover, there is a high risk of contracting infection amidst the Covid-19 pandemic,” Singh said.The RWA has raised a complaint with authority regarding the matter, he said, adding, “If our complaints are not being heard, and vendors start putting up shops here, the residents of Arun Vihar will protest at the site,” he added.Meanwhile, the Noida authority officials said that they will visit the area and talk to the residents on this. “We will visit the site to attend to the residents and hear out the issues. Our officials will try to solve the matter at the earliest,” said Rahul Sharma, Noida authority in-charge of Work Circle-2, where the vending zone has been put up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/arun-vihar-residents-oppose-noida-authority-s-vending-zone-plan-in-sector-29-101631910387796.html
18-09-2021||Noida||UP pollution body starts monitoring air in Ghaziabad’s Kaushambi||The Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB) on Friday initiated special monitoring of air and noise pollution in Kaushambi for five days, said officials.UPPCB officials said that the move came in connection with a petition filed by Kaushambi apartments residents’ welfare association (Karwa) to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to resolve different pollution-related issues in the township.The officials have installed equipment at three locations near Meenakshi Hospital, Kaushambi police post, and Panchmarhi Tower for monitoring particulate matter (sum of all solid and liquid particles suspended in air, many of which are hazardous) and noise pollution (elevated sound levels).“Monitoring has been initiated, and if the weather permits, we will devote five days to capture data of particulate matter -- PM10 and PM2.5 -- for which equipment will be installed by Friday. We will capture the data and submit a report on the same to the NGT... We have our real-time air quality monitoring station in Vasundhara which is about two or three kilometres aerial distance. We installed the new equipment, especially at the township, to gather localised information about the pollution levels,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB.The township has 22 high-rise residential towers and is adjacent to Anand Vihar border in Delhi. It is also opposite Kaushambi inter state bus terminal (ISBT) and Sahibabad industrial area site IV.On August 23, after hearing the petition filed by Karwa, the NGT directed the divisional commissioner of Meerut, district magistrate of Ghaziabad, superintendent of police of Ghaziabad, and regional officer of UPPCB to appear before the tribunal on October 25.In a meeting held between officials of Ghaziabad district administration, Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC), UPPCB, and Karwa among others, the GMC gave its nod for installing 400 trees to curtail pollution, and a sluice gate to prevent backflow of water from Sahibabad drain to Kaushambi.“UPPCB is monitoring air and noise pollution in the area, but the collected data will not be accurate as the city has been receiving rainfall and the air pollution levels have been dropping considerably. So, we will raise this point before the tribunal and request it to conduct another monitoring drive in November or December,” said VK Mittal, president, Karwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-pollution-body-starts-monitoring-air-in-ghaziabad-s-kaushambi-101631910328436.html

She was speaking after the inauguration of the national wrestling championship, which is being held in Amethi, Irani’s Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh, for the first time.She won the Amethi seat in 2019 Lok Sabha elections by defeating the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi.“This is the first time when a wrestling championship has taken place in Amethi. So far, Amethi was known only for political wrestling. The holding of this national event on the occasion of PM Modi’s birthday would inspire our wrestlers,” she said. Union minister Giriraj Singh, national wrestling federation chairman Brajbhushan Saran Singh, the BJP MP from Gonda, and UP’s sports minister Upendra Tiwari were present on the first day of the championship. “I have come here for the first time and whatever development has taken place here is all because of the BJP and Smriti Irani. As for wrestling, it is in India’s DNA. From Bhim to Jarasandh and Duryodhan (Mahabharat age), our country has seen some great wrestlers,” Giriraj Singh said. “Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the sporting mood of the country has changed. Now, our Olympic medal winners have been feted for their great show and rewarded handsomely. So much so that now even foreign players feel like playing for India. Pakistan is busy producing grenades and we are creating world class sportspersons,” the Union minister said. On the first day of the wrestling championship, wrestlers from 23 states participated. Celebrity wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Babita Phogat of Dangal fame also took part.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/known-for-politics-amethi-now-witnessing-real-wrestling-smriti-irani-101631910207355.html

Though the court has directed Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) to restore possession of the house to Bhargava, the matter is still subjudice and the next date of hearing is September 28. Bhargava was evicted based on the complaint of one Sushila Devi, who complained to the police that the plot was her property, and had been sold on the basis of fake documents. Four months ago, the HSVP cancelled the re-allotment and occupation certificate and got Bhargava to vacate the house. Bhargava then approached a local court, which asked the authority to submit the documents on the basis of which re-allotment was cancelled. Following the court directions, the HSVP submitted two letters in which it cancelled its order withdrawing re-allotment to Bhargava. It also withdrew the eviction order after arguments in the court, after which the court appointed a commissioner to ensure possession was given back to Bhargava. On being given the possession back, Bhargava said, “I had no option but to approach the court and it is due to intervention of the court that I have got my house back,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/after-court-intervention-evicted-allottee-gets-house-back-in-gurugram-101631910098273.html

18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet okays free insurance for 15 lakh more families, milling policy||The Punjab cabinet on Friday approved free insurance cover for 15 lakh more families under the Ayushman Bharat-Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana (AB-SSBY) which were earlier not covered by the scheme. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh announced this at a virtual meeting where the state health department proposed bringing these families under the government scheme on co-sharing basis which would have required the beneficiaries to pay for part of the expense. However, Amarinder suggested making the insurance cover for these families also completely free in line with his government’s promise of universal healthcare for the people of Punjab. Also, the cabinet gave the go-ahead to the Punjab Custom Milling Policy for the 2021-22 kharif season for conversion of paddy procured by state procurement agencies —Pungrain, Markfed, Punsup and Punjab State Warehousing Corporation (PSWC) — into custom milled rice and its delivery into the central pool. Barring the families of government employees and pensioners who were already covered under Punjab Medical Attendance Rules, all the remaining nearly 55 lakh families in the state will now come under the ambit of the scheme, an official spokesperson said. The state government will now be bearing a total annual cost of ₹593 crore to cover 55 lakh families to provide insurance cover of ₹5 lakh per family for secondary and tertiary care treatment in empanelled public and private hospitals. The health and family welfare department has been asked to formulate the process for the enrolment of these families under the scheme. Nearly 39.38 lakh families, including 14.64 lakh identified as per the 2011 ‘Socio-Economic Caste Census’ (SECC), 16.15 lakh smart ration card holder households, 5.07 lakh farmers, 3.12 lakh construction workers, 4,481 accredited journalists and 33,096 small traders and their families, are already availing the scheme since August 2019 having got cashless medical treatment to the tune of ₹913 crore in the last two years, it was informed. Job regularisation agenda deferred The agenda of regularisation of over 37,000 contract employees, who have completed 10-year service in different departments, boards and corporations, was deferred by the cabinet after discussion. Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, who is the head of the cabinet sub-committee on the issue, raised demand that the minimum period of regularisation should be 3-5 years against 10 years as fixed by the government, it is learnt. “The matter was sent for legal opinion by the cabinet,” a minister said. Ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who joined the cabinet meeting from Punjab Bhawan, rued poor audio quality during the conference. Bajwa even asked the CM to convene meetings in person for better decision-making. “When other programmes are being held without any hindrance, why convene cabinet meetings through video-conferences?” he questined. 160 assistant professors for new colleges To ensure smooth running of 18 new government colleges in the state, the cabinet approved recruitment of 160 assistant professors and 17 librarians. The recruitments will be made by the departmental selection committee after taking these posts out of the purview of the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC). The cabinet also gave the nod to constitute the selection committee comprising former University Grants Commission (UGC) chairman Prof Ved Prakash as head with Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU) vice chancellor, representative of principal secretary, department of social justice and empowerment and 3 subject matter experts as its members. The committee has been mandated to carry out the recruitment process by strictly following the selection criteria as per the UGC guidelines.

The enforcement officials demolished internal walls in six illegally constructed houses in S, U and V Blocks. The team also demolished 11 shops, which were constructed on residential plots. All these structures were also sealed by the department. On Thursday, the department demolished the internal walls of 10 houses, in which there were additional constructions in violation of rules. DLF Phase 3 has 2,600 plots reserved for the economically weaker section, and last week, the department had carried out a survey to check building plan violations, additional constructions and commercial activities. Based on that survey, the department has now initiated action against such violations, said officials. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that the demolition drive started around 11am and continued till late evening. “We hired 50 labourers and pressed two earthmoving machines into action to carry out the demolitions. We have been forced to do this because despite notices the owners have not removed violations. Additional constructions in violation of rules will not be allowed,” said Bhath. Bhath also said that along with U block, the team also sealed shops and houses in S and V blocks, where illegal construction was found.Around 100 policemen from Gurugram Police maintained law and order during the drive and supported the enforcement officials. On Thursday, the department had also deployed a drone to keep a watch on the locals as they opposed the drive. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, enforcement, said that a guest house being operated in the area was also sealed for violating rules. “All the vacant rooms of the illegal guest house were sealed as it was operating in violation of rules. Our team also interacted with local residents and made them aware about the danger of constructing such buildings,” said Sharma. Officials said that action against illegal constructions will continue and also appealed to people to remove additional construction and floors themselves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/demolition-drive-continues-in-dlf-phase-3-owners-of-10-houses-11-shops-face-action-101631909727606.html
18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet nod to job for minister Gurpreet Kangar’s son-in-law||The Punjab cabinet on Friday gave the go-ahead for the appointment of state revenue minister Gurpreet Kangar’s son-in-law Gursher Singh as excise and taxation inspector on compassionate grounds. Chairing the cabinet meeting through video-conferencing, the chief minister noted that Gursher’s father Bhupjit had played a crucial role in blowing the lid off the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) scam involving then chairman Ravi Sidhu, an official spokesperson said. Bhupjit, who was posted as excise and taxation officer (ETO) and died in 2010, had helped the vigilance bureau catch Sidhu giving 5 lakh bribe red-handed, it was claimed. The spokesperson claimed that the applicant was considered for the post in view of the qualification of candidate and the contribution made by Bhupjit, and the cabinet decided to make an exception on special grounds. As per the government policy, the ward of a deceased employee has to apply for employment within one year from the date of death. The policy also clarifies that if there is a genuine cause for delay, the candidate’s application can be considered up to 5 years after obtaining special approval from the personnel department. Interacting with the media after the cabinet meeting, Kangar said, ““Bhupjit Singh passed away in 2010 and Gursher was not eligible for the job then. He got married to my daughter in 2016 and applied for the job that year. Does being my son-in-law deprives him of the right to get a job as per the government policy?” This is the fourth instance of the cabinet in the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government of giving the go-ahead to jobs to the family members of party leaders on compassionate grounds. Earlier, the government had appointed late chief minister Beant Singh’s grandson and brother of Ludhiana MP Ravneet Bittu as a deputy superintendent of police (DSP). This year, a controversy erupted when the cabinet okayed appointment of Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Bajwa’s son as a DSP and Ludhiana (North) legislator Rakesh Pandey’s son as a naib-tehsildar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cabinet-nod-to-job-for-minister-gurpreet-kangar-s-soninlaw-101631909667237.html

18-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram civic body forms committee to improve sanitation, implement Swachh Bharat Mission parameters||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has formed a four-member committee to help improve sanitation, and implement Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) parameters in the city, officials said on Friday.The committee, formed by MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja on Thursday, was given a seven-day deadline, September 23, to submit a report on their findings and suggestions on improving each aspect of SBM. A meeting will be organised in the fourth week of this month to deliberate on the matter, said MCG officials.The committee includes MCG chief town planner (CTP) Madhusmita Moitra, deputy municipal commissioner Dr Vijaypal Yadav, joint commissioner (headquarters) Hariom Attri, and additional municipal commissioner Rohtash Bishnoi.“These officers will submit their report in seven days after assessing all the parameters set under the Swachh Bharat Mission in their respective zones and thereafter will suggest means to improve cleanliness and evaluate the implementation of Solid Waste Management Rules-2016. The said officers will also visit their respective areas to assess the ground reality regarding cleanliness in their respective zones,” said SS Rohilla, public relations officer (PRO), MCG.As per officials, all MCG joint commissioners have also been directed by Ahuja to join the officers in their respective zones during the evaluation process.MCG officials said that they will be focusing on the garbage-free city (GFC) category to improve the city’s rankings.The Swachh Bharat Mission’s GFC rating has 25 key components, such as the door-to-door collection of waste, sweeping, scientific waste processing, storage bins, penalties for violations, cleaning of drains and water bodies, among others.In both the 2020 and 2019 surveys, the city ranked poorly in the GFC category.In the 2019 survey, the city got two stars out of a possible seven in the category while last year’s survey found two municipal wards in the city were not swept.After the 2020 survey, former MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh identified GFC as the main category the MCG had to improve upon.For the 2021 survey, the GFC rating amounts to 1,800 points of the total 6,000 points of the Swachh Bharat Mission ranking.In last year’s survey, GFC was under the certification category-- in which the city scored 500 out of 1,500 points. The city scored 600 out of 1,250 points in 2019 in the same category.“Around 30% of all points in the 2021 survey will be under the GFC category, in which Gurugram has performed poorly. Unless we make changes, the city’s score will plummet and it will reflect in the rankings against the rest of the country. Hence, we will prioritise the GFC category and look at weak points and ways it can be improved,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-civic-body-forms-committee-to-improve-sanitation-implement-swachh-bharat-mission-parameters-101631909607571.html
18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali MC removes 55 street vendors from Phase 7 market||Three days after officials of the enforcement wing were given a month’s time to clear the encroachments in the markets, the civic body officials swung into action and held a major drive in Phase 7 on Friday, confiscating articles of 55 illegal vendors.Most of these vendors were removed from the parking area and market corridors. The drive began at 5pm and continued till 6pm.Secretary-cum-enforcement officer Ranjeev Kumar said, “Now the drives will be regularly held in the mornings and evenings. We have warned them several times, but they are adamant. They will be challaned on the basis of the articles. For one rehri, we charge ₹1,000 as fine.”Earlier in the day, the drive was also carried out in Phases 11 and 4, and Sectors 70 and 71.On September 14, Mohali MC had divided the area under its jurisdiction into four zones to tackle encroachments in markets. While chairing the civic body’s monthly General House meeting on September 14, mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu had said the area inspectors heading the teams would be responsible to get rid of encroachments in a month: “If they fail to do so, they will be charge-sheeted or suspended.”During the visit, it was found that vendors are fearlessly operating in parking lots and on the main road in the markets of Phases 7, 3B1, 3B2, 9, 10 and 11. Also, shop owners in all these markets have encroached upon the corridors, leaving no space for visitors. Under the Street Vendors Act, there are 993 vendors in the city. However, the number of those actually operating in the markets is close to 2,000 who can be seen selling a variety of products, including apparel, footwear, jewellery and eatables, in market corridors and parking areas. In some markets, there is no space to even walk in the corridors. The enforcement wing of MC has only two vehicles including a truck, a Bolero jeep, which caters to the entire city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mc-removes-55-street-vendors-from-phase-7-market-101631909487409.html
18-09-2021||Lucknow||GST Council decides to set up two GoMs||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Friday decided to decided to set up two Groups of Ministers (GoMs), the first to look into rate rationalisation and the second to examine the issues of e-way bills, FASTags, technology and compliances. Both the GoMs have been given two months’ time to submit their reports. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made the announcement about the two GoMs after the GST Council’s 45th meeting in Lucknow. She said there were clear anomalies in the structure as rates have gone up and down. Sitharaman also said a number of “people centric” decisions were taken at the GST Council meeting that met physically after a gap of nearly two years. The GST Council is an apex federal body on indirect taxes. The GST Council also decided that food delivery aggregators like Swiggy and Zomato would now be responsible for the collection of GST from consumers instead of the restaurants from where the food is bought. A decision in this regard has been taken following reports that some restaurants were either not depositing the tax or it disappeared after collection of GST from the consumers. “This is no new tax,” said Sitharaman. She also said petrol and diesel would not be brought under the GST regime at this stage. “This is not the time to bring them under the GST,” she said while speaking to media persons after the meeting. Sitharaman said the issue was taken up on the GST Council’s agenda only in view of the directives of the Kerala high court that asked the council to consider the matter. She said many members said they didn’t want this and the council will report back to the Kerala high court. About the extension of deadline for compensation to states for the shortfall in their GST collections beyond July 2022, she said the law provided the compensation against shortfall in GST for five years. She said the cess to be collected after July 2022 (up to March 31, 2026) would be used for the purpose of payment of loan and interest taken last year or this year due to shortfall in the revenue. She said the collection of cess would be used for repayment of loan. A number of states have been demanding that the deadline be extended for five more years. “We demanded extension of the deadline for payment of compensation to states beyond five years,” said West Bengal minster of state (independent charge) for urban and municipal affairs Chandrima Bhattacharya. Commenting on the decision not to bring petrol and diesel under GST, Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of the department of economics at Lucknow University, said, “The people at large will be disappointed to know that the GST Council did not agree to bring the petroleum products under the GST regime which would have brought down the prices of petroleum products substantially. This would have given the much needed relief to the common man.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/gst-council-decides-to-set-up-two-goms-101631909367502.html
18-09-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram authority to repair key roads, conduct annual maintenance of others||After the monsoon, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will start repairing key roads in the city by filling up potholes and stretches damaged due to heavy rain, said officials on Friday. GMDA has proposed three projects to specially repair the road from Huda City Centre to Subhash Chowk, undertake the annual maintenance of roads on the left (Delhi to Jaipur) side of National Highway-48 and repair the road from the toll gate on NH-8 to Kapashera border. Most of these roads provide access to residential areas in the city and have been damaged due to heavy rain this monsoon. “We will be starting the repair work for these roads within two months after we receive suggestions from the citizens on what kind of work they would like done. Our primary focus is filling up potholes and repairing patches that are broken. The repair work is likely to be completed within six months to one year, ensuring that the roads are ready for the next monsoon,” said a senior official from infrastructure-I division of GMDA. Officials had earlier said that repair and maintenance work of roads was delayed due to pending approvals and the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, which began in April this year. To repair the road from Huda City Centre to Subhash Chowk, the authority will carry out measures such as overlay treatment with 40mm bituminous concrete, repair of footpath to facilitate pedestrian movement, mandatory and cautionary sign boards for assistance of traffic. The road from Huda City Centre to Subhash Chowk is one of the busiest roads in the city. The roads leading from Subhash Chowk and Huda City Centre have six lanes from west to east, with service roads on both sides and a right-of-way of 60 metres each. For roads on the left of NH-48, the authority will focus on filling potholes using a granular sub-base or wet mix macadam method (a compact method of road construction), repairing patches with dense bituminous macadam or concrete, and repairing damaged road markings. The authority will also start repair work on four key roads from November, which include the outer road of Sector 114, the master road of sectors 62/65, 58/61 and 59/60 and construction of a 200-metre service road for the sectors 59/61 road. Around four kilometres of roads will be repaired as part of these projects across all locations, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-authority-to-repair-key-roads-conduct-annual-maintenance-of-others-101631909127281.html
18-09-2021||Gurugram||Two arrested for running fake call centre in Haryana’s Gurugram||Two persons were arrested for allegedly running an illegal call centre from the basement of a house in Sector 44 in Gurugram and duping United States (US) nationals of money. Acting on a tip-off, the police searched the call centre on Wednesday night and found that employees were engaged in calling US nationals despite having no licence or permission to run such a facility. The police said a case under Section 75 of IT Act, 2000, Section 66D of IT Act, 2008, and sections 120B and 420 of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Cyber Crime police station on Thursday. The two suspects have been identified as Nikhil Kumar and Jitender Sharma, who had taken the basement on rent in August 2021, and started running the fake call centre, said police. Police said their employees used to call US citizens posing as representatives of a large online retailer. They would tell the intended victims that someone had used their online accounts to purchase iPhones. The employees of the bogus call centre would “assure the US citizens that they would resolve the problem” and then ask them to pay a fee between USD 300-500 by purchasing gift cards. The numbers of these gift cards are then obtained from the intended victim and the money is transferred fraudulently, said police. During questioning, the employees said they used a database of US citizens, which was obtained by their employers online, said police. The police also said the two men failed to furnish any permission for operating the call centre. A number of items, including computers, phones and other documents were seized from the office. Subash Boken, spokesperson, Gurugram police, said, “The matter is being probed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/two-arrested-for-running-fake-call-centre-in-haryana-s-gurugram-101631908587404.html

18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Health services in rural Punjab have come to standstill: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday claimed that the government health services in Punjab’s rural and remote areas had come to a complete standstill. Addressing a press conference, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema accused the previous Akali and the present Congress government for weakening the government health system in rural areas in the state. “Till 1980, the state’s public health service was number one in the country and above national standards, but it is lagging behind Bihar in many aspects today,” he claimed. The AAP leader said there were 4,400 sanctioned posts of doctors in 1980 and all of which were filled. “While there are still 4,400 posts, about 1,000 of them are vacant. Of these, there are 516 posts of specialist doctors which were abolished by the previous SAD-BJP government,” he said. Cheema said the decision of the Capt Amarinder government in 2006 to hand over 1,186 rural dispensaries under the rural development and panchayats department had cost the rural population dearly. He demanded that rural dispensaries should be handed over to the health department immediately. “If this is not done, we will start a struggle to guard the interest of people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/health-services-in-rural-punjab-have-come-to-standstill-aap-101631907147180.html

18-09-2021||Chandigarh||AICC calls Punjab CLP meet today, tells all MLAs to be present||In what is likely to spell trouble for chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, the Congress high command has called a meeting of the legislature party in Punjab in Chandigarh on Saturday. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat made the announcement at around midnight. “The AICC has received a representation from a large number of party MLAs, requesting to immediately convene a meeting of the legislature party of Punjab,” he posted on Twitter. The CLP meeting has been convened at the Punjab Congress office here at 5pm. All the MLAs have been asked to attend the meeting. “AICC directs the PPCC to facilitate this meeting,” he said in another tweet, tagging former party president Rahul Gandhi, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu.Minutes later, Sidhu also took to the microblogging site to inform the party MLAs. “As per the AICC directive, Congress Legislative Party meeting has been convened at @INCPunjab PPCC Office, Chandigarh, on 18 September 2021 (Saturday) 5 pm,” he tweeted.The Congress has 80 MLAs in the 117-strong state assembly.While the chief minister is the leader of the CLP and usually calls the meeting, the AICC directive is being seen as unusual, signalling fresh fireworks in the faction-ridden state unit. Several cabinet ministers and MLAs close to Sidhu have been demanding the meeting of the legislature party. There were reports that a letter signed by four cabinet ministers and several MLAs was sent to the central leadership on Wednesday asking for a meeting of the CLP at the earliest to discuss the election strategy. Last month, four ministers and 24 legislators had after a meeting at cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa’s house demanded the chief minister’s removal. A few of them had later met Rawat in Dehradun to press their demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aicc-calls-punjab-clp-meet-today-tells-all-mlas-to-be-present-101631906429171.html

Around 16 crores has been spent just for replacing tiles in Sarabha Nagar main market in the name of a retrofitting project,” said Sidhu.“These things point towards large-scale corruption, misappropriation of funds, and wasted at large. The officials are working negligently on the behest of a cabinet minister, and we have sought a CBI inquiry into the matter. Mishra has assured action on our complaint,” said Sidhu.The BJP leader demanded that a committee be formed at the local level with prominent personalities from the city as participants so that their suggestions can be sought while planning the projects. Parveen Bansal stated that no information is being shared about the projects approved, the cost of projects, the design, etc.“Around ₹3.5 crore is being spent on renovation of Mini Rose garden in Kidwai Nagar even though that project could have been completed in a few lakhs. Around ₹38 crore has been spent on Malhar road and Sarabha Nagar main market. The width of Malhar road has been reduced from 120 feet to 46 feet resulting in traffic snarls. The parking space in Sarabha Nagar market has been reduced under the project, which was aimed at developing the infrastructure there,” he said.“Funds are being wasted to develop the areas that already fall under the posh category. No heed is being paid to the problems being faced in old city areas, including, contaminated water supply, potholed roads, traffic jams, etc. The projects should be planned properly, and suggestions should be sought from the public also during the planning process,” said Bansal.Factionalism in BJPFactionalism was witnessed between the two groups of BJP leaders which were led by Parveen Bansal and Bikram Sidhu. Both the groups tried to meet Mishra separately but ended up handing over the memorandums jointly.NGOs seek transparency in ₹650-cr Buddha Nullah projectSeeking transparency in the ₹650 crore project to clean the Buddha Nullah, members of Public Action Committee (PAC), a group of NGOs, submitted a memorandum with secretary, ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA), Durga Shankar Mishra, at the railway station on Friday.The members of the committee rued that the officials have failed to make public the details of the projects being taken up under the smart city mission including, the construction of sewer treatment plants (STP), etc., which might result in misuse or wastage of funds.Amandeep Bains from PAC said they have been raising concern over Buddha Nullah pollution and the Sutlej river in the past.“An environmental expert should lead the Buddha Nullah project committee , as it is not just a civil engineering project, but also concerns the health of residents and the environment. Further, the process to shift the dairy units situated in Haibowal and Tajpur road dairy complex should be expedited. The project to establish the effluent treatment plants in the dairy complexes should be stopped, as it will lead to wastage of money as the dairy units have to be shifted,” he said.The common effluent treatment plants (CETP) being established to treat the waste of the dyeing industry situated at Tajpur Road and Focal Point area should also be made operational at the earliest. The authorities should also come up with a plan to prevent dyeing units from dumping effluents into the MC sewer lines.CoE also submits memoSlamming MC for not involving the public in the smart city project, the Council of Engineers (CoE) also submitted a memorandum with Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-smart-city-projects-bjp-highlights-discrepancies-submits-memorandum-with-mohua-secretary-101631906188354.html
18-09-2021||Lucknow||PM’s leadership has given new direction to the country, says Yogi||LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday distributed tool kits to 21,000 beneficiaries under the ‘Vishwakarma Shram Samman Yojana’ and ₹171 crore financial assistance (loans) to 11,000 beneficiaries of ‘Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana’ on the occasion of Vishwkarma Jayanti that coincided with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday. “Our government is organizing a Vikas Utsav from September 17 to October 7 to commemorate PM Modi’s able leadership that has given a new direction to the country. Today’s function is being organized to honour the talent of handicrafts artisans,” the CM said while speaking on the occasion. This date (September 17), he pointed out, was important in two ways — it was Lord Vishwakarma’s birth anniversary, and the day also marked the birthday of the world’s most popular leader and country’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was completing 20 years of public service on October 6. Adityanath said while Vishwakarma was the God of construction and creation, PM Modi had given a new model of Indian economics, which was proving helpful in making traditional entrepreneurs and handicraft artisans self-reliant. He said adoption of PM’s ‘vocal for local’ mantra alone could materialise the dream of a prosperous India. He said UP government’s ‘one district, one product’ scheme had shown new direction to handicraft artisans and entrepreneurs. Yogi Adityanath said his government provided jobs to all 40 lakh migrant workers who came to the state during the lockdown last year. The CM claimed that UP’s unemployment rate was far lower than that of other states in the country. “The unemployment rate in UP was as high as 17% in 2017, which has now been reduced to mere 4 to 5%,” he pointed out. He said more than 68,400 people had been trained under the ‘Vishwakarma Samman Yojana’ so far with each trainee getting ₹250 as daily wages. He directed the MSME department to chalk out a plan to distribute tool kits to 75,000 handicrafts artisans in the next three months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pms-leadership-has-given-new-direction-to-the-country-says-yogi-101631906187255.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||‘Mentorship for girls offers an alternative vision’||Thirteen-year-old Bhavna Pandey from Hyderabad aspires to be an Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer. Nothing extraordinary about that ambition except for Pandey’s circumstances: she studies at the St Albert High School, described as a “budget private school” by its principal, B Sunitha Kumari. Most of the students’ parents are daily wage earners, or blue collar workers like Pandey’s father, who is a driver. During the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the school struggled to get funds to deliver groceries to the families, who were hard-hit by the lockdown. Yet for Pandey, it was the pandemic that kindled her ambition. In 2018, Varsha Adusumilli, a BITS-Pilani graduate and entrepreneur wrote a book called Wonder Girls, which told the stories of 15 young women who had chosen jobs and careers despite the odds stacked against them. I was struck by the book and felt convinced that every Indian girl must read it. Concurrently, Soumya Jain, the founder of iTeach Schools, an educational not for profit, expressed an interest in introducing the Wonder Girls book as part of the secondary school curriculum. When an opportunity to teach the book in classrooms arose, I offered to sponsor the provision of 5000 copies. The same year, Varsha started the Wonder Girls Foundation Programme in partnership with fellows at education non-profits Teach For India and iTeach. The teaching fellows taught the book along with the school curriculum to educate adolescent high schoolers about young female role models from diverse professions. In the pandemic, the Wonder Girls team moved the programme online to facilitate direct classroom interaction with role models: since August 2020, over 250 individual sessions have been conducted with 92 teachers in schools across the country. Pandey and her classmates had an hour-long live call each with five women — an IAS officer, a scientist, an actor, a flight commander and a software engineer based in the United States and working for a search engine giant. One of these five speakers was Apurva Pandey, an IAS officer who scored 39th rank in the Union Public Service Commission who made quite an impression on the teenager. “We could see the challenges that these women have faced in their lives. Our families have suffered a lot of losses due to the pandemic. But these women motivated our children in such a way that they started dreaming big, and felt more confident,” Pandey’s principal, Kumari said. The importance of encouraging young women cannot be stressed upon enough especially as the pandemic has seen women fall off the grid from the formal and informal workforce as well as the classroom. The State of Working India 2021: One year of Covid-19, a report by the Centre for Sustainable Employment at the Azim Premji University finds that “women were much more likely to lose jobs and much less likely to recover than men. .. While 61 per cent of men followed the no-effect [employment] trajectory over this period, the corresponding figure for women was only 19 per cent. Further, while only 7 per cent of men followed a no-recovery trajectory, the figure for women was 47 per cent. Women were also much more likely to also experience a delayed job loss even after the lockdown relative to men.” The report was based on data collected by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), which tracked labour participation rates in both the formal and informal work sectors. As early as March 2020, the UNESCO warned that the “economic hardships caused by the crisis will have spill-over effects as families consider the financial and opportunity costs of educating their daughters... Education responses must prioritize the needs of adolescent girls’ at the risk of reversing 20 years of gains made for girls’ education.” Millions of Indian adolescent girls are vulnerable to early marriage, trafficking and violence; the Covid pandemic has only exacerbated the conditions in which such practices would flourish. Given what faces young women of the country, how can a mentorship programme really help? It is imperative for young women as well as the systems within which they operate -- schools, peer networks, families and broader communities -- to recognise their capacity and capability. Encourage adolescent girls to aim higher, show them that alternatives are possible. “Just randomly saying, ‘I want to become an IAS officer’ and working towards it, are two different things. Apurva Pandey shared all the preparations she went through to become an IAS officer, from fifth grade onwards. She gave a lot of good advice which some are following,” Kumari said. A 2017 study by the Girl Scout Research Institute in the United States, which could be considered a proxy programme, finds that “having a supportive adult in Girl Scouts is especially beneficial for girls of lower socioeconomic status (SES). In our study, lower-SES Girl Scouts were significantly more likely than lower-SES non–Girl Scouts to say they have an adult in their lives who helps them pursue their goals,” which is essential to career success. “I see sustainable impact. The programme has opened a dialogue, and a space for different conversations apart from academics. It is a good platform to talk about how well women are doing in different fields,” says Varalakshmi Ayyagari, a former Teach for India fellow who taught the programme in Hyderabad. Individual stories of gritty hopefuls, such as Pandey, routinely make the headlines in India. What is needed is sustained social and economic mobility for all adolescent girls and young women.

It is a matter of shame for the state government,” he said.He questioned chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, his deputy Dushyant Chautala and state home minister Anil Vij for delays in filing chargesheets against the IPC and SLL offenders.“Why is Haryana last among the bigger states (except Manipur and Meghalaya) in terms of filing chargesheets in criminal cases. The national average rate in filing chargesheets was 82.5%, but why Haryana a laggard at 39.7%,” he said.The Congress leader said due to laxity in filing the chargesheets against the criminals and the casual attitude of the government, crime in Haryana has been increasing continuously for the last seven years.The people of the state are suffering but the government seems careless about their woes.

The congestion was at its peak between 9.30am and 11.30am, when commuters took nearly 30 minutes to cross the stretch.Due to a protest march by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders in central Delhi against the three farm laws introduced by the Centre exactly a year ago, Delhi traffic police officials set up multi-layered barricades across all its major borders, including the Sirhaul toll plaza.Agitating farmers had first gathered at the Sirhaul toll plaza around 11.30pm on Thursday and blocked the movement of vehicles on the carriageway heading towards Delhi.According to Ravinder Singh Tomar, DCP, Gurugram traffic police, a joint team of Gurugram Police and Delhi Police then asked the farmers to vacate the area, and after 1am, vehicular movement started returning to normal.“In the interim, we diverted heavy traffic from Gurgaon-Faridabad Road and Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway, due to which congestion at the toll plaza was managed,” said Tomar.During the morning, Delhi traffic police had set up heavy barricading at the toll plaza and started screening vehicles at random as they headed towards Delhi.“After Thursday night’s situation, Gurugram Police and Delhi Police were on alert. Delhi Police already had prior notice about possible disruptions. Around 9am, a group of 15-20 farmers tried to block the expressway again. However, they were quickly dispersed, after which the intensity of checking increased,” said Tomar.Coinciding with peak morning hour traffic, for two hours, between 9.30am and 11.30am, the congestion at the toll plaza was at its worst.“It took me nearly 30 minutes to cross from the end of the Shankar Chowk flyover till Rajokri. There was heavy barricading by Delhi police and they were stopping vehicles at random and letting others through,” said Uday Mishra, a resident of GK 1.As updates regarding the Sirhaul toll plaza barricading were shared via word-of-mouth and on social media, commuters altered their travelling plans accordingly.“My brother had informed me about the congestion at the toll plaza. I had to drop a relative at the airport and instead of the highway, I drove via MG Road. On my way back to Gurugram, the carriageway was completely empty, and I could see the situation was far better on the other carriageway than an hour ago,” said Sandeep Kumar, a resident of DLF 5.Tomar and officials deputed at the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) control room said that post noon, the traffic situation improved as Delhi traffic police started barricading the carriageway only at intervals.“After 12pm, there was only minor congestion at the toll plaza, compared to the situation in the morning. Delhi traffic police were closing the barricades at random, and opening the carriageway completely soon after, whenever they observed traffic build-up,” said an official at the control room.“Our workers were protesting across all Delhi border entry points from Thursday night onwards, such as Delhi-Gurugram border, Tikri border, and Singhu border. We had given prior notice that we will be holding a peaceful march in central Delhi on Friday. Despite this, our workers and the vehicles they were travelling in were being stopped at border areas. We had no choice but to protest at the border points,” said Dr Daljit Cheema, spokesperson, Shiromani Akali Dal.Cheema also said that more SAD workers were stopped at border areas from 9am onwards by Delhi Police and a lot of them weren’t able to make it into Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/barricading-farmers-blockade-lead-to-congestion-at-sirhaul-toll-plaza-in-gurugram-101631905766910.html

We had only one unit of AB positive blood group in the blood bank therefore, we decided to use O- negative blood instead as it is a universal donor,” said Dr Saggar.Dr Varun Saggar, Dr Jagpreet Singh, Dr Neelam, and Dr Shinu managed to reconstruct the stomach that was punctured from the left side.“While four units of blood were used during the surgery, one unit was administered to the patient today,” said Dr Saggar.He said that the patient had also suffered a one-inch deep wound on his neck, and it appears that first, the patient had tried to stab himself in the neck and later in his stomach.The patient was provided psychiatric counselling and later kept under sedation as he is susceptible to inflicting injury upon himself again.Dr Saggar informed that the patient is now in a stable condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-stabs-self-gets-new-lease-of-life-at-ludhiana-civil-hospital-101631905408336.html
18-09-2021||Chandigarh||In HC, Haryana Police blame farmers for Karnal episode||Blaming farmers for August 28 incident in Karnal, the Haryana Police in an affidavit filed in the high court have demanded that farmers be directed not to block highways under the “guise of right to protest”.The police have also told court that the video wherein the then Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha can be heard instructing cops to “break the heads” of any protester who crossed the barricades was filmed 13km away from the place of lathi charge (Bastara toll plaza) and no policeman from there had joined the force at the toll.The affidavit was filed by inspector general of police (IGP), Karnal range, Mamta Singh, in response to a plea seeking judicial inquiry and alleging that Sinha’s instructions violated the fundamental rights.Scores of farmers had sustained injuries in the lathi-charge on August 28 evening after farmers blocked the Ambala-Delhi highway. As the video featuring Sinha went viral, it had resulted in a major controversy and farmers sat on a dharna in Karnal. Subsequently, the state government agreed for a judicial probe.The police say farmers were supposed to protest in Karnal city on August 28 where chief minister ML Khattar was to attend an event.However, farmers, around 800 in number, gathered at the toll, which is 13 km away from the city and allegedly surrounded the vehicle of state BJP chief Om Prakash Dhankar and sat on a dharna.Authorities tried to pacify the farmers but they did not agree and resorted to stone-pelting, resulting in mild use of force by police upon direction from the duty magistrate.The police say farmers have been sitting on dharna at the toll plaza for nine months now and only five lanes were operational. There was no major deployment at toll but as the farmers gathered 200 more policemen had to be sent there.The police also claim that farmers were armed with sticks, iron rods and farm implements.Two of the petitioners attacked police with ‘kassi’ (spade) and a farmer received head injury when he was trying to attack policeman and fell down. The farmer was given first aid by the same cop, the police have claimed, submitting videos on various incidents of that day.The police further claimed that only four farmers were injured against 24 policemen and an FIR stand registered; in addition to an SIT probing the matter.“The petitioners talk about the right to protest but right cannot be enjoyed at the cost of right to freedom of movement and right to life and liberty,” it says, citing various judgments against the blockade of highways and that police acted to follow court orders.The police have lamented that in recent years there has been a growing trend of blocking highways to pressure authorities.Since November 2020, the police are facing serious law and order problems due to protest calls at the events of ministers and BJP leaders and to ensure their safety and maintain law and order has become a challenge for the police.When such protests turn unruly and police are forced to act, the farmers would sit on dharnas and put pressure to get FIR cancelled, it says, adding that 211 FIRs have been registered related to farmers’ protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-hc-haryana-police-blame-farmers-for-karnal-episode-101631905355215.html

Wadhawan, a promoter of Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL), has been arrested on money laundering charges in the multi-crore Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank Ltd fraud case. The single judge bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while hearing Wadhawan’s bail application on medical grounds, was informed by his counsels that he was seriously ill and needed immediate care for heart and pulmonary ailments. They submitted a list of specialist doctors who could examine Wadhawan, who has been admitted in KEM Hospital since September 1. In the hearing on August 27, the prison authorities had informed the bench that Wadhawan was being referred to KEM Hospital whenever required for cardiac treatment as the prison hospital. The court had directed the medical superintendent of the prison to submit a report of Wadhawan’s health and medical condition. On September 9, after the medical report furnished to the court stated that Wadhawan was shifted to KEM Hospital on September 1, HC had sought a report from the hospital. On Friday, senior advocate Aabad Ponda for Wadhawan said owing to his client’s serious condition and the fact that even KEM Hospital did not have sufficient facilities to treat him, doctors from private hospitals should be allowed to check on the accused. Ponda also submitted a list of doctors and sought directions to allow them to examine Wadhawan, who also needed a pacemaker. Additional public prosecutor Prajakta Shinde for the prison authorities submitted that a report of KEM Hospital’s dean stated that while the hospital had the facilities required, a decision on further course of action could be taken after further consultation. However, advocate Hiten Venegaonkar for the Enforcement Directorate (ED) submitted that Wadhawan was already admitted in the medical intensive care unit of the hospital and was being treated by expert doctors, including pulmonologist, nephrologist and cardiologist, and was under constant medical care. After hearing the submissions, the bench noted that though Wadhawan was getting medical attention, specialist doctors from private hospitals as per the list submitted by Wadhawan’s counsel can be permitted to examine him at KEM Hospital. The court sought a further medical report and posted hearing of the application to September 24. Wadhawan has been named as an accused by the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police and ED for his alleged involvement in the PMC Bank case. His earlier bail applications, seeking temporary release due to Covid-19 pandemic, were rejected by the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court, which had observed that the allegations against him were of a serious economic offence that had caused losses worth crores of rupees.

The state government, it is learnt, was disappointed with the tardy progress being made by the Commission and was not keen to give any more extensions.As per the Commissions of Inquiry Act, the government has to lay the report of the Commission along with a memorandum of the action taken before the state assembly within six months of the submission of the report by the Commission.Was to submit report in 6 monthsThe Commission, which was given several extensions to complete the inquiry, was originally mandated to complete the probe in six months from its first sitting.Chairman of the Commission, justice (retd) SN Jha said they have completed the probe and the inquiry report is now with the secretary of the Commission. The chairman did not elaborate as to why the report has not been submitted by the Commission so far. “The secretary is also competent to submit the report,” he said.The CoI was mandated to inquire into the sequence of events leading to the agitation and all facts and circumstances relating to the occurrence of violence leading to loss of lives, damage to properties — both private and public, including roads, canals, railway stations, police stations — and illegal felling of trees besides violation of human rights from February 18 to 23, 2016, in Rohtak, Jhajjar, Sonepat, Jind, Hisar, Kaithal and Bhiwani.It was to also inquire into the existence of a deep-rooted conspiracy, if any, to damage the social fabric of the society and any such matter as may be found relevant in the course of the inquiry.‘Poor progress due to court case’Till January 2020, the Commission had made little headway in the inquiry and the chairman of the Commission had told HT that due to a court case the Commission was not able to proceed further. He recently said they were finally able to overcome the litigation and finish the probe.Virender Kumar, a close aide of former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, had filed a plea in the high court challenging the constitution of the Commission on grounds that the same had been constituted to nullify the findings of the Prakash Singh Committee.The petitioner had also submitted that during pendency of investigation by the special investigating team (SIT) of police, there was no necessity of setting up a commission as its entire proceedings were based on the FIR itself.The Prakash Singh Committee constituted in February 2016 had indicted high-ranking officials of the police and state administration in its probe pertaining to the role of officers of civil administration and police during the Jat reservation agitation.On January 7, 2020, the counsel for the petitioner had submitted before the HC bench of justice Lisa Gill that he, along with the co-accused, have been discharged in a criminal case of looting, vandalism and arson (FIR number 101 of February 24, 2016) registered at Rohtak Civil Lines police station pertaining to the quota violence.Haryana advocate general BR Mahajan, however, on February 5, 2020 had informed the HC that as far as the discharge of the petitioner is concerned, it is only one of the grounds which the petitioner is entitled to take before the Commission.There is no decision on the part of the state to not proceed against the petitioner, Mahajan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jat-quota-violence-jha-commission-completes-probe-yet-to-submit-findings-101631905108721.html

18-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra opposes proposal to bring fuel prices under GST ambit||The Maharashtra government has opposed the proposal to bring petrol and diesel in the ambit of the goods and services tax (GST). The GST Council in its meeting on Friday discussed the proposal in order to bring down fuel prices.Opposing the move, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who also handles the finance portfolio, said that the existing tax system should not be changed to maintain financial autonomy of the states that are already in financial trouble owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. He demanded that the Centre reduce its taxes imposed on fuel, which will help in providing relief to the citizens from inflation and price hikes.Pawar was speaking to the media in Pune as he could not attend the GST Council meeting held in Lucknow. His request that he be permitted to attend the meeting online was not accepted. “I have made it clear before the GST Council in writing that VAT (value added tax) should be continued as part of the existing tax regime on petrol and diesel prices and they should not be brought in the ambit of GST. VAT imposed on fuel plays a major contribution for the funds required for development works,” Pawar said.“Before GST was implemented, the local bodies used to earn revenue from octroi. It was replaced by LBT (local body tax) and later, VAT and sales tax were introduced, replacing LBT. Ever since GST was introduced, most of the things (over collection of taxes) have started going under the jurisdiction of the Central government. Our view is very clear, the powers of the Centre to collect taxes should remain with them as the entire country runs on this tax system including defence. But the Centre is also gradually encroaching upon the power of the states to impose taxes,” he remarked.“After GST was imposed, additional revenue sources of the states have become limited, which has automatically impacted the development works. The states should get autonomy to explore revenue sources, which is important and necessary as well,” he pointed out.The finance minister said states also need funds for development works, which was badly impacted owing to Covid-19.“All are facing financial trouble due to Covid-19 pandemic; people are struggling with inflation and hikes in fuel prices, and the Maharashtra government is also worried about it. We demand that the Centre reduce its taxes on fuel prices. If that happens, people will get relief from inflation,” Pawar said.Pawar said that the Centre gets ₹32.90 per litre on petrol and ₹31.80 per litre on diesel through various taxes. During the Covid period, it has got a revenue of ₹44,000 crore alone from Maharashtra in the form of taxes on fuel.The deputy CM further said they cannot approach the Centre all the time for funds. In addition, they are also providing their contribution from the state’s budget for the welfare schemes jointly run by the Centre and the state government.He reminded that the promises made to the states while bringing the GST must be fulfilled in letter and spirit by the Centre. “The states were promised reimbursement against revenue losses for five years between July 2017 and June 2022. It was further said that the period will be extended for another five years with 14% annual rise. Our two years were wasted in Covid-19 and thus, we requested the GST Council to continue the reimbursement for another five years,” Pawar said.State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit has announced to hold an agitation against the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for opposing the proposal to bring fuel under the ambit of GST. Former CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “This issue has brought the real face of Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) before people. They are the one who were holding agitations over hike in fuel prices and now when the Central government is trying to reduce them by ₹25- ₹30 per litre by bringing fuel under GST, they are opposing the move. If MVA choses to oppose the proposal, then we will agitate against MVA government,” Fadnavis told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-opposes-proposal-to-bring-fuel-prices-under-gst-ambit-101631905046900.html

The war of words between the two leaders broke out on the microblogging site after Sidhu hit out at Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, accusing the party of staging a drama over the issue. “Exploitation of farmers and decreasing prices even on crops where MSP is announced – @ArvindKejriwal Ji you notified the Private Mandi’s central black law! Has it been de-notified or the masquerading is still going on?” the Punjab Congress chief tweeted. Sidhu also posted a video message in which he accused the AAP of tearing copies of the central laws in the Delhi assembly to stage a drama. Chadha, who is also national spokesperson of the AAP, got back at the Congress leader by raking up his rift with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. “The Rakhi Sawant of Punjab politics – Navjot Singh Sidhu – has received a scolding from Congress high command for nonstop rant against Capt. Therefore today, for a change, he went after Arvind Kejriwal. Wait till tomorrow for he shall resume his diatribe against Capt with vehemence,” he tweeted. The AAP leader’s tweet triggered outrage on the microblogging site as several twitterers slammed him for the comparison. Congress leader and a one-time AAP legislator Alka Lamba said that Chadha’s remarks showed the anti-women mentality of the ruling AAP that is akin to RSS’s thinking. Responding to the AAP leader’s personal dig in equal measure, Sidhu tweeted, “They say man descended from the apes and the monkeys. Looking at your mind @raghav_chadha I believe you are still descending!

18-09-2021||Mumbai||No coercive action against Narayan Rane till September 30: Maha govt to HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked Union minister Narayan Rane to file separate petitions to challenge the various first information reports (FIRs) registered against him across different cities regarding his remarks against Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on August 23. Rane had filed a petition seeking the quashing of FIR by the Nashik Cyber police and had sought to include other cases registered at Mahad, Thane, Pune, Ahmednagar and Jalgaon in the plea as well. However on Friday, after the state government assured that no coercive action will be taken against Rane till September 30, the court directed him to file separate petitions instead of one. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing Rane’s petition, was informed by senior counsel Ashok Mundargi and advocate Aniket Nikam that the Rajya Sabha member has amended the plea and had included details of all six FIRs registered against him. In the earlier hearing, after the state had given an assurance that it would not take coercive action against Rane with regards to the FIR registered at Nashik, the minister had sought similar assurances regarding other cases as well so that he could amend the petition and add details of the other FIRs. On Friday, after the court was told that details of all FIRs had been included in the petition, the court said, “The FIRs are of different police stations of different jurisdictions. Let the challenge to each of the FIR be in separate petitions. It will be more convenient for prosecution in taking instructions from each police station.” When the bench added that all petitions would be tagged and heard together, Mundargi agreed but sought a blanket interim protection in all FIRs till the petitions were filed. Additional public prosecutor JP Yagnik for the state government informed the bench that after the petitioner had assured of cooperating with the Nashik Police on August 25, the state had assured that it would not take any coercive steps against Rane till the next date of hearing. However, as he has been asked to appear before Nashik Police on September 25, the state was willing to extend its assurance. Rane has been issued a notice under Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) by Nashik Police which Mundargi said he will do through videoconference on September 25. While speaking at a press meet on August 23, the Union minister, who was on Jan Ashirwad Yatra, had stated that he would have slapped CM for “not knowing the year of India’s Independence.” A day later, he was arrested and granted bail by the Mahad magistrate court. When Rane moved HC on August 25 stating that the Nashik Police commissioner was working under pressure from the ruling party (Shiv Sena), senior advocate Amit Desai for the state had informed the court that no coercive action would be taken against Rane in the FIR. However, in response to Rane’s claim that multiple FIRs were lodged against him with the only intention to “harass him by launching a false prosecution”, Desai had refused to make a blanket statement of protection in all FIRs as there were no details of those. Rane had challenged the Nashik Cyber police FIR under Sections 153 (B) (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 500 (criminal defamation), 505 (2) (intent to incite) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), among others. The petitions will come up for hearing on September 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-coercive-action-against-narayan-rane-till-september-30-maha-govt-to-hc-101631904629200.html

Now, when the SAD is facing the ire of farmers in the state, its leaders are trying to befool them by shedding crocodile tears, they added.LIP leader Randhir Sibia and Pawandeep Madaan stated that LIP had raised concern over the farm bills when they were introduced by the BJP union government but SAD had supported those bills and played a major role in getting them passed in the parliament. “SAD is responsible for the problem due to which the farmers are sitting in protest at the Delhi borders for months now. The SAD is now trying to build back its image ahead of assembly elections but it cannot befool the farmers anymore.

Let’s unite to mark this day as the beginning of a renewed revolt to bring justice for farmers,” the SAD president tweeted.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal along with 15 other party leaders have been detained at Parliament Street police station.According to the police, the leaders were detained for taking out the protest march in violation of Covid-19 guidelines.

Hence, equitable risk allocation is the key,” he said. Prof HM Shivanand Swamy, director emeritus, centre of excellence in urban transport at CEPT University, said the switch to e-buses must be well calibrated. “There are four reasons to switch to electric buses - reduced pollutant emissions; lowered fiscal deficits due to oil; limited operating costs, and; decreased greenhouse effect,” he said. Giving the example of China, which is a global leader in EVs both in terms of technology and mass manufacturing, Lulu Xue, urban mobility manager, WRI China, said increasing the contract period for electric bus operation from eight years to 15 years can help in bringing down the costs of procurement. “In China, e-buses were deployed on shorter routes to align with their ranges. Post that, their deployment was extended to longer routes with multiple buses, which brought down their replacement ratio against diesel buses – that practice may suit the systems in India, as well,” she said. The panel concluded that transit agencies that have deployed electric buses have mixed feedback on the technology. While some consider the e-bus rollout fruitful, others have faced challenges in smoothly operating them due to their limited driving range. They also find that the actual on-road performance of electric buses is substantially lower than the assured ranges indicated by electric bus OEMs. However, many STUs also found that electric bus deployment was more successful on low-frequency and less congested routes. Another issue that was discussed was the lack of relevant details of routes or existing fleet operations in tender documents and also during pre-bid consultations which is a common challenge which e-buses OEMs or bus operators face. The panelists said that the lack of information makes it difficult for bidders to understand operational requirements and enter into service-level agreements with transit agencies, and attributed the information gap to transit agencies’ limited understanding of electric bus operation and their lack of preparedness prior to issuing tenders.Gerald Ollivier, lead transport specialist, World Bank, said, “Scaling up electric bus deployment and leveraging the economies of scale can reduce their procurement costs by 10%. Balanced tweaking of some contractual clauses can reduce costs by a further 15% and effective unbundling of services can support a further 15% decrease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wri-connect-karo-2021-experts-say-ageing-public-bus-fleet-an-opportunity-to-roll-out-electric-buses-101631904568334.html

The Sena has said that action against the actor was initiated after Sood was appointed as the brand ambassador of Delhi government’s ”Desh ka mentors” programme. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece said such “narrow mindedness” will boomerang on the BJP. Party’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the BJP had supported the actor during the first wave of Covid-19 when he had helped migrants reach their hometowns, but when he was made the brand ambassador of Arvind Kejriwal government’s programme, I-T action was initiated against him.“The greatness of the rulers lies in respecting those with opposing views, even if there is a (non-BJP party) Opposition party in power in the states or people with contrasting views. Making false allegations against ministers and delaying the appointment of 12 persons to the legislative Council in Maharashtra as well as the I-T department searches on Sood are signs of narrow mindedness and such a childish game will boomerang on them [BJP] one day,” the editorial said. Raut said when Sood was helping people, the BJP was appreciative of his work and had questioned the Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government why it was not able to do what the actor was doing for migrants. “The BJP was at the forefront in lauding Sood’s work and constantly projected that he was ’our man’. But when Sood decided to do social work as the brand ambassador of the Kejriwal government’s educational programme, I-T department’s action on his premises started,” the editorial added. As a policy, state BJP unit does not respond to Saamana editorials .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-says-i-t-action-against-sonu-sood-will-boomerang-on-bjp-101631904270054.html
18-09-2021||Delhi||WRI Connect Karo 2021: ‘Nature-based solutions best to tackle water pollution’||With most sources of water pollution traced to urban areas, there is a need for nature-based solutions and better planning in cities to tackle the issue in metropolitan areas, said experts at the 2021 edition of the World Resources Institute (WRI’s) annual flagship event, Connect Karo, on Friday.The experts also highlighted the need to secure urban riverfronts and critical ecological and social challenges along these sensitive zones, mainly due to rapid urbanisation, pollution and extreme weather events driven by climate change. The event also saw the launch of a book, titled ‘Guidance Note for Environmentally Sensitive, Climate Adaptive and Socially Inclusive Urban Riverfront Planning and Development’, by WRI-India for conserving the river Ganga under the Union government’s ‘Namami Gange’ project.Launching the book, Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, director-general, National Mission for Clean Ganga, said in his keynote address that water restoration is required in all its forms, be it for rivers, groundwater, rainwater or other small water bodies. “This book is a pathway to look at urban riverfronts as social spaces and thriving ecosystems...,” said Mishra. He added that cities need to combat climate crisis by adopting various water conservation strategies. “People are the most important part, therefore connecting them with water is key. Several initiatives such as friends of river/wetlands/science club etc are being established. By providing amenities, promoting a sense of ownership for riverfronts and ghats, these can become pleasant spaces,” he said. Experts said that ecological and environmental heritage are as important as the city’s heritage. “The current riverfront development plans are more focused on built environment and potential economic benefits. There are limited considerations of social, hydrological and ecological impacts. The objective of the guideline is to act as an appraisal tool to support decision-making, inform about environmentally sensitive, climate adaptive and socially inclusive riverfront developments,” said Samrat Basak, director, Urban Water, WRI-India. Also, experts highlighted the need for a fundamental change in managing water and rejuvenating landscapes, beginning at the top of catchments areas. Victor Shinde, lead, water and environment, National Institute of Urban Affairs, said that sustainable economic development cannot happen without integrating rivers to the city’s planning. “Water is the primary medium through which climate crisis manifests its impacts. Urban rivers have a strong role to play in this,” said Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wri-connect-karo-2021-nature-based-solutions-best-to-tackle-water-pollution-101631904268618.html
18-09-2021||Delhi||Harsimrat, Sukhbir among 14 detained as SAD marches against farm laws in Delhi||Fourteen senior leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), including former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal, were detained on Friday during a protest march of thousands of farmers, activists, and party workers who had gathered in Delhi to mark one year of the three contentious farm laws. Although the proposed march – from Rakab Ganj gurdwara to Parliament House – was not allowed by the Delhi Police on Friday citing Covid-19 restrictions, SAD leaders held a symbolic march along Pandit Pant Marg till the entry to Parliament House Annexe, barely 500 metres from the gurdwara, with banners and flags demanding a repeal of the three contentious farm laws. Police said nearly 1,500 protesters under SAD’s banner gathered at Rakab Ganj to begin their protest march in the morning. “To handle the situation, an adequate number of security personnel from Delhi Police and central armed forces was deployed and barricades were placed to prevent agitators from marching towards Parliament. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal were among 14 people removed from the protest venue and briefly detained at Parliament Street police station. All of them were later released,” said deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav.However, the proposed march and multiple barricades led to massive snarls on arterial roads in the national capital. In central Delhi, all roads leading to Gurdwara Rakab Ganj and Parliament House were barricaded and checking of vehicles intensified. Commuters were stuck in jams at several places till late afternoon. Police said they received information that around 10,000 farmers were planning to take part in the Delhi march.SAD has been extending support to farmers protesting at the Delhi border points of Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur since last November, demanding a repeal of the farm laws. “The party also submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, through the executive magistrate. Besides asking for a repeal of the black laws, it demanded a commitment from the Centre that farmers would be consulted before bringing in any new legislation affecting their lives,” SAD said in a press statement on Friday.In the memorandum, Sukhbir Singh Badal said the three laws “virtually threaten the farmers’ very existence, putting a question mark over their sources of livelihood and even their hold on their lands”. He also said the party broke off its alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party after the government ignored its concerns over the farm bill and enacted the laws. The party put forward five demands, including revoking the three laws, legal and constitutional guarantee of the minimum support price, and a resumption of talks with protesting farmers to resolve the deadlock. Leaders from Samyukta Kisan Morcha – an umbrella platform of over 40 farmer groups which are leading the farmer agitation since last year – did not attend the protest. “None of the SKM members went because it was a call given by a political party. At Singhu, we continued with our everyday events and speeches. If any farmer attended the protest, it would be in his own individual capacity,” said an SKM member, asking not to be named. Hundreds of farmers and activists started arriving in Delhi from Thursday afternoon in cars and private buses and were mostly put up at the three gurdwaras in the city -- Rakab Ganj, Bangla Sahib, and Sisganj -- and also at the farmer agitation spots at Delhi borders. Amritpal Singh, who arrived from Punjab earlier this week and was staying in Singhu, was among the hundreds who came to attend the protest march. “Several roads leading to the guudwara were blocked and some of us coming from Singhu were stuck at various points. Our friends and relatives travelling from Punjab were not allowed to enter Delhi. Police at the border points misbehaved with those coming to protest and many could not even enter Delhi,” said Singh, who came from Khatrai Khalan village in Amritsar district. Delhi Police brass said since they were receiving intelligence inputs that nearly 10,000 people from neighbouring states such as Punjab and Haryana may enter the city and try to reach the protest venue, deployment of personnel at all border points was stepped up and vigil intensified. The personnel were directed to check all vehicles entering Delhi, especially through the borders of Haryana and Punjab. Narendra Singh Bara, a member of SAD, said they condemned the police action of barricading various points in the city. “Along with protesters, public too faced issues in commuting because of the barricades near Mukarba Chowk and other areas. We don’t understand the point of barricading when the police ultimately allowed us to march to Parliament. The crowd would have been double had it not been for the restrictions and checking by Haryana and Delhi police.” Delhi Police officers said protesters were contained till the Rakab Ganj gurdwara roundabout, which is near the Parliament House Annexe gate, as they did not have permission to hold the march. Police said in a September 15 letter to SAD’s president Sukhbir Singh Badal and the party spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema, DCP (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav informed them that their proposed protest march was not allowed in view of the existing guidelines framed in compliance of Supreme Court’s order on holding protests only around Jantar Mantar area and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA’s) latest Covid-19 guidelines, prohibiting all kinds of gatherings till September 30.  No case was registered till Friday evening in connection with the violation of the police orders and the DDMA’s Covid-19 guidelines, Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/harsimrat-sukhbir-among-14-leaders-detained-as-sad-takes-out-protest-march-against-farm-laws-in-delhi-101631904267229.html

The IO was also not able to answer the court’s queries. It was dealing with the arguments on framing charges against the accused in one of the riots cases.The judge said that the record shows that the special public prosecutor has not appeared in the case on several occasions and that during the previous hearing, he arrived only after the matter was adjourned.He directed the Delhi police commissioner to personally look into the issues and ensure proper prosecution of the riots cases, failing which he will be constrained to pass “an adverse order”, including imposition of adjournment costs on the state with a direction to deduct the same from the salary of the officers responsible for imposition of the cost.He directed that an order copy of this case be sent to DCP north-east, joint CP (eastern range), the Delhi Police commissioner and the state Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-pulls-up-police-for-lackadaisical-probe-in-riots-cases-101631903969346.html

During the hearing, special public prosecutor (SPP) Madhukar Pandey submitted that Sidhana told the police that he has “forgotten” the password and is not cooperating in the investigation. “If, that is the situation, how can the court presume...[that he is] deliberately not disclosing the code for unlocking the mobile phone,” the judge said, dismissing the prosecution’s argument. The court further noted that Sidhana has admitted that he was part of the mob. The accused has been released on anticipatory bail on the condition that he has to join the probe as and when required and not influence the witnesses in any manner. The SPP opposed the bail plea and told the court that Sidhana, who was part of the unlawful assembly, attempted to “kill some police officials” and instigated the mob to break the barricades.The prosecutor added that the gangster even hugged some people to celebrate after breaking the barricades.He said that Sidhana is currently involved in 20 heinous cases including those related to murder and attempt to murder. Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, along with advocates Jaspreet Singh and Jasdeep Singh Dhillon, who represented Sidhana, told the court that their client is not even named in the FIR and added that the police does not have any evidence against him. Sidhana moved the court saying he had grave apprehension that he may be arrested as his first cousin, Gurdeep Singh, was allegedly abducted and tortured by the Delhi Police and was made to forcibly sign certain blank papers, the counsel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rday-violence-delhi-court-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-lakha-sidhana-101631903666935.html

Police have also recovered lakhs of secessionist pamphlets promoting ‘Referendum 2020’ from their possession during a raid conducted at Rampur village in Khanna. A truck had to be called in to carry all the banned propaganda material. In July 2019, the Centre had banned the SFJ under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for its involvement in promoting secession as well as violent militancy in Punjab, specifically the Sikh Referendum 2020. “Their activities were aimed at creating a divide between communities and disturbing the peace and communal harmony in the Punjab,” the Centre had said. Those arrested on Friday are Gurwinder Singh of Rampur in Khanna; and Jagwinder Singh and Sukhdev Singh, both of Morinda in Ropar. The police have also booked Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Harpreet Singh, Bikramjeet Singh and Gursahai Makhu, all based in the US, and Jagjeet Singh Mangat of Khanna.A police spokesman added that they, in the presence of a duty magistrate, conducted raids at Rampur village in Khanna and recovered over 2.8 lakh pamphlets carrying propaganda material related to ‘Referendum 2020’. A printer, spray pump and spray bottles for writing secessionist graffiti on walls, one laptop, three mobile phones and one Honda City car were also recovered.During preliminary investigation, it has been found that the accused Gurwinder Singh was radicalised and motivated over a YouTube channel, US Media International, being operated by JS Dhaliwal, who introduced him to Pannun. A police spokesperson added that on Pannun’s instructions, Gurwinder hoisted Khalistani flags on the premises of the government school in Rampur village. Police claimed that Gurwinder had enroled 20-25 persons to promote ‘Referendum 2020’ by distributing pamphlets for different groups in the vicinity of Doraha, Ludhiana. All these persons were paid for their service at the behest of Pannun. A police spokesperson added that Gurwinder had also written wall graffiti, promoting Sikh Referendum 2020 activities (in English and Punjabi), under bridges and on signboards on the road stretch from Khanna to Singhu Border in Delhi. On August 15 night, he spray painted pro-Sikh Referendum 2020 and anti-Indian slogans. “For promoting these kinds of secessionist activities, the accused received huge funds from Pannun via human carriers, the hawala route etc,” a police source added.

18-09-2021||Delhi||SAD's rally throws traffic out of gear in Delhi||Massive snarls and congestion were seen on Friday on several arterial stretches in the national capital, especially around central Delhi, owing to a farmers’ protest march organised by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) to mark one year of the enactment of the three contentious farm laws. Although the proposed march – from Rakab Ganj gurdwara to Parliament House – was not allowed by the Delhi Police on Friday citing Covid-19 restrictions, SAD leaders held a symbolic march along Pandit Pant Marg till the entry to Parliament House Annexe, barely 500 metres from the gurdwara, with banners and flags demanding a repeal of the three farm laws. Throughout the day, the Delhi traffic police used its social media handles to alert commuters about intermittent closure of specific roads and to suggest diversions to avoid inconvenience. However, despite these warnings, snarls were seen at Dhaula Kuan, ITO, Vikas Marg, Delhi Gate, Karol Bagh, Sardar Patel Marg, Moti Bagh and Rao Tula Ram Marg, among others. Because of the restrictions put in place in central Delhi, a ripple effect of these jams was also seen around Tilak Marg, the India Gate hexagon, Teen Murti Marg and adjoining roads. Via a series of tweets, the Delhi traffic police informed commuters about the closure of roads at Jharoda Kalan border (with Haryana) and suggested alternative routes to avoid getting stuck in the farmer protests. “Gurdwara Rakabganj Road, RML Hospital, GPO, Ashoka Road, Baba Kharak Singh Marg will be closed for traffic movement due to the farmers’ movement. Please avoid using these routes,” traffic police tweeted. In another tweet they said, “Both carriageways of the Jharoda Kalan border have been barricaded due to the farmers’ movement, please refrain from using this route.” During the day, the police also intermittently stopped the traffic moving from Gurugram towards Sardar Patel Marg, while the traffic coming from Naraina loop was diverted to the Ring Road towards Moti Bagh. This also led to long tailbacks along RK Puram, Moti Bagh, Sarojini Nagar, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), with vehicles queuing up all the way till Lajpat Nagar on the Ring Road. Earlier in the day, traffic from the Pusa roundabout towards Shankar Road was also diverted towards Pusa Road, the traffic police said. Around afternoon, the Narela-Bawana road was also closed temporarily, traffic officials said. Many took to social media to complain about commuting hassles and some of them even uploaded pictures of stationary vehicles. A few airport-bound commuters, who were particularly stressed by these unprecedented jams, also complained about the lack of preparedness by the authorities. “The entire central Delhi and Ring Road towards the airport was jammed on Friday. My parents had to take a flight in the evening and seeing these worrying tweets, we left home an hour earlier than usual. Despite that, they just about managed to make it on time. There was no police personnel on the road to manage the traffic; vehicles were being diverted randomly. If they (authorities) knew about these protests, why did they not make proper announcements and arrangements in advance?” said Ankur Khanna, a resident of east Delhi’s IP Extension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhisad-protest-march-throws-traffic-out-of-gear-as-cops-shut-roads-divert-commuters-101631903427132.html

The young lawyers sought construction of alternative chambers before removal of the lawyers’ chambers in Agra. A memorandum was submitted to press the demand for enhancing facilities for lawyers and arrangement of chambers on court premises. Nitin Verma, divisional president of Yuva Adhivakta Sangh, along with others, met Bar Council of India chairman Manan Kumar Mishra and raised the issue of recent order of the Registrar General, Allahabad high court for removal of advocates’ chambers in civil court compound of Agra besides other districts in Uttar Pradesh. “We demanded that first proper facilities be provided to lawyers, specially the youth and alternate chambers be given to them and then only proceedings for removal of chambers of lawyers be initiated. Such order for removal of chambers without making alternative arrangements would be against the principles of natural justice,” said Nitin Verma. “If the order is implemented, the worst affected would be the youths among the lawyers. So, there is need to reconsider the order,” added Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/removal-of-chambers-agra-lawyers-meet-bci-chairman-101631903307994.html
18-09-2021||Delhi||Breathalysers are allowed, why not herbal hookahs, HC asks Delhi govt||The Delhi high court on Friday asked the city government how its prohibition on herbal hookah in public places to contain Covid-19 is justified when police are allowed to conduct breathalyser tests for motorists (to ascertain drink driving).Justice Rekha Palli said the Delhi government should reconsider its decision while hearing five separate pleas by restaurants and bars seeking directions to the city-state and the police to not interfere with the sale of herbal flavoured hookahs.“Issue notice…Delhi government counsel seeks time to get instructions as to why August 3, 2020 order is not reconsidered when breathalyser test is being allowed now. It is expected that DDMA will consider this aspect urgently,” the court said.Separate petitions were filed by Breath Fine Lounge and Bar, TOS, R High Speedbar and Lounge, Verandah Moonshine and Sixth Empirica Lounge in West Punjabi Bagh, challenging the order of joint commissioner of police (licensing unit) prohibiting and excluding the sale or service of herbal flavoured hookahs in restaurant/ bars.The pleas said the petitioners are serving herbal hookahs for which no licence is required as they are without tobacco but the police are still conducting searches and seizing equipment and issuing fines.Appearing for the Delhi government, advocate Santosh Kumar Tripathi opposed the petitions and said people are moving about with their masks on even when they by themselves in the car. Then how can hookahs be allowed in public places, he asked.He argued that for a single mistake, entire Delhi would have to pay a heavy price and allowing hookah consumption in public places may lead to the spread of Covid-19 since several people would be sharing a single hookah.“Herbal or non-herbal, we are not allowing any type of hookah. We are wearing masks even when we are driving a car alone. How can we allow hookah to be shared from one person to another? Hookah is not that important, our lives are more important,” he said.When the petitioners’ counsel said she was giving an undertaking that each customer will be using a separate hookah in the restaurant, the Delhi government counsel said not even a single hookah could be allowed.Following this, the court asked the government to decide on the matter and said, “It can’t go on like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/breathalysers-are-allowed-why-not-herbal-hookahs-hc-asks-delhi-govt-101631903128240.html
18-09-2021||Lucknow||Now, specific biomarker to help treat liver cirrhosis patients||Doctors of the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) have discovered specific biomarker to extend the life expectancy of patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Through this biomarker, the cause of the problem in liver cirrhosis patients will be detected in just one to two hours. Hence the direction of treatment will also be decided within hours. Patients with liver cirrhosis have many problems including intermittent bleeding, ascitis (water filling in the stomach), imbalance in sodium-potassium levels, hallucinations and delusions. By treating these problems quickly, the quality of life could be increased to a great extent, said professor Gaurav Pandey of the department of gastroenterology. . According to prof Gaurav Pandey, the cause of this problem is infection or inflammation. The neutrophil CD64 biomarker plays an important role in determining the cause. “This we have proved after research on 128 patients of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. If the CD64 count is low, the cause is inflammation. If the number is high, then there is infection. If there is an infection, we immediately start antibiotics and the patients get relief. If the cause is inflammation, then doctors can immediately start immunosuppressive drugs. Acute liver failure (ACLF) is a common problem in liver cirrhosis patients. We have four to five hours to decide the direction of treatment. If the right treatment is not received at the right time, it can be life threatening. After this research, the misuse of antibiotics will stop. Antibiotic resistance will be less among patients undergoing treatment. The cost of treatment will also go down,” he said. The research on the utility of neutrophil CD64 in bacterial infection or inflammation in severe alcoholic hepatitis has been accepted by the scientific community. Research by prof Vikas Agarwal and Dr Durga Prasanna of the department of clinical immunology and professor Gaurav Pandey of the department of gastroenterology has been published by Scientific Report Journal . Increased level of TLC deceives doctors According to professor Vikas Agarwal, till now doctors used to take increased TLC (total leucocyte count) as a marker of infection and antibiotics were started but the patient did not get relief. “Our research proved that TLC usually keeps increasing in 90 to 95 per cent patients but infection does not occur in 50 to 60 per cent of them. We found that TLC can also increase due to inflammation. Infection was found in 58 out of 128 patients. That’s why going for CD 64 count is important. The facility of this test is available in the institute,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-specific-biomarker-to-help-treat-liver-cirrhosis-patients-101631902946681.html
18-09-2021||Delhi||No unlicensed rickshaw allowed in revamped Chandni Chowk from Sept 25||Unlicensed rickshaws will not be allowed to operate on the revamped Chandni Chowk boulevard after September 25, officials of the North Municipal Corporation of Delhi (North MCD) said on Thursday. The civic body has asked all cycle rickshaw pullers in Chandni Chowk to procure licences before that date in order to continue plying on the revamped stretch from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid. The North MCD has also circulated a public service announcement outlining the details and procedures of procuring a licence. Over a hundred refurbished cycle rickshaws have been pressed into service on the revamped Chandni Chowk stretch that was inaugurated on Sunday. These colour-coded rickshaws are driven by people who have been given a licence by the North MCD. Going forward, only these licensed rickshaws will be allowed to operate on the stretch. For wider dissemination of the registration/ licence procuring process, the corporation has crafted a public service message that is being circulated across various media, including WhatsApp. “Only rickshaws having North MCD licences can ply on the stretch between Lal Jain Mandir and Fatehpuri Masjid. Without a licence, no rickshaw will operate in the Chandni Chowk zone. If a rickshaw puller or vendor wishes to operate a rickshaw on the stretch, they can procure a licence and registration form from the DC office in Kashmere Gate. The last date for submitting registration forms is September 25,” the recorded public service message circulated by the DC office said. Shashanka Ala, DC City, Sadar Paharganj Zone, North MCD, said the corporation will facilitate the process of refurbishment of rickshaws. “We will refurbish the rickshaws of individuals who register with us. Unregistered rickshaws will not be allowed on the stretch at any cost,” said Ala. She said there will be a cap on the number of rickshaws that will operate on the stretch but only after an assessment of the demand. “There will be a cap on the number of rickshaws but only after we study what the demand is,” she said. Bhim Singh, 42, a rickshaw puller, said while he had paid ₹500 for procuring the licence, he could not afford to refurbish his rickshaw. The refurbished rickshaws have a different design and are red in colour. “I got the licence made after paying ₹500 but my rickshaw is still the old-style one. For refurbishing the rickshaw, we would have to shell out more money, about ₹1,500-2,000. We don’t earn enough and can barely make the ends meet; how willwe bear the additional cost?” said Singh. Intizar Ali, a 27-year-old rickshaw puller who secured a licence recently, said he was unsure by when he’d be able to get the refurbished rickshaw. The contractor through whom he rents the rickshaw has only old-style rickshaws, he said. “I got my licence made online but we need to get the rickshaw redesigned. Our vendor is not ready to do that. I am not sure how the entire process will pan out if the vendors don’t have the rickshaws,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-unlicensed-rickshaw-allowed-in-revamped-chandni-chowk-from-sept-25-says-civic-body-101631902586761.html
18-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi issues 14-point guidelines for construction firms to curb dust pollution||Ahead of the annual winter pollution spike in the national capital, the Delhi government on Friday issued an ultimatum to construction agencies, as it released a 14-point set of dust mitigation guidelines and gave them 15 days to adhere to the directions to control dust pollution in their sites. The move comes days after the state government banned the sale, storage and use of firecrackers on Diwali, to be celebrated on November 4 this year.Addressing the media on Friday, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said he issued the guidelines at a meeting with over 50 private construction agencies in the city.“We held a meeting at the Delhi secretariat today [on Friday] with all the private agencies doing construction work in Delhi today and apprised them about the guidelines issued by the Delhi government to check dust pollution. During this meeting, suggestions were also taken from the representatives of private construction agencies,” Rai said.The national capital’s air quality starts deteriorating every year around mid-October when crop stubble burning starts in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana. This, along with Delhi’s own local pollution sources and unfavourable weather conditions such as low wind speeds make things worse for the Capital every winter. Dust and debris from construction sites also exacerbate the city’s pollution problem, which has forced the state to issue curbs on such activities during the winter. Despite a blanket ban on crackers for the last four years, unchecked cracker bursting also contributes to Delhi’s hazardous winter air.The state government will release a holistic winter action plan by September 30 this year, for which agencies have been asked to submit their own plans by September 21.The government’s 14-point guidelines for construction agencies included that all construction agencies in Delhi will have to mandatorily cover the periphery of their sites with tin walls of appropriate height so that dust from the site does not blow out. Further, all sites operating in an area over 20,000 sqm built up area will need to install anti-smog guns to ensure that dust generated is settled.The guidelines also mandate that the agencies cover construction material with a tarpaulin or a green net; ensure that vehicles carrying construction material and debris are regularly cleaned and its wheels washed; the construction material are fully covered during transportation and does not spill onto the roads; and that material is stored properly on-site and is not dumped along roads and pavements.Rai said that agencies will also need to ensure that no construction material or construction and demolition waste is left uncovered.“It was also advised that wet jets be used for the cutting and grinding of stones. Such activity will not be allowed in the open. Unpaved surfaces and areas with loose soil should be adequately sprinkled with water to suppress dust, roads around construction sites must be paved and blacktopped, and construction and demolition waste should be recycled on-site or transported to authorised recycling facility and due record of the same should be maintained,” Rai said.Apart from these, agencies were also asked to provide adequate safety gear such as masks to all workers involved in activities such as loading, unloading and handling of construction material and waste. .Rai also stressed on his government’s focus on fighting the pollution levels in Delhi that tend to rise every winter and urged the cooperation of all government and private agencies, and public participation in this fight.“We all have to fight for our breath together. Therefore, all of us will have to fulfil our responsibility with full sincerity. All private agencies should appoint an employee at their construction sites to see whether the norms are being followed or not. Everyone has to make changes in their daily behaviour,” he added.The Delhi government had issued a similar set of guidelines last year before the pollution season, and several construction agencies, including government and government-funded agencies such as the Public Works Department (PWD) and the NBCC (India) Limited, were slapped with hefty fines for violating dust mitigation guidelines.Earlier this week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also announced a complete ban on the sale, storage and use of firecrackers in the Capital this Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-issues-14-point-guidelines-for-construction-firms-to-curb-dust-pollution-101631902226954.html

18-09-2021||Delhi||‘Gangster’ wanted in gang war murder cases arrested from south Delhi||New Delhi: A 21-year-old alleged criminal, wanted in four cases of murder and an attempt to murder case related to incidents of gang rivalry, was arrested from south Delhi on Thursday, with the police claiming to have recovered a sophisticated automatic pistol and five cartridges from his possession. Police said the suspect carried a reward of ₹1 lakh on his arrest.Police identified the suspect, Govind Singh Thapa alias Danny, as a member of Hashim Baba gang, which is operational in south and east Delhi. The gang, which is currently led by Shahrukh after Hashim Baba‘s arrest, has been in a rivalry with the Ravi Gangwal gang over establishing supremacy in south and eastern parts of Delhi. Police said three murders and the attempt to murder cases in which Thapa was involved, were reported between March and May in south and east Delhi. “These crimes were committed by Shahrukh, Thapa, Aman, Pawan and others,” said joint commissioner of police (crime) Alok Kumar.“Shahrukh wanted to establish his supremacy in south and east Delhi areas after the arrest of his gang leader Hashim Baba. Shahrukh’s main rival in south Delhi was Ravi Gangwal and his gang and he started taking them on,” said Kumar.On the night of March 22, Shahrukh, along with Thapa and some other aides, went to Dakshinpuri with firearms and ammunition and allegedly opened fire at Amit Madrasi, a close associate of Ravi Gangwal. Madrasi, however, managed to escape despite receiving gunshot injuries.“Immediately after that, Shahrukh, Thapa and their associates started searching for others in Gangwal’s gang. After spotting one Kunal, brother of Sunny, an important member of the Gangwal gang, they shot him multiple times and killed him on the spot in Ambedkar Nagar. Accordingly, cases of murder and attempt to murder were registered,” said the joint CP.A fortnight later, the same group allegedly killed one Farman, alias Nanhe, a rival of Hashim Baba, in east Delhi’s Mandawali. On May 25, they were also involved in another murder due to an old rivalry in northeast Delhi’s Jafarabad. In 2020, Thapa was booked in a murder and attempt to murder case registered at the Preet Vihar police station. The details of this crime were not shared by the police. A special task force (STF) formed to nab the suspects first caught Shahrukh’s brother Sahil with firearms, following which, on September 13, they nabbed Aman Khan, an alleged hit man from the gang. Police said their interrogation led to the arrest of Thapa from near Sriniwaspuri depot in south Delhi on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gangster-wanted-in-gang-war-murder-cases-arrested-from-south-delhi-101631900786647.html
18-09-2021||Mumbai||I-T department raids premises linked to Anil Deshmukh in tax evasion case||The investigation wing of the Income Tax (I-T) department conducted searches on Friday at the residence and offices of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in Nagpur, Mumbai and Pune for suspected tax evasion.According to people familiar with the matter in the department, multiple I-T teams started search operations on Friday morning. The searches continued till the evening.In Nagpur, Deshmukh’s residence was searched by I-T officials accompanied by personnel from central security forces. The Nagpur city police deployed additional security outside the residence as many of the leader’s supporters gathered outside following the searches, said a senior police officer. The tax department neither shared any details nor released a statement in connection with the searches. Deshmukh was not available for a comment. The former minister has been at the centre of controversies this year. On August 23, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a charge sheet against his personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde in a money laundering case, in which the former minister is the main accused. The charge sheet also includes a statement from dismissed Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze, one of the accused in the Antilla bomb scare case, and in the murder of Mansukh Hiran. In his statement to ED, Vaze has claimed that ₹40 crore was collected from ten deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) and “paid to former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and transport minister Anil Parab” for “letting the order of then city police commissioner Param Bir Singh to transfer them go through”.Vaze claimed that Deshmukh and Parab were not happy with Singh’s order regarding transfer and postings of the 10 DCPs and got the order reversed. “After 3-4 days, I came to know that after some adjustments and consideration of money, the said order was issued,” Vaze told ED.The money laundering case against Deshmukh and his aides was registered after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a first information report (FIR) against the minister on April 21. The basis of the FIR was corruption allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh. Singh alleged that Deshmukh demanded a monthly collection of ₹100 crore from Mumbai’s bars and restaurants, a claim that eventually forced Deshmukh to resign.According to the ED charge sheet, Vaze also corroborated the allegations of corruption against Deshmukh. “The I-T department’s action against Deshmukh is very surprising as his tax assessments (files) are clear. He has never received any intimation or notice in the past 20 years from the I-T department. The action (searches) is nothing, but pure political harrasment,” Deshmukh’s lawyer Inderpal Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/it-department-conducts-search-at-anil-deshmukh-s-premises-101631879424558.html

Many also raised doubts about the value of mass boosters.The panel, however, voted in favour of authorising Pfizer vaccine boosters for everyone aged 65 and above, as well as for people at high risk of developing severe Covid-19.The decisions came after a day-long meeting full of data presentations and at times charged debate that was convened by the FDA.“I think this should demonstrate to the public that the members of this committee are independent of the FDA,” said Archana Chatterjee, dean of Chicago Medical School.UNGA: Spotlight on NYC’s Covid vaccine mandatesSome 100 world leaders will descend on New York next week in a partial return of the annual UN General Assembly (UNGA) despite Covid-19 concerns, with progress sought on pressing global problems - starting with the pandemic.Much of the focus at the UNGA will be on the subject of coronavirus vaccine mandates that were recently declared by New York City. Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro has kicked up a firestorm by saying he will attend it even though he’s unvaccinated against Covid-19 - something that could violate the city’s vaccine mandates.In Melbourne on Saturday, several police officers were wounded and hundreds of protesters were arrested in Australia’s second most populous city at violent clashes during an anti-lockdown march.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-panel-rejects-booster-proposal-101631987234620.html

Noting that a lot of voters were “torn” between options, Trudeau said it wasn’t an “impossible choice” to support the incumbent Liberals. “You can actually vote for the party that is going to stop the Conservatives and move forward with the strongest plan to get things done,” the PM asserted.Rival O’Toole made a similar pitch, but to those who have gravitated to the extreme right People’s Party of Canada. “There are actually millions of Canadians who are very frustrated with Mr Trudeau. If they allow that frustration to do anything other than vote Conservative, they’re voting for Mr Trudeau.”The CBC poll tracker gives the Liberals a 61% chance of forming a minority government, but only 16% odds of garnering the majority that Trudeau targeted while precipitating snap elections on August 15.With 31.6% support, the Liberals are likely to get 153 seats, 17 short of the majority mark of 170 and four short of its 2019 tally. At 31% support, the Conservatives could also lose seats, down to 118 from 121 it won last time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-main-rival-tell-people-not-to-vote-for-smaller-parties-101631987046677.html

The statement, issued on Friday, made no mention of women teachers or girl pupils.Secondary schools, with students typically between the ages of 13 and 18, are often segregated by sex in Afghanistan. During the Covid-19 pandemic, they have faced repeated closures and have been shut since the Taliban seized power.The United Nations said it was “deeply worried” for the future of girls’ schooling in Afghanistan. “It is critical that all girls, including older girls, are able to resume their education without any further delays. For that, we need female teachers to resume teaching,” the UN’s children’s agency Unicef said.Primary schools have already reopened, with boys and girls mostly attending separate classes and some women teachers returning to work. The country’s new regime has also permitted women to go to private universities.In a further sign that the Taliban’s approach to women and girls hasn’t softened, they appeared to have shut down the government’s ministry of women’s affairs and replaced it with a department meant for enforcing strict religious doctrine during their first rule.Videos posted on social media showed women workers from the ministry protesting outside after losing their jobs.Pak supports inclusive Afghan governmentPakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said he has “initiated a dialogue” with the Taliban for an inclusive Afghanistan government having Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks in it, a day after SCO members sought representation for all ethnic, religious and political groups in the new dispensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-girls-says-afghanistan-as-secondary-schools-reopen-101631986759852.html

Turns out, as The New York Times summed it up, “Almost everything senior defence officials asserted in the hours, and then days, and then weeks after the August 29 drone strike turned out to be false.”“Sorry” is not enough for the survivors of the deadly drone strike. Emal Ahmadi, whose three-year-old daughter Malika was killed on August 29, when the US hellfire missile struck his elder brother’s car, told AP on Saturday the family demands Washington to investigate who fired the drone and punish those responsible for the attack.“That is not enough for us, to say sorry,” said Ahmadi. “The USA should find the person who did this.” Ahmadi said the family is seeking financial compensation for their losses.On Friday, General Kenneth F McKenzie Jr, commander of the US Central Command that carried out the drone strike, said at a press meet, “Our investigation now concludes that the strike was a tragic mistake. This strike certainly did not come up to our standards, and I profoundly regret it.”He said the US was considering ex-gratia payments to the victims and, going forward, strikes in Afghanistan “will be under a higher standard”.2 die in Jalalabad blastsTwo people were killed when three blasts struck Jalalabad on Saturday, one of which targeted a Taliban vehicle, in the country’s first deadly attack since the United States withdrew.“In one attack, a Taliban vehicle patrolling in Jalalabad was targeted,” a Taliban official who asked not to be named told AFP. “Women and children were among the injured.”An official from the health department in Nangarhar told AFP three people, not two, died and 18 were wounded, contradicting local media reports that said the attacks left two dead.Photos taken at the site of the blast showed a green pick-up truck with a white Taliban flag surrounded by debris as armed fighters looked on. Jalalabad is in Nangarhar, heartland of the IS group’s Afghanistan branch.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drone-attack-in-kabul-killed-civilians-confesses-america-101631986525163.html

"After 40 years of conflict, this inclusivity will ensure peace and a stable Afghanistan, which is in the interest not only of Afghanistan but the region as well," Imran Khan tweeted.After capturing the country in an unexpected coup on August 15, the Taliban have announced an interim Cabinet which is now seeking international recognition. No country has yet recognised the Taliban government while China has extended co-operation and Qatar where the Taliban have their political office has engaged with the leadership.

The three countries are known for their high levels of equality, low unemployment and modern social service systems.Speaking about humanitarian issues, Rashid said that Pakistan has requested the international community for providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan as it does not want anyone to die of hunger in the war-ravaged country.This is not the first time when Interior Minister Rashid has compared Afghanistan with Scandinavian countries.Last week, he said it would be unfair for the world to expect Afghanistan to become as prosperous as some Scandinavian countries in eight days and cautioned that freezing of Afghan accounts could create a humanitarian crisis.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan on August 15, two weeks before the US' complete troop withdrawal on August 31 after a costly two-decade war. This forced Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to flee the country to the UAE.The Taliban insurgents stormed across Afghanistan and captured all major cities in a matter of days, as Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the US and its allies melted away.Thousands of Afghan nationals and foreigners have fled the country to escape the new Taliban regime and to seek asylum in different nations, including the US and many European nations, resulting in total chaos and deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-possible-afghanistan-becomes-scandinavian-country-in-17-days-pak-minister-101631968482903.html

While two IED blasts took place at 10.30 am, the third one struck 50 minutes later, the reports said.The twin blasts targeted two convoys of vehicles, carrying members of the Taliban. The third one exploded near the university hospital.The convoys were travelling from Jalalabad (the capital of Nangarhar province) to Kabul. The road from the eastern city to the national capital is dominated by Zadran tribe, whose cadre the Haqqani network that is led by interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani.Kabul watchers say that the explosions are a result of infighting between various factions of the Taliban. Jalalabad is the fifth-largest city of Afghanistan which is about 80 miles from Kabul.Local media reported that another IED blast took place at 11.50am in the Angor Bagh area, which also targeted the passing Taliban vehicles. Any injury or casualty in this blast is still being determined. An IED also exploded in the Rokhan Mina area at 12.30pm, the media reports said. The target of the attack is not known yet.The attacks are the first deadly blasts since the new government was established in Afghanistan.Also on Saturday a sticky bomb exploded in the capital Kabul wounding two people, said police officials. The target of the Kabul bomb was not immediately clear.Two Taliban vehicles were also targeted in Sherzad and Hisarak districts of Nangarhar on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jalalabad-blasts-result-of-infighting-between-taliban-factions-report-101631960612133.html

18-09-2021||World||Which Covid-19 vaccines are approved? Here’s the global progress||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues its rampage across the world, with the total number of infections having crossed 227 million (227,655,835, to be precise) on the John Hopkins University's coronavirus tracker. The total number of deaths from the infectious disease has also just crossed the grim milestone of 4 million. In a silver lining, however, vaccination rates have been picking up across the world; more than 5.85 billion doses have been administered across 184 countries, according to data collected by the Bloomberg news agency. In India, a record landmark in the vaccination campaign against Covid-19 was achieved on the occasion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on September 17. In an extraordinary feat, the country vaccinated as many as 25 million citizens, more than three times the average daily total of the past month.There are more than 200 clinical trials worldwide testing potential vaccines, known as candidates, against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). So far, only six of the vaccine candidates have been approved around the world. Here's a review of the Covid-19 vaccine situation so far:How many vaccines have been approved so far?Note: To be considered a globally-approved Covid-19 vaccine in this chart, a candidate needs to have either been approved by the US FDA or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or cleared for emergency use by the FDA, the EMA, or the WHO.The approved vaccines were developed by:BioNTech-Pfizer (mRNA vaccine)Moderna (mRNA vaccine)AstraZeneca (nonreplicating vector vaccine)Janssen (Johnson & Johnson)(nonreplicating vector vaccine)Sinopharm (inactivated virus vaccine)Sinovac (inactivated virus vaccine)How far have researchers gotten in the development of a vaccine?Still, the majority of vaccine candidates for Covid-19 are still in a preclinical phase. That means the vaccine candidates are being tested in animal experiments, for example, rather than with human patients. When those tests are deemed successful, candidate vaccines can move into clinical trial phases. That's when they are tested with humans. There are three clinical trial phases for efficacy and safety before a vaccine can be approved for use by humans. The phases differ from each other, most significantly in their scale:Some companies, such as BioNTech-Pfizer in Europe, and Sinovac in China, have tested their vaccine candidates in several trials in parallel. For example, they have tested the same vaccine but in different age groups or with different dosages.If clinical trials are successful, a company can formally apply to regulatory bodies to have their vaccine approved for use by the general public.Three regulatory authorities are considered to be particularly important in this context: The FDA in the US, the European EMA, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency in Japan.How fast can vaccines be developed?t can take several years to develop an effective and safe vaccine. On average, it takes between 10 and 12 years, but it can take longer. The search for a vaccine against HIV has been going since the early 1980s — so far without success.In the case of Covid-19, researchers are racing to shorten the time it usually takes because of the ongoing pandemic. Despite the pressure that that brings, vaccine developers, manufacturers, and the World Health Organization (WHO) say there will be no compromises on safety.Research teams are aiming to accelerate, or limit, the time it takes to get to approval during the pandemic to an average duration of 16 months.That will only be the beginning. Once clinical trials are successfully completed and a vaccine is approved and produced, researchers start phase IV, during which they observe the progress of vaccinated patients.Which types of Covid-19 vaccines are in development?Researchers are pursuing 13 different approaches for vaccines against Covid-19.Most of the vaccine candidates use a protein-based subunit — so, instead of using a complete pathogenic virus, they are built on a small component of it, such as a protein found in its outer shell.That protein is administered to patients in a high dose, with the aim of inducing a fast and strong reaction by the human immune system.The hope is that the immune system will "remember" the protein and trigger a similar defense reaction if or when it comes into contact with the actual virus.Vaccines against hepatitis B and HPV (human papillomavirus), for example, are based on this principle.Four additional approaches have made it to phase III.Nonreplicating viral vectors are a type of so-called recombinant vaccines: Researchers modify the virus's genetic information by switching on or off or altering certain functions. By doing that they can, for example, reduce the infectiousness of a virus. Such genetic modifications, however, require that science already has detailed knowledge about which parts of a virus' genetic material are responsible for which functions in order for them to be able to manipulate them effectively. The term "nonreplicating" means that the virus in the vaccine enters cells in the human body but is unable to reproduce there on its own.Inactivated vaccines use a "dead" version of the pathogen. They tend to provide a lower level of protection than live vaccines. Some vaccines in this class have to be administered several times to achieve sufficient immunity. Examples of inactivated vaccines include ones against influenza and hepatitis A.RNA vaccines follow a different strategy, without using any "real" component of the virus at all. Instead, researchers aim to trick the human body into producing a specific virus component on its own. Since only this specific component is built, no complete virus can assemble itself. Nevertheless, the immune system learns to recognize the non-human components and trigger a defense reaction.Vaccines based on virus-like particles use another approach: Researchers only use the empty virus envelope — without any genetic material inside of it — to train the immune system.With DNA-based vaccines, patients are injected with the virus's genetic makeup for the human body to produce virus particles themselves without being actually infected. Confronted with these self-produced virus particles, the immune system is supposed to learn to recognize and fight the actual virus.Who is working on a Covid-19 vaccine?At the time of this writing, there were well over 100 research teams worldwide developing a Covid-19 vaccine. So far, 37 teams have advanced their vaccines to the third phase of clinical trials. Although some of these vaccines have already been approved in some countries, they still continue to be tested in clinical trials in parallel.Five teams stand out for conducting the most extensive clinical trials:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/which-covid-19-vaccines-are-approved-here-s-the-global-progress-101631951930907.html
18-09-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine tracker: Countries with highest vaccination numbers||India reached a new milestone on Friday by administering over 25 million (2.5 crore) doses of Covid-19 vaccines in a single day. The feat was achieved on the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Friday was the fourth day that India has crossed the 10 million mark of daily doses in the past month. The previous record for single-day dose administration was set on August 31, with 12.87 million doses administered across India.More than 5.85 billion doses have been administered so far across 184 countries, according to Bloomberg. The average daily vaccination stands at 31.1 million doses a day, Bloomberg further said.When compared to other countries in the world, only China has administered vaccines to more number of people than India. Here's a look at global vaccination statistics based on data shared by health authorities of these countries:ChinaThe Chinese government said this week it had given more than 2.16 billion shots and that 1 billion Chinese people were fully vaccinated.The Chinese government record further showed that 4,937,857 vaccine doses are being administered daily.IndiaThe over 25 million vaccine shots (administered on Friday) equals the entire population of Australia, is two-thirds the population of Canada, and five times the entire population of New Zealand, according to the central government.The Union health ministry said on Saturday that the special drive had raised India's overall vaccinations to more than 790 million.India, a country of nearly 1.4 billion people, has given at least one dose to more than 62% of eligible adults and two doses to about 21%.United StatesAccording to Bloomberg data, which is based on the numbers provided by the country's health authorities, 383 million doses have been given so far. In the last week, an average of 781,574 doses per day were administered.Roughly half of the US population has been fully vaccinated, while 63.5 per cent people have received single dose.BrazilThe South American country, which was hard hit by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April-May, has administred 216,611,648 doses of vaccines to its population. The data from Brazil's health authority shows that 1,811,626 doses are given every day on an average.Brazil's 35.9 per cent of population is fully vaccinated, which 68.4 per cent have received one dose.JapanThe island nation has administered 148,775,011 vaccine doses. The daily average is 1,211,318.The fully vaccinated account for 52.8 per cent in Japan, whereas 65.1 per cent has received one shot.IndonesiaIndonesia has administered 118,994,105 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to its population, with the daily average being 1,256,699.The country has a long way to go to inoculate its population.

The new Taliban ministry of education made the announcement in a statement on Friday, saying state and private schools at the primary and secondary level as well as official madrasa religious schools would be open from Saturday. "All teachers and male students should attend school," the Taliban said in the statement.Most educational institutions across Afghanistan have remained closed more than a month after the Taliban seized the capital Kabul. Girls up to Class 6 have attended classes at some of the schools that have managed to stay open and women have gone to university classes. But high schools for girls have been closed in Afghanistan. Taliban officials have promised that girls will be able to go to school so long as they do so in segregated classrooms and they have said they will not replicate the fundamentalist policies of the previous Taliban government, which banned girls' education. However, women still are not allowed to continue their work in some of the provinces, with exceptions for those who have worked in health departments, hospitals and education.Also read | Taliban to track, secure 2000-year-old Bactrian gold treasure: ReportThe UN Children's Fund (Unicef) has welcomed the reopening of schools in Afghanistan from Saturday but said that girls must not be kept away from the classrooms. "We are deeply worried that many girls may not be allowed back at this time. Even before the most recent humanitarian crisis, 4.2 million children were not enrolled in school. Around 60 per cent of them are girls,” Unicef chief Henrietta Fore said in a statement on Friday."Girls cannot, and must not, be left behind. It is critical that all girls, including older girls, are able to resume their education without any further delays. For that, we need female teachers to resume teaching," Fore added.Also read | ‘Tragic mistake’: US admits Kabul airstrikes did not kill IS terroristsUnicef has said that significant progress has been made in education in the country over the past two decades.

The UN agency urged development partners to support education "for all children" in Afghanistan. "Unicef will continue to advocate with all actors so that all girls and boys have an equal chance to learn and develop the skills they need to thrive and build a peaceful and productive Afghanistan," Fore stated.Also read | UN envoy of ousted Afghan govt asks to keep NY seat amid no clarity from TalibanThe Taliban recaptured Afghanistan in August after US troops withdrew and the Afghan government collapsed, prompting concern that they will reimpose a harsh interpretation of Islamic law that prohibits girls from attending school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-reopen-schools-for-afghan-boys-girls-still-not-allowed-in-classes-101631947006968.html

Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The number of H-1B visas issued each year is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 reserved for individuals with advanced degrees. The current system for selecting applications for consideration is a hybrid of first-come, first-served, and a lottery.During former president Donald Trump's final days in office, the US Citizenship, and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced to do away with the traditional lottery system in deciding the successful applicants for the H-1B visas.The USCIS had said it would prioritise wages to protect the economic interests of American workers, and better ensure that the most highly skilled foreign workers benefit from the temporary employment programme.The H-1B cap allocation regulation was originally set to take effect on March 9, 2021. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) delayed the effective date of the regulation to December 31, 2021, in response to a Biden administration regulatory freeze."Because Mr Wolf was not lawfully appointed as Acting Secretary at the time the Final Rule was approved, the Court concludes the rule must be set aside. In light of this ruling, the Court does not reach Plaintiffs’ alternative arguments. Accordingly, the Court vacates the Final Rule and remands this matter to DHS," the judge said in its order.“Plaintiffs argue the Final Rule must be set aside because Mr Wolf was not lawfully appointed as Acting Secretary at the time the DHS promulgated the rule,” he wrote.The Court concluded the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that Wolf’s appointment was not lawful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h1b-visa-us-court-sets-aside-proposed-trump-era-wage-selection-rule-101631945545276.html
18-09-2021||World||‘Justice for J6’: All you need to know about September 18 rally in Washington||Washington is on high alert ahead of a rally in support of the pro-Trump rioters who ransacked the US Capitol on January 6. Compared to that time, the security forces are better prepared to avoid a repeat of the mayhem.The rally is scheduled to take place on Saturday. Sean Gallagher, acting assistant chief for the Capitol Police's uniformed operations, said that authorities are expecting "a peaceful event this weekend" but the security apparatus is ready "to handle anything that occurs".Since it's a Saturday, members of Congress will not be in the building; many are still on summer recess and won't be back in town until next week.Who is organising the rally?The "Justice for J6" rally is being organised by Look Ahead America, a non-profit organisation led by Matt Braynard, who worked as an analyst for the Republican Party.Braynard started the non-profit after he was dismissed by Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, but his fortunes changed after Trump's 2020 loss. He joined an aggrieved group of Trump allies seeking to overturn the election - and in the process reaped recognition, lucrative fees and fundraising windfall.The group is planning to organise similar rallies across the country in the coming weeks. It has appealed to the attendees to show respect to law enforcement officers and refrain from bringing Donald Trump banners.How many protesters are expected to attend the rally?Though there are no exact numbers, the police say that organisers have obtained a permit for 700 protesters. The officers, however, are prepared a larger turnout."What we're concerned about, I think more than anything, is the possibility of counter-demonstrators making it to this demonstration and there being violence between those two groups," Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger told reporters.What are the security arrangements?A black fence that surrounded the complex for six months after the deadly riot has been put back up for the weekend along with surveillance cameras.The National Guard has 100 officers standing ready to act as a "physical security task force" backing up the Capitol Police and local law enforcement if requested.Capitol Police warned in a news conference there had been "some threats of violence," with a counter-rally scheduled to take place nearby.What happened on January 6, 2021?Thousands of Trump's supporters, some associated with ultra-nationalist and white supremacist groups, stormed the US legislature that day in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory.Around 600 have been charged, including at least 185 accused of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees and more than 70 indicted for destruction or theft of government property.A rioter was shot dead by police as she tried to breach the Senate. Officials say the mob assaulted 140 officers, with damage to the Capitol complex estimated at $1.5 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justice-for-j6-all-you-need-to-know-about-september-18-rally-in-washington-101631945360872.html
18-09-2021||World||Indian works leave their mark at Toronto International Film Festival||While Indian films made their presence felt at the 2021 edition of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), there was a marked absence of talent from the country as a result of ban on direct flights from India to Canada that kept most filmmakers away.Of the three directors who had their debut projects premiere at Toronto International Film Festival , only Mumbai-based Ritwik Pareek, director of the fiction feature Dug Dug was able to make it to Toronto. Even in his case, the hassles associated with getting a RT-PCR test in a third country before connecting to a flight to Toronto meant he missed the in-person world premiere of his own film.Payal Kapadia, director of the documentary A Night of Knowing Nothing, also skipped the Toronto International Film Festival . And for Nithin Lukose, director of Paka, it wasn’t even possible to attend the festival as he has received the anti-Covid jab Covaxin, which is not recognised by Health Canada. That film was represented at the festival by Dallas-based producer Raj Rachakonda, while the other producer, Anurag Kashyap, a TIFF regular, couldn’t make it either.Those were not the only lack of Indian presence. The large press contingent from India was missing and an industry event India@75, promoting the country as a film destination, was cancelled without explanation.However, for Ritwik Pareek, the trouble he went through to attend TIFF in person was “totally worth it”. He described having his debut project Dug Dug, a satire on commercialisation of religion in India, showcased at TIFF as a “very big opportunity” and its selection in the official slate was “more than I could have asked for”.In fact, its world premiere was at an IMAX theatre and came right after TIFF’s most high-profile presentation of the year, the science fiction epic Dune.Nithin Lukose, meanwhile, participated in a virtual Q&A session after Paka’s premiere, and was excited at the opportunity, as he said, “It’s a matter of pride that a regional film like ours is getting a platform through a globally renowned festival like TIFF.” A statement from the filmmakers said he and Anurag Kashyap couldn’t make it due to “travel restrictions changing by the moment and vaccine mandates not yet streamlined internationally.”The 10-day Toronto International Film Festival concludes today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-films-leave-their-mark-at-toronto-festival-101631944050982.html
18-09-2021||World||How some EU countries managed to ditch Covid-19 restrictions||In parts of Europe, enjoying a pre-pandemic social life, or at least a close version of it is no longer a far-off dream.Fully vaccinated people in the Netherlands can go dancing in crammed clubs and can attend parties without having to keep social distance from 25 September. Instead, the government will begin mandating vaccine passes, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in a press conference Tuesday.Denmark abandoned all Covid- restrictions last week, becoming the first EU country to go return entirely to pre-pandemic daily life. No masks or even proof of vaccination are necessary to go to concerts or gyms.In late August, Danish health minister Magnus Heunicke said the government no longer saw Covid-19 as a "socially critical disease." This approach effectively ends the ministry's mandate to implement measures such as national closures and requirements for coronavirus passes.Joining the league will be Sweden, which has stood out among European countries for its relatively hands-off response to the pandemic. Most restrictions, including limitations on private and public gatherings and the advice to work from home, will expire by the end of September, Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren announced earlier this month.Travelers to these countries are still required to be tested and quarantine upon their arrival if they are not fully vaccinated.Delta variant loomsDenmark and Sweden both have a relatively high vaccination rate. According to the University of Oxford's Our World in Data project, in Denmark, more than 80% of eligible adults are fully vaccinated and in Sweden, over 70% are vaccinated. "Among the most vulnerable of our patients and citizens, the vaccination rate is more than nine out of ten," said Allan Randrup Thomsen, a virologist at the University of Copenhagen.In the Netherlands, the vaccination rate stands at about 60%, But caretaker health minister Hugo de Jonge hopes that rewarding more freedoms to residents, in tandem with a vaccine mandate, will boost the country's vaccination rollout, according to the public broadcaster NOS.Easing restrictions comes at a time when infection rates are rising in some EU countries and the rest of the world, mostly due to the highly contagiousdelta variant. The latest update to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, (ECDC)'s map shows far fewer red zones compared to previous weeks, but it also highlights the radically varied status of the pandemic across Europe.In countries with slower vaccine rollout, the virus is still raging.With only 20% of its population fully vaccinated, Bulgaria has resorted to limiting social life and imposing more restrictions on public life and businesses. Despite a surge in infections, most Balkan countries have very few restrictions in place.But even countries with higher vaccination rates are now experiencing a rise in infections.Despite having vaccinated about 60% of eligible adults, Austria is seeing a surge in new cases and has therefore shortened the validity period of negative PCR tests, a mandatory document for entering most public places.Norway, the Scandinavian neighbor of Denmark and Sweden, is experiencing a new wave of infections, despite having a vaccination rate of about 70%, the ECDC data shows.Covid endgame?In late May, the Danish government presented its vaccine pass, in the form of an app, a printed QR code, or a green bar for people who had tested negative.When such measures were mandated in some European countries, like France, Italy, and Greece, the curbs often sparked resistance and in some cases, demonstrations.But Sweden, the Netherlands, and Denmark enjoy a high level of trust in authorities , which experts say has given the countries a leg up in fighting the pandemic. It made it much easier for the governments to carry out tracking programs."We had a large testing program, which allowed us to track the infected persons very locally, and we had local lockdowns that worked very effectively," Camilla Holten Moller, a Statens Serum Institut epidemiologist, told DW. "We were able to do so simply because the Danes historically have a high level of trust in their health authorities and vaccine programs."The decision-makers in the three countries are realistic about the possibility of new outbreaks in the fall and especially breakthrough cases, but they have set their policy goals on keeping the virus under control and reducing the coronavirus' strain on hospitals."I don't think that Denmark will have to go into national lockdown again. We have proven that our large test system allows us to control the outbreaks with local lockdowns," Holten Moller said.The Dutch cabinet will be monitoring the number of Covid-19 related hospital and ICU admissions, rather than looking at the number of infections, caretaker health minister Hugo de Jonge said in a letter to parliament, according to the public broadcaster NOS.The Covid endgame of the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden is a delicate balancing act: Containing the pandemic with restrictions and protections, and carefully resuming pre-pandemic life. High vaccination rates mean the countries can contain Covid-19's worst outcomes — hospitalisation and death — with fewer restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-some-eu-countries-managed-to-ditch-covid-19-restrictions-101631943226169.html

Acknowledging a lot of voters were “torn”, Justin Trudeau said it wasn’t an “impossible choice” to support the incumbent Liberals. “You can actually vote for the party that is going to stop the Conservatives and move forward with the strongest plan to get things done,” Justin Trudeau asserted, according to the outlet CBC News.His main opponent, Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole made a similar pitch but to those who have gravitated to the extreme right People’s Party of Canada (PPC). At a campaign event in the town of London in Ontario, Erin O’Toole said, “There are actually millions of Canadians who are very frustrated with Mr Trudeau. If they allow that frustration to do anything other than vote Conservative, they’re voting for Mr Trudeau.”The PPC, headed by former Conservative cabinet minister Maxime Bernier has gained some steam, and could be based on quadrupling its vote share from the 1.6% recorded in 2019. It may still win no seats in the House of Commons as in 2019 but it could dent the Conservatives’ prospects. In fact, as the PPC share has reached 6.3% according to the CBC Poll Tracker, it has siphoned support mainly from the Conservatives and benefited the Liberals, who have returned to frontrunner status.The CBC Poll tracker gives the Liberals a 61% chance of forming a minority government but only 16% odds of garnering the majority Justin Trudeau targeted while precipitating snap Canada elections on August 15. With 31.6% support, it is likely to get 153 seats, 17 short of the majority mark of 170 and also four short of its rally in 2019. At 31% support, the Conservatives could also lose seats, down to 118 from 121 in the last Canada elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-elections-justin-trudeau-erin-o-toole-tell-voters-not-to-waste-ballot-on-a-smaller-party-101631942311039.html

The magnitude-4.3 quake struck shortly after 7:58pm and was centered near Carson, about 21 miles (34 kilometers) southeast of downtown LA, according to preliminary information from the U.S. Geological Survey website.Its depth was reported at about 9 miles (14 kilometers), the USGS reported.Some people reported feeling a jolt ranging from a moment to several seconds across the area. It was felt in neighboring cities, including Santa Monica, Torrance, and Beverly Hills.No problems were reported at an oil refinery in Carson.The Los Angeles Fire Department went into earthquake emergency mode, sending vehicles and helicopters to patrol its 470 square miles (1,217-square-kilometer) area but said it didn't receive any reports of “significant damage or injury," according to a department statement.Seismologist Lucy Jones told KCBS-TV that the quake “doesn't look abnormal at all."“This size happens on average somewhere in Southern California every couple of months,” she said. “When it happens to be in the middle of the Los Angeles basin then a lot more people feel it and it becomes bigger news.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/magnitude-4-3-earthquake-rattles-los-angeles-no-injuries-reported-101631941613197.html
18-09-2021||World||10 civilians killed: US says Kabul drone strike was a ‘tragic mistake’||The US military on Friday acknowledged that the drone strike it carried out in Kabul on August 29 was a “tragic mistake” and all 10 persons killed were civilians, including seven children, and not one of them had anything to do with the terrorist group Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) as had been claimed earlier.It was a most profound reversal of the Pentagon’s earlier description of the drone strike in Kabul, which was touted as a successful operation that presaged the over-the-horizon counterterrorism capability that President Joe Biden said the US will have in Afghanistan after the pull-out.Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley had called it a “righteous” strike.Turns out, as The New York Times summed it up, “Almost everything senior defence officials asserted in the hours, and then days, and then weeks after the August 29 drone strike turned out to be false.”General Kenneth F McKenzie Jr, commander of the US Central Command that carried out the Kabul drone strike, acknowledged it unequivocally. “Our investigation now concludes that the strike was a tragic mistake,” he said at a news briefing. “This strike certainly did not come up to our standards, and I profoundly regret it.”The general said the US is considering ex-gratia payments to the victims and, going forward strikes in Afghanistan “will be under a higher standard”.Asked if the blundered drone strike cast doubts on the over-the-horizon counterterrorism strategy - strikes carried out from outside Afghanistan, the American general said, “Let me be clear this was a self defence strike taken under self defence rules and engagement based on an imminent threat to attack us. That is not the way we would strike in an OTH (over the horizon) mission going into Afghanistan against ISIS-K targets, the one thing that will not be a self defence strike. It’ll be done under different – it’ll be different - done under different rules of engagement, so - and we’ll have a lot more opportunity probably than we had under this extreme time pressure to take a look at the target.”The US military had earlier described the drone strike target in Kabul as an IS-K leader who was driving an explosives-laden car to the Hamid Karzai International Airport for a terrorist attack as the Americans and other countries were evacuating personnel and Afghan allies after the fall of Kabul.After the August 26 terrorist strike at the airport that killed more than 170 Afghans and 13 American troops, the US was on heightened alert for more of these attacks. There were intelligence reports that were widely cited, including by President Biden, of an “imminent threat”.The August 29 strike should be considered in the light of the Kabul airport attack, the general said going into the process that led to the tragic incident, including the intelligence warning repeatedly of an “imminent threat”. The general went on to detail the movements of the car - a Toyota Corolla - stretching over hours before the strike from video recordings that showed its many stops. The vehicle picked up bags and packages at these stops, and people. “One of the most recurring aspects of the intelligence was that ISIS-K would utilise a white Toyota Corolla as a key element in the next attack,” General Kenneth F McKenzie Jr said.Zemari Ahmadi, the driver of the car was a long-time worker for a US aid group, and had nothing to do with the Islamic State, according to multiple US media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-kabul-drone-strike-was-a-tragic-mistake-101631940750858.html

Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the cultural commission of the Taliban interim cabinet, said they have assigned the relevant departments the task to find and check on the Bactrian treasure. “The issue is under investigation, and we will collect information to know what the reality is. If it has been transferred (out of Afghanistan), it is treason against Afghanistan,” he was quoted as saying by Tolo News. “The government of Afghanistan will take serious actions if this and other ancient items are moved out of the country.”According to National Geographic, the Bactrian treasure consists of thousands of gold pieces from all over the ancient world and was found inside six tombs, dating from the first century BC to the first century AD. “They contained more than 20,000 objects, including golden rings, coins, weapons, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, weapons, and crowns. In addition to gold, many of these were crafted from precious stones such as turquoise, carnelian, and lapis lazuli,” the magazine said.Also read | Afghanistan had women ministry. Taliban replace it with ‘vice and virtue’Scholars believe the graves belonged to six wealthy Asian nomads, five women and one man, according to National Geographic. “The 2,000-year-old artifacts found with them exhibit a rare blend of aesthetic influences (from Persian to classical Greek) and the great number of precious objects found surprised the archaeologists, in particular the intricate golden crown found in the sixth tomb,” National Geographic said in 2016.The Bactrian treasure was brought to the presidential palace by the former government in February 2021 and was put on display for public viewing. However, after the collapse of the former government, concerns were raised over its safety.Also read | Afghanistan can’t be ‘controlled from outside’, says Pak PM Imran KhanTolo News reported that Wasiq has said any contract that has been signed with the international community over the protection of ancient and historical monuments will remain in place.

It should remain in our country,” Hashmat said.Tolo News reported in December 2020 that the Bactrian treasure collection has been displayed in 13 countries in the past 13 years, “bringing in more than 350 million Afghanis (more than $4.5 million) to the country’s contemporary treasury.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-to-track-secure-2000-year-old-bactrian-gold-treasure-report-101631932521548.html
18-09-2021||World||UK relaxes rules for vaccinated travellers; minor benefit for long haul flights from India||Britain is simplifying its system for international travel for vaccinated travellers coming in and out of the UK and scrapping its current three-tiered red-amber-green country list with a single red one, transport minister Grant Shapps said on Twitter on Friday, adding that these measures will be applicable from October 4. The latter move is set to benefit long haul flights between India and the UK.From October 4, the current traffic light system of red, amber and green countries based on levels of Covid-19 risk in different countries will be scrapped and replaced with one red list only. UK will no longer require pre-departure tests before arrival into England for fully vaccinated travellers coming from non-red list countries.For India, which is currently on the amber list, this will translate into reduced travel costs for the Indian diaspora vaccinated in the UK, as they will no longer be required to undergo compulsory PCR tests. However, those who have been inoculated with Covishield, the Serum Institute of India produced Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, have not been exempted from mandatory Covid-tests as the newly expanded list of countries whose vaccines are recognised in England does not include India.Passengers who aren’t recognised as being fully vaccinated with authorised vaccines under the UK’s international travel rules, including India, will still have to take a pre-departure test, a day two and day eight PCR test, and self-isolate at their given address for 10 days upon entry.The UK expanded the list of countries with recognised vaccines to include Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and 14 other countries, thus travellers from these countries will no longer need to be tested for Covid-19. In addition to this, eight countries—Turkey, Bangladesh, Egypt, Maldives, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Kenya—will be removed from the red list from October 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-relaxes-rules-for-vaccinated-travellers-minor-benefit-for-long-haul-flights-from-india-101631930578393.html
18-09-2021||World||Washington braces for rally supporting January 6 Capitol rioters||The ‘Justice for J6’ rally in support of pro-Trump rioters, who ransacked the US Capitol on January 6, is scheduled to be held on Saturday. The rally has been organised by Matt Braynard, a former Trump campaign operative, and his organisation, Look Ahead America. The supporters are demanding that the US justice department drop charges against January 6 protesters who are not charged with “destruction of property” or “committing violence against police officers”."Our advocacy is on behalf of the vast majority of people arrested at that event who are not charged with committing violence against police officers, who are not charged with destruction of property," Braynard told reporters on September 17. He added those who have “committed violence against police officers or destroyed property at the Capitol building on January 6 should be given a speedy trial -- if guilty, convicted and locked up”.Around 600 people have been charged so far, with at least 185 accused of assaulting, resisting, or impeding Capitol police officers or employees and more than 70 have been indicted for destruction or theft of government property during the January 6 riots.The Biden administration has deployed scores of National Guard troops and the black fence that surrounded the US Capitol building for six months following the January 6 riots has been brought back along with surveillance cameras. Members of the US Congress will not be in the Capitol building on Saturday.Capitol Police chief Tom Manger told reporters that three groups of counter-protesters were planning on showing up to Saturday’s rally, which might lead to a potential clash between the groups. “What we're concerned about, I think more than anything, is the possibility of counter-demonstrators making it to this demonstration and there being violence between those two groups," Manger said.The January 6 riots stormed the Capitol building as Congress was starting the electoral vote count. They were egged on by the then-president Donald J Trump, who had reiterated previously made claims of a “stolen” and “rigged” election. Thousands of Trump's supporters, some associated with ultra-nationalist and white supremacist groups, breached police parameters and scaled the Capitol building leading to chaos. One rioter was shot dead as she tried to breach the Senate. Officials say the rioters assaulted 140 officers and caused $1.5 million to the Capitol building.Trump extended his support to Saturday’s rally and continued to claim that the election which led to his defeat was “rigged”. "Our hearts and minds are with the people being persecuted so unfairly relating to the January 6th protest concerning the Rigged Presidential Election," he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-braces-for-rally-supporting-january-6-capitol-rioters-101631929532292.html

Durst admitted dismembering the neighbor but claimed the killing was self-defense. He was acquitted.The HBO filmmakers confronted Durst with a letter he once sent to Berman in handwriting similar to a cryptic note received by police locating Berman's body.When the trial opened last year, Durst's defense team said their client had written the note to police after finding Berman's body and panicking, but argued this did not mean he killed her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-real-estate-tycoon-robert-durst-guilty-of-beverly-hills-murder-of-best-friend-101631921331198.html

This forced Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to flee the country to the UAE.The Taliban insurgents stormed across Afghanistan and captured all major cities in a matter of days, as Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the US and its allies melted away.Thousands of Afghan nationals and foreigners have fled the country to escape the new Taliban regime and to seek asylum in different nations, including the US and many European nations, resulting in total chaos and deaths.

18-09-2021||World||In a first, France recalls its envoy to US, Australia over submarine deal||France recalled its ambassadors to the US and Australia in a diplomatic slap intended to convey its anger over a deal forged in secrecy that saw Paris lose a multi billion dollar submarine contract.While France and the US have at times been at odds on global affairs, including over the Iraq War in 2003, Paris has never gone so far as to remove its envoy to Washington, according to senior French diplomats who declined to speculate how long the envoys would be gone. It’s also unclear whether more slights are planned and if France is expecting a US overture in order to move on. French officials have already canceled a gala in Washington and Baltimore this week meant to celebrate Franco-American ties. The stunning decision comes two days after Australia’s Scott Morrison unveiled plans to buy nuclear-powered submarines in a joint announcement with U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The new partnership effectively scuppered Australia’s 2016 deal with French shipbuilder Naval Group to build as many as 12 conventional submarines in a project that had gone over budget but seemed secure.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian made the announcement on the envoys late Friday and denounced the deal as “unacceptable behavior between allies and partners, the consequences of which affect the very conception we have of our alliances, our partnerships and the importance of the Indo-Pacific for Europe.” A White House official said the Biden administration would try to work out its differences with Paris. The official said France and the U.S. would continue to cooperate on issues including the pandemic and security.The loss of the Australian submarine deal is a personal blow for President Emmanuel Macron. In June, Macron invited Morrison to Paris after the Group of Seven summit, and the two discussed the contract with state-owned Naval Group, focusing on delays and pricing, two people familiar with the discussions said. From the French perspective, there was never a suggestion that Australia was about to ditch the contract, look for other partners, or had second thoughts. Two French officials describe it as the typical discussions befitting a deal of that size and that Macron felt he had responded to Morrison’s queries.Macron and Biden have previously had a warm relationship. The French president publicly rejoiced at the G-7 meeting in June that America was “back” and ready to work with European partners, after difficult years under former US President Donald Trump.If France had any suspicion the submarine deal was in danger, two French officials said, it would never have signed a road map with Australia only two weeks ago, in which they “committed to deepen defense industry cooperation” and “underlined the importance of the future submarine program.”How the communication went down with all the parties involved is still up in the air. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that high-level US officials discussed the Australia partnership with French counterparts before its public announcement. Officials in the UK and the US have said it was for Australia to warn France. Australia, for its part, justified the cancellation of the French contract by its fundamental need for nuclear-powered rather than diesel submarines in a changing security environment as China expands its military clout in the Indo-Pacific region. In short, it wasn’t personal. But the French, by their reaction, see it differently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-france-recalls-its-envoy-to-us-over-aukus-submarine-deal-101631920110869.html

But the advisers rejected that idea out of concern that the data to support such a broad application was thin and there could be risks, especially for younger people.Instead, the panel voted 18-0 in favor of an emergency-use authorization -- a more limited clearance than a full approval -- for people 65 and older or individuals at high risk of severe Covid-19.The move is a setback to a sweeping plan from the Biden administration to roll out booster shots to a broad population next week. But it will still allow US health officials to target third doses at people at highest risk of getting seriously ill or dying from Covid-19.The FDA will still need to grant a final clearance. And an outside advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will also make detailed recommendations for the use of the booster shot at a meeting next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-approves-pfizer-covid-boosters-for-over-65s-high-risk-people-101631910710410.html

Huge crowds were there clamoring to get inside and on board one of the final evacuation flights out of the country."There were over 60 clear threat vectors that we were dealing with at this time," McKenzie said.US officials believed that the car had been loaded with explosives. The New York Times reported that it was filled with canisters of water.McKenzie said that no civilians had been spotted in the area at the time the strike was authorized.'Completely harmless'One of those killed was an Afghan man who worked for a US aid group, Ezmarai Ahmadi."We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan," said Austin.He said Ahmadi's activities that day were "completely harmless," and that the man was "just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed."Ahmadi's brother Aimal told AFP that the car had been filled with children pretending that the parking routine was an adventure."The rocket came and hit the car full of kids inside our house," he said."It killed all of them.""My brother and his four children were killed. I lost my small daughter... nephews and nieces," he said disconsolately.AFP was unable to independently verify Aimal's account."On behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense, I offer my deepest condolences to surviving family members of those who were killed, including Mr. Ahmadi, and to the staff of Nutrition and Education International, Mr. Ahmadi's employer," Austin said.More than 71,000 Afghan and Pakistani civilians have died directly from the war launched by the United States after the September 11, 2001 attacks, with casualties rising dramatically after then president Donald Trump relaxed rules of engagement in 2017, according to a Brown University study in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tragic-mistake-us-admits-kabul-airstrikes-did-not-kill-is-terrorists-101631906893610.html
18-09-2021||India||‘Humiliated’, says Captain as he resigns as Punjab CM||Chandigarh Punjab’s chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh became the fifth chief minister (across four states) to be pushed to resign, although experts said the Congress’ decision could end up hurting its prospects in elections early next year. With under five months to go for the state elections, Singh resigned on Saturday after the Congress summoned a meeting of its lawmakers in the state , saying that he feels “humiliated”, but adding that he won’t accept newly appointed party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu as the next CM or the party’s face in the coming polls. Analysts said the infighting could work to the advantage of the Aam Aadmi Party, widely seen as the strongest contender in the state at this point in time. The two-time chief minister submitted his resignation along with those of his council of ministers to Governor Banwarilal Purohit at the Raj Bhawan barely minutes before a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), widely seen as having been called to remove him from the CM’s post. The meeting was announced by the Congress high command late on Friday, and it appeared to catch Singh, who is the leader of the CLP, unawares.The development came amid a power tussle that divided the ruling party in the state, with Singh and Sidhu at loggerheads. Sidhu was made the state Congress chief earlier this year despite opposition by Singh. Sidhu and several Congress lawmakers in the state have targeted Singh for not fulfilling promises made in the 2017 manifesto, being soft on the Badals of the Akali Dal , and an over-reliance on a small group of bureaucrats. “I feel humiliated...this is the third time they (Congress high command) have called the MLAs. Apparently, they do not have confidence in me and didn’t think I could handle my job. But I felt humiliated at the manner in which they handled the whole affair,” Singh told reporters outside the Punjab Raj Bhawan after submitting his resignation, attributing his decision to the stance of the Congress leadership over the past two months.Singh said he spoke to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the morning and told her about his decision to quit. “I have resigned and the (Congress) leadership can now make anyone it trusts the chief minister,” he said. However, there was no decision on his successor till late on Saturday. CLP passed a resolution authorising party chief Sonia Gandhi to take a decision in the matter. The names of Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, his predecessor Sunil Jakhar and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa were doing the rounds as possible contenders for the post. Singh’s resignation came following a long-drawn tussle with newly appointed Punjab Congress president Sidhu, four cabinet ministers and several MLAs. It also comes amidst fears that anti-incumbency arising from his style of functioning could hurt the party’s chances in he coming polls. The BJP effected changes in Uttarakhand and Gujarat recently citing similar concerns. While the process wasn’t entirely smooth -- especially in Gujarat, where the entire cabinet was dropped -- the party still managed to avoid making the changes the kind of public spectacle that has played out in Punjab over the past few months. Asked about his future course of action, Singh said he would decide this in consultation with his supporters. “I have been in politics for 52 years. I am going to be here. In politics, there are always options. I will use that option when the time comes… At the moment, I am still in the Congress,” he said. He was accompanied by his wife, Patiala MP Preneet Kaur, and son Raninder Singh. Lok Sabha MPs Gurjit Singh Aujla and Ravneet Singh Bittu were also present. Before going to the Raj Bhawan, Singh was a huddle with at least a dozen ministers, MLAs and MPs, according to people aware of the development. He insisted that the MLAs attend the CLP meeting later. In another interaction with the media, the Congress leader said he won’t accept Sidhu as the Punjab chief minister, describing him as “a total disaster”. The man who could not handle one ministry, can never run entire Punjab, he said. If Sidhu is made the face of the Congress for the Punjab polls, Singh said he will oppose him “tooth and nail”. He also added that Sidhu’s close association with Pakistan PM Imran Khan could end up compromising India’s national security. Punjab shares an international border with Pakistan. Singh’s exit leaves the electoral battle in Punjab interestingly poised. The Shiromani Akali Dal has still not shrugged off the fall out of the sacrilege and police firing case, and its alliance with the BJP at the time the controversial farm laws that have spared a protest by farmers that is now into its eleventh month. Between June and October 2015, three incidents of sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib took place in Faridkot district, sparking protests across the state. On October 14, 2015, two protesters were killed in police firing in Behbal Kalan. The same day, police also opened fire on protesters in Kotkpaura. Amarinder had promised strict action against those responsible for sacrilege and police firing. On April 9 this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the investigation carried out by the state police’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the Kotkapura police firing case. The state government has constituted a new SIT in accordance with the court order. The obvious beneficiary of the fallout of these cases, analysts said, could be the Aam Aadmi Party. A Congress leader, asking not to be named, said that Singh should have sent his resignation to the party president instead of giving it to the Governor in keeping with his long association with the Gandhi family and the party.The CLP meeting was attended by 78 out of the 80 Congress MLAs. Besides Singh, Vidhan Sabha speaker Raja Kanwarpal Singh did not join the meeting because of his constitutional obligation. The resolution was passed in the presence of two central observers, general secretary Ajay Maken and revenue minister in Rajasthan, Harish Chaudhary. Harish Rawat, in charge of Congress affairs in Punjab, said that all the MLAs passed the one-line resolution requesting Sonia Gandhi to decide the name of the next chief minister. The resolution was moved by Brahm Mohindra and seconded by the party’s Dalit MLA from Amritsar West, Raj Kumar Verka, the Congress’s working president and Urmur MLA Sangat Singh Gilzian and four-time MLA from Samrala, Amrik Singh Dhillon.Rawat said a copy of the resolution has been sent through email to Sonia Gandhi and the decision in this regard is expected soon.The CLP also passed a resolution hailing Singh’s tenure as the chief minister. The resolution in this regard was moved by Maken and was seconded by rural development and panchayati raj minister Tript Bajwa, who was among the first ones to revolt against Singh . “The party praised Amarinder for his tenure of as the chief minister. He tried to his best to serve the state under tough conditions the state was facing when he took over. He provided solutions to the problems the state was facing,” said Rawat. Maken said he hoped that Singh will continue to guide the Punjab Congress, being the most senior leader of the party.Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal said Amarinder Singh’s resignation is an admission by the Congress that it failed to perform in the state and has nothing to show for its tenure of over four-and-a-half years.“The Congress party cannot hope to save its incompetent government and befool Punjabis with a mere change of face,” he said, and alleged that the entire state cabinet was steeped in corruption.The BJP also termed Singh’s resignation a “failure” of the Congress in the state, and accused the ruling party of protecting “mafia raj”.BJP national general secretary Tarun Ghugh said, “The entire Punjab cabinet failed. The chief minister failed. Congress has failed in Punjab.”“Replacing the Congress chief minister is a panic reaction of the Congress high command to salvage the party’s situation after it failed to deliver in the past four-and-a-half years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/humiliated-says-captain-as-he-resigns-as-punjab-cm-101631989414897.html

May God grant peace to the departed souls and give strength to the bereaved families to bear the loss,” Soren said in a tweet.Commissioner, Palamu Range, Jatashankar Choudhary said the incident occured during immersion of the ‘Karam dali’ and the bodies of the girls, who drowned while trying to save each other, were sent to the Latehar district hospital.As soon as the news about the tragedy spread, the festivities gave way to mourning, and wails of distraught family members could be heard at many homes outside which sullen crowds collected.According to officials, a group of 10 girls from the village had gone to the pond with ‘Karam Dali’ for immersion when two of them started drowning and shouted for help. In an effort to save each other, seven of them drowned in the deep pond while three other girls are undergoing treatment.Officials said after hearing their desperate cries, villagers rushed to their rescue.“Four girls died on the spot while three others breathed their last on way to Balumath CHC,” they said. District officials also rushed to the scene.Those dead included three sisters - Rekha Kumar (18), Reena Kumari (16) and Lakshmi Kumari (12), daughters of Aklu Ganjhu.The others were identified as - Sushma Kumari (12) daughter of Charan Ganjhu, Pinky Kumari (18) daughter of Jagan Ganjhu, Sunita Kumari (20) daugher of Fifa Ganjhu, Basanti Kumari (12) daughter of Laldeo Ganjhu and Suraj (10) son of Yashwant Vishwakarma.Meanwhile, agitated villagers in Bukru blocked the Balumath-Chatra Road-National Highway 98, alleging that the incident occured due to widening of the pond for excavation.The blockade could only be lifted late in the evening after a senior official assured them of a compensation of ₹4 lakh each for the families of the seven girls.Karma is a major festival in Jharkhand related to worship of mother nature and is celebrated with great enthusiasm, mostly by tribals||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-including-7-children-drown-in-jharkhand-district-101631988875692.html
18-09-2021||India||‘Wait and watch’: TMC says more leaders to join after Babul Supriyo’s entry||Former Union minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Babul Supriyo, who announced his retirement from “politics” only two months before, joined Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Saturday, saying that he got a “huge opportunity” in the West Bengal’s ruling dispensation.Following his entry, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh and the party’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said that the shift is only the beginning of a pattern and that more such moves are in the pipeline.“Many BJP leaders are in communication with [the] TMC leadership. They are not satisfied with the BJP. Babul Supriyo joined today, another wants to join tomorrow,” Ghosh told news agency ANI, adding that the process will continue.“Wait and watch,” he said.Kunal further stated that the BJP is only a “gas balloon” with no ideologies and that no one can withstand their “anti-people policies” – which is why people are bidding adieu.Echoing Kunal’s views, TMC Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said that significant leaders from various political parties are set to join the TMC. Commenting on Supriyo’s entry, he noted that it’s a “welcome move” as he is a well-known face not only in West Bengal but also outside the state.Also Read | Babul Supriyo's security cover scaled down to Y-categoryEarlier in the day, Supriyo said that his decision to make the move took place in the last four days “to be exact.” The former Union minister of state for environment, who is a sitting MP from Asansol town, said that he spoke to TMC leader Derek O’Brien regarding his daughter’s school and later to TMC supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek.“Huge trust and faith were entrusted upon me. I will resign from the MP’s post from Asansol. I will play by the rule book. I will meet Didi (Banerjee) on Monday. I didn’t expect this development. It was an unexpected opportunity,” Supriyo told Hindustan Times.Tensions first arose pertaining to Supriyo’s stand in the BJP leadership after he took to Facebook in July to write a post related to him being “asked” to resign following the Union cabinet reshuffle – where Supriyo saw himself as no longer the minister. Although the former BJP leader had later clarified any controversy regarding his choice of word, BJP’s West Bengal president Dilip Ghosh took a jibe at the singer-turned-politician.“That is how a party functions; you need to have faith in the due process. If he were to be fired instead, would that have made things any better?” Ghosh said, adding that none of the 12 ministers who resigned made such comments about the saffron party.Meanwhile, TMC turncoat and West Bengal’s Leader of Opposition from the BJP, Suvendu Adhikari said that Supriyo should have informed the state opposition party before deciding to depart. Hailing Supriyo as his “good friend,” Adhikari said that the former’s exit is “not a loss for BJP.”Babul Supriyo should have told BJP before leaving the party. His exit is not a loss for BJP. He is not a mass leader & not a good political organizer. However, personally, he is my good friend: West Bengal LoP Suvendu Adhikari on former BJP leader Babul Supriyo joining TMC pic.twitter.com/OSyZs7Oj8s“He is not a mass leader and not a good political organiser. However, personally, he is my good friend,” Adhikari, who himself left TMC after more than two decades being its member, told ANI.Supriyo’s entry to TMC remains a shock since he showed his support for BJP’s Bhabanipur bypoll candidate Priyanka Tibrewal only a few weeks before and was also picked up as the saffron party’s top 20 start campaigners for the upcoming polls. Moreover, after the TMC registered a landslide victory in the West Bengal Assembly elections this year, Supriyo had taken to Facebook to unleash a rant on the people of the state for their voting choice – even saying that the citizens made a “historic mistake” by not giving the BJP a chance and bringing back “the cruel lady (Mamata Banerjee) to power.”However, he deleted the post later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wait-and-watch-tmc-says-more-leaders-to-join-after-babul-supriyo-s-entry-101631988000714.html
18-09-2021||India||Babul Supriyo joins TMC, says will resign as Asansol MP||Former Union minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Babul Supriyo, who was dropped from the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government’s Cabinet in July, joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Kolkata on Saturday.The 50-year-old joined West Bengal’s ruling party in the presence of TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and MP Derek O’Brien. “Today, in the presence of National General Secretary @abhishekaitc and RS MP @derekobrienmp, former Union Minister and sitting MP @SuPriyoBabul joined the Trinamool family. We take this opportunity to extend a very warm welcome to him!” the TMC tweeted. Weeks after he was dropped from the Union cabinet, the playback singer-turned-politician said he was quitting politics and will soon resign from the Lok Sabha. However, he went back on his decision after a meeting with BJP president JP Nadda and said he would continue to work as a parliamentarian.“I meant it from my heart when I said I will leave politics. However, I felt there was a huge opportunity that was entrusted upon me. All my friends said my decision to leave politics was wrong and emotional. I am very proud that I am changing my decision. I am coming back for a great opportunity to serve Bengal. I am very excited. I will meet Didi (chief minister Mamata Banerjee) on Monday. I am overwhelmed by the warm welcome,” he said.The former Union minister of state for environment said he will resign as the Asansol MP. “Didi and Abhishek have given me a great opportunity. As I have joined the TMC, there is no point in holding on to my seat in Asansol. I have come into politics because of Asansol. I will do for that constituency as much as possible,” he added.Supriyo is the fifth leader to switch from the BJP to the TMC after the Mamata Banerjee-led party won the state elections in May. Three days ago, TMC’s Arpita Ghosh resigned as a Rajya Sabha MP, leaving the post vacant. She was named as the party’s state general secretary. TMC MP Saugata Roy said Supriyo’s exit showed that BJP was losing ground in the state. “The BJP has no future. Already, a few BJP legislators have joined the TMC. More are willing to join. This much I can say that the house of JP Nadda has started to crumble and except for Dilip Ghosh, none would be left in the BJP,” he said. The BJP, which had listed Supriyo as one of its star campaigners for the upcoming Bhabanipur bypoll, downplayed his exit.“He joined the BJP with a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha elections and was given a ministerial berth after winning. Now that his ministerial berth is gone he is joining the TMC despite the fact he had said he is leaving politics and won’t join any party. This could be a blow to his credibility,” said senior BJP leader Rahul Sinha.Reacting to the development, Congress’s Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said: “There are professional stars who joined BJP to gain something. He was made the minister. Later when he was dropped he joined the TMC. Mamata is always ready to accept such leaders.”Political analysts said that while Supriyo’s exit may not hurt the BJP on the ground, it might lead to the party losing the perception battle in the state. “I don’t think it would be a big organisational blow to the BJP as Supriyo was not given any key portfolio. But this definitely would be a blow to the party as far as public perception is concerned. With one after another leader quitting, a message is going out that not only has the BJP lost the assembly polls, it may not continue to remain as a strong opposition,” said Biswanath Chakraborty, political commentator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babul-supriyo-joins-tmc-says-will-resign-as-asansol-mp-101631987316880.html

A detailed order is expected to be issued by the administration later. “Casinos can open from Monday at 50 per cent capacity,” Sawant said.The decision follows a recommendation by the State Expert Committee consisting of doctors and experts in the field, who said that it would be safe to reopen casinos and other closed spaces with a limited capacity and with strict protocols being followed. “The economy needs to be revived, it should start. It is not just the casino industry, but the hotel industry too. Tourism related activities need to start,” Sawant said. Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister while interacting with state leaders and healthcare workers called for resumption in tourism activity now that the state has given the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to more than 11.66 lakh people for a population of 15.5 lakh. The Chief Minister also announced that 42% of the state is fully vaccinated with both doses and that the target has been set for completing the second dose for most of the population. “Our target of vaccinating 11.66 lakh people with the first dose has been completed.

Bringing water from 115 countries is an excellent work. I hope water from remaining 77 countries would also be procured by the time construction of the temple is completed. We will do 'Jalabhishek' of our Ram Lala from that water." He further said that construction of Ram Temple is a moment of pride for everybody."Indian culture is very rich and there is no discrimination on the basis of cast, creed and religion in India," he asserted.Addressing the gathering, Rai said procuring water from across the world it is a historic moment. "In Ayodhya, there is a place called 'Saptasagar'. It is believed that water from all oceans of the world was brought during the coronation of Lord Ram in Treta Yuga. And now when his temple is being made at his birth place, water from all the oceans of the world has again been brought. It is a sentimental issue for me," he said.Rai also said that the first phase of the foundation of the Ram Temple has been completed. Jolly said that during the Covid pandemic, when people could not step out of their homes, his organisation procured water from 115 nations across the world. “Not just Hindus but also Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jews and Buddhists of the world have contributed to this noble cause. People from all religions in different countries helped us in procuring water from their counties," he said, adding the water has been put in 115 small pots mentioning their respective countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-says-water-from-115-countries-to-be-offered-at-ayodhya-101631981794122.html

While tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, nausea are some of the common side effects after vaccination, some symptoms, in rare cases, can be a cause of concern.Common side effects may affect the ability to do common activities but they disappear after few days. However, some side effects can be life-threatening such as blood clots, as was reported in few cases after administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Cases of cardiac myocarditis have also been reported among adolescent boys who were administered with mRNA technology-based Pfizer vaccine. But the vaccine is yet to be approved for use in India.On Saturday, the ministry of information and broadcasting shared a graphic on social media, suggesting people immediately consult a doctor if those symptoms occur within 20 days of administration of any vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Here’s the list of symptoms within 20 days of vaccination that may require immediate attention:Meanwhile, India has reached the milestone of administering 80 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines, a day after it achieved the extraordinary feat of administering over 2.5 crore shots in a single day. The government noted that the single-day vaccination numbers were around equal to the entire population of Australia, two-thirds the population of Canada, and five times the entire population of New Zealand.Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded everyone involved in the remarkable feat, saying “every Indian would be proud of today’s record vaccination numbers.”“Countless individuals and organisations have immersed themselves in some or the other noble deed of community service today. I salute them for their noteworthy efforts. There is nothing better than giving back to society and helping others,” PM Modi tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-symptoms-need-immediate-attention-if-occurring-within-20-days-of-vaccination-101631982967400.html

Addressing the inaugural session, Nadda said that the BJP is working to realise the dreams of BR Ambedkar who advocated for equal rights for poor and marginalised sections of society.The BJP chief said the party is committed to ensuring social justice and is moving forward with the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’ so that the benefits of development reach all sections of society. He accused other political parties of using caste-related issues for vote bank politics, saying the benefits of development never reached the marginalised communities.“I want to draw your attention to the issue of the caste divide that resulted in society's downfall. It was the biggest impediment to India's development,” he said, adding that the major reason behind BJP emergence as the “largest political party” in the world was that it never accepted caste politics.Nadda was earlier scheduled to visit Varanasi for the two-day event but, as he told the party workers virtually, he had to cancel it for “some reason”. Lamenting the cancellation of the visit, the BJP chief said that he wanted to connect with the members of BJP SC Morcha in person and analyse the programmes run by them in detail.The wing’s national president Lal Singh Arya was present in Varanasi along with several officer bearers for the meeting. HT had earlier reported that the BJP national general secretary Dushyant Kumar Gautam, national and regional office bearers of the party’s SC wing, several party MPs and MLAs will offer prayers at Sant Ravidas Temple in Varanasi on Sunday.

18-09-2021||India||Domestic flight fare band applicable for 15 days a month: Here is what it means||The ministry of civil aviation has increased the passenger capacity from 72.5 per cent to 85 per cent in a breather to the airlines as the Covid situation in the country is improving. At the same time, the ministry has tweaked the fare band rule by making it applicable for only 15 days in a month which, in effect, may increase the price of flight tickets.The ministry explained that if the current date is September 20, then the fare band will be applicable till October 4. So if you are booking a flight on September 20 for a date beyond October 4, then the fare band will not remain applicable. Similarly, if the booking is done on September 21, then the fare band will remain applicable only for 15 days that is till October 5. What is the domestic price fare band?The civil aviation ministry had fixed the upper and lower limit of airfares in 2020, when domestic flights resumed operation in a limited and staggered way after being suspended during the national lockdown. The aim of the exercise was to boost air traffic as aviation was one of the worst-affected sectors by the pandemic-induced lockdown. Recently, the ministry has revised the caps and increased both the upper and the lower limit. The new directive says that this cap will remain applicable only if the tickets are being booked 15 days in advance.How will it affect airfares?Emergency air travel will continue to be subsidised as the cap will be applicable to tickets being booked in 15 days advance. But if tickets are booked before a month, which is mostly the case for planned trips, there will be no price cap, which means, the airlines are free to fix their own fare chart.This year, air fares have been hiked four times already and according to the present fare band, a flight under 40 minutes can cost a minimum of ₹2,900 and a maximum of ₹8,800. The highest duration flights of 180 to 210 minutes can cost a minimum of ₹9,800 and a maximum of 27,200. These caps will remain applicable when the ticket is booked only 15 days in advance. In May 2020, the government cut down the capacity of domestic airlines t0 33% to reduce the risk of the spread of Covid. Gradually, the capacity was increased to 45% and so on to finally reach 85 per cent now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-flight-fare-band-applicable-for-15-days-a-month-here-is-what-it-means-101631977988074.html

For more than three months, the state remained the pandemic capital of the country reporting around 70 per cent of the total cases registered. The second wave of infections deteriorated after the Onam festival in August- end. Though the state reported a high number of cases for more than three months there was no health crisis or shortage of oxygen.

18-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Sept 19, 2016 — 17 soldiers killed in Kashmir, PM Modi vows action||Srinagar/New Delhi- Heavily armed militants attacked an army base in north Kashmir early Sunday (September 18) and killed 17 soldiers, triggering calls for a swift retaliation that could squeeze the space for any détente between India and Pakistan. The dawn raid surprised soldiers in their sleep as attackers lobbed grenades and set fire to tents and shelters. The blaze killed 12 troopers and the rest died in the gunfight, sources added. TV images showed helicopters flying to evacuate the wounded and smoke billowing from the mountainous base at Uri, which houses about 12,000 troops. Soldiers killed four “fidayeen” — or commando-style gunmen willing to fight to death — after an hours-long gunbattle to end what was the worst single attack on the army in years. More than 20 soldiers were wounded, some of them seriously. The attack jeopardised hopes of peace returning quickly to Kashmir which has been rocked by two months of violent protests in which 86 people have been killed and thousands injured. Sources said the raid was part of a fresh wave of infiltration by militants from across the Line of Control, the heavily militarised de-facto border with Pakistan. CALL FOR RETALIATION A top army official said the attack pointed to the involvement of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, which was also blamed by India for the Pathankot airbase attack in January. Islamabad denied any involvement. Sunday’s attack led to calls for an aggressive response, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowing to punish those behind the “cowardly” and “despicable” attack. No one has so far claimed responsibility but home minister Rajnath Singh hit out at Pakistan, calling it a terrorist state that needed to be “identified and isolated”. MADE-IN-PAKISTAN Lt Gen Ranbir Singh, director general of military operations, said the militants could be from the JeM as some of the equipment recovered from them had Pakistan markings. He said four AK-47rifles, four under barrel grenade launchers and ammunition were found on the dead militants. Islamabad rejected the charge with the foreign office saying that New Delhi always blamed Pakistan for such incidents even before completing a probe. The attack is likely to further roil Kashmir that army sources say has seen scores of infiltration attempts since protests broke out against insurgent leader Burhan Wani’s killing in July. The Uri attack came within hours of the Uttarakhand police chief revealing that the Centre had sent out an alert for possible terrorist strike on defence installations in North India. Defence minister Manohar Parrikar visited Srinagar for a meeting with top army commanders and home minister Rajnath Singh cancelled scheduled trips to Russia and the United States. Army chief Dalbir Singh and northern command head DS Hooda also rushed to Uri. Home secretary Rajiv Mehrishi will visit Srinagar on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-sept-19-2016-17-soldiers-killed-in-kashmir-pm-modi-vows-action-101631974294411.html
18-09-2021||India||Who will succeed Amarinder Singh? Cong resolution at CLP meeting authorises Sonia Gandhi||Hours after Captain Amarinder Singh resigned as chief minister of Punjab, the Congress passed a resolution at the legislature party meeting authorising party chief Sonia Gandhi to choose as successor. The CLP meeting was called by the party high command and held at Punjab Congress Bhavan in Chandigarh.Watch: Amarinder quits as Punjab CM as Gandhis favour SidhuHarish Rawat, the in-charge of Congress affairs in Punjab, said that all the MLAs passed the one-line resolution requesting Gandhi to decide name for next chief minister. The resolution was moved by Brahm Mohindra and seconded by the party's Dalit MLA from Amritsar, Raj Kumar Verka.Rawat said that the resolution has been sent through email to Sonia Gandhi. He, along with fellow party leader Ajay Maken, reached Chandigarh from Delhi on Saturday morning for the CLP meeting convened at the insistence of a group of party leaders close to Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was recently appointed the chief of Congress' Punjab unit.Former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar and cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa are the frontrunners in race to replace Amarinder Singh.Meanwhile, Congress leader Ajay Maken said he hopes Amarinder Singh will continue to guide the Punjab Congress being the seniormost leader of the party. As observer, he moved a resolution praising the leadership of Amarinder Singh. Party MLA Tript Bajwa seconded it.Seventy eight of Congress' 80 MLAs attended the CLP meet. Four rebels of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), who had recently joined the Congress, were also present in the Congress Bhavan in Chandigarh but did not attend the CLP meeting.Amarinder Singh was the only MLA to skip the meeting. He met governor Banwarilal Purohit hours before the CLP meeting and submitted his resignation amid a political tussle with Sidhu. Later, addressing a press conference at the gate of Raj Bhavan, Singh said that he "felt humiliated" that his leadership was questioned and had informed Sonia Gandhi about his decision. The 79-year-old later told news agency ANI that Sonia Gandhi told him ‘I am sorry Amarinder’.Also Read| How Amarinder Singh's resignation as Punjab CM unfolded: A timelineOn being humiliated, Singh was referring to being summoned thrice by the central leadership in the past two months.Within minutes of Singh's resignation, his chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar and political secretary Captain Sandeep Sandhu also resigned from their respective posts.

18-09-2021||India||Sunil Jakhar among frontrunners to be the next Punjab CM after Amarinder Singh's exit||The name of Sunil Jakhar was doing the rounds as Congress's top choice for the next chief minister of Punjab as Captain Amarinder Singh stepped down from the post on Saturday after facing internal strife for months. The Congress Legislature Party has requested Sonia Gandhi to decide the name for the next CM. Apart from Sunil Jakhar, the name of Pratap Bajwa is also being speculated. Captain Amarinder Singh's bete noire Navojot Sidhu is also eyeing the post. The speculation over Sunil Jakhar started because of a specific tweet that he posted hours before Captain Amarinder Singh resigned. Praising Rahul Gandhi for adopting ‘Alexandrian solution’ to the 'Punjabi version of Gordian knot', Sunil Jakhar wrote, "Surprisingly, this bold leadership decision to resolve Punjab Congress imbroglio has not only enthralled Congress workers but has sent shudders down the spines of Akalis'. The reference in his tweet was that of Alexander the Great slicing a knot in half after struggling to find out how the knot can be opened. Kudos to Sh @RahulGandhi for adopting Alexandrian solution to this punjabi version of Gordian knot. Surprisingly, this bold leadership decision to resolve Punjab Congress imbroglio has not only enthralled congress workers but has sent shudders down the spines of Akalis.As Amarinder Singh met the governor and resigned, he told media persons that the decision was taken in the morning. Sunil Jakhar's tweet came around noon, indicating that the decision might have already been made.Sunil Jakhar was the president of the Punjab Congress before the post went to Navjot Singh Sidhu in July this year. When the tussle between Amarinder Singh and Sidhu reached its peak, Jakhar met the district presidents to find a solution to the unending crisis. Even after Sidhu was made the president of the state unit, the crisis did not end and, finally, Amarinder Singh resigned on Saturday. He said the reason behind his resignation was the humiliation he felt, though he will continue to remain in the Congress, as of now.67-year-old Sunil Jakhar is considered as Congress's first choice as reports claim that now the party wants a Sikh (Sidhu) and non-Sikh combination for Punjab. Jakhar was a Lok Sabha MP between 2017 and 2019 representing Gurdaspur, after Vinod Khanna's death. But at present, he is not an MLA.As the Sidhu-Captain crisis was going on Sunil Jakhar commended that this internal strife was hampering the "vital process" of taking the state government's "landmark achievements" to people. "Due to lack of coordination in the party, we are unable to take these achievements amongst the public,” Sunil Jakhar said at a gathering at his native village Panjkosi early this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunil-jakhar-among-frontrunners-to-be-the-next-punjab-cm-after-amarinder-singh-s-exit-101631962725969.html
18-09-2021||India||Ahead of festival season, states told to monitor Covid trajectory on daily basis||Ahead of the upcoming festival season in India, the Centre on Saturday instructed states and Union Territories (UTs) to ensure all necessary precautions and effective enforcement for the rule to avoid mass gatherings, especially in congested and closed spaces due to the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.In a high-level meeting chaired by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba on Saturday, and attended by officials of states and UTs, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, NITI Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul and others, states and UTs were told that existing guidelines for malls, local markets and places of worship have to be strictly adhered to, according to a statement issued by the Union health ministry.“States were urged to undertake effective Information, Education and Communication for promotion of Covid Appropriate Behaviour and Covid safe festivities. They were advised to closely monitor the case trajectories in all districts on a daily basis to identify early warning signals and ensure the imposition of restrictions and adherence to CAB,” the statement added.Amid concerns about a possible third wave of the pandemic, health experts have voiced concerns about public celebrations and gatherings during festivals, saying they can become super-spreader events. The Centre, on many occasions, has appealed to citizens to abide by Covid-19 norms, celebrate festivals within their families and shop at markets carefully without overcrowding.Dr Balram Bhargav, the director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said on Thursday, “Festivals are on the anvil and sudden increase in population density creates a very conducive environment for viral spread.” Addressing the health ministry’s briefing on the Covid-19 situation, Dr Bhargav warned that if there is a sudden rise in population density anywhere, it becomes very easy for the virus to spread. “The call of the hour is vaccine acceptance, maintenance of Covid-appropriate behaviour, responsible travel and responsible festivity,” he added.Meanwhile, during Saturday’s high-level meeting with states and UTs, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba also referred to examples from other countries which saw multiple peaks and expressed concerns over certain pockets in India reporting high Covid-19 test positivity. He advised state health administrators to undertake a granular analysis of their virus trajectory, ramp up health infrastructure, undertake the stock of essential medicines and augment human resources at the earliest, to meet any potential spike in infections.For a third consecutive day, India’s daily Covid-19 tally remained above the 30,000-mark as 35,662 new cases were reported on Saturday, taking the caseload to 33,417,390. Saturday’s infection count is 3.5% more than that of Friday’s when 34,403 were detected Covid-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-festival-season-states-told-to-monitor-covid-trajectory-on-daily-basis-101631965714032.html
18-09-2021||India||How Amarinder Singh resignation as Punjab CM unfolded: A timeline||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday announced his resignation after months of a political tussle with his bete noire Navjot Singh Sidhu. Congress returned to power in Punjab in 2017 with a brute majority but soon witnessed infighting in the state unit. In 2019, Sidhu, who was brought into the Congress fold by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, resigned from Captain's Cabinet after months of squabbling. Singh had objected to Sidhu's decision to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. He publicly criticised Sidhu for his controversial hug with Pakistan army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa.But after the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashed the report submitted by a special investigation team (SIT) on the Kotkapura firing case, the rebellion came out in open.Also Read | Amarinder Singh on next Punjab CM: ''Whoever they have faith in' The High Court judgment was a huge setback for the Singh-led Congress government and then state party chief Sunil Jakhar and cabinet minister Sukhjinder Randhawa even offered their resignation over the issue. Sidhu, who was already vocal against Captain, got support from more MLAs within the party, prompting Congress president Sonia Gandhi to constitute a committee to look into the squabbling. The committee was headed by the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge.The committee submitted a report on the issue and recommended keeping Singh in command but accommodate Sidhu by giving him a role in the state unit and reorganise the party structure. In July 2021, Congress appointed Sidhu as chief of the Punjab unit even as Captain resisted his elevation for the top post. Sangat Singh Gilzian, Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Pawan Goel and Kuljit Singh Nagra were appointed as the working presidents, paving the way for a significant revamp in the organisational structure.Also Read | ‘I felt humiliated’: Amarinder Singh resigns as Punjab chief ministerBut the overhaul failed to address the factionalism in Punjab Congress as Sidhu kept targeting the chief minister over various issues. The rift in the party kept getting wider as Singh, in his own words, felt humiliated by the way talks transpired over the months. He was unhappy with Congress summoning MLAs twice in the past two months and convening the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting in Chandigarh."I was humiliated three times by the Congress leadership in the past two months…they called the MLAs to Delhi twice and now convened CLP here in Chandigarh today,” said Captain Amarinder said at a press conference after submitting the resignation to the governor on Saturday.“I spoke with the Congress president this morning, told them that I will be resigning today,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-amarinder-singh-resignation-as-punjab-cm-unfolded-a-timeline-101631965854297.html

During his interaction via video conferencing, PM Modi said the Centre did not mention the tourism sector matter initially because “politics would have started on this as well". “But it was very important that our tourism destinations reopen. Himachal Pradesh, Goa are some examples of the same. Everyone eligible has received their first dose already. We are now working on Uttarakhand to achieve the same,” he added.The Prime Minister further said that he hopes the “aggressive Covid-19 vaccination drive” in Goa will revive tourism in the state of “serene beaches".

The resignation comes less than five months before the Assembly elections in Punjab, and less than an hour before a legislature party (CLP) meeting called by the Congress party.The resignation was announced by the senior Congress leader's son Raninder Singh on Twitter.My father submitting his resignation to HE the Governor Sahib of Punjab. pic.twitter.com/RyINJSUeh5Addressing a press conference at the gate of the Raj Bhavan, the 79-year-old Amarinder Singh said he felt humiliated. “I called up Congress president (Sonia Gandhi) this morning and told her that I am going to resign. The thing is, this is happening for the third time that MLAs are being called for a meeting, my leadership is being questioned,” he said.Also Read| 'Whoever they have faith in': What Amarinder Singh says on next Punjab CMSingh said there is no plans for now to quit the Congress party, “but future politics is always an option”. He said that the future course of action will be decided after discussions with his loyalists. Political analysts say the move would hurt the Congress in the upcoming state polls.Meanwhile, the meeting of the Congress legislators in the faction-ridden state unit began in Chandigarh as scheduled at 5pm.“CM @capt_amarinder has met Punjab governor and submitted his and his council of ministers’ resignation,” the CM’s media adviser Raveen Thukral tweeted on Saturday evening. Singh was accompanied by his wife, Patiala MP Preneet Kaur and son Raninder Singh. Lok Sabha MPs Gurjit Singh Aujla and Ravneet Singh Bittu were also present.Singh, who had declared the 2017 battle in which he led the Congress to a near two-thirds to be his last one, was raring to have another go. Sidhu, meanwhile, never cloaked his ambition and pictured himself as the natural claimant to the mantle of the chief minister if the party retains power in the polls next year.The cricketer-turned-politician was appointed the state president on July 18, ignoring the CM's opposition to his elevation.Infighting in Punjab CongressThe feud, fuelled by the competing ambitions of both Singh and Sidhu, left the state unit, particularly ministers and legislators, divided, making the party cadre becoming apprehensive about its impact on electoral prospects.To make matters worse, both the leaders indulged in one-upmanship, rarely letting go of any opportunity to pull each other down.The legal setback the Punjab government received in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case gave the Sidhu faction further ammo to target Singh.The role of Congress high commandThe Congress high command, particularly general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and former president Rahul Gandhi, backed Sidhu and named him the state chief, but not before a public spectacle played out live on TV by parading party leaders, including Singh, before a three-member central committee.Though the high command expected the situation to ameliorate, it did not get any better.Concerned, the Congress leadership hurriedly called a CLP meeting today on the insistence of Singh's detractors. The dissenting cabinet ministers and MLAs, who are close to Sidhu, had met Congress general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat last month to seek Singh's ouster and demanded a CLP meeting. Timeline of Singh-Sidhu bad bloodTussle for control of the party first broke out in 2019, when Sidhu resigned as a state minister after he was divested of the local bodies portfolio.He had switched sides from the BJP to the Congress before the 2017 state assembly elections.The bickering continued for months and eased somewhat after Sidhu was elevated as state unit chief overriding Singh's objections. But the fire was not completely doused and it resulted in today's resignation.Punjab goes to the polls early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-resigns-as-punjab-chief-minister-amid-tussle-with-navjot-sidhu-101631962905244.html

While four family members were dead in a room, a nine-month-old baby is suspected to have died of starvation, officials said. Police suspect the family members died by suicide. Byadrahalli police investigating the case said that the post-mortem of bodies will be conducted on Saturday morning. Suicide will be confirmed in the post-mortem, they added.Police identified the deceased as Bharathi (51), her daughters Sinchana (34) and Sindhurani (34), her son Madhusagar (25), and the baby girl. The bodies were found in a decomposed state and forensic experts have told police that the deaths could have occurred five days ago. Bharathi, the elderly lady, was found dead in the hall, while Sinchana and Sindhoorani were found dead in a room on the first floor along with the nine-month-old baby boy. The girl who survived was found in the room where Madhusagar was found dead. Police are yet to identify the motive behind the suicide. Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Sanjeev Patil said that police were not able to recover any death note from the house. According to the officer, the incident came to light when H Shankar, Bharathi’s husband returned after five days. “He called the police and when they broke open the door, they found out that there were five bodies inside the house and the baby was found alive. The bodies had started decomposing by the time they were found,” said Patil. Soumendu Mukharjee, Additional Commissioner of Police (West) said that the reason for the five deaths is yet to be ascertained. “Shankar, the man of the house is in a state of shock. He will be inquired as soon as he is fit,” he said. Police said that a family dispute could have been the reason behind the suicide. In the brief statement given to the police, Shankar said that one of his daughters had left her in-laws place to stay with him, which he wasn’t happy about. While the mother took her daughter’s side and asked them not to return, Shankar was not happy with this decision. Neighbours told police that there were constant arguments between Shankar and the family members in the house and on Sunday, following an argument over the same issue, Shankar had stormed out of the house. Since leaving the house he didn’t attend any calls by the family members, he said. The baby girl is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. “We have shifted the child to a private hospital since she was found in an unconscious state. We are still awaiting a report from the hospital. When she recovers, we will provide her counselling,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2yearold-baby-spends-5-days-in-house-with-dead-family-members-101631962294785.html
18-09-2021||India||Former Union minister Babul Supriyo joins TMC in Kolkata||In a major blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party, former Union minister Babul Supriyo joined the Trinamool Congress on Saturday in Kolkata. “Today, in the presence of National General Secretary @abhishekaitc and RS MP @derekobrienmp, former Union Minister and sitting MP @SuPriyoBabul joined the Trinamool family. We take this opportunity to extend a very warm welcome to him!” the TMC tweeted. “It all happened in the last four days to be exact. I spoke to Derek O’Brien regarding a matter related to my daughter’s school. Then from Didi (Mamata) and Abhishek, I got a huge opportunity. Huge trust and faith were entrusted upon me. I will resign from the MP’s post from Asansol. I will play by the rule book. I will meet Didi (Mamata Banerjee) on Monday. I didn’t expect this development. It was an unexpected opportunity,” said Supriyo while speaking to the media. On July 31, Supriyo had said that he was quitting politics and would soon resign from the Lok Sabha. The announcement had come weeks after the 50-year-old was dropped from the Narendra Modi-led Cabinet. In the same post, he also ruled out joining any other political party — TMC, Congress or the CPI(M). He, however, later edited the post to remove this part. “I had given seven years moving away from music. But then I felt that everything had come to a full stop. I was disillusioned. I had said from my heart that I was quitting politics. My friends told me that my decision to quit politics was emotional and wrong. There is no politics of revenge. I am happy that I am changing my decision and coming back,” Supriyo said while adding that the TMC would soon reveal what responsibilities would be given to him. Earlier, he decided not to resign from his MP’s post on the request of top BJP leaders. Recently, the BJP had named him as one of their 20 star campaigners against Mamata Banerjee in the upcoming Bhawanipore bye-elections. “On Saturday, he went to the south-Kolkata office of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee and joined the party,” said a senior TMC leader. Supriyo, a two-time MP from Asansol who was the Union minister of state for environment was dropped from the Cabinet in a major reshuffle on July 7. Earlier he had contested the West Bengal assembly elections but was defeated by heavyweight TMC leader and state minister Arup Biswas from Tollygunge. “He joined the BJP with a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha elections and was given a ministerial berth after winning. Now that his ministerial berth is gone he is joining the TMC despite the fact he had said in his post that he is leaving politics and won’t join any party. I don’t think this is transparency and reveals a good side. This could be a blow to his credibility,” said Rahul Sinha, senior BJP leader. It was on May 4, 2014 ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls that Narendra Modi during an election campaign rally at Asansol in West Bengal’s West Burdwan district had said: “I want Babul in Parliament”. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha said: “There are professional stars who joined BJP to gain something. He was made the minister. Later when he was dropped he joined the TMC. Mamata is always ready to accept such leaders.” This comes just three days after Trinamool Congress MP Arpita Ghosh resigned from the Rajya Sabha leaving the post vacant. “I don’t think it would be a big oranisational blow to the BJP as Supriyo was not given any such portfolio to strengthen the party. But this definitely would be a blow to the party as far as public perception is concerned. With one after another leader quitting the party, a message is going out that not only has the BJP lost the assembly polls, the party may not continue to remain a strong opposition,” said Biswanath Chakraborty, political commentator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-union-minister-babul-supriyo-joins-tmc-in-kolkata-101631960852880.html

Babul Supriyo was one of the staunch critics of Trinamool Supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and as he had announced his resignation from politics, he earlier maintained that he would not be joining any other political party. In the latest Cabinet reshuffle, Babul Supriyo was dropped from the Cabinet and within a few days, he announced his self-exile from politics. However, he did not officially resign as an MP from the BJP. Today, in the presence of National General Secretary @abhishekaitc and RS MP @derekobrienmp, former Union Minister and sitting MP @SuPriyoBabul joined the Trinamool family.We take this opportunity to extend a very warm welcome to him! pic.twitter.com/6OEeEz5OGjThere was no murmur about Babul Supriyo joining the Trinamool as reports said that the BJP kept the singer-turned-politician as a star campaigner for BJP's Bhabanipur by-poll candidate Priyanka Tibrewal. In fact, he tweeted in support of Tibrewal, who represented the former minister in several legal cases, Supriyo had tweeted.The Trinamool said this is just the beginning as many BJP leaders are in communication with TMC leadership. “They are not satisfied with BJP. One (Babul Supriyo) joined today, another wants to join tomorrow. This process will go on. Wait and watch,” Trinamool leader Kunal Ghosh said.The exit of a heavyweight former minister and popular singer just ahead of the Bhabanipur by-election in which Priyanka Tibrewal will be challenging Mamata Banerjee bolsters TMC's strength. The former banker and singer joined the BJP in 2014 and won from the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency. Between 2014 and 2021, he served as a minister of the state of several departments including urban development, housing, urban poverty alleviation, ministry of heavy industries, public enterprises, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change etc. His significance in the party in the state got whittled down because of Dilip Ghosh, while he lost his Cabinet post after he was defeated in the West Bengal assembly election.The former minister has remained thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, but in many of his social media posts, he revealed how infighting among the BJP in West Bengal wad demoralising the grassroots workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babul-supriyo-joins-trinamool-congress-101631957186388.html
18-09-2021||India||‘Why did they get fever?’ PM’s jab on opposition’s reaction to 2.5 cr vaccination milestone||Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a dig at the opposition Congress, asking a doctor during an online interaction whether he could explain why a political party began to have an ‘adverse reaction’ after the country achieved historic 2.5 crore vaccinations in a single day on the occasion of his 71st birthday on Friday. Dr Nitin Dhupdale, a doctor at the Goa Medical College and Hospital, was the first person chosen to interact with the prime minister during his interaction with doctors, health workers and other frontline workers on completion of 100% vaccination (of the first dose) in Goa. “I am not a doctor or a medical expert, but we have heard of adverse side effects or a fever. If there is a high fever, one loses mental balance, doctors say this. Every hundred vaccinations that are given one or two persons report vaccine side effects. Yesterday, we were able to administer 2.5 crore doses, possibly the highest in the world for a single day. But yesterday after midnight after the figure was announced, a political party started showing some adverse reactions? Is there a logic to this,” the Prime Minister asked. Dr Dhupdale responded with a brief chuckle but went on to explain how in Goa, people were explained what vaccine they were being administered, the possible side effects and were also given a helpline number to contact in case they experienced a reaction. “We have explained to people what vaccine was being given. We also gave them a helpline to call if they experience side effects,” Dr Dhupdale said. Goa is the second state after Himachal Pradesh to have ‘officially’ completed 100% vaccination of the first dose even though there are an estimated several thousand people yet to take their first dose. Speaking at the beginning of the interaction, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said that Goa had exceeded its vaccination targets and has achieved 102% of its original intended target of first dose vaccination. Our target of vaccinating 11.66 lakh people with the first dose has been completed. We have administered 102% of the initial target with the first dose. We have also completed vaccinating around 5-lakh people which is around 42% of our target with both doses,” Sawant said. “When you asked the nation to do a Tika Utsav, we took it forward and took it to each village. We did three editions of tika utsav going to each village and municipality. For the second dose too we had three editions, the third of which was launched yesterday on your birthday and is currently ongoing. We have done walk-in vaccination and on the spot vaccination, which is why we were able to achieve our target,” Sawant said. “In far off places, hesitancy was there. Through awareness, we were able to dispel it. We also had Tauktae cyclone, floods but our field and health workers helped us a lot and this is why this could be possible,” the chief minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-did-they-get-fever-pm-s-jab-on-opposition-s-reaction-to-2-5-cr-vaccination-milestone-101631953593565.html

The comment in party mouthpiece Saamana came in reference to political developments in Gujarat, where Bhupendra Patel was appointed chief minister, replacing Vijay Rupani.In fact, the entire Rupani cabinet was replaced with a fresh one in the major reshuffle handled by the BJP's central ledership."Modi is the real face of the BJP and everyone else is a torn mask. Without Modi, many of the present masks of the BJP will be defeated in the municipal elections. Being aware of this, he has started taking bold steps to prepare for 2024," Raut said in his article.He further said that since the time JP Nadda became BJP president, the party has been undergoing constant changes."It was through Nadda that the chief ministers of Uttarakhand and Karnataka were changed. The chief minister of Gujarat was also changed in a jiffy, in fact, the entire cabinet was reshuffled. The new chief minister of Gujarat Bhupendra Patel is a first-time MLA. Modi-Nadda have shown that nothing is impossible in politics. They have made all the ministers in Rupani's cabinet sit at home," Raut said in his editorial.The BJP has started 'repair work' through Nadda to overcome the defeat of the party in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Maharashtra, Raut claimed in the article.Last month, the Sena - once an ally of the BJP - said that the opposition parties will have to make ‘shrewd and clever’ moves if they want to defeat the BJP in 2024. In a Saamana editorial, it cited the poll results in West Bengal and Maharashtra as examples to stress to Modi-Shah combination can be defeated.The Sena also asked the opposition parties to win the trust of the people and project themselves as a viable alternative to the BJP.The suggestions were given after a virtual meeting of 19 opposition parties in which Congress president Sonia Gandhi called for systematic planning and rising above individual compulsions. This was meant to give a push to the opposition parties, which have never joined hands or started poll preparations so much in advance.The Shiv Sena pulled out of t BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) last year after issues over government formation in Maharashtra.The BJP won 282 seats in 2014 and 303 in 2019. Buoyed by the strong response of the electorate in the BJP's favour in 2019, party national secretary Sunil Deodhar claimed of winning 333 seats in the 2024 General Elections. However, after setbacks in Bengal and other states, the strategy will surely be revised to ensure the party stays on course to come to power for third consecutive time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-preparing-for-2024-elections-sanjay-raut-on-gujarat-developments-101631948774074.html
18-09-2021||India||I-T dept says Sonu Sood involved in ₹20 crore tax evasion; FCRA violation||After two days of raids on Bollywood actor and philanthropist Sonu Sood and premises linked to him, the Income Tax department said on Saturday that tax evasion worth ₹20 crore by Sood and his associates has been unearthed so far apart from Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) violations. The department had conducted a search and seizure operation at various premises of Sood in Mumbai as well as a Lucknow-based group real estate group. Total 28 premises in Mumbai, Lucknow, Kanpur, Jaipur, Delhi and Gurugram were searched over two days. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement that “during the course of search at the premises of the actor and his associates, incriminating evidence pertaining to tax evasion have been found.”It said the modus operandi followed by Sonu Sood was to route his unaccounted income in the form of bogus unsecured loans from many fake entities. “Investigations so far have revealed use of 20 such entries, the providers of which, on examination, have accepted on oath to have given bogus accommodation entries. They have accepted to have issued cheques in lieu of cash. There have been instances where professional receipts have been camouflaged as loans in the books of accounts for the purpose of evasion of tax. It has also been revealed that these bogus loans have been used for making investments and acquiring properties,” the CBDT said. It added that the total amount of tax evaded unearthed so far, amounts to more than ₹20 crore. Subsequently, the IT department has found foreign funds violations in actor’s Sood Charity Foundation, incorporated on July 21 last year when Covid-19 was at its peak and he was involved in a lot of relief work, particularly sending migrant workers to their homes. The CBDT said that the foundation has collected donations worth ₹18.94 crore from April 1, 2021, till date, out of which it has spent around ₹1.9 crore towards various relief work while the balance of ₹17 crore has been found lying unutilized in the bank account of the foundation. “It is seen that funds to the tune of ₹2.1 crore have also been raised by the charity foundation from overseas donors on a crowdfunding platform in violation of (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act) FCRA regulations,” the CBDT statement added.The I-T department had also conducted raids at various premises of the real estate firm, with whom Sood has entered into a joint venture real estate project and invested substantial funds. The raids, the CBDT statement said, have resulted in the unearthing of incriminating evidence pertaining to tax evasion and irregularities in the books of account. It said the company is involved in bogus billing of subcontracting expenses and siphoning off of funds. Evidence of such bogus contracts worth ₹65 crore has been found so far apart from unaccounted cash expenses, unaccounted sale of scrap and digital data evidencing unaccounted cash transactions. “Further, it has been unearthed that the said infrastructure group has entered into a dubious circular transaction to the tune of ₹175 crore with an infrastructure company based in Jaipur. Further investigations are being carried out to establish the full extent of tax evasion. Cash ₹1.8 crore has been seized during the search (at a company) and 11 lockers have been placed under prohibitory order,” it said. The raids are continuing, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-dept-says-sonu-sood-involved-in-rs-20-crore-tax-evasion-fcra-violation-101631948732831.html

Of the 281 Covid-19 fatalities reported in the last 24 hours, nearly half or 131 deaths were reported from Kerala, according to data.The state has been reporting a record number of Covid-19 cases for weeks now. On Friday, the state added 22,182 Covid-19 cases to India’s tally of 34,403 and on Thursday (September 16) Kerala contributed 17,681 infections to the country’s tally of 30,570, according to the data released by the health ministry.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan told reporters on September 16 that almost 68 per cent of the country’s total cases are being reported from Kerala. "Kerala has over 1.99 lakh active cases, while five other states—Mizoram, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra—have more than 10,000 active cases,” Bhushan said during a press briefing.In the last 24 hours, the district of Thrissur reported the highest number of cases in the state-4,013, followed by Ernakulam with 3,143 and Kozhikode with 2,095 cases, health minister Veena George told reporters.

18-09-2021||India||Is AUKUS pact a signal to India to go for nuclear attack submarines?||With Australia signing a pact with US and UK to go in for eight nuclear powered conventional attack submarines or SSNs to deter China in Indo-Pacific, India also needs to have a relook at its 1999 conventional submarine plan and move swiftly towards nuclear powered sub-surface vessels.While India has floated a Request for Information (RFI) for six new diesel attack submarines with air independent propulsion for longer duration under water under Project 75I, the rapidly changing security scenario in the Indo-Pacific calls for Modi government to put the plan of three SSNs on the front-burner. India as of now has one ballistic missile firing nuclear submarine or SSBN, INS Arihant, with another one, INS Arighat, ready for commissioning next year. It does not have a nuclear-powered conventional attack submarine, but the situation will change in 2025.Although the French are understandably unhappy at Australia for unilaterally scuttling the USD 50 billion deal with Naval Group to build 12 AIP equipped diesel submarines in favour of SSNs under the newly unveiled AUKUS Anglo-Saxon pact, fact is that the rapidly building Chinese Navy needed a stronger response. The SSNs are only limited by food supplies and the mental framework of their crew and can-do sea access-sea denial patrols for more than 45 days. In short, Australia, which is at the receiving end of the belligerent Chinese like India and Japan, can deter the powerful PLA Navy, which has a series of SSNs and SSBNs and is acquiring longer sea legs by the day.In this context, Indian national security planners also need to reconsider Project 75 I and Project 76, a follow-up of the previous one, and jump to Project 77 or the SSN project. Since submarine building takes at least a decade from the drawing board, India needs to prepare for a time when Chinese aircraft carriers and SSNs will be patrolling the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) apart from other global players.It is not that the Modi government is sitting tight and watching the unfolding security situation in maritime dimension. With new aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, INS Arighat SSBN, six new Kalvari class diesel attack submarines and Vishakhapatnam class of destroyers, the Indian Navy is going to be very potent force in the Indo-Pacific by 2025.With US willing to sell armed Predator drones, Aegis integrated combat system and Tomahawk cruise missile to India, Modi government has enough options to project power in Indo-Pacific. India’s key ally France is also willing to help in design and construction of SSNs as well as improve Indian military’s over the horizon capabilities.Just as US, India and Australia are focused on the Indo-Pacific, the new Japanese leadership is also shedding its pacifist approach faced with wolf-warriors of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The emerging leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga are conservative and nationalist in approach. Rather than be pushed around by Beijing, Japan is all ready to join hands with Quad partners in securing Indo-Pacific.The AUKUS pact will not be without security ramifications for the Quad partners as there is a distinct possibility that China may build an SSN for its client Pakistan citing the transfer of nuclear reactor under AUKUS to Australia. This will create a bigger security headache for India and for other countries in the IOR. Time has come for India to revisit its deterrent capabilities and for Indian Navy to think beyond Karachi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-aukus-pact-a-signal-to-india-to-go-for-nuclear-attack-submarines-101631944254552.html

"The SKM has asked constituent organisations to appeal to all sections of society to join hands with farmers and publicise the bandh beforehand so that inconvenience to the public may be reduced. The bandh will be peaceful as well as voluntary and would exempt emergency services,” it said in the statement, according to news agency PTI.Central and state government offices, markets, shops, factories, schools, colleges and other educational institutions will not be allowed to function during the Bharat Bandh by farmers, which will start at 6am and remain in force till 4pm, the SKM said in a statement on Friday. Public and private transport will not be allowed to ply on roads, the umbrella body of more than 40 farmer unions said. No public functions will be allowed and only emergency services, including ambulances and fire services, can function during the bandh, it added.The SKM said that a "state-level preparatory meeting" will be held in Mumbai on September 20 for further planning regarding the bandh. A ‘Kisan Mazdoor Mahapanchayat' will be organised in Uttar Pradesh's Sitapur on the same day and it will be followed by a 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' in Uttarakhand's Roorkee on September 22.Also read | SAD to resume poll events after farmers’ September 27 Bharat BandhThe protesting farmers will also host a five-day Kabaddi League from September 22 at Tikri and Singhu border protest sites.

It said lakhs of farmers are protesting at Delhi borders not of their "own volition" and have been forced to stay there by police of different states and the Union home ministry.Also read | Scrap farm laws, talk to farmers for way forward: Punjab CM to CentreThe SKM said the protest of the farmers, who have faced "great hardship" living on the highways amid heavy rains, harsh summer and chilly winter months, is a matter of "protecting their livelihoods, basic productive resources and the future of the next generation".Farmers from different parts of the country have been protesting since November last year against the three farm laws, which the Centre has said are major agricultural reforms. However, the farmers fear that they will do away with the minimum support price or MSP system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. The government and farmer leaders held more than 10 rounds of talks but have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-body-says-september-27-bharat-bandh-will-be-peaceful-issues-guidelines-101631941255678.html

18-09-2021||India||The future is here? India may soon get its first 'electric highway'; what it means||The central government is mulling over the concept of an ‘electric highway’, to be built between the national capital of Delhi and Jaipur in Rajasthan. Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari said on Friday said the government is already in talks with a foreign company to build the electric highway – his “dream” project – between these two cities and that the construction work might start very soon if the discussions come through. Hindustan Times' sister publication HT Auto reports that in addition to the Delhi-Jaipur stretch, another electric highway may also be constructed between Delhi and Mumbai, and talks are on with a Swedish firm regarding that.What is an ‘electric highway’?With the world moving on from conventional fuels to alternative sources of energy for powering transport, electricity is currently the most popular choice for powering motors of propulsion in vehicles. If the proposed electric highway comes through, it will see vehicles powered by electricity ply on the stretch – the first of these will be between Delhi to Jaipur; and later, if everything goes well, the Delhi-Mumbai stretch may see another of these electric highways.Also Read | The electrification of Indian carsAccording to Union minister Nitin Gadkari, electric vehicles are not just limited to small road vehicles. Buses, trucks, and railway engines may also eventually be powered by electricity. The minister said that it was his dream to build an electric highway, but the project is still in the proposal stage.“It is my dream to build an electric highway from Delhi to Jaipur,” the PTI news agency quoted Gadkari as saying. “It is still a proposed project. We are in discussion with a foreign company.”He said that as the transport minister, he has taken the resolution to eventually bring an end to the use of petrol and diesel in the country.Electric vehicles, the future of transportationAn electric vehicle (EV) uses one or more electric motors for propulsion and can be powered either by an electric current collector system (for example, the overhead lines or electric third rails powering trams or electric locomotives), a battery (can be charged by solar panels or by converting fuel to electricity using fuel cells or a generator), and any other extravehicular sources of power.Also Read | Electric Vehicles: Push for courses and research in IndiaBecause of the diverse range of options available, EVs are not limited to road vehicles; electricity can theoretically power the railway, aircraft, spacecraft, and even underwater vessels. It has also been described as one of the 100 best contemporary solutions to address climate change and is expected to reduce conventional transportation's drastic impact on global warming and the environment.In its latest outlook, the International Energy Agency (IAE) said this year that world governments should do more to meet climate goals with policies that favour electric vehicles, and India's proposed electric highway project is expected to be a substantial step in that direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-future-is-here-india-may-soon-get-its-first-electric-highway-what-it-means-101631931795297.html

At present, eight out of 25 high courts were working without regular chief justices.
18-09-2021||India||Orissa HC rejects plea on raising height of Durga idol to 4 feet, says move will not affect sanctity||The Orissa High Court on Friday rejected the petition filed by a puja committee of Cuttack town seeking relaxation in capping of the height of Durga idol at 4 feet observing that the height despite being an essential aspect of a tradition would not lower the sanctity as well as the devotion and fervour associated with the popular festival.Balubazar Puja committee, one of the 150-odd organisers of the Durga Puja festivities had approached the Orissa High Court last week seeking that the state government order on capping the height of all idols of Durga as well as other subsequent festivals at 4 feet be lifted. The committee contested the order of the state government issued last month which said the height of all idols of Gods and Goddesses such as Ganesh, Durga, Kali and Laxmi should be capped at 4 feet.The HC bench of Chief Justice S Muralidhar and Justice BP Routray said Durga Puja festival itself was a combination of several elements of celebration, and the idol is but one important component. “In respect of these many elements there has had to be some amount of restriction on the scale and size. It is in that context that the restriction on the height of the idol has to be viewed. It cannot be singled out as an ‘essential’ aspect of a tradition or practice without which, the festival itself may not have significance,” the HC said.The court said the puja committee could not justify if the height of the idol is restricted to 4 feet, then somehow the sanctity of the occasion, the devotion and fervour associated with the festival, and the religious sentiments of the people would be interfered with in a manner contrary to tradition.The HC bench however made an exception for Balubazar puja committee and 8 other committees in Cuttack town that have already started construction of the idols and exceeded the 4 feet limit. It said the rest of the puja committees that have not started construction would have to keep the idol at 4 feet.Since last month, politics has escalated over the height of the Durga idols with opposition BJP calling for a Cuttack bandh on September 13 against the government order. BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab had also opposed the state government decision on capping of idol height.The deities of Maa Durga have been worshiped in Cuttack since 1509. It is believed that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who was born in Cuttack, started Durga Puja in the city to organize youngsters against the British like Balagangadhar Tilak had started Ganesh Utsav in Maharashtra. The first recorded Sarvajanin (public) Durga Puja in the state started in Kazi Bazaar area of Cuttack in 1832.While capping the idol heights, last month, the special relief commissioner of Odisha had said congregations for celebration of Ganesh Puja, Durga Puja, Laxmi Puja, Kali Puja and other festivals would not be allowed in public throughout the state.The state government said puja pandals would need to be covered on three sides while the 4th side would be covered in a way so as not to allow any public view of the idols. It also barred the use of the public address systems at puja pandals and said the immersion processions would not be allowed.Apart from Odisha, states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat have capped the height of idols at 4 feet, but the neighbouring state of Bengal has not put in place any such restrictions. Assam too has also not put any such restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/orissa-hc-rejects-plea-on-raising-height-of-durga-idol-to-4-feet-says-move-will-not-affect-sanctity-101631911527629.html
18-09-2021||India||Supreme Court to reconsider its ruling in favour of Adani Power||The Supreme Court has decided to reconsider its 2019 judgment, which affirmed Adani Power (Mundra’s) call to terminate the power purchase agreement (PPA) signed with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam (GUVNL).A five-judge bench, headed by chief justice of India NV Ramana, issued notices on a curative petition filed by GUVNL after noting that the plea raises significant questions of law. Apart from Adani Power (Mundra), notices have also gone to Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) and an NGO, Consumer Education and Research Society.“We have gone through the curative petition and the relevant documents. In our prima facie opinion, there are substantial questions of law raised in this curative petition, which require consideration. Issue notice,” stated the court’s order on September 16.The bench, which also included justices Uday U Lalit, AM Khanwilkar, BR Gavai and Surya Kant, has listed the matter for a hearing in the open court on September 30.Curative petition is the final legal remedy available to a litigant after dismissal of the main petition and the review petition.In its July 2019 judgment, a three-judge bench comprising justices Arun Mishra, BR Gavai and Surya Kant underlined that Adani Power was justified in terminating the PPA since it could not get coal supply on time from the Naini block of Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation (GMDC).The apex court, in its 2019 order, also allowed Adani to seek a compensatory rate for the electricity it had alternatively supplied to Gujarat from its Korba power project in Chhattisgarh. It had asked the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to decide the compensatory rate for Adani Power within three months from the date the company approaches it. GUVNL will then have to make the payment to Adani within three months from the date the CERC decides.The dispute dates back to 2010, when Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) said Adani Power illegally terminated the PPA the latter had signed with GUVNL. This decision of GERC was later upheld by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, prompting Adani to approach the top court.According to Adani’s contention in the top court, it signed the PPA in 2007 with GUVNL for supply of 1,000 MW at ₹2.35/unit from its power project at Korba, Chhattisgarh, based on coal supply from Naini. GMDC agreed to supply 4 million tonne of coal a year to Adani by developing the Naini coal block.Later, in 2007, Adani told GUVNL it would supply power from its Mundra power project in Kutch, Gujarat, instead of from Chhattisgarh since GMDC was lagging in coal production. However, despite repeated reminders to the Gujarat government, GUVNL, and GMDC, the coal supply did not start. Adani claimed it was forced to terminate the PPA in December 2009, arguing the agreement for supply of power was based on the assurance given by GMDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-reconsider-its-ruling-in-favour-of-adani-power-101631908423579.html
18-09-2021||India||Karnataka tops in vaccination drive on PM’s birthday||Karnataka topped the Covid vaccination drive in the country on Friday by administering 2.69 million doses till 9 pm, minister for health & family welfare and medical education K Sudhakar said.The state stood first in the country ahead of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which achieved over 2.66 million and 2.48 million doses, his office said in a release.“It is really apt that this effort coincides with the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has led the war on Covid from the front,” Sudhakar said.According to data released by the state health department at 8:30 pm, Karnataka had achieved 85% coverage by administering 2,692,955 doses against the target of 3,175,000.“I would like to thank all the health workers and other staff who have been involved in this historic vaccination drive,” Sudhakar said.It is a phenomenal effort by Karnataka to administer more doses than Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which have several times more population, he said. Meanwhile, the state on Friday also crossed the “milestone” of administering over 50 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine till date.Data from Cowin shows the Karnataka government appears to have continued its practice to hoard Covid-19 vaccines so as to show a higher number of inoculations on Friday. The state government denied hoarding of vaccines. The state government had set a target to administer 3 million doses on Friday to celebrate the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Data from Cowin shows that Karnataka has held back vaccinations to a minimum to administer jabs on a specific day to show higher numbers and demonstrate its prowess in the fight against Covid-19. The state government has shown high numbers on days it observes mass vaccination drives across Karnataka and seeing sharp downward fluctuations on other days. Denying hoarding of vaccines, Dr KV Trilok Chandra, commissioner for health and family welfare, said, “Compared to other states we have been consistently administering an average of 3-4 lakh doses every day irrespective of any mela.” He said the average per day vaccination was higher than most other states. Chandra said the two days in September where inoculations were lower than 100,000 was due to the festivals. The emphasis on optics in the fight against Covid-19 comes at a time when the threat of a third wave of infections looms over the state, which has so far lost at least 37,573 lives due to the virus and millions more impacted due to it. Until Friday, the state had administered a high of 1.25 million doses in a single day on September 1, the day it launched the “lasika utsav”, and every Wednesday since. Though the Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government has assured to adminsiter 500,000 vaccinations per day, data shows that it has breached that number just on four occasions in September. Most BJP-ruled states held vaccination drives to observe the birthday of the Prime Minister. The developments come even as people are sent back home without their shots, especially in rural areas where distance and transport have added to existing problems like growing hesitancy in districts, such Yadgir, Raichur and Chamarajanagar, among other. To overcome hesitancy, the district administration of Chamarajanagar had also tried to implement a ‘no-vaccine, no-pension/ration’ order that came under heavy criticism and eventually pulled back. The state health department said that as of Friday, the state had 3.5 million doses of vaccines with the state and the supply was also at a healthy rate.According to the government release on Friday, the districts that topped in Karnataka during the drive are Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike- BBMP area (398,000 doses), Belagavi (239,000 doses), Dakshina Kannada (133,000 doses), Ballari (133,000 doses), Tumkuru (124.000 doses) and Mandya (115,000 lakh doses).Bengaluru Urban, Shivamogga, Dharwad, Ramanagara, Hassana, Davanagere, Chikamagaluru and Haveri districts achieved more than 100 per cent of the day’s target.The vaccination drive, also called “Mega Vaccination Mela” was conducted in over 12,000 Covid vaccination centres across the state.Karnataka administered a total of 50.12 million doses till 9 PM on September 17.“We are very confident of crossing the target of 1.5 crore (15 million) that we have set ourselves for September,” the minister said, also expressing confidence about vaccinating the entire adult population in the State by the end of November.India on Friday administered a 20.25 million doses till 9 pm. The total doses administered in India till September 17 has crossed 790 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-tops-in-vaccination-drive-on-pm-s-birthday-101631907447395.html
18-09-2021||India||3 days after incident, Congress MLA booked for assaulting health officer||Congress MLA and former minister Jitu Patwari was booked on Friday for allegedly assaulting the chief municipal health officer during a programme which was organized on Wednesday, to create awareness among people to contain the spread of Dengue and malaria in Indore, police said. The case was registered after sanitation workers staged a protest at Rajendra Nagar police station demanding action against the Congress MLA on Friday morning. Following which, Indore police registered a case against the Congress MLA from Rau under Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 294 (using obscene language) of IPC. Rajendra Nagar police station in-charge Amrita Solanki said, “Some sanitation workers had come to the police station with health officer Uttam Singh Yadav. Yadav filed a complaint that the municipal corporation was organizing an awareness programme against Dengue and was also fumigating to kill larva of mosquitoes. Patwari attended the programme and misbehaved with Yadav and forced him to carry out fumigation in his constituency in Indore. He manhandled him and also abused him.” The chief municipal health officer came to file a complaint after informing his seniors about it. The accused is an MLA so the arrest will be made only after the investigation, said Solanki. “It is a political conspiracy against me. The case was registered three days after the incident. In Indore, Rau is the worst-affected area due to dengue and malaria but the municipal corporation is carrying out a step-motherly behaviour with my constituency. The residents are seeing everything,” Patwari said. Attacking the Congress MLA, BJP leader from Indore Madhu Verma said, “Congress MLA Jitu Patwari bullied a municipal corporation officer and manhandled him. Everyone saw him doing so. The officer filed a complaint against him. Now, what is the conspiracy in it? He should behave himself before blaming others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-days-after-incident-congress-mla-booked-for-assaulting-health-officer-101631906727111.html

There is a lot of lacuna in learning as it is working in silos and we are not trying to integrate with the industry. There’s a total disconnect between academic, industry and a complete mismatch particularly with regard to research and innovation. Probably, the one way it can happen is through education, innovation and technology. NEP permits the flexibility or the integration of the technology and facilitates effective integration of technology. We do have a lot of challenges, but we are very well placed particularly after the Covid-19. Our government has been working in this direction, establishing platforms for comprehensive learning management systems as part of the digital learning which has been developed in Karnataka. Even edu-tech companies do not have the kind of content development we have done with over 350,000 pieces of material, designed and evenly crafted along with the classrooms. We now have internet-enabled smart classrooms, providing more than 300,000 devices (tabs) to children studying in government institutions. The unified college management system has been established to connect in real-time with all private colleges, aided and government colleges which will come under this rule. Data capturing can happen based on this and a lot of interventions can be done. For the teachers as well there is a digital divide since their average age is around 40-45 years. How do you overcome these challenges? We are trying to ensure there will not be any digital divide in the state by providing all required facilities like upskilling of teachers. We are trying to train more than 10,000 teachers in this year on how they can cope with the changes. This is a way forward to address all challenges for enhancing the economy, bringing in social equity, inclusiveness and empowering youngsters to have a better future. And to get placement, cope up with emerging technologies as it becomes a huge area and connect with the industry. With the NEP, the syllabus has been completely rewired and revamped to connect with the industry and cater to their demand. We are building the system in such a way that even the most digitally illiterate can make use of the system. I do not think we will face a lot of challenges as in higher education we have a lot of younger professors and the process will be a smooth transition. What kind of regulatory mechanism will be in place to fix issues like fees in private educational institutes, higher education? With regard to higher education, we do have a higher education council in which all universities are members and I am the chairman. There is a lot of change which is facilitated through coordination and they (universities) have a lot of autonomy. With the NEP, there should be a lot of structural and administrative changes and legislations need to be brought in. We started working in this direction at the ongoing session to bring the Karnataka Shikshana Ayoga that will become the umbrella for primary, secondary education for entire education system that becomes a common body which will be headed by the chief minister. We are working on strengthening of the Higher Education Council and many other verticals will also come up. Some regulatory bodies will take some more time. Since the time is 15 years for stage-wise implementation which will happen initially and we have brought a lot of academic reforms for 2021. How does Karnataka plan to achieve higher GER on par with developed economies? The GER has increased for now after our government took over and is now at 32% from 28%. We have increased absorption capacity to get 200,000 additional children admitted. Enrollment of students should increase in primary, secondary and higher education. I am very pretty sure that we are going to achieve 50% GER target by 2040 because if a big state like Karnataka achieves it in 10 years, it may be impetus to several other poorer states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, where a large number of school dropout is there when compared to Karnataka. There has been an adverse impact psychologically also on students due to Covid and the time lost. How has the government and education sector suffered or employability suffered because of Covid? From school to college children, everybody has been badly affected. We did our best and provided online education but even then there have been a lot of setbacks. We will ensure that we overcome all shortcomings in days to come and effectively address these by integrating technology. We have vaccinated all college students, teaching and non-teaching staff to bring them back to campus. Since NEP follows 360 degrees of learning, nothing will be in isolation as all activities will be possible through collaboration that allows children to go beyond campus and learn. How will you accommodate those opposing the NEP who accuse the policy of muting scientific temper? The NEP only has positives where the student gets what they want. We are just worried that the transition is happening very fast. It was planned for implementation from 2021 and will be given 15 years time for complete implementation. The administration and all the structural facilitation is happening excellently. Connecting with the industry and academia is fantastic. I don’t think there is even a single negative point and some are opposing it for the sake of it. There are fears on the NEP and how it may prioritise Hindi over Kannada, other languages? At school level, students have been allowed to take three languages which include two Indian and one foreign. In higher education we do have two languages and it will be a choice of the student. In Karnataka, Kannada is mandatory in school and college. The nationalist policy is going to strengthen local languages and it is not an imposition of Hindi. And it is meant to promote and ensure that our identities will remain with us and it will continue to flourish and sustain any challenges.How will the policy bring in synergy between industry and academia? Since we are allowing institutions to collaborate with industry, the best facilities will be available for students. Earlier it was a namesake internship for just 2-3 months which we have made to 9 months in engineering as well as other courses. We are insisting industry to pay stipend otherwise, it has no value. If you belong to any particular place or locality, you can ensure the institution of your locality grows to international standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htlenovo-smarter-ed-conclave-nep-facilitates-integration-of-tech-with-education-says-karnataka-minister-ashwath-narayan-101631905407314.html

Her uncle, Vishnu, was earlier the village chief and the family owns large parcels of land. Yadav belonged to an other backward class (OBC) communtiy who eked out a living as a daily wager in Sagar’s fruit market, Singh added.Last year, Sharma’s family married her off to a man from their community 150km away in Jabalpur. She returned home a few days ago, and called Yadav to her house on Thursday evening, when her family saw them, said police.Singh said Raghvendra, Vishnu,Shubham and Deepak tied Yadav’s hands and mercilessly thrashed him. “Later, they poured kerosene oil on him and set him afire and then pushed him off the roof. He landed in their cowshed,” the district police chief added, citing the young man’s statement recorded hours before his death.A villager informed the police about the incident.Yadav and Sharma were taken to the local community health centre. Early on Friday morning, they were taken to the Bundelkhand Medical College 30km away. Yadav died soon after, police said.Sharma’s family blamed Yadav and said he had come to kill the woman. But Yadav’s family refuted the allegations.Yadav’s uncle, Umashankar Yadav, said the family knew about his relationship with Sharma, but that he kept himself busy with work as a daily wager since her wedding.“On Thursday evening, Rahul told me that Chanchal asked him for one last meeting. She had been calling him for the past three days. Rahul went there to meet her last time but we didn’t know that they would kill him,” Umashankar said.Yadav’s family sought police protection even as protests rocked the region .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25yearold-man-dies-of-burn-injuries-in-madhya-pradesh-s-sagar-district-four-arrested-police-101631905293510.html
18-09-2021||India||Bill banning online gambling tabled in Karnataka Assembly||The Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government on Friday tabled a bill to ban online gambling and betting in Karnataka with provisions of heavy penalties for offenders.The Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was tabled in the lower house of the state legislature in the ongoing monsoon session.By tabling the bill, the government proposed to amend the Karnataka Police Act, 1963 that defined games which included online that had any forms of wagering or betting.According to the bill, “Games means and includes online games, involving all forms of wagering or betting, including in the form of tokens valued in terms of the money paid before or after the issue of it, or electronic means and virtual currency, electronic transfer of funds in connection with any game of chance.”The government also made a provision to punish offenders with a maximum imprisonment of three years or a fine of up to ₹1 lakh.The bill, however, does not include betting in turf clubs or other races.The bill, which makes certain offences related to wagering and gambling a cognizable offence, includes use of cyberspace, computer resources or any communication device as defined in the Information Technology Act, 2000 in the process of gaming.The tabling of the bill comes at a time when there has been a sharp spike in online betting games being floated into the virtual space which, by disclaimers made by the promoter companies themselves, can be addictive.The bill stated that offences will attract prison sentences ranging between six months to three years and fines from ₹10,000- ₹20,000 depending on frequency of the violation. Those aiding and abetting online gaming would also be brought to book, the amendment states.On Friday, the lower house passed three bills, including the Identification of Prisoners (Karnataka Amendment) Bill that seeks to include collection of blood, DNA, voice and iris scan samples as “measurements” of offenders for effective surveillance and prevention of breach of peace and crime.There are apprehensions on the provisions of this bill as it makes anyone, who has been sentenced in a crime for one month and upwards, to be forced to give their samples which will become part of the database.Experts have voiced their concerns over such a bill over privacy issues as well as questioned if the necessary infrastructure was in place to collect, store and analyze such complicated procedures.Priyank Kharge, a Congress MLA and former minister, also raised her concerns over right to privacy and availability of necessary infrastructure to collect, store and analyze the collected samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-banning-online-gambling-tabled-in-karnataka-assembly-101631905048109.html
18-09-2021||India||Islamic State trying to spread tentacles through online propaganda: NIA||Concerned that the Islamic State is trying to spread its tentacles in India, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday appealed to the public to bring into its notice any such propaganda or radicalization on social media platforms.The investigating agency also opened a hotline number -- 011-24368800 -- for all to inform about any such activities.“Investigation by the NIA has revealed that IS (Islamic State) is trying to spread its tentacles in India through continuous propaganda online. Gullible youth are targeted on open social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Once a person shows interest, he or she is then enticed to communicate with online handlers based abroad using encrypted social media platforms,” the statement said. “Depending on the gullibility of the person, the handlers then use the person for uploading online content, translation of IS texts to local language, conspiracy, preparation of a module, collection of arms and ammunition, preparation of IEDs, terror funding and even attacks,” it added. With the Taliban taking control of Afghanistan last month and subsequently releasing several prisoners linked to the Islamic State in Kabul, Kandahar and Mazar-i-Sharif, there appears to be an attempt to lure Indian youth through platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, people familiar with the development said. According to the agency, most of the 150 Indians who joined the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria between 2014 and 2017 were radicalised by various recruiters on the internet. The agency also said that it has so far arrested 168 people in 37 cases of terror attacks, conspiracy and funding which have been inspired by the IS ideology in the country. It said that charge sheets have been filed in 31 of the cases, the most recent of which was registered in June, and that 27 accused have been convicted after trial.At least eight from Kerala, who had joined the IS in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province in 2016, were among those recently freed from Afghanistan prisons, an NIA official said on condition of anonymity. While their present location is not yet known, it is suspected that they might try to enter India, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/islamic-state-trying-to-spread-tentacles-through-online-propaganda-nia-101631904989331.html
18-09-2021||India||Karnataka coastal districts on alert after intelligence agencies intercept satellite calls||Police have issued an alert along Karnataka’s coastal regions after central intelligence agencies recently intercepted satellite calls originating from three coastal districts, officials said. Senior police officers said police are taking all precautions and the alert should not be a concern for the public. A senior officer in charge of the intelligence in the state confirmed that the state police had received inputs from central agencies regarding such calls. “We can’t share more details about these calls, but this is not the first time such calls are reported in the state. Our teams are on the ground verifying these inputs. However, there is no imminent cause for concern,” said the officer. Officers in the know of the developments said that inputs from the central agencies have been taken seriously since the “contents of these calls were of interest”. On September 1, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had said that police had received inputs about possible terrorist activity on the coasts of Kerala and Karnataka. He said the state administration is keeping a watch for any suspicious activity in the coastal and adjoining forest areas. “I can’t discuss some issues openly, but I want to tell you that Karnataka police along with NIA is keeping a strict vigil on any anti-national activity in coastal and adjoining forest areas. NIA had also picked up a person who was involved in such activities. We have also issued a high alert in coastal areas,” said the chief minister. It was then claimed by the police that a central Intelligence report had warned that terrorists could infiltrate from the coastal districts of the state. The fresh alert comes days after the chief minister’s statement. So far, 15 Islamic State sympathisers have been arrested from Karnataka. The latest arrests were reported on August 11, when the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Zufri Jawhar Damudi from Karnataka’s Bhatkal town in connection with terror activities of a group propagating the violent ideology of the Islamic State (IS). A day before that NIA had arrested Ammar Abdul Rahman of Mangalore and Shankar Venkatesh Perumal of Bengaluru in connection with the case after conducting simultaneous searches in Jammu and Kashmir and Karnataka. In October 2019, NIA had announced that the central agency had arrested 127 IS sympathisers from across India between 2014 and 2019. According to the NIA list at the time, a maximum of 33 people have been arrested from Tamil Nadu, followed by Uttar Pradesh (19), Kerala (17), Telangana (14), Maharashtra (12), and Karnataka (8). Since 2019, as per the information listed on NIA’s website, three IS-related cases have been reported. The first case was reported on September 19, 2020, in which four men from Karnataka were arrested. The second case was reported on March 5, 2021, in which seven people from Kerala were arrested and the third case of arrests was reported after raids in September. With these arrests, Kerala moved to the second spot in the list with 24 arrests while Karnataka jumped to the fourth with 15 arrests, followed by Telangana (14), as per the NIA information. While answering a question regarding ‘reports of the presence of Islamic terrorists in southern states of India’, during the monsoon session in September 2020, the Union ministry of home affairs told parliament: “Some instances of individuals from different states, including the southern states, having joined Islamic State (IS) have come to the notice of Central and state security agencies.” “Investigations by the NIA have revealed that IS is most active in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir,” read the MHA statement in Rajya Sabha. B Dayananda, additional director general of police (Intelligence), Karnataka, said the numbers mentioned by the MHA are only pertaining to the cases registered by NIA. “As per the state government’s records, 30 people have been arrested for links with the Islamic State. So far the arrests have been made in connection with radicalisation and evidence of contact with members of the Islamic State,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-coastal-district-on-alert-after-intelligence-agencies-intercept-satellite-calls-101631904928317.html
18-09-2021||India||CPI(M) cautions against luring of women going to colleges towards terror, sparks new row||Thiruvananthapuram: Amid raging controversy triggered by Pala Bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt’s statement on ‘narcotic jihad’, the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) has cautioned its party cadres against a deliberate move to lure educated women studying in colleges to terrorism. The controversial remark appeared in a note prepared by the party to its cadres ahead of the upcoming party conferences. Under the title ‘Minority Communalism’ the note said some of the recent debates and deliberations supporting Taliban in the state should be viewed seriously. It asked its cadres to be vigilant about such issues. “Deliberate attempts are being made to lure youth into extremist ideologies. Efforts are also made to make educated women to think that way. Our student and youth outfits should pay special attention towards such issues,” the note said. It also criticised the Jamate-e-Islami for propagating fundamentalist ideals. Though Christians in the state generally do not buy such communal ideologies, a radical influence is growing among a section of the community which forces it to buy the victim theory quite often, it said. The note also said such tendencies in minority communities will only help majority communalism in the state. The note has stoked another round of debate in the state. The opposition Congress asked the party to produce evidence to prove such “grave charges” while the BJP said finally the ruling party admitted to the presence of terror network in the state. “The ruling party is making a grave charge. The party and government have responsibility to reveal what forced it to make such a note. If they have any data or evidence to prove it should release them,” said opposition leader VD Satheesan. The BJP said the party has finally admitted to the presence of terror network in the state. “Its double standard is exposed. While it is fiercely opposing the Bishop’s statement it tells it cadres about the presence of jihadi elements,” said BJP state president K Surendran. When asked, CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said the party will oppose both, majority and minority communalism but refused to comment on the in-house note. Bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt while addressing a religious congregation in Kottayam on Sept 9 said Catholic girls and youth were becoming victims of “narcotic jihad” and decried authorities for turning a blind eye towards it. Though many religious leaders and a section of the intelligentsia asked the Bishop to clear the air saying he was only referring to the social evil (growing use of narcotics among youth) he is yet to dilute his statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpim-cautions-against-luring-of-women-going-to-colleges-towards-terror-sparks-new-row-101631904870267.html
18-09-2021||India||Chandrababu Naidu demands scrapping of new Tirumala Board||Amaravati, Sep 17 (PTI): Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday demanded that the newly-constituted Board of Trustees of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams be abolished forthwith as “vested interests” were brazenly apparent in its appointment.The YSR Congress government turned the holy place into a commercial entity, he alleged and warned that those trying to damage the sanctity of Venkateswara Swamy would pay a price.Rather than honouring the devotees’ sentiments, the government hurt them by appointing a 81-member Board, including 52 special invitees, Chandrababu said in a letter to Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy.“A Board that should have been constituted with devout and service-oriented people has been filled with industrialists, criminals, the corrupt and malicious persons. It is reprehensible that a jumbo Board with 81 members has been constituted, which is unprecedented. The TDP strongly condemns it,” Chandrababu said.The Leader of the Opposition charged that the new Board was established in a manner that not only hurt the sentiments of crores of devotees, but also established that only political and business interests were involved.“The TTD Board has been turned into a rehabilitation centre for the politically-unemployed,” he lashed out.BJP MP G V L Narasimha Rao too came down heavily on the Jagan government on the TTD Board issue and questioned the motive behind nominating 52 special invitees.“The Jagan government is treating TTD as a platform for its politics and distribution of posts. The government should desist from such things,” the MP said.He said a Trust Board within the ambit of law would suffice and there was no need for a jumbo body with more than 50 special invitees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandrababu-naidu-demands-scrapping-of-new-tirumala-board-101631904866824.html
18-09-2021||India||SC allows Kerala to hold Class 11 exams physically||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the Kerala government to conduct physical examinations of Class 11 in the state, trusting the authorities to follow all Covid-19 precautions to avert any harm to students and observing that the third wave of the pandemic was not in the offing immediately. A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said, “We are convinced by the explanation offered by the state government. We hope and trust that the authorities will take all precautions to ensure no untoward incident is faced by students who are of tender age and are appearing for the examination.” On September 3, the court restrained Kerala from proceeding with its Class 11 examinations beginning September 6 on account of the “alarming” situation posed by a surge in Covid-19 cases that posed a serious risk to the health of students. More than 300,000 students in the state are supposed to appear for the Class 11 examinations. With the direction on Friday, the apex court disposed a petition filed by advocate A Rasoolshan, who argued the decision of the state to conduct offline examinations for Class 11 was creating tremendous mental stress among students and posed a serious risk to children as cases in the state were rising at an alarming rate. Explaining why it had swiftly intervened in the matter on September 3 ordering stay of the examinations, the bench said, “Earlier we had intervened thinking that by September, the possibility of the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic is there. Now the third wave does not seem to be in the offing immediately.” Also, the court noted that the state had successfully conducted the Joint Engineering Examination (JEE) – Main 2021 from August 26 to September 2, National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) for medical/dental admissions on September 11 and 12 and other engineering entrance examinations in the state that were all held physically involving hundreds of thousands of students. “The authorities are conscious of their responsibilities. Last time when the grievance of holding physical examination was made before us, we did not have a convincing answer. Now the explanation has been given in the counter affidavit of the state. More than 7 lakh (700,000) students appeared in JEE and NEET. Even for APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, the state conducted engineering entrance examination. So long as Covid-19 protocols are followed we have no objection,” the bench observed. “Examination in offline mode can be conducted by strictly adhering to all precautionary measures issued by state and Central governments in preventing further spread of Covid-19 pandemic,” the Kerala government told the Supreme Court through its affidavit filed last week. It further convinced the court that for students and those showing symptoms of Covid-19, separate rooms will be arranged along with PPE kits for students and invigilators. Further, the state told the court that holding online examination will prejudice large number of students who have no access to laptops, desktops or even mobile phones and in many areas, the internet connection or mobile data was not available. “These students will never be able to write online examinations,” the state government said. The decision to hold offline Class 11 examinations from September 6 to 27 was notified by the Kerala government on May 28. The state was in favour of holding offline Class 11 examinations as their marks count towards admission into higher educational courses, unlike CBSE or ICSE boards. Disputing the assurance offered by the state government, the petitioner’s counsel Prashant Padmanbhan submitted to the court that number of students who appeared for NEET, JEE from Kerala were roughly around 80,000 and all of them being above 18 years had the opportunity to get vaccinated. The same was not true about Class 11 students, who are of tender age. He relied on news reports claiming that the spread of Covid-19 infection cannot be checked by wiping tables and chairs as there is potential of catching infection from the air. The bench told the petitioner not to be rhetorical and adopt a different approach. “We are not willing to take this matter forward. The last examination they conducted was on September 2. They are taking all responsibilities with all seriousness,” the bench observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-allows-kerala-to-hold-class-11-exams-physically-101631904806790.html
18-09-2021||India||Bengaluru boy found dead with gunshot wound, police suspect suicide||A 17-year-old student was found dead near a bus stop in Bengaluru with a gunshot wound in the early hours of Friday. Police said the boy allegedly shot himself with a pistol.A Class 12 student in a private college in the city, the boy was found dead at an empty bus station in Sanjay Nagar with a bullet wound to his right temple. Police recovered a pistol and the bullet that killed him. The motive behind the extreme step is still unknown. According to police, the victim was the younger son of a former army personnel from Uttarakhand. His father had retired from the parachute regiment in 2017 and was working in a security division of a private firm in the city. The family was living in a rented house in the city since his father’s retirement.In their preliminary investigation, police have not found any foul play. Deputy commissioner of police (central) MN Anuchet said the evidence collected from the scene indicated suicide. Senior police officers said the suicide could have taken place between 3.30 am and 6.30 am. “He has left the house around 3.30 am. He has walked around 1 km and sat at a bus station, next to the training command of the Indian Air Force. A passerby informed the police around 6.30 am after spotting the body. We found a bullet entry on the right temple, which exited from the other end,” said DCP Anuchet. The Indian Ordnance Factory-manufactured pistol recovered from the crime scene was registered in his father’s name. The DCP said before leaving the house the boy had taken the pistol with him. His parents told the investigators that his father had trained him to use the pistol and he had practiced with it as well. “His father had purchased the weapon with a license on his retirement. The weapon was kept in an almirah in the house, which was accessible to all family members,” the officer added. As part of the investigation, police have collected CCTV footage from the road leading to the bus station. The footage shows that the student was texting on his mobile phone constantly, as he was walking towards the bus stop. “We still don’t know the motive behind the suicide. There was no death note. Even though he was messaging on the phone, all the texts were found deleted. We are looking for call details as part of the probe,” said DCP Anuchet. According to the parents’ statement, the boy was a bright student and didn’t tell them if he was facing any problems. They also told police said that the boy used to read till late at night and had a habit of going for a morning walk. So, the family didn’t suspect anything when they didn’t find him at home in the morning. The parents and an elder sister of the student came to the bus stop after police informed them about the incident. The father told the police that he didn’t get any hint that his son would take such a drastic step.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-boy-found-dead-with-gunshot-wound-police-suspect-suicide-101631904749556.html
18-09-2021||India||India shares challenges that led to AUKUS formation: Aus envoy Barry O’Farrell||India shares the “challenging strategic environment” that prompted Australia’s move to forge a security alliance with the US and the UK, including territorial tensions across the Indo-Pacific and China’s massive military modernisation programme, Australian high commissioner Barry O’Farrell said on Friday.The new military partnership called AUKUS will help improve Australia’s capabilities in line with the country’s 2020 Defence Strategic Update and will not affect the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, which is more of a diplomatic forum, O’Farrell said during a virtual media briefing.AUKUS was unveiled by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and US President Joe Biden against the backdrop of China’s assertive actions across the Indo-Pacific, and its first initiative is aimed at equipping Australia with nuclear-powered submarines.India has chosen to maintain a studied silence on the new security alliance, apparently due to sensitivities related to the strategic situation in the region and ties with key partners. France, a key strategic ally for India, was angered by Australia’s decision to scrap a $90 billion programme to build 12 French-designed conventional submarines and instead opt for nuclear-powered vessels.Explaining the rationale behind AUKUS, O’Farrell said: “The decision reflects a much more challenging strategic environment, an environment we share with India, where great power competition is intensifying, where territorial tensions in the South China Sea, Taiwan and elsewhere are becoming more challenging.”He said: “Indo-Pacific investment in military capability is proceeding at an unprecedented rate and of course that latter point is being driven by China, which has the largest military modernisation programme underway in the world.”AUKUS is also about “ensuring we have capabilities that contribute, along with India and other countries, to deterring the types of behaviour that threatens the peace and security in the Indo-Pacific today and in the future”, he added.Amid reports that the new alliance was aimed at balancing China across the region, especially in light of Beijing’s aggressive and assertive actions in recent years, O’Farrell noted that AUKUS was not directed against any particular country or meant “to provoke any particular regional power”. It was, he said, based on a “sober assessment of the capability required to meet a more challenging strategic environment”.O’Farrell dismissed Beijing’s criticism of AUKUS, saying China itself is engaged in “one of the largest militarisation updates in history”, and “it did strike me as slightly odd that they would criticise another country for investing in increased capability”.He added, “As a three-ocean nation, nuclear-powered submarines will provide Australia with a capability it now believes it needs for its defence because they can travel faster, they can travel for a longer range and they have greater power and endurance.”Strengthening Australia’s defence capabilities through nuclear-powered submarines will be part of the country’s “contribution to a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific”, and this capability will increase Canberra’s “strategic weight and allow us to more effectively shape our region’s future trajectory”, O’Farrell said.“Australia is striving to retain an inclusive regional order where the rights of all states are respected, whether they are big states or small states,” he said.Australia wants to “contribute to strategic reassurance measures that ensure no one country believes they can advance their strategic ambitions through conflict and it’s not about seeking to provoke any particular regional power”, he added.Asked specifically about France’s anger over the cancellation of Australia’s conventional submarine deal, O’Farrell said his country wants to continue working with India, France and Indonesia to ensure the Indo-Pacific remains free and inclusive.Australia’s decision to move towards nuclear-powered submarines “hasn’t been welcomed by France” but the move will help in ensuring that trade across the Indian and Pacific Oceans will be safe and secure, he said.The Malabar naval exercise is an example of the four members of the Quad conducting manoeuvres together to keep pace with threats in the region, O’Farrell said. Australia participated in Malabar two years in a row and would like to “keep that streak going”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-shares-challenges-that-led-to-aukus-formation-australian-high-commissioner-barry-ofarrell-101631904748352.html

The cases that have been withdrawn also include those filed against the media, those who protested against the Kudankulam nuclear plant and the eight-lane road projects in Tamil Nadu, officials said. Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin made the announcement in this regard in the state assembly recently. The DMK in its election manifesto had also promised to withdraw the cases lodged against protesters during AIADMK rule. Stalin-led DMK government, that took over in May, issued an order withdrawing 5,570 cases in the past 10 years of AIADMK government on September 4. The order was made public on Friday. The order signed by SK Prabakar, additional chief secretary, showed that the cases withdrawn include 26 cases registered against journalists (that were filed between 2011 and 2021), 2,831 cases for agitations against the farm laws, 2,282 cases over protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 405 cases over the eight-lane Salem expressway project and 26 cases filed against people who protested the Kudankulam nuclear power plant project. The cases that have been withdrawn are those in which the investigation is still pending or a charge-sheet has not been filed, the order said. The order added that it was recommended to the government that any further action in such cases may be dropped by the police. In cases that are pending trial, the Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge has been directed to move an application for withdrawal of case from the court. For cases filed against MPs and MLAs, as per Supreme Court directions, no case shall be withdrawn without the permission of the High Court. The order said the government will furnish details of the same before the Madras High Court soon. “The Director General of Police (DGP) is directed to furnish the details of cases involved against sitting or former MPs/MLAs to the government, for taking up the matter with the High Court of Madras,” the order said.

18-09-2021||India||Time to liberate people of Telangana from TRS, says Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would emerge victorious in the next Telangana assembly elections, besides winning all the 17 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the 2024 general polls. Addressing a huge rally of the BJP workers on the outskirts of Nirmal district headquarters to commemorate the 73rd anniversary of Telangana Liberation Day (merger of erstwhile Hyderabad state with the Indian Union), Shah said it was time to liberate people of Telangana from the clutches of Telangana Rashtra Samithi to bring them the real freedom. Telangana was under the autocratic regime of the Nizams. Thanks to the courageous decision of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, that Hyderabad was liberated from the Nizam’s rule, 13 months after Indian Independence and merged with the rest of India on this day in 1948, Shah said. “Now, Telangana has once again come under a single-family rule. We need to display the same valour and get the state liberated from this family (of TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao). Only then, the people of the state can breathe easy,” Shah asserted. The Union home minister lashed out at the TRS government for not celebrating the Telangana Liberation Day on September 17 every year, fearing backlash from Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, which was formed by the Razakars, the private army during the Nizam rule. “When the neighbouring states of Karnataka and Maharashtra are celebrating the liberation day in the regions which were once part of the Hyderabad State during the Nizam regime, what prevented the Telangana government from not celebrating?” he asked. Shah asserted that after the BJP forms the government in Telangana, it would officially celebrate the Telangana Liberation Day. “Unlike the TRS, we are not afraid of Majlis party. We shall commemorate the sacrifices made by the people of Telangana, including Dalits and girijans, for the liberation of Hyderabad state,” he said. Stating that the entire country was celebrating the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, the home minister said on this occasion, a special Covid-19 vaccination drive was launched and over two crore people were being vaccinated across the country. Shah was all praise for state BJP president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay for taking up padayatra (foot march) to understand the people’s problems by directly interacting with them. Speaking at the meeting, Sanjay demanded that the Telangana chief minister should tender apology to the people for not celebrating the Telangana liberation day officially. “He should remember that it was because of Sardar Patel, the Nizam rule came to an end and Telangana was merged with India. Had Patel not been there, Telangana would not have been a reality and KCR would not have become the chief minister,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/time-to-liberate-people-of-telangana-from-trs-says-amitshah-101631904628176.html
18-09-2021||India||Kerala HC dismisses petition against new Lakshadweep rules||The Kerala high court on Friday rejected a petition questioning the Lakshadweep administration’s decision to close dairy farms and remove meat from midday meals in schools, saying it can’t interfere in policy matters.In June, the court had stayed the operation of the two controversial orders passed by Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel.During the hearing of the plea filed by Ajmal Ahamad, a resident of the island, the administration contended that the court can’t interfere in such policy decisions. Counsel for the administration S Manu also pointed out that dairy farms were running in loss and the island was losing ₹1 crore every year. He also argued that nutrition needs of the children can be met with an altered menu.The counsel listed the nutritional value of the new menu, saying that it was well above the stipulated value. He argued that the petitioner, also an advocate, filed a public interest litigation “for raising unfounded and unverified allegations and for publicity.” He pointed out that the petitioner is a member of the Save Lakshadweep Forum which is leading the ongoing protests against the administrative reforms in the island.Petitioner’s counsel Peeyus Kottam contended that the decisions of the administration norms would infringe upon the ethnic culture, heritage, food habits and the rights of the residents under Article 19 of the Constitution. He said earlier food items like chicken, fish and eggs should be continued, seeking re-opening of dairy farms.After hearing the replies, a division a bench of Chief Justice S Mani Kumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly dismissed the public interest litigation.The Save Lakshadweep Forum protested against three draft regulations brought in by administrator Patel, saying they will affect the unique culture and tradition of the island.They opposed the move to make the island a tourist destination, ban on cattle slaughter, two-child norm for local body members, liquor licence, goonda law and other new rules.But BJP leaders from the island said some vested interests were provoking local people to stall developmental projects in the island. On May 31 the Kerala assembly had passed a resolution demanding recall of administrator Patel. The administration also maintained that some leaders from Kerala were instigating residents against development projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-dismisses-petition-against-new-lakshadweep-rules-101631904566949.html
18-09-2021||India||Top woman Maoist surrenders in Telangana||A top CPI (Maoist) leader operating from Chhattisgarh surrendered to the Telangana police on Friday on health grounds, the state police chief said.Jajjeri Sammakka alias Sharada (45), who surrendered, is the widow of Haribhushan alias Yapa Narayana, former central committee member of the Maoist party. Haribhushan, who was also former secretary of the Telangana state committee, died of Covid-19 on June 21. Though Sammakka was also believed to have died of Covid-19, the Maoist party issued a statement denying the same.Sammakka, who was Khammam district committee member operating from bordering Chhattisgarh forests, was carrying a reward of ₹5 lakh on her head. Director general of police M Mahendar Reddy, before whom she surrendered, handed over the cheque to her.The DGP later told the media that several Maoist leaders were suffering from Covid-19 but not getting proper treatment in the forests. “We have specific information that many senior Maoist leaders, including central committee members like Azad and Raji Reddy, are willing to surrender and join the mainstream. But the top leadership has not been giving them permission,” he said.Reddy said Sammakka was upset with the party for not providing proper treatment to her husband Haribhushan which led to his death. “The Maoists have lost the people’s support. If they surrender, we shall provide all protection to them,” he said.Sammakka, who hails from Gangaram village of Mahabubabad district, was attracted towards the Maoist party (then called CPI-ML People’s War) in 1994 and she married Haribhushan in 1995. She worked as a squad member between 1997-98 and later became North Telangana Special Zonal Committee member in 1999.Though Sammakka surrendered before the Warangal police in 2008, she returned to the Maoist party in 2011 and became a member of Sabari-Charla area committee in 2016, before being elevated to the Khammam district committee member. She escaped from exchange of fire with the police six times, according to police data.“After her husband’s death due to Covid-19 in June this year, Sammakka lost interest in the party and had been trying to surrender to the police,” the DGP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-woman-maoist-surrenders-in-telangana-101631904508729.html

18-09-2021||India||Congress holds stir on fuel price hike, farm laws||The Congress wished Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his 71st birthday on Friday and observed the day as “unemployment day”, “anti-farmer day” and “high prices day” – the three issues raging in the country -- to mark his alleged “failures”.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi lead the greetings and tweeted, “Happy Birthday, Modi ji.”The party’s frontal organisations, Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and National Students Union of India (NSUI), observed the day as the “national unemployment day”.Justifying the party’s stand, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate cited the examples of Children’s Day, National Integration Day, Sadbhavna Day and Good Governance Day, which are celebrated to mark the birth anniversaries of former prime ministers. “Modi’s birthday is being observed as unemployment day,” she said.“It is the prime minister’s birthday and from this platform, we wish him a happy birthday. We pray for his well being, but we do believe that this day is being celebrated in many parts of the country as unemployment day, anti-farmer day, high prices day, crippled economy day, as winning over your crony capitalists friends day, as ED, IT, CBI raid day, and the corona mismanagement day,” Shrinate told mediapersons.The Congress leader said that the country is paying “a heavy price” for the alleged failures of the Prime Minister over the last seven years.“We do believe that in the last seven years, you have failed on several fronts and we hope and pray that God gives you the wisdom to realise that this is what you led the country to. This is where, you have failed and today as a result, India is paying a heavy price for it,” she said. The Congress, in a XXX, has said that India has the highest rate of unemployment despite Modi’s promises. Jobs are being lost and farmers have been protesting against the contentious farm laws for nine months without a resolution in sight, the party said.The high prices of gas, diesel, petrol, edible oil, pulses, daily essentials are making the lives of people difficult, Shrinate said.“Still, you have put India on sale for a few friends of yours and which is why, it is important that we are calling it the ‘punjipati poojan divas’ (crony capitalist friends day),” she said.The Congress, along with at least 14 other parties, has planned to hold protests across the country for 10 days to demonstrate against the PM’s Bharatiya Janata Party.

18-09-2021||India||SC seeks ₹30 lakh as deposit from firms after challenge to award of tender||To curb misuse by frivolous litigants who challenge award of tender processes before High Courts, the Supreme Court on Friday set an example by directing deposit of over ₹30 lakh towards litigation costs and other expenses incurred by the successful bidder and the Tamil Nadu government in defending multiple rounds of litigation over a state government tender issued in October last year for supply of hologram excise labels on liquor bottles sold by state.The top court also set aside the Madras high court order of April 29, 2021 directing the state to float fresh tenders with generic specifications and noted the present reality where every tender is challenged before Court either by parties who did not take part in bidding or in public interest litigations.The Court cautioned High Courts from falling into an error by sitting as an “appellate authority” on technology and commercial expediency in tender matters and said that the Courts should only consider whether the choice of decision to award the tender was “lawful” and not whether it was “sound”.Justifying award of costs, the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy said, “There seems to be often hesitancy in our judicial system to impose costs, presuming as if it is a reflection on the counsel. This is not the correct approach. In a tussle for enforcement of rights against a State different principle apply but in commercial matters costs must follow the cause.”Based on counsel fees and other actual expenses incurred by the successful bidders – Uflex Limited and Montage Enterprises – as well as Tamil Nadu Government, the bench ordered the corporate entities who challenged the tender before the High Court - Kumbhat Holographics and Alpha Lasertek India LLP – to equally share the burden of costs of over ₹23.25 lakh to the successful bidders and ₹7.58 lakh to the state government within four weeks.The bench said, “The tender jurisdiction was created for scrutiny of commercial matters and, thus, where continuously parties seek to challenge award of tenders, we are of the view that the succeeding party must get costs and the party which loses must pay costs.” The Court noted that the salutary principles governing award of costs are that it should ordinarily follow the event, ought to be realistic keeping in view the ever increasing litigation expenses, and must serve the purpose of curbing frivolous and vexatious litigation.The genesis of the litigation in the present case was a notice inviting tender for production and supply of polyester based hologram excise labels to be pasted across the liquor bottle caps sold by the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation. The notice issued on October 1, 2020 set out the technical specifications and eligibility criteria.Two companies - Kumbhat Holographics and Alpha Lasertek challenged the tender conditions before the High Court claiming that the tender eligibility criteria were tailor-made to favour Uflex and Montage Enterprises. The single judge of Madras High Court dismissed their petition in February 2021 but a Division Bench reversed this finding ordering fresh award of tenders. This decision was challenged in the top court by Uflex and Montage.Uflex argued in Supreme Court that the two companies before the High Court had not bid for the tender as one did not meet the benchmark of having eight-year experience in supplying holograms while the other was a partnership concern. The petitioners told the Supreme Court that the High Court committed an error by examining the funding pattern of the successful bidders.Faulting the HC, the top court said, “The present case is not one of an inter-corporate battle or of minority shareholders claiming the rights or any debts due, where the principle of lifting the corporate veil should be applied….It is thus our view that the Division Bench has fallen into an error in almost sitting as an appellate authority on technology and commercial expediency which is not the role which a Court ought to play.”Merely because a company is more efficient and obtains better technology, makes more competitive bids and, thus, succeeds more cannot be a factor to deprive that company of commercial success, the bench observed. The Court found that this exactly was the position in the present case where the two original petitioners endeavoured “to continuously create impediments in the way of the succeeding party merely because they themselves had not so succeeded.”The ground reality today, the top court said, is that almost no tender remains unchallenged with unsuccessful parties or parties not even participating in the tender approaching High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution.“A tenderer or contractor with a grievance can always seek damages in a civil court and thus, attempts by unsuccessful tenderers with imaginary grievances, wounded pride and business rivalry, to make mountains out of molehills of some technical/procedural violation or some prejudice to self, and persuade courts to interfere by exercising power of judicial review, should be resisted,” the bench held.The supreme court on Friday directed a deposit of over ₹30 lakh towards litigation costs and other expenses incurred by a successful bidder, and the Tamil Nadu government in defending multiple rounds of litigation over a state government tender issued in October last year for the supply of hologram excise labels on liquor bottles sold by state.

Has it been de-notified or the masquerading is still going on?” the Punjab Congress chief tweeted.Sidhu also posted a video message in which he accused the AAP of tearing copies of the central laws in the Delhi assembly to “stage a drama”. Chadha, who is also national spokesperson of the AAP, got back at the Congress leader by raking up his rift with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. “The Rakhi Sawant of Punjab politics – Navjot Singh Sidhu – has received a scolding from Congress high command for nonstop rant against Capt. Therefore today, for a change, he went after Arvind Kejriwal. Wait till tomorrow for he shall resume his diatribe against Capt with vehemence,” he tweeted.Responding to the AAP leader’s personal dig in equal measure, Sidhu tweeted, “They say man descended from the apes and the monkeys. Looking at your mind @raghav_chadha I believe you are still descending! You still haven’t answered my question about notifying the Farm Laws by your Government (sic)”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-raghav-chadha-exchange-barbs-over-farm-laws-congress-infighting-in-punjab-101631903489118.html
18-09-2021||India||Wants to be part of solution to climate crisis: Yadav at Biden-led meet||Combating climate crisis is a shared global challenge and our response must be based on the fundamental principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said on Friday as he represented India at the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) convened virtually by US President Joe Biden.The minister also said that promises of climate finance and low-cost technology transfer from developed to developing nations must be fulfilled without delay. “Developing countries have consistently risen to the challenge through enhancement of ambition and acceleration of actions. Climate justice requires that the promises of climate finance and low-cost technology transfer from developed countries to developing countries must be fulfilled without any further delays,” Yadav said.Besides this, the Union minister also pointed out that though India’s share of the world population is 17 per cent but the country’s share in cumulative historical emissions is just 4 per cent. The current annual emissions are only 5.2 per cent of the global emissions and the per capita emissions are about a third of the global average, he said.“It is clear that we are not a part of the problem, but we want to be a part of the solution to the climate crisis,” he said.“The world needs rapid, sustained, and deep emission cuts in this decade to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels,” Yadav added.Two international reports released on Friday suggested the world is far behind from meeting the Paris Agreement goals. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)’s NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions) Synthesis report said the world is on track for 2.7 degree warming over pre-industrial levels based on current pledges by countries on mitigating the climate crisis.Another report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) flagged that developed countries had not delivered on their promise of mobilising 100 billion dollars a year even in 2019.Following his submission at the forum, Yadav tweeted: “Represented India at the Major Economies Forum convened by @POTUS today. Mentioned that India believes the world needs rapid, sustained and deep emission cuts in this decade rather than setting distant targets.”“Reiterated the centrality of Climate Justice as highlighted by PM @NarendraModi Ji at various forums, which requires that the promises of climate finance and low-cost technology transfer from developed countries to developing countries, must be fulfilled without delay,” he added.In his speech, Yadav also said that India’s NDCs are ambitious and are a significant contribution towards achieving the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. “Further, we will ensure that our successive nationally determined contributions reflect an ambitious progression over the existing ones, as required under the Paris Agreement,” he said.India has an ambitious target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, he said. “This is a high bar by any measure. In fact, it is amongst the most ambitious targets in the world. Our solar installed capacity has increased 15 times in the last six years alone. We have set up the International Solar Alliance to harness the energy of the sun and foster international cooperation in the sector,” he said, adding that India’s non-fossil fuel installed power capacity at 153.88 GW is already 39.64% of the total installed capacity, which indicates the country is likely to exceed one of the elements of its NDCs soon.India’s NDC consists of three main elements --an economy-wide emissions intensity target of 33%–35% below 2005 levels, electric power capacity target of 40% installed capacity from non-fossil-based energy resources by 2030 (conditional to international support), and creating a carbon sink expansion target of creating an additional (cumulative) carbon sink of 2.5–3 GtCO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.“The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report reaffirms that cumulative emissions up to net zero will determine the eventual global temperature that is reached by the end of the century. Global carbon budget is a finite resource, and India has used up far less than its fair share,” he said, reiterating that India’s per capita emissions are about a third of the global average.The MEF comes six weeks before the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, which will set the course for global climate efforts over the coming decade.Ahead of the UNFCCC releasing its NDC synthesis report which captures the pledges of countries against the Paris Agreement goals, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres issued a strong warning to G20 countries.“Today’s report from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on the Nationally Determined Contributions of all Parties to the Paris Agreement shows that the world is on a catastrophic pathway to 2.7-degrees of heating. This is breaking the promise made six years ago to pursue the 1.5-degree Celsius goal of the Paris Agreement. Failure to meet this goal will be measured in the massive loss of lives and livelihoods,” he said in a statement.“G20 nations account for 80% of global emissions. Their leadership is needed more than ever. The decisions they take now will determine whether the promise made at Paris is kept or broken. Before COP 26 all nations should submit a more ambitious NDC that help to place the world on a 1.5-degree pathway. We also need developed nations to finally deliver on the US 100 billion commitment promised over a decade ago in support to developing countries,” Guterres added urging a 45% cut in emissions by 2030 to reach carbon neutrality by mid-century. The NDC synthesis report suggests there has been an increase of 16% in emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 levels.The OECD on Friday published ‘Climate Finance Provided and Mobilised by Developed Countries’ report with updated data from 2019.At the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries had committed to a collective goal of mobilising USD 100 billion per year by 2020 for climate action in developing countries.Since 2015, the OECD has produced analyses of progress towards this goal in their reports. This year’s report shows that in 2019, total climate finance provided and mobilised by developed countries for developing countries was USD 79.6 billion in 2019, an increase of only 2% from 2018. A more than USD 20 billion annual jump would, therefore, be required to meet the USD 100 billion goal for 2020.“Climate finance is key to unlocking emissions reductions and action to adapt to #ClimateChange - today’s @OECD report shows there is much further to goDeveloped countries must urgently step up their climate finance pledges to deliver on the $100bn goal,” tweeted Alok Sharma, COP 26 President responding to the OECD report.In its report last month, the IPCC said the world may have lost the opportunity to keep global warming under 1.5 degree C over pre-industrial levels. The 1.5 degree C global warming threshold is likely to be breached in the next 10 to 20 years by 2040 even if carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decline rapidly to net zero around 2050, it noted.“While India’s emphasis on climate justice and climate finance is irrefutable, its domestic transition to renewables, electrification and hydrogen can lead to emission reduction and job creation. Rich countries need to step up concessional climate finance which had stagnated even before the pandemic,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, Climate, World Resources Institute, India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wants-to-be-part-of-solution-to-climate-crisis-union-minister-at-biden-led-meet-101631903306803.html

Bantu Sharma of Railway Protection Force was shot dead by the terrorist near Wanpoh at around 6 pm. He was rushed to Government Medical College, Anantnag, where he succumbed to injuries, the people cited above said. Soon after the incident, the army launched a joint search operation to nab the accused, they added. “Preliminary investigation revealed the terrorists had fired indiscriminately upon the cop near Shamford School, Wanpoh. In the incident, he sustained bullet injuries and was shifted to the hospital where he succumbed injuries,” a police spokesperson said, adding that a case has been registered and a probe is underway. Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference (NC) leader Omar Abdullah were among those who condemned the attack on the constable.“Very sorry to hear about the terrorist attack in Kulgam today that claimed yet another innocent life. Deepest condolences & prayers with Bantoo Sharma ji’s family. May his soul rest in peace,” Mufti posted on Twitter. Abdullah tweeted: “I unequivocally condemn the militant attack in Kulgam district of South Kashmir. My heartfelt condolences to the family & colleagues of Constable Bantoo Sharma of Railway Protection Force who was killed in the line of duty earlier this evening. May his soul rest in peace.” In a statement, Peoples Conference chairman Sajjad Lone said: “Strongly condemn the killing of a policeman in Kulgam. May Allah give patience to the family of Bantu Sharma to bear this loss. And May the killers rot in hell.” This is the second killing of a policeman in Kashmir in the past five days. On Sunday, probationary sub inspector Arshad Ahmad was killed after terrorists shot at him twice from behind in Khanyar area. Friday’s incident also comes amid an increasing attack on police personnel in the Valley, especially in Srinagar city. On August 3, a cop and a civilian were injured when suspected terrorists opened fire at a police rakshak vehicle at Sheraz Chowk.Four days later, another cop was killed in a terrorist attack in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district.In June, inspector Pervaiz Ahmad, who worked with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), was killed after terrorists opened fire at him at Nowgam, near his residence in the outskirts of Srinagar. An off-duty policeman was shot dead near his house in the Old City’s Saidapora area in the same month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constable-shot-dead-by-terrorists-in-kashmir-second-attack-on-cops-in-5-days-101631903007247.html
18-09-2021||India||TRS pulls out of probe panel on Parliament ruckus||New Delhi: Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has pulled out of a proposed Rajya Sabha panel to look into allegations of misconduct against Opposition MPs during the last day of the monsoon session, becoming the fourth opposition party to withdraw from the official probe. The Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam earlier declined to join the panel, blaming the government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the ruckus that rocked the Upper House on August 11. TRS initially had agreed to join the panel. But earlier this week, TRS floor leader K Kesava Rao sent a letter to Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, expressing his reluctance to be a part of the probe into the action of Opposition MPs during the furious protests on the last day of the monsoon session, according to officials and TRS functionaries. “We initially agreed. But now we are no more. Even as we condemn any violence or disruption in Parliament, we can’t be a member of this probe,” said a senior TRS leader on condition of anonymity.“TRS doesn’t approve what happened in the Rajya Sabha. But we don’t know what will be the quantum of punishment. We wrote to Naidu that we might not agree with the BJP and other parties. Our position is any action against MPs must be done keeping in mind the dignity of the House,” the senior leader quoted above said. TRS is the fourth party to officially communicate its inability to participate in any probe. A functionary pointed out that apart from TRS’ efforts to maintain a distance with the BJP, TRS chief and Telangana chief minister K ChandrasHekar Rao enjoys close ties with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The second-largest Opposition party, Trinamool Congress, isn’t likely to be invited in the panel because several party lawmakers allegedly were involved in the ruckus. On August 11, in the dying hours of the disruption-hit monsoon session, some opposition MPs clashed with the marshals when the general insurance amendment bill was cleared amid furious protests. At least two marshals submitted a written account of their injuries to the chairperson. Two women MPs of the Congress, Phulo Devi and Chayya Varma, alleged they were manhandled that broke out on the floor of the House. An internal Rajya Sabha secretariat report later said opposition MPs tore papers, obstructed ministers from taking their seats, choked and suffocated one marshal, dragged and pushed another, took videos and even climbed on a LED TV stand.The Opposition denied these charges and blamed the government for the unruly scenes in the House. They said outsiders were brought into the House who used force and physically manhandled members. Naidu later proposed a committee to examine the complaints and the ruckus that took place and said he was “deeply pained” by the incident. The government blamed the Opposition for disrupting Parliament, deviating from Parliamentary procedure and damaging house property. The BJP and its ally, the Janata Dal (United), and some other parties are expected to join the probe. A Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader told HT that if invited, it will also be a part of the panel. “We have not been invited so far. But BJD would be ready to join any such probe. For, we face such troubles in Odisha assembly too even as the disruptors there are the Congress and the BJP,” said a senior BJD leader from the Rajya Sabha. Last week, Congress MP and Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, rejected the proposal of joining the probe panel and wrote to Naidu alleging the investigation committee seemed like a “design to intimidate MPs into silence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trs-pulls-out-of-probe-panel-on-parliament-ruckus-101631902466728.html
18-09-2021||India||No GST on petrol for now, says FM||The apex federal body on indirect tax matters, the Goods and Service Tax (GST) Council, on Friday considered bringing petrol, diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) within the ambit of GST, but decided against it on revenue considerations.Briefing the media about the Council’s decisions, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said: “It was brought on to the table for discussion. Members spoke very clearly that they wouldn’t want it to be included in the GST.”She said Council took up the matter as per the directive of the Kerala High Court, and the court will be informed of its decision.The council, however, reduced tax rates on key Covid-19-related medicines — Itolizumab, Posaconazole, Infliximab, Favipiravir, Casirivimab, Imdevimab, Deoxy-D-Glucose, Bamlanivimab, Etesevimab, and extended duty exemption on other Covid-related drugs: Amphotericin B, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, and anti-coagulants such as Heparin. The reductions and the extensions of the past reduction will last till December 31.The Council also readjusted duty on several items, including tax exemption on goods supplied at Indo-Bangladesh border ‘haats’ (market). HT reported the plans to do so on Thursday.The Council also decided that online food delivery platforms such as Swiggy and Zomato will collect tax on food items from the consumers for ease of tax administration as GST is a levy on consumption. The move will, however, not impact the end consumer, revenue secretary Tarun Bajaj said.Sitharaman said the Council decided to exempt GST on import of muscular atrophy drugs like Zolgensma and Viltepso for personal use from 12% to zero as these medicines cost crores of rupees.While tax concessions on Covid-related drugs have been extended by three months, the exemptions given previously on related medical equipment will end on September 30.As a result of the tax rejig, consumers will get relief on retro fitment kits for vehicles used by the differently-abled. Fortified rice kernels supplied in welfare schemes will also become cheaper.GST on medicine keytruda, used in treatment of cancer, has been reduced from 12% to 5%, and tax on biodiesel supplied to oil marketing companies for blending with diesel has been reduced from 12% to 5%.Import of leased aircraft has also been exempted from payment of integrated GST (IGST). IGST is levied on inter-state transfer of goods and services and it is shared between the Centre and the state. All imports are treated as inter-state supplies and accordingly IGST is levied on them in addition to the applicable custom duties.Tax rationalisation, mainly undertaken to correct duty anomalies so that manufacturers get full input tax credit, made few items costlier. They are -- ores and concentrates of metals such as iron, copper, aluminium and zinc as they have been moved from 5% slab to 18%.Specified renewable energy devices and parts will now attract 12% GST instead of 5%.Items such as cartons, boxes, bags, packing containers of paper currently attracting 12-18% will now be put in 18% tax bracket.GST on waste and scrap of polyurethanes and other plastics, all kinds of pens, railway parts, locomotives and miscellaneous goods of paper like cards, catalogue, printed material are now shifted from 12% to 18% slab, according to an official statement.Sitharaman said the Council also decided to correct long-pending issue of inverted duty structure suffered by footwear and textiles sectors. “GST rate changes in order to correct inverted duty structure, in footwear and textiles sector, as was discussed in earlier GST council meeting and was deferred for an appropriate time, will be implemented with effect from January 1, 2022,” she said.Briefing the Council’s decision Sitharaman said while the statutory five-year period for compensating states for their revenue losses would end on June 30, 2022, the government would continue compensation cess till April 2026 to service principal and interests on money already borrowed to compensate states.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime, the GST law assured state governments a 14% increase in their annual tax revenue for five years and the Centre committed to meeting any shortfall in revenue through the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and other tobacco commodities. The government raised money from market in 2020-21 and 2021-22 to compensate states for shortfall in the protected revenue as compensation cess was inadequate due to devastation impact of Covid-19 pandemic on businesses.The decision on including fuel in GST has been most widely watched since these products hit record highs in the past year with the centre and states raising their levies on it, as a measure to make up for the revenue lost due to the pandemic.As a result, central and state levies on petrol and diesel are over 50% of their retail prices.Santosh Dalvi, partner and deputy head of indirect tax at KPMG India said, “Amidst revenue concerns expressed by states, the decision to defer inclusion of petroleum products within the ambit of GST will affect petroleum industry and consumers with continual cascading of taxes.”“The big decision to extend the period of GST Compensation Cess till March 2026 in order to service borrowed principal and interest will affect sectors suffering from such cess which expected relief after five years,” he said.MS Mani, senior director at consulting firm Deloitte India said, “The multiple rate changes announced indicates that the GST Council is willing to alter rates in cases where the rates are leading to an inverted duty structure or where there are other valid reasons for changing the rates.”“While food delivery services would constitute e-commerce services, sufficient safeguards need to be taken in subjecting them to GST to ensure that smaller food outlets are protected and consumers do not end up paying more,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-gst-on-petrol-for-now-says-fm-101631902165979.html
18-09-2021||India||Data protection bill may see social media firms lose safe harbour status||The data protection bill, which is currently being reviewed by a joint parliamentary committee (JPC), may lead to social media companies losing their status as an intermediary, or protection from action for third party content, for “selecting, modifying, editing, blocking, muting, amplifying content or removing users from its platform”, if one of the changes proposed to its draft is accepted, people familiar with the matter said.This will effectively make social media companies liable to be penalised for taking action against any content, whether pursuant with law, following government orders or in accordance with its terms of service, say experts. The proposed move is to treat the companies as publishers instead of intermediaries. The data protection act, the proposals suggest, will supersede will the information technology act, section 79 of which provides intermediaries the protection from penal action for what users post, or third party content. These are part of changes being considered by the JPC which is studying the personal data protection bill, sent to it for further deliberation after parliamentarians objected to the version introduced in parliament in 2019, the officials said.The final report of the JPC is yet to be tabled and the committee has now sought until the winter session to submit its report. The joint parliamentary committee did a clause-by-clause reading in December last year but with a new chairperson, BJP MP PP Chaudhary, taking over; there are concerns that the panel may have to start discussions from scratch.To be sure, the central government will decide the final shape of the bill that will be presented to parliament for legislation.According to the discussions at present, one of the officials aware of it said, the future law could make it contingent upon social media companies to not “initiate transmission”, in keeping with the IT Act, if they want to retain their intermediary status.The companies will also have to ensure that they do not indulge or associate in any act which is against the public or state policy, the other proposals suggest. The bill will also define a threshold of users or impact to determine which social media companies constitute significant data fiduciaries or a class of intermediaries who will fall under this provision, according to the proposals. The proposal for significant impact covers social media firms that could influence the sovereignty and integrity of India, electoral democracy, security of the state or public order, the person cited above said, adding that the proposals proceed to venture a definition of a social media platform. Under the information technology act, 2000, an intermediary is not liable for any third-party information, data, or communication link made available or hosted by them -- a legal principle that is known as giving such companies safe harbour. This stems from Section 79 of the IT Act, which makes it conditional: an intermediary must not initiate the transmission, select the receiver of the transmission, and select or modify the information contained in the transmission. The changes in the much-awaited data protection law also come at a time when the government is at loggerheads with social media firms over content moderation and compliance with the new social media and intermediary guidelines. In May, Twitter tagged posts by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders “manipulated media” for carrying purported screenshots of a document that sought to implicate the opposition Congress in a plan to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government cited “percepts of natural justice” to order Twitter to remove the tags, which the company has left up. The additional clauses that, which set to take away the safe harbour status, are being considered under section 28 of the personal data protection bill, which will now be known as the data protection bill as it will also address non-personal data, the person cited above said. According to Supreme Court lawyer and founder of Cyber Saathi NS Nappinai, the larger issue is how much the proposed legislation may be in excess of or possibly even negate existing laws. “Assuming these amendments are being proposed, substantial portions such as ‘initiate, select or modify’ already form part of section 79 IT Act,” Nappinai said. “Other additions proposed may not be specifically adverted to under IT Act but may be read into them with checks and balances. It would, therefore, behoove the committee to evaluate the necessity for this addition and in doing so ensure both harmony between the provisions under both enactments and provide for checks and balances to ensure that protections under existing laws are not negated or free speech stifled due to ambiguity.” She added that without the above, the proposed amendments would amount to government authorities shooting themselves in the foot. “The additions proposed will effectively negate all the benefits that accrue to victims and also government’s rights which form part of the IT Act and Rules framed therein,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/data-protection-bill-may-see-social-media-firms-lose-safe-harbour-status-101631902107565.html
18-09-2021||India||Afghanistan power change not inclusive: Modi to SCO||The world community must decide collectively on recognising the new regime in Kabul in view of questions about its legitimacy because the change of power in Afghanistan was “not inclusive” and done “without negotiation”, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday.In his virtual address to a joint meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) that was convened in Dushanbe to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, Modi said the international community must ensure Afghan soil is not used to spread terrorism.He called on SCO members to develop “strict and common norms” based on the principle of zero tolerance towards terror to counter any terrorism emanating from Afghanistan’s territory. The norms should include a code of conduct to prevent cross-border terror and terror financing and a system for their enforcement, he added.Earlier in the day, Modi said in another virtual address, this one to the SCO Summit, that the developments in Afghanistan highlighted challenges faced by the region, including the impact of growing radicalisation on peace and security.India has watched warily since the Taliban took over Afghanistan on August 15 following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. The establishment of a hardline setup by the Taliban that includes several key members of the Haqqani Network and the presence in Afghanistan of thousands of fighters from Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are among India’s key security concerns.Along with its partners, India has called for the creation of an inclusive government in Afghanistan that protects the rights of women and minorities. India has also insisted Afghan soil must not be used to plan or carry out terror attacks against other countries. Modi reiterated these concerns in his address to the SCO-CSTO meeting.Modi listed four issues that he said should be the focus of regional cooperation on Afghanistan – the new regime put in place in Kabul, the spread of terrorist and extremist ideologies if instability continues in Afghanistan, the possibility of the uncontrolled flow of drugs, illegal weapons and human trafficking, and the serious humanitarian crisis in the war-torn country.He said that the “change of power in Afghanistan was not inclusive and has taken place without negotiation”, and that this raises “questions about the acceptability of the new regime”. The representation of all sections of Afghan society, including women and minorities, is important, he said.“Therefore, it is essential that the world community decides on the recognition of the new regime in a thoughtful and collective manner. India supports the central role of the UN on this issue,” Modi said, speaking in Hindi.Modi warned that continued “instability and fundamentalism” in Afghanistan would lead to the spread of terrorist and extremist ideologies around the world, and that “other extremist groups may be encouraged to seek power through violence”.All countries must work together to ensure that Afghan soil isn’t used to spread terrorism in any country, and SCO members should develop “strict and common norms” on this issue based on zero tolerance for terrorism, he said. These norms, which should include a code of conduct to prevent cross-border terror and terror financing, could become a template for global anti-terror cooperation.SCO’s Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) mechanism can help monitor any flow of drugs, illegal weapons and human trafficking from Afghanistan. “A large amount of advanced weapons remain in Afghanistan. Due to these, there will be a risk of instability in the entire region,” Modi said.“From this month, India is presiding over the council of [RATS]. We have developed proposals for practical cooperation on this topic,” he said.All countries must work together to ensure humanitarian aid reaches Afghanistan, which is facing a serious humanitarian crisis, Modi said. People have been hit by the interruption of financial and trade flows and the Covid-19 pandemic, and India stands ready to deliver food and medicines to “our Afghan friends”, he added.In his address to the SCO Summit, Modi also said the grouping should develop a joint approach to fight radicalisation and extremism, and called for developing a network between moderate, tolerant and inclusive Islamic institutions in the member states.“The 20th anniversary of SCO is a suitable occasion to think about the future of the SCO. I believe the biggest challenges in this region are related to peace, security and trust deficit and the root cause of these problems is increasing radicalisation,” Modi said, speaking in Hindi.“Recent developments in Afghanistan have made this challenge more apparent. The SCO should take an initiative on this issue,” he said, recalling Central Asia’s historic role as a “bastion of moderate and progressive cultures and values”.Modi also welcomed Iran as a new member state of SCO, and Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar as new dialogue partners, saying the expansion reflects the grouping’s growing influence.The current members of SCO are China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan. Afghanistan, Belarus and Mongolia have observer status with SCO, while dialogue partners include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Turkey.Modi addressed both the meetings in Dushanbe virtually while external affairs minister S Jaishankar participated in person and held meetings with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. Jaishankar also held talks with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Tajik President Emomali Rahmon and with his counterparts from Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-power-change-not-inclusive-modi-to-sco-101631902105989.html
18-09-2021||India||Vaccination boost marks PM Modi’s birthday||With over 23.1 million shots of the Covid-19 vaccine administered on Friday, according to data available at 11pm on the Co-WIN dashboard, India’s inoculation drive nearly doubled its previous single-day record for doses delivered, in a major push to the drive by several states to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday.Till 11pm on Friday, 23,141,139 jabs were administered, according to the government data. The previous record for single-day dose administration was set on August 31, with 12.87 million doses administered across the country.Friday was the fourth day that India has crossed the 10 million mark of daily doses in the past month. The over 23 million shots was a historic figure – one that has so far been exceeded only by numbers from China, where the government has a strict control over data opacity and directions to its citizens.“Every Indian would be proud of today’s record vaccination numbers. I acknowledge our doctors, innovators, administrators, nurses, health care and all front-line workers who have toiled to make the vaccination drive a success. Let us keep boosting vaccination to defeat Covid-19,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.“A gift to the Prime Minister on behalf of health workers and people of the country. On the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, India has crossed the historic figure of administering 2 crore vaccine doses in a day, setting a new record. Well done India!” Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted in Hindi. A day earlier, Mandaviya called for a major push to the vaccination drive to mark Modi’s 71st birthday, saying it would be the perfect gift.The total number of doses administered in the country has now crossed 792 million, with 197 million people being fully vaccinated and 398 having received a single dose of the vaccine, according to government data. When seen alongside the country’s projected adult population of 940 million (according to the Census of India’s National Commission on Population), this means that 63.3% of people above the age of 18 years have received vaccine shots – 42.3% have been partially vaccinated and 21% having received both doses.Buoyed by Friday’s massive push, India’s pace of vaccination, which has been extremely patchy in the past, has now entered its best phase. The seven-day average of daily dose administration, which denotes the average daily pace of the vaccine drive, has now soared to9.3 million doses a day – the highest ever recorded since India’s mass vaccination drive commenced on January 16.States across the country – led largely by the ones ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – were preparing for a record vaccination day as part of three-week celebrations to mark the Prime Minister’s 71st birthday. The Bihar government had announced it will administer 3 million shots on Friday; Gujarat targeted 3.5 million for the day; Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka said they were preparing for a massive vaccination drive, and Uttar Pradesh launched a 20-day ‘Seva Aur Samarpan Abhiyaan’.According to Co-WIN data analysed by HT, at least eight states – Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttarakhand – had set new records of daily dose administration on Friday.This push, however, came at a time when the daily dose administration was slowly declining.In the week leading to Friday, the seven-day average of daily doses had dropped to 6.9 million from a peak of 8.5 million (in the week ended September 1). Numbers had dropped particularly over Wednesday and Thursday when 6.7 million and 6.8 million doses were administered across the country. This appeared to be caused by a drop in daily dose administration in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Assam and Karnataka, which had seen daily numbers fall between 40%-70% on Wednesday and Thursday from the preceding week’s average.While the pace of the drive has improved, particularly from the low rates seen in previous months, there is still room for progress if India wants to achieve its stated target of vaccinating its entire adult population of 940 million by the end of 2021, a commitment the government has made in a submission to the Supreme Court.For this, the country needs to administer 10.4 million doses every day till the end of the year, data shows. While India has matched (and exceeded) this required rate on a few days (including Friday, where it more than doubled this required rate) the main challenge will be to do so on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-boost-marks-pm-modi-s-birthday-101631902047275.html
18-09-2021||India||SII to supply 200 million doses, Bharat Biotech 35 million shots in September||Serum Institute of India (SII) is expected to supply 200 million doses of Covishield and Bharat Biotech 35 million doses of Covaxin this month, government officials said on Friday, while adding that supplies have now reached a level where they have surpassed the demand.The September supplies number quoted by the official represent a significant boost. Last month, India administered 185 million doses. “In terms of Covid-19 vaccine supplies, we have reached the stage where government is able to provide states the volume of doses they demand based on their vaccine administration capacity. No state can now be seen complaining that they were in a position to administer more vaccine doses than what they were administering in a single day but were not doing that because of the short vaccine supply from the Centre,” said the senior government functionary, asking not to be named. On Friday, more than 20 million doses were administered, making it a record. It was only the fourth time the country crossed the number of 10 million vaccinations a day. The number of doses available will further get a boost of close to 10 million doses when shipments of the recently approved Zydus Cadila ZyCov-D vaccine arrive. These are scheduled to be available either by September-end or by early October, according to a government official privy to the development. The number of available and unutilised vaccine doses has also seen a jump lately, with 50 million doses available on an average almost each day for states in the month of September. “Close to 77 million doses were pending with states on Friday for use in the programme (vaccinations on Friday). The availability, on average, has been around 50 million doses for a while now, and that speaks volumes about how there is no vaccine shortage anymore in the country,” the official quoted above said. “We are fortunate enough to be able to produce the vaccines locally, and the central government has provided enough support to companies in research and development, and also monetary support,” the official added. The Centre has also asked states to prioritise recipients due for their second doses, and to even conduct special campaigns, if required, earmarking certain days and centres for the exercise so that no one misses their second dose. Vaccine manufacturers typically inform the government about availability of doses 4-5 days before the start of a new month, helping plan the distribution across the country. Nearly 62% of country’s all adult population has received at least first Covid-19 vaccine doses, and 20% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the government data. India targets vaccinating all adults by the end of December 2021. “Vaccine hesitancy is more or less down now, and we have been administering on average about 6-7 million doses per day for a while,” said the official, adding that the government will look at exporting doses once the country’s population is taken care of. Experts say while the vaccination rate seems to have improved, still it was too early to announce that vaccine hesitancy was over among people. “To an extent it does look like that many of those who are coming to take the shot now are those who were initially hesitant to get vaccinated. However, to say that vaccine hesitancy is over would be too early to say because we have to look at how north and central Indian states do as these are the regions that are known to be vaccine hesitant even for childhood vaccinations. The hesitancy is actually seen in states such as UP, MP, etc, and once these states cover 60-70% population with first dose then it will be a big deal. Mid to late October will be crucial,” said Chandrakant Lahariya, senior public health and vaccine expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-to-supply-200-million-doses-bharat-biotech-35-million-shots-in-september-101631901987547.html
18-09-2021||India||India, China agree to work towards speedy resolution of LAC row||India and China have agreed their military and diplomatic officials should meet again for discussions on speedily resolving remaining issues related to the stand-off on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the external affairs ministry said on Friday after a meeting of foreign ministers of the two countries.A readout issued by China’s foreign ministry after the meeting between foreign minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Dushanbe was silent on further meetings and only spoke of consolidating the “disengagement results of the frontline troops”.Jaishankar said in a set of tweets that he discussed disengagement in the border areas with Wang, and “underlined that progress in this regard is essential for restoration of peace and tranquillity, which is the basis for development of bilateral ties”.This was the first meeting between the two ministers since July 14, when they held talks on the sidelines of a meeting of SCO foreign ministers in Dushanbe. India and China have been locked in a border row for 16 months, a phase that witnessed a deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley and saw tensions spiral between the rival armies on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso last year.After several rounds of military and diplomatic talks, India and China withdrew frontline troops and armoured units from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February. In August, the two sides ended forward deployment at Gogra and dismantled all temporary structures in this area.India has linked the overall normalisation of bilateral relations to disengagement at other friction points on the LAC, including Hot Springs and Depsang. China, however, has said the LAC standoff should be delinked from other aspects of relations between the two sides.The external affairs ministry’s statement on Friday quoted Jaishankar as saying, it “was necessary to ensure progress in resolution of remaining issues so as to restore peace and tranquillity along the LAC”. It added, “In this regard, the ministers agreed that military and diplomatic officials of the two sides should meet again and continue their discussions to resolve the remaining issues at the earliest.”Jaishankar also recalled that Wang said at their July 14 meeting that India-China relations “were at low ebb”, and that both sides agreed a “prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of the either side as it was impacting the relationship in a negative manner”.The Chinese foreign ministry’s readout quoted Wang as saying that China has “always been positive” to seek a solution to the standoff and that the “overall situation in the border area was gradually de-escalated” because of recent communication between diplomatic and military officials.Wang hoped that “India will meet China halfway to move the situation towards stability and shift it from urgent dispute settlement to regular management and control”. The readout added that both sides “need to consolidate the disengagement results of the frontline troops, and strictly abide by the protocols and agreements and the consensus reached between the two countries” to safeguard peace and tranquillity and prevent “recurrence of border-related issues”.Wang also said China and India must continue to be “opportunities of development to each other rather than threats” and push cooperation onto a “healthy and stable track”.The external affairs ministry said the two ministers also exchanged views on recent global developments, and Jaishankar said India “had never subscribed to any clash of civilisations theory”. He said India and China “had to deal with each other on merits and establish a relationship based on mutual respect”.The statement added, “For this, it was necessary that China avoid viewing our bilateral relations from the perspective of its relations with third countries. Asian solidarity would depend on the example set by India-China relations.”Though the statement didn’t give details, Jaishankar’s remarks were an apparent reference to the situation in Afghanistan, where China has been working closely with its traditional ally Pakistan since the Taliban takeover in Kabul. China has provided aid worth millions of dollars to the Taliban setup and is among the handful of countries that have kept open their embassies in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-agree-to-work-towards-speedy-resolution-of-lac-row-101631901927179.html
18-09-2021||India||Why World Bank junked its ease of doing business rankings||The World Bank Group has junked, due to irregularities, its “Doing Business Reports”, after an external investigation showed senior former bank leaders including then World Bank chief executive Kristalina Georgieva had been working with economists to upgrade China’s 2018 ranking.According to the Doing Business 2018 report, China had a score of 65.3 with a global ranking of 78, the same notch as the previous year’s. If adjusted for parameters such as Starting a Business and (ease in) Getting Credit, China’s ease of doing business score would have fallen that year to 64.5, translating to a global ranking of 85, a later World Bank review showed. “Taking as given the published data for all other countries, China’s global ranking in Doing Business 2018 would have been 85, a decline of 7 places relative to the previous year,” the Bank’s review states.The rankings have acquired the status of a prestige tag for emerging economies and become a key influencer of wide-ranging policies. They purport to show which countries are most welcoming of private investment and business. The action came after an external investigation’s findings that the rankings could be manipulated. The investigation implicated Georgieva, who is now managing director of the International Monetary Fund, the global lender of last resort, and former World Bank president Jim Yong Kim. Georgieva has denied wrongdoing, saying in statement on Friday: “I disagree fundamentally with the findings and interpretations... ” The rankings have set in motion far-reaching economic policies that focus on winding down red tape and easing regulations to facilitate quicker investments, setting off global competition to reach the top. “After data irregularities on Doing Business 2018 and 2020 were reported internally in June 2020, World Bank management paused the next Doing Business report and initiated a series of reviews and audits of the report and its methodology,” the World Bank Group said in a statement on Thursday.The trust countries repose in the Doing Business Report and its rankings is critical for policymaking in many developing nations to bring down poverty levels and push income-generating investment, acting on the bank’s advice. The World Bank Group further said: “Going forward, we will be working on a new approach to assessing the business and investment climate. We are deeply grateful to the efforts of the many staff members who have worked diligently to advance the business climate agenda, and we look forward to harnessing their energies and abilities in new ways.” The World Bank’s board said its current executive directors authorised the release of “Investigation of Data Irregularities in Doing Business 2018 and Doing Business 2020 – Investigation Findings and Report to the Board of Executive Directors”. This is an independent external review of the “facts and circumstances around previously reported data irregularities in the 2018 and 2020 Doing Business Reports,” the bank said. This investigation’s findings released by the bank showed senior officials may have manipulated rankings. Among 190 countries, India ranked 63rd in Doing Business in 2020. A 63rd rank meant India has improved its ranking by 79 positions in the five years between 2014 and 2019. “This (World) Bank publishes these data, but how seriously it is to be taken depends on countries. Nobody enforces them. This government has given it utmost importance than most previous governments as have many other comparable countries,” noted economist Abhijit Sen said. The then World Bank president Jim Yong Kim too has been implicated by the investigation. “For instance, President Kim discussed the report and China’s performance with senior Chinese government officials on September 12; the then executive director for China met with members of the Bank’s East Asia and Pacific regional office on September 14 to inform them that if China’s rankings improved within ‘everyone would be relieved’,” the investigation stated.“It was against that backdrop that the data irregularities pertaining to China occurred,” the probe said. According to the investigation’s findings, during the 2020 Doing Business Report, at the direction of a senior World Bank Group official, Saudi Arabia’s ranking was upgraded, displacing Jordan. “In August 2019, the Doing Business team generated a draft of its Top Improvers list for Doing Business 2020 that had Jordan as the top reformer with Saudi Arabia placing second,” the investigation states. The places of the two countries changed in the final report. “The following month, September 2019, Mr Djankov -- by then serving as the DEC director -- instructed the Doing Business team to find a way to alter the data such that Jordan fell from its first-place position in the Top Improvers List”. Simeon Djankov was one of the founders of the Doing Business Report, who at the time was serving as the adviser to Georgieva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-world-bank-junked-its-ease-of-doing-business-rankings-101631901865980.html

18-09-2021||Today's||In Uttar Pradesh, does the BJP have an edge?||For the next six months, politics in India will revolve around politics in Uttar Pradesh (UP).
18-09-2021||Today's||We must condemn communal rhetoric||I’m not being disingenuous, nor do I mean to be naïve, but how do you view Yogi Adityanath’s constant taunting of Muslims? It makes me squirm.More importantly, it distresses me because I can hear echoes of Germany in the 1930s, South Africa in the 1960s, and Uganda in the 1970s. And that’s despite the fact I’m Hindu. In comparison, it must terrify our fellow Muslim citizens. Yet, it’s accepted in silence by Adityanath’s party, its president and, even, the prime minister (PM). And though reported by the media, it’s only rarely criticised, leave aside condemned.Consider the most recent example. In a speech last Sunday, boasting of how much he has done, Adityanath still found a way of weaving in an attack on Muslims. “Were you getting this ration before 2017?” he asked. This was his answer: “Because back then those saying ‘abba jaan’ used to digest the ration… earlier those saying ‘abba jaan’ used to loot jobs meant for the poor.” And if that wasn’t enough, he promised to “definitely teach a lesson to the Romeos saying ‘abba jaan’.”This wasn’t the first time, and I’m certain it won’t be the last occasion he’s picked on India’s Muslims. “How can our heroes be Mughals?” he asked last year, perhaps ignorant of the fact Akbar is considered one of the greatest emperors of all time. A year earlier, while campaigning, he accused his opponents of favouring “Ali” while he has faith only in “Bajrang Bali”.The truth is, Adityanath has never hidden his prejudice. In fact, he revels in it. “If one Hindu girl is converted we will convert 100 Muslim girls”, is perhaps the most-quoted example of his prejudice. But there are others that are worse. On September 7, 2014, he claimed: “In places where there is 10-20% minority population, stray communal incidents take place. Where there are 20-35% of them, serious communal riots take place and where they are more than 35%, there is no place for non-Muslims.”In 2005, 12 years before he came to power, he declared this ambition: “I will not stop till I turn Uttar Pradesh and India into a Hindu rashtra.” No doubt, it explains his behaviour. In fact, I presume it’s the intellectual underpinning of his prejudice. But what could possibly explain the way his hateful comments are received by his party and by the press?Ours is a secular country and Muslims are equal citizens. So, what does the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president’s and PM’s silence amount to? It’s a question that’s crying out for an answer.Do they accept Adityanath is undermining our democracy and vitiating the principles of our Constitution? Is his prejudice threatening the peace and harmony of our country? Isn’t this sort of prejudice repugnant in a politician who some believe could one day be our PM?I don’t know their answers, but the silence suggests they’re very possibly “no”. Otherwise, surely, they would have spoken out, if not acted? In which case, there’s another question we need to ask: Is Adityanath reflecting their views, even though they may be reluctant to voice the same thoughts themselves? This, too, needs to be answered.Let me now come to the press. Some of us see ourselves as the moral guardians of society. Others as a guard dog that barks and cannot be silenced. Yet, of the six papers I read every day, only two reported Adityanath’s “abba jaan” taunts. They were also the only ones to criticise him, but merely mildly.We bristle with anger when Indians are mistreated abroad but seethe when the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) speaks about our treatment of Muslims in Kashmir. But remember what Sardar Patel said: “It is for us who happen to be in a majority to think about what the minorities feel, and how we in their position would feel if we are treated in the manner they are treated.”That’s why the silence with which we respond to Adityanath is a terrible mistake.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/we-must-condemn-communal-rhetoric-101631976215904.html
