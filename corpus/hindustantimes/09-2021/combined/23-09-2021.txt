Students who have already appeared for the NEET exam this year are worried about how medical admissions will happen, and other issues they might face, if the NEET exam is scrapped in Maharashtra for this year. The state government is now going to review the entire NEET process. “The decision taken by the Tamil Nadu government has forced us to rethink the NEET exams on which admissions to medical courses and the careers of thousands of students are dependant. We are now going to collect all necessary information about this year’s examination and soon declare our stand on it,” said Amit Deshmukh, state minister for medical education. On September 13, a bill was passed in the Tamil Nadu assemble to scrap the NEET examination in the state. It was followed by a demand raised by Nana Patole, Maharashtra state Congress chief, to follow suit.“We are worried about the NEET exams. I studied hard to crack this test and if it is cancelled then how will admissions happen. I don’t want to miss a chance to get admission to a good medical college,” said Sharvari Khatri, an aspirant student. Another student Meenal Dudhane said, “Due to Covid we are already in stress over online studying and exams. Finally something good was happening as NEET was conducted. If that is cancelled now then what will be the substitute for it? There are lakhs of students appearing for NEET every year from the state and state government should think before taking any decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cong-demand-to-scrap-neet-in-maha-has-students-worried-101632421499037.html
23-09-2021||Other||Allahabad HC dismisses appeal of four murder convicts||The Allahabad high court has dismissed an appeal challenging life sentence of four convicts who had killed one Riazuddin by crushing him under a tractor nearly 18 years ago as he was selected as “Shiksha Mitra” (para teacher) while one of the accused Pratap Singh from the same village could not succeed and so harboured animosity against him.Riazuddin was a resident of Nauli Fatuabad village of Buduan district and the incident had occurred in November 2003. The court affirmed the lower court judgment and directed three out of the four appellants, Sadhu, Devendra and Srikrishna, who were on bail, to surrender immediately before the trial court to serve out the sentence. The fourth convict Pratap Singh is already in jail. His bail plea was not allowed on an earlier date.The bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice JJ Munir passed the order in an appeal filed by Pratap Singh, Sadhu, Devendra and Srikrishna who were convicted by the court of additional sessions judge, Budaun. The prosecution case was that a First Information Report (FIR) was lodged on November 11, 2003 by Sirajudin, father of the deceased, at Ushait police station of Budaun.As per the FIR, on November 11, 2003, Riazuddin was riding a tonga to Kadar Chowk when he was intercepted at an isolated place and waylaid by the four appellants who came along riding a tractor. They forced Riazuddin to get down from the carriage, physically assaulted him and threw him in front of the tractor and then Pratap Singh crushed him to death under the wheels of the tractor.Appellants’ plea was that the prosecution could not establish the motive to kill the victim and that too brutally. State government counsel submitted that both Riazuddin and Pratap Singh had vied for the position of “Shiksha Mitra” and the former’s appointment to the said position had left Pratap Singh seething with anger which led to the crime.The court, after hearing the concerned parties, observed, “Motive is not very relevant in a case of direct evidence, where a dependable ocular version is available. Once there is evidence forthcoming on the basis of an eye-witness account, that is consistently narrated by multiple witnesses, motive is hardly relevant.”“Appellants, in their statements under Section 313 of the Code, have not assigned any particular motive to the witnesses to falsely implicate them,” added the bench while dismissing the appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allahabad-hc-dismisses-appeal-of-four-murder-convicts-101632421259053.html
23-09-2021||Delhi||Five-year-old electrocuted, two friends injured at south Delhi park||New Delhi: A five-year-old boy was electrocuted and two other children were injured after they came in contact with the iron railing of a public park in south Delhi’s Khanpur which was in touch with a live wire, police and electricity department officials said. The park is reportedly managed by the south municipal corporation of Delhi (SDMC).The incident happened on Wednesday with the electricity department officials claiming that the loose wire was used by someone in the neighbourhood to illegally draw power from an electric pole.The incident comes weeks after three minor girls and two adults, who tried to save them, were electrocuted by a loose electric wire at a grocery shop in Ghaziabad’s Rakesh Marg on September 1.According to police, the three children involved in Wednesday’s mishap belonged to the JJ Colony in Khanpur and had reportedly gone to the park to see a monkey performing tricks with its trainer.“Around 4.30 pm, my grandson touched the electric pole and suffered electric shock. The other two children tried to save him one after the other and suffered electric shock... While they somehow survived, my grandson could not be saved,” said the grandmother of the deceased child.Their families claimed the two children, aged five and six, were admitted to a private hospital and discharged on Thursday. Police said they have registered a case in connection with the incident.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the police control room received a call about the incident at 4.40 pm on Wednesday, following which a police team headed by a sub-inspector from the Neb Sarai police station rushed to the spot.“An initial enquiry has revealed that on Wednesday, a live electric wire of one of the temporary connections fell on the ground, causing the casualty. We have registered a case and further action is being taken,” said DCP Thakur.A BSES spokesperson said, “As per the preliminary investigation, it appears that illegal electricity wires were being drawn by hawkers from the nearby jhuggis in the vicinity. One of these illegal live wires fell down, charging the railings around the park, leading to the unfortunate incident... We are fully cooperating in the police investigation and our condolences are with the family of the deceased.”The deceased child’s grandmother alleged that instances of live wires coming in contact with the park’s railings are common during rainy season. “Despite informing the local councilor and municipal officials, nothing was done,” she alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fiveyearold-electrocuted-two-friends-injured-at-south-delhi-park-101632420898941.html

Mukesh Suryan, the mayor of the south corporation, said that the joint campaign will focus on controlling vector-borne diseases, reducing single-use plastic, a “chalo school programme” to improve school enrolment levels, and improving sanitation services. Suryan claimed that the municipal corporations will be expediting the installation of fixed compactor stations at all dhalaos (garbage receptacle points). The drive against the single-use plastic will be carried out between September 25 and October 2, he added.Suryan said that the civic body will also distribute 5,000 tablets to needy students of SDMC primary schools. He added that they will start a special programme “RWA Ki Baat Parshad Ke Sath” wherein RWAs can put their issues before the councillor.Raja Iqbal Singh, the north corporation mayor, said that the North Delhi Municipal Corporation will run a “garbage-free Delhi” campaign from October 7. Shyam Sunder Agarwal, the east corporation mayor, said that the civic body plans to add 37 garbage compactor stations in its jurisdiction area. Agrawal said that a target has been set to eliminate the legacy waste from the Ghazipur landfill site by the year 2024.The three municipal corporations of Delhi have consistently fared poorly in the Swachh Bharat rankings by the ministry of housing and urban affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-delhi-mayors-announce-sanitation-campaign-and-drive-against-single-use-plastic-101632420659036.html

23-09-2021||Delhi||AAP claims North MCD making false claim of tax cuts; BJP calls charge ‘baseless’||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled North Delhi municipal corporation of making a false claim over reducing house tax, and trade and licence fee.The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless”.While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules the three municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD). Municipal polls are scheduled to be held in April next year. “The BJP-ruled North MCD hasn’t rolled back the hike in trade and factory licence fees yet. They are misleading people ahead of elections. The BJP is lying to the people of Delhi by saying North MCD has reduced house tax and licence fees on trade and factories. The BJP-ruled MCDs are functioning like Khap Panchayats. They have no credibility left,” said the AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.He said, “The BJP increased licence fees by 17-25 times last year on a range of trades and factories. Now, they are putting up posters saying they have reduced them when they have actually not initiated any roll-back process. The BJP had resorted to similar tactics before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls too, and later forced people to pay increased amounts as taxes and fees.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the allegations are baseless. “His (Saurabh Bhardwaj) comments expose his politically immature conduct. His statement that BJP-ruled North MCD has misled people on withdrawal of hiked trade licence fees and property tax waiver is another proof of his political and administrative immaturity. North MCD’s general house and standing committee have already approved withdrawal of hiked charges and property tax waiver which are now awaiting notification by administrative wing. Such notifications take a few weeks, and are likely to be implemented anytime next week.”Jogi Ram Jain, the standing committee chairman of the north corporation, said the AAP functionaries do not understand how the municipal corporation operates, adding that relief will be provided in the next 20 days. “The private member resolution on this issue has been passed and the municipal commissioner will bring a preamble on the matter in the next house meeting. We will try to call an early house meeting. It is our commitment that the relief will be provided within the next 20 days,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aapclaims-north-mcd-making-false-claim-of-tax-cuts-bjp-calls-charge-baseless-101632420420095.html

In the first stage, a 20.5km-long section will be developed between Sangam Vihar and Malviya Nagar Metro station (Nilgai line); the second will see an 8.5km stretch between Malviya Nagar Metro station and Vasant Kunj; and the third stage involves the development of a 7-km long stretch between Chirag Dilli and Asiad Village Complex.The work for phase-I’s first stage has been awarded and tenders for the second and third stages will be floated soon, said a senior DDA official.As part of the project, DDA will construct cycle tracks and pedestrian pathways, and to ensure convenient access, origin and destination points too will be linked using cycling and walking tracks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-sets-december-2023-deadline-to-complete-36-km-of-walking-cycling-tracks-in-delhi-101632420058958.html
23-09-2021||Delhi||HC slams ‘copy-paste’ petition against Asthana’s appointment as Delhi top cop||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday said a petition challenging the appointment of IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner was a “copy-paste”, and warned the petitioner to be cautious in the future.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh made the remark when the petitioner’s counsel was unable to explain the averments made in his plea, which advocate Prashant Bhushan, on behalf of the intervenor NGO, claimed to be “copied”.The court said the petition was entirely copied, including full stop and comma, from another plea filed with similar prayers before the Supreme Court. It said that the lawyer, who is the author of the petition which has been copied, is waiting in the queue to argue.“All these things you have copied from the memo of the senior advocate (referring to Bhushan). If you are copying, you do it 5% and write 95% of your own. Here, 97 to 99% is copied even with all the full stops and commas. Don’t do this in the future, we have tolerated it this time,” the bench said.Advocate BS Bagga, appearing for the petitioner, said, “I don’t know from where these allegations have come from”.The high court was hearing a PIL by Sadre Alam, a lawyer, against the appointment of Asthana along with an intervention application by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan, which has challenged the appointment before the Supreme Court.During the day’s hearing, when Bagga started his argument on inter cadre transfer, the chief justice asked him what he meant by “super time scale”.The court repeatedly asked the same question which he was unable to explain and sought time to check and come back.“We are asking you for the last time, we will dismiss the petition with costs. You have copied from his memo that is the problem. Without understanding, you are reading. Now we want an additional explanation. What is the super time scale,” the bench said.While addressing Bhushan, the bench said, “You people are also distributing your copies (of the petition) everywhere. Don’t do this. He does not know what is super time scale is. You are doing it in good faith but it becomes a weapon. I have asked the question deliberately.”The Centre, in its affidavit, has said that the appointment of Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner was done in the public interest, keeping in mind the diverse law and order challenges faced by the national capital, which have national security implications as well as international/cross border implications.Asthana, in his affidavit, has told the court that there is a sustained social media campaign against him and the legal challenge to his appointment was an abuse of process of law, arising from vendetta.He said that ever since he was appointed Special Director, CBI, proceedings are being consistently filed against him by certain organisations as part of a “selective campaign”.While dictating the order, the bench said, “counsel appearing in… started with an argument on inter cadre transfer. He simply read over paragraphs without explaining anything. When the word ‘super time scale’ was read, we asked a question whether he can explain or not and the counsel for the petitioner was unable to explain what is the meaning of super time scale in the service jurisprudence.”The counsel sought time and the court listed the matter for further hearing on September 27.The petitioner has sought quashing of the July 27 order issued by the Union home ministry appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police commissioner, and also the order granting inter cadre deputation and extension of service to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hcslams-copy-paste-petition-against-asthana-s-appointment-as-delhi-top-cop-101632419939413.html
23-09-2021||Delhi||Pay ₹2 lakh a day to shoot at Ghazipur landfill, ₹75k for all other locations in East Delhi: Civic body’s new film policy||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) will charge filmmakers ₹2 lakh a day to shoot around the Ghazipur landfill site, even as it fixed a rate less than half for other areas in its jurisdiction, according to the municipal body’s new film policy. A senior EDMC official said the civic body will charge ₹10,000 as a one-time registration fee, ₹25,000 as refundable security fee, apart from ₹75,000 as a daily charge in all areas in east Delhi, apart from the landfill, according to the policy, which got east Delhi mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal’s anticipatory approval on Thursday.Before this policy was implemented, no such policy was in place in the area, and filmmakers were free to shoot without being charged for it.A senior municipal corporation official said the rates for shoots near the landfill are higher because of the large number of such requests they receive. However, the official added, if anyone plans to shoot a documentary or a film for a social cause, or to promote the EDMC’s interests, the civic body may consider waiving all charges for shoots near the garbage mound.The 70-acre Ghazipur landfill is the tallest in India, and stands at a height of 50m, according to recent estimates, and receives around 2,200 metric tonnes of waste every day.“A single window portal to approve film shootings online is being developed for various agencies of Delhi. The Delhi Tourism and Transport Development Corporation (DTTDC) has been appointed the nodal agency for this... After depositing all the required documents, security fee and permission fee, the civic body will grant permission for the shoot within seven days,” said Rakesh Gupta, spokesperson of the East corporation.The south and north corporation have also cleared their new film policies, and will charge ₹75,000 per day to shoot in their respective jurisdictions. So far, only the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) had a film policy and permissions are issued on payment of ₹2 lakh per day.EDMC standing committee chairman Beer Singh Panwar said, “This will be a good source of revenue generation for the EDMC and will bring on electronic media and OTT platforms areas under the East corporation.”Commissioner Vikas Anand said that the new policy covers all buildings and open areas including the ASI-protected monuments, heritage buildings, private properties like farm houses, malls, hospitals, among other sites. The regulations state that no disruption of traffic flow will be permitted and sound limits will be required to be kept within the limits prescribed by pollution control board. The policy prohibits display of “controversial, objectionable or obscene material” while liquor will be prohibited in all venues, the approved policy adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pay-2-lakh-a-day-to-shoot-at-ghazipur-landfill-75k-for-all-other-locations-in-east-delhi-civic-body-s-new-film-policy-101632419518936.html
23-09-2021||Delhi||Jamia to reopen in phase-wise manner from November, says registrar||Following protests by several student groups demanding the reopening of the campus to all students, Jamia Millia Islamia on Thursday announced a phase-wise reopening plan for its final-year students in undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD courses from November. The university, however, has not given any date for the reopening.Registrar Nazim Hussain Jafri said the decision was taken after an academic council meeting on September 13. “The university campus shall be opened to PhD scholars who are due to submit their thesis on or before December 31, 2021. The final year/semester students may attend clinical and practical classes offline from the month of November in limited numbers, subject to the adherence of Covid-19 health and hygiene protocols,” said an order released by Jafri’s office on Wednesday.Speaking to Hindustan Times, Jafri said, “PhD students have already been coming to the campus for their work. As far as final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students are concerned, our statutory bodies have decided that status quo should be maintained till October 31. We will hold a meeting after that and decide whether it would be conducive to call them to the campus from November, based on the Covid-19 situation prevalent at that time.”Students coming to the campus for lab and practical work will have to produce a negative RT-PCR report or a vaccination certificate. The university has specified that teaching and examinations of all undergraduate, postgraduate, and diploma programmes will continue in the online mode and hostel facilities will remain suspended. “Departmental library facility will be opened to PhD and final-year/semester students on production of their latest negative RT-PCR report/vaccination certification,” the university said in the order.Students have been campaigning and demanding the reopening of the university over the past few weeks. Earlier this week, a representation of students, comprising members of at least five student groups, approached the university administration to make a case for the reopening of the university that has remained closed since last year when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. In a joint statement, students said it was crucial to open the university since students have been facing difficulties during remote learning. Students said while most institutions and public spaces have opened, the campus continued to remain shut. They said the possibility of reopening the university in the near future looked bleak. “AC and EC meetings were held four to five days ago, but the minutes have not yet been released. In this situation, the students are facing uncertainty over the reopening of the campus,” the statement issued by the student organisations said.Students said they were disappointed with the varsity order. “The circular hasn’t addressed the core demand of restarting in-person classes for all students. The permission for research scholars and final year students to use library isn’t of much use as most students are away at their native places and the hostels are shut,” said Musaddiq Mubeen, a postgraduate student and president of Students’ Islamic Organisation’s Jamia unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jamia-to-reopen-in-phase-wise-manner-from-november-says-registrar-101632419459268.html
23-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Centre refuses to share empirical data on OBC, BCC collected in 2011||The state took a step closer to resolving the knotty quota issue that has plagued it since March after the Governor on Thursday approved an ordinance that permitted reservation for Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates in local body polls even as the Centre refused to share data from the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 stating that the data was “unusable” for official purposes” because of “mistakes and inaccuracies”. The Centre’s contention was made in an affidavit filed in response to the state’s July writ petition which came up for hearing in the Supreme Court on Thursday. The petition sought empirical caste data after the apex court struck down a law in March that granted reservation to OBC candidates in municipal body elections. The SC also asked Maharashtra to stay within the court’s previously mandated cap of 50%, and provide reservation to OBC candidates based on fresh empirical data. “The governor sought a clarification on the ordinance. The state cabinet decided to resend it on Wednesday. I am happy to hear that the governor has signed the ordinance. I was sure that he would clear it. However, the battle for OBC reservation and its census data is long,” said food and civil supplies minister and OBC community leader Chhagan Bhujbal. Raj Bhavan officials on Thursday confirmed that governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has signed the ordinance. On Wednesday, Koshiyari had refused to clear the ordinance citing the apex court’s March directions. The state sent the ordinance back to the Governor late in the evening stating that its amendment permitting reservation to OBC candidates was permissible as the reservation to within the 50% cap as mandated by the apex court. The state will amend two legislations — Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and Maharashtra Village Panchayat Act for Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayats — to ensure this reservation. However, the local Zilla Parishad elections that will start on October 5 in six districts across Maharashtra — Palghar, Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim and Nagpur — may not be affected by this amendment. “Any change in the bypolls has to be done at the directions of the Supreme Court because it has directed us to hold the bypolls based on open category candidates. If there is any change for whatever reason, the direction has to come from SC. We are following their directives and can’t change on our own, state election commissioner UPS Madan told HT last week. Following the Centre’s refusal to share caste census data citing reasons of error, the state government is expected to file its reply and the matter has been scheduled after four weeks. OBC Welfare minister Vijay Wadettiwar said they will file a caveat in the apex court regarding the ordinance. “We will file a caveat in the Supreme Court saying that we have promulgated the ordinance to provide reservation to the OBC community within 50% ceiling,” he said. “Pertinently, due to several infirmities found in the aforesaid data as explained hereinafter, it was decided by the cabinet to constitute an expert committee under the chairmanship of the then vice chairman Arvind Panagariya. However, the other members of the committee were not named and the committee never met. As a result, no action has been taken on the data in the past 5 years,” the 30-page affidavit filed by R Subrahmanyam, secretary, ministry of social justice and empowerment stated. A senior law officer requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to the media said: “The central government has filed an affidavit on Tuesday in which it has refused to share the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011. The Centre has said that the data cannot be used for any official purposes as it has several errors. It has further told the SC that they had constituted an expert committee under the chairmanship of Arvind Panagriya, the then vice-chairman of Niti Aayog to rectify the mistakes but other members were not named and thus no action was taken for rectification of the mistakes.” “It has further mentioned several examples to prove that there are errors in the data. For example, the affidavit says that the data was collected by the people such as primary teachers who were not trained enough for the job and hence there are errors in entries etc.,” he added. The census data is necessary because of the Supreme Court’s March ruling. Legislation for the local bodies in Maharashtra provides reservation to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (SC and ST) communities based on their population in those particular bodies. In case of the OBC community, 27% reservation based on last census conducted in 1931. Consequently, there are many districts in the state where the combined reservation of all the communities — SC, ST and OBC — exceeded the 50% cap. On March 4, the Supreme Court directed the state to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which reservation for the community could be fixed. It also allowed the state election commission to hold local bodies polls, which begin on October 5 without reservation in place. This could have proved politically damaging for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharshtra Vikas Aghadi coalition government. Even with the amendments to the law, seats reserved for OBC candidates would have decreased by 10-15%, from 5200 to 4500 seats. There are five laws that govern OBC reservation in local body elections. The remaining three — the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act and Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and the Industrial Townships Act — fall under the state urban development department, and do not come within the purview of the ordinance. The state has also decided to promulgate another ordinance that will provide upto 27% reservation to the OBC community in the urban local bodies such as municipal corporations, municipal councils and nagar panchayats. An ordinance to this effect will be sent in a day or two, officials said. Separately, the state is also considering returning to a multi-member ward system where the local body will have panels of members in place of a single elected one. Experts said that this was a gambit to ensure further representation of OBC candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-centre-refuses-to-share-empirical-data-on-obc-bcc-collected-in-2011-101632418858806.html
23-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC nod for weekly offs for fair price shops in the Capital||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday modified an order directing all the fair price shops in the city to remain open on all seven days of the week, and allowed the dealers to take a day off each week.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh passed the order after the Delhi government additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal said that he had no objection to the application by the dealers’ association.Fair price shops were directed to function on all days of the week in April last year by the Delhi government as the pandemic spread across the Capital.Noting that the pandemic situation is not so grave as it was on April 27, 2020, the bench said, “So weekly off is permitted to fair price shops in accordance with the law.”Meanwhile, the bench also directed the Delhi government to give a road map for ensuring that the needy, including among non-PDS beneficiaries, are provided with adequate dry ration amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It asked the government to give bullet points of all the work done in this regard till now and listed the matter for further hearing on October 22.The court was hearing an application by an NGO, “Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan”, which had challenged the government’s non-PDS guidelines putting an “arbitrary” limit of 20 lakh beneficiaries for dry ration.The NGO demanded foodgrains for all the needy persons and sought direction to the AAP government to modify the May 27 guidelines to the extent that it should not be a mere one-time relief measure and that the beneficiaries should be given foodgrains for every calendar month until further orders.Delhi government counsel Anuj Aggarwal submitted that the cap has been done away with in pursuance to the court’s June 25 order.“We are ensuring that nobody sleeps hungry and besides dry ration, people are also provided with cooked meals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-nod-for-weekly-offs-for-fair-price-shops-in-the-capital-101632418618871.html

23-09-2021||Gurugram||52 illegal stormwater drain connections identified, notices sent to offenders||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has identified at least 52 illegal stormwater drain connections over the past two weeks and sent notices to offenders, officials said.The drainage division of GMDA has identified these connections with exact coordinates so that locating and disconnecting them is easy, officials said.Pardeep Kumar, chief engineer, infrastructure-II division of GMDA, said, “As per norms, untreated sewage should not go into our drains, but there are many such unauthorised connections to stormwater drains in the city, which we identified during a survey this month. We are now tracing those who have made these connections and sending notices to them along with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, which will further be disconnecting them.”Kumar said that if violators repeat the offence, action will be taken against them under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Environment Protection Act, 1986, with the help of the pollution control board.Officials from the infrastructure-II division said that around 40-50 MLD of sewage is illegally released into the city’s stormwater drains at present. These illegal connections add to the waterlogging problems during peak monsoon.Explaining how these illegal connections are being identified, a senior official from the infrastructure-II division said, “We are sending cameras mounted on selfie sticks or similar devices down different manholes in the city, where we have noticed heavy waterlogging, and through these cameras, we are able to identify the illegal connections.”Officials said that maximum violations were found at Khandsa village street, Vatika Chowk, Sector 39/46 road, Sector 45 on Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg and Garoli industrial area.Between January and May, the GMDA had removed over 170 illegal connections to sewer lines and stormwater drains in the city. These connections were mostly from housing societies and led to flooding and overflow of sewer and stormwater drains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/52-illegal-stormwater-drain-connections-identified-notices-sent-to-offenders-101632418147232.html
23-09-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 vaccination: Camp to be set up at gurudwara, more likely at temples, banks and post offices||The Gurugram health department on Friday will conduct a Covid-19 vaccination drive at a place of religious worship, a gurudwara at Sadar Bazar, for the first time as part of its mega vaccination push that includes setting up camps at public places and places of worship, officials said. Officials said that the camp will be set up at the Gurudwara Singh Sabha, opposite a vegetable market in Old Gurugram, from 10.30am to 4.30pm, in collaboration with Fortis Memorial Research Institute. Only Covaxin doses will be administered at the camp, with the first dose available for people above 45 years and the second dose available for all eligible age groups. A total of 600 slots will be available at this site and beneficiaries must register themselves on Co-WIN application before coming for vaccination, health department officials said.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “Many times, people are not able to visit the designated vaccination centres due to some or the other problem, but they visit religious places, banks and post offices to access their pension account or other works; we are trying to take the vaccine to these people. One such vaccination drive will be conducted at a gurudwara on Friday, and more such drives are being planned at temples, mosques and other public places.”On Tuesday, the district task force decided to undertake vaccinations at places of worship, vegetable markets, post offices and banks, to extend the reach of the vaccination drive. The health department will also be coordinating with 1,221 residents’ welfare associations in this regard. Officials said that besides the camp at the gurudwara, vaccination will be carried out at 48 session sites and that around 7,900 slots will be available for the same. On Thursday, 8,568 people were vaccinated against Covid-19 in the district, with 3,284 taking the first dose and 5,284 taking the second dose. Officials said that for the past three days, the number of second dose vaccinations has been higher. Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “After we realised that many people are due to take their second dose of vaccine, we made a list of these people and circulated it to all health centres in the district. Ground medical staff have already started contacting these people and we have seen that numbers of second dose have been higher in the past three days, as those whose second doses were due are being individually contacted.” Since Monday, 49,669 people have been given the second dose of vaccines, compared to 38,662 being administered the first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-vaccination-camp-to-be-set-up-at-gurudwara-more-likely-at-temples-banks-and-post-offices-101632418145988.html
23-09-2021||Gurugram||Cycle tracks across 800 kms to come up by 2035: GMDA||A decision to construct 800 kilometres of cycle tracks across the city by 2035 was taken in a core planning committee meeting of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) held on Tuesday, officials familiar with the developments said.The cycle tracks are being developed as part of measures to improve non-motorised transportation in the city, identified as a mobility concern in the comprehensive mobility management plan (CMMP) of the GMDA approved last December. The improvements will be rolled out in different phases, with Phase 1 lasting until 2026, Phase 2 until 2031, and phases 3 and 4 to be completed by 2041. In the meeting, the GMDA’s chief executive officer (CEO) recommended a proposal for the construction of a 15-kilometre cycle track from Iffco Chowk to the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) and directed officials to formulate a plan to link this track with the track on Golf Course Road. This track will cover sectors 27, 28, 42 and 43, officials said. “We have a target of constructing 800 kilometres of cycle tracks, which will be covered in different phases. At present, we will be constructing a 15-km track from Iffco Chowk to SPR. We will also hold discussions with DLF for constructing a cycle track on Golf Course Road. We have planned to connect all these cycle tracks so that more residential areas can be covered, which will automatically motivate people to use cycle for short travel,” Sudhir Rajpal, the GMDA’s CEO, said. Officials from the infrastructure-I division said that once the cycle track from Iffco Chowk to SPR is completed, it will automatically act as a connecting point for the existing track between Huda City centre and Subhash Chowk. At present, cycle tracks are under construction at the Anaath Road, Shankar Road, Rezang La Road and Maharana Pratap Chowk. Officials said that the GMDA is planning on constructing similar cycle tracks from Huda City Centre towards major road networks of Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, Gurgaon-Faridabad Road, Golf Course Road, Golf Course Extension Road, and Signature Towers. Sarika Panda Bhatt, a co-founder of the Raahgiri foundation, the GMDA’s technical partner for designing cycle tracks, said, “Cyclists and pedestrians take 20% of the road space only and it is an important mode of transport for a large section of the population. We need to shift towards finding out ways for sustainable mobility and cycle tracks help in developing that.” “At present, people fear for safety and prefer a four-wheeler, but once proper cycle tracks are developed, people who now take out cars for short distances will also shift to cycling or walking. Gurugram is a city with almost 5,000 elite cyclists, besides those who use it as a daily mode of transport,” she said. To ensure all cycle tracks are not encroached upon, the GMDA has placed bollards at all entry and exit points to prevent vehicles from entering the main tracks. At a few points, the GMDA is also planning on deploying security guards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cycle-tracks-across-800-kms-to-come-up-by-2035-gmda-101632418144807.html

23-09-2021||Gurugram||Aravallis: MCF resumes demolition of illegal structures, five farmhouses razed||After a break of around 20 days, the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) resumed its ongoing demolition drive against illegal structures constructed on forest land in the Aravallis. On Wednesday, five illegal farmhouses located on the Surajkund Road were demolished, officials said. Yashpal Yadav, the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad, said, “After identification by the forest department, we have started demolishing illegally constructed farmhouses on Aravalli land in the district. Five such farmhouses were demolished on Wednesday and 10 more will be demolished by the end of the week. The forest department has given us a list of 15 farmhouses.” He said that more illegal structures standing on Aravalli land have been identified and will be demolished over the next few weeks. On Monday, the Supreme Court said that unauthorised properties on forest land cannot be granted any protection, as it sought a report from the municipal body of Faridabad, within a week, on illegal structures located in the Aravalli forest and reasons for not demolishing them. The next hearing in this regard is scheduled for September 27.In the second week of August, the Faridabad forest department had demolished three farmhouses. Earlier this month, the administration had also demolished 200 houses at Jamai Colony, a settlement that cropped up on Aravalli land in the district. In the third week of July, the Supreme Court, while hearing a case about demolition of Khori village in Faridabad, observed that “the direction to remove all unauthorised structures standing on the forest land applies to all such structures without any exception.” After the top court issued directions in this regard, the forest department started preparations to raze all illegal structures, including farmhouses, banquet halls and institutes, constructed on forest land. So far, around 14 farmhouses that were set up in the Aravallis have been demolished in Faridabad, officials said. In Faridabad, officials have estimated that around 120-130 illegal structures are currently standing on land notified under Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/aravallis-mcf-resumes-demolition-of-illegal-structures-five-farmhouses-razed-101632418080172.html

23-09-2021||Delhi||DJB to install 80MGD RO plants in areas with saline groundwater: Satyendar Jain||The state water utility plans to install reverse osmosis (RO) plants in areas where groundwater is unusable due to high salinity and levels of total dissolved solids (TDS), said senior officials of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) after a meeting with water minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday. Jain said the government will install RO plants with a total capacity of 80mgd (million gallons per day) or 363mld (million litres per day) within a year. In the first phase, the water utility will install these plants in areas like Okhla, Dwarka, Nilothi-Nangloi, Chilla and Najafgarh. The government estimates that around 725,000 households may benefit from this project. A senior DJB official explained that the agency is targeting areas with surplus groundwater, but which is unfit for use. “For instance, water in the Najafgarh area is available at a depth of 2-3 metres, but is extremely saline. Raw water will be supplied to these RO plants using sub-surface resources and purified water will then be supplied to the households,” the official said. The Delhi government said it will use RO systems that will have 80% water recovery rate, unlike typical systems, which waste a lot of water during the purification process.The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) estimates that the city has around 22 lakh million gallonsof saline, and hence unusable, groundwater. “This can be converted to drinking water after RO treatment and can be used to augment the DJB’s existing water supply. Areas for the project will be selected in such a way that the existing pipeline system can be used, which will save the utility money on laying pipelines,” DJB said in an official statement.DJB said private investors will bear a major share of the cost to set up the RO plants and the water utility will then buy clean drinking water from them at a fixed rate. Jain said the DJB will shortlist RO systems available with at least an 80% recovery rate. “Based on initial studies done by DJB officials, the cost of water, in this case, will be equal to the existing cost of water treatment through conventional methods,” Jain said. The minister said that one small RO plant will be installed for every 500 households and more than one RO plant will be provided in areas where the population is more than 2,000.DJB currently supplies the city with 4,230mld of water, against a demand of 5,130mld. If the RO project is successful, officials estimate that this shortfall will drop from 900mld currently, to 540mld..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/djb-to-install-80mgd-ro-plants-in-areas-with-saline-groundwater-satyendar-jain-101632417658535.html
23-09-2021||Mumbai||Active case count down in Maharashtra, state monitors Covid situation||Even as the state’s active case count is reducing, experts and state public health department is monitoring the situation closely as they expect a spurt in infections by October first week, owing to the increased movement during the Dahi Handi and Ganeshotsav festivals. However, officials from the health department said that so far there are no signs of the potential third wave of Covid-19 infections. Maharashtra on Thursday added 3,320 fresh Covid-19 infections, taking it tally to 6,534,557. The state recorded 61 deaths due to the virus, pushing the toll to 138,725. Mumbai, meanwhile nearly logged 500 fresh cases on Thursday. It recorded 498 fresh infections and five fatalities. The active caseload in the state dropped to 39,191, lowest in seven months. A senior bureaucrat said the state is monitoring as the numbers could see some increase owing to crowding in the past two weeks due to the festivals. Officials said that targeted testing during this period will help them pinpoint cases and arrest the transmission. “Due to crowding during the celebrations, we expect some increase in cases. It is crucial to keep test numbers high in this period to locate infection and prevent it from spreading,” the bureaucrat said, requesting anonymity. He further said there are no indications of the potential third wave as of now. Officials added that they are also focusing on speeding up the vaccination drive in the districts where the percentage of first dose and second doses are low. The vaccination drive will also help in the fight to prevent the third wave, officials said. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday directed officials to increase the pace of inoculation drives across the state, especially in districts where the numbers are lagging. In Nanded and Hingoli districts, the percentage of second doses is 12.24% and 11.28%, respectively, which is the lowest in the state. Similarly, the two districts have the lowest percentage in first doses – 35.20% (Nanded) and 38.08% (Hingoli). A chunk of the cases came from Ahmednagar rural (577), while Ahmednagar city added 21 cases. Pune rural added 437 cases, while Pune city added 182 cases and Pimpri-Chinchwad added 125 new cases. Satara logged 219 new infections, and Solapur 196. Dhule rural, Dhule city, Jalgaon city, Hingoli district, Akola rural, Amravati rural, Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur, and Chandrapur city did not report any fresh cases on Thursday. The daily positivity rate in the state has been around 2% in the last one week. On Thursday, the positivity rate was 1.95%. The state tested 170,373 samples in the past 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/active-case-count-down-in-maharashtra-state-monitors-covid-situation-101632417238673.html
23-09-2021||Mumbai||Mangrove Foundation of Maharashtra spent 7.5% of earnings last financial year||The Mangrove Foundation, a registered society under the state forest department’s mangrove cell, spent 7.5% of its earnings in FY20-21 on research, security, capacity building, asset procurement and other allied tasks for protection of mangroves in Maharashtra’s coastal districts. This comes to a total of ₹15.66 crore, as opposed to the total earnings for the year of ₹211 crore, as per the Foundation’s recently published annual report 2020-21.After being registered in 2015 with a corpus fund of ₹115.7 crore, the Mangrove Foundation’s capital has increased over the years to ₹525 crore at the end of March 2021, with mitigation costs from projects like Coastal Road, Trans Harbour Link and Bullet train contributing large sums. However, the majority of this money remains unspent due to the foundation’s decision to use only the interest accrued to carry out its activities. “The Mangrove Foundation was registered with a... mandate to run its operations from the interest income generated by keeping its corpus funds in fixed deposits. Additionally, it receives project/activity specific funds from various government departments and agencies and CSR funds from various corporate organisations,” the foundation’s annual report stated. The foundation also received non-corpus funds to the tune of ₹2.3 crore in the last financial year.Neenu Somraj, deputy conservator of forest (DCF), mangrove cell, clarified that the Foundation is not bound by law to retain its corpus funds, but has made this decision keeping in mind “longevity”. “We have to think about running the foundation for a good length of time in the future. There was a period of three years before 2018 when the corpus did not grow at all. If we simply spend all the money now, it may cause a crunch in the future. So the decision to use only the interest is a considered step that will help sustain the organisation,” said Somraj. At a conservative interest rate of about 6%, the mangrove foundation can hope to generate about ₹30 crore of usable revenue from its current corpus which, officials said, would exceed the total expenditure of FY20-21 by a large margin. “As the corpus grows, we will of course have more funds to scale up our current activities,” Somraj added.Of the ₹15.66 crore utilised in FY20-21, the largest expense of ₹4.7 crore has been made under the head of a “Mangrove Protection Framework”, which includes compensatory mangrove plantation, security and encroachment removal. Of this, ₹3.22 crore were spent on hiring 185 security personnel from the Maharashtra State Security Corporation to keep a watch on sensitive mangrove areas. The remainder was spent on carrying out compensatory afforestation and other “protection measures” which include office development and payment of legal fees to advocates. Another ₹2.32 crore were spent on eco-tourism and livelihood activities such as aquaculture and mangrove tours.The majority of expenses, however, have been administrative in nature. Under multiple heads, ₹6.6 crore together were spent on staff fees, procurement of vehicles, office maintenance, electronic gadgets, office rent and others. In comparison, only ₹94 lakh were spent under the research and capacity building heads, while another ₹79 lakh was spent toward conservation of coastal and marine species.“This pattern of expenditure does not reflect a coherent or unified vision for protection of mangroves. A very large part of the money is being spent only on administrative works, and only a small amount has gone towards dedicated ecological studies and gathering actionable data through field work. A question arises as to whether the foundation is sustaining itself while leaving conservation wanting,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee of the Conservation Action Trust (CAT). Goenka’s petition as a member of the Bombay Environment Action Group had led to the Bombay high court’s (HC) September 2018 judgment on mangrove protection.Though environmentalists agreed that use of these funds must be judicious, they also claimed no money has so far been spent on restoration of damaged mangroves, complaints of which are placed before a HC-appointed committee from time to time. Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti which is currently fighting a public interest litigation in the Bombay HC for compliance with the HC’s September 2018 judgement on transfer of mangroves to the forest department for safekeeping, said, “The mangrove foundation is a cash rich body now. As per their mandate, they must spend a portion of this money on restoration of degraded mangroves. But so far, not a single instance of mangrove destruction has led to restorative action.”HT was the first to report last month that, since its inception in 2018, the Bombay high court (HC)-appointed Mangrove Protection and Conservation Committee (MPCC) has received an estimated 142 complaints regarding the destruction of mangroves in the state’s coastal districts. Of these, about 88 complaints have been resolved, with a few transferred to the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for consideration. Another 54 odd complaints are pending resolution, according to committee members. However, committee members (including officials in the forest department’s mangrove cell) confirmed to HT that not a single complaint has so far resulted in the restoration of damaged mangroves, which is part of the mandate given to the committee by HC in its final judgement from September 2018.Responding to this claim, Somraj said the primary responsibility for restoration lies with various municipal corporations and land-owning agencies. “It can be prohibitively expensive for us to do this work. It is for ULBs to conduct the initial clean up and their cost, only after that can be step in to afforest the affected places,” Somraj said.Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest, mangrove cell, could not be reached for a comment. However, speaking to HT on the issue of restoration last month, Tiwari had said, “We have kept funds for this task but cannot proceed with it until the various municipal corporations or land-owning agencies clean up the debris first. The restoration will be done by the forest department but cleaning up the area is their responsibility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mangrove-foundation-of-maharashtra-spent-7-5-of-earnings-last-financial-year-101632416998704.html
23-09-2021||Mumbai||43 Maharashtra cities to join global Race to Zero campaign||Ahead of the upcoming 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November, Maharashtra minister for environment and climate change Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday announced that 43 Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) cities and urban clusters from Maharashtra will join the global Race to Zero campaign. Cities joining this campaign have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions in the 2040s or sooner.Some prominent cities in the list are Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Panvel, Kohlapur, Shirdi, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Badlapur, Ulhasnagar, Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur among others. Of these, six cities from western Maharashtra — Mumbai, Nashik, Aurangabad, Kalyan-Dombivli, Pune and Nagpur — already joined the campaign earlier this year.The announcement comes during the ongoing Climate Week NYC 2021 proceedings where Thackeray spoke during India’s ‘Road to COP26’ event, part of The Hub Live series of conferences. “Joining the Race to Zero campaign is our contribution in the global fight against climate change. We cannot keep emitting carbon. We don’t have the luxury of time. Maharashtra will set an example of how subnational governments can act despite being a heavily industrialised state,” said Thackeray in his address. The state environment department will undertake a greenhouse gas emission inventory exercise for all the cities and clusters, which account for a floating population of 50 million. Within 12 months of joining, the cities will have to explain what actions will be taken toward achieving both interim and long-term pledges and commit to report publicly on their progress.Commenting on the development, Chandni Singh, senior research consultant at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements in Bangalore, said, “The Race to Zero campaign has a holistic approach and makes a case that you cannot just do mitigation or adaptation but everything together. Even a signal of this kind of commitment is commendable. However, a study we did showed that about 50-60% of the cities with population of over a million have some kind of climate resilience plans in place, but the situation is different when checked for implementation. So, it will be good to see how these plans pan out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/43-maharashtra-cities-to-join-global-race-to-zero-campaign-101632416518498.html

The cooperation department has initiated the inquiry into the alleged irregularities related to bad loans given to corporate entities, redevelopment of housing projects, irregularities in gold mortgage loans, misappropriation in purchase for computerisation system among others. Divisional joint registrar Bajirao Shinde issued the order of inquiry for 10 types of irregularities in MDCCB in the past five years. District sub-registrar Pratap Patil has been tasked with conducting the inquiry and submitting the report in three months. The bank is headed by Darekar as its chairman and the action is seen as the MVA government’s reply to the action and inquiries initiated against ministers and leaders from the ruling parties. MVA ministers such as Anil Parab, Hasan Mushrif and leaders from ruling parties including Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawli, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar are facing charges of corruption levelled by BJP leaders. The inquiry notice dated September 22 has been served under section 83 of Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. “The inquiry will be conducted into the expenditure on the repair and renovation of movable and immovable properties belonging to the bank in the last five years. The loans given by the bank for redevelopment of housing societies, corporate houses which turned out to be bad loans too will be inquired into. Probe will also conducted into loans given out of its area of operation and loans given to sugar factories. The irregularities into loans given on mortgage will also be probed. The loans given to cooperating housing societies on the basis of forged documents too will be probed,” the notice stated.The inquiry has been initiated on the basis of the inspection report submitted by the cooperation department on August 10. Darekar alleged that the action initiated by the government is politically motivated and out of vendetta. “The state government had ordered such inquiries in the past too. We have come out clean every time. The compliance report submitted after the inquiries under section 83 and 88 in the past have been accepted by the cooperation department. The bank has received Class-A certificates by cooperation auditors for the last 10 years. The bank is headed by the board of directors representing all political parties and they share equal responsibilities of the irregularities, if any. We are not resisting any action, but it is an attempt to suppress the voice of the opposition. We are going to demand inquiries into corruption in Pune district cooperative bank, state central cooperative bank and other cooperative entities under the leadership of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). We will push for inquiry into these irregularities by central agencies like the Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of investigation along with state regulators,” he said. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the action by cooperation department against MDCCB is on the basis of a complaint received by the department. “Darekar or other BJP leaders are free to make complaints against the state cooperative bank or Pune district bank to any agency. The directors responsible for irregularities will face consequences,” he said.MDCCB has faced the inquiry in the past as well. In September last year, a team led by divisional joint registrar was asked to enquire into losses of ₹47.99 crore sustained by the bank and 7.11% drop in capital receipts. The probe was also ordered to examine loans given to sugar factories and corporate loans and their recovery, expenditure on modernisation of bank offices and its computer mechanism over past five years, and loans given to cooperative housing societies under its ambitious redevelopment scheme. It also faced the inquiry into the disbursement of loan of ₹2.35 crore to Darekar’s relatives using fake documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-probe-alleged-irregularities-in-mumbai-district-coop-bank-led-by-bjp-leader-101632416278500.html

Thackeray also directed forest department officials that tigers should be radio-collared and camera should be affixed to track their movement and alert locals in a time-bound manner.Chandrapur district, which has a high tiger population, has seen the most tiger attack cases out of the total 88 recorded in 2020. Taking cognisance of the rising human-tiger conflict in Chandrapur, the Maharashtra government had set up an 11-member committee to look into options for conservation, relocation of tigers, and suggest measures to reduce conflict.The project under Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jan Van Vikas Yojana will cover 939 villages. The CM directed officials to see if other villages can be added. Initially, five sensitive villages will be fitted with metal fence. Solar fence has been used in Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra. A solar-powered fence is fed by the power generated from solar sources, including solar panels, batteries and energisers. These fences send non-lethal but sharp shock when an animal or person comes in contact with it, acting as a barrier to intruding animals, experts said.The CM further said that solar borewells should be built at 218 locations and ditches should be constructed which would solve the issue of drinking water for wildlife. Thackeray also suggested considering the possibility of cultivating bamboo, fruit trees and store fodder in non-agricultural lands near villages where tigers roam frequently.Thackeray, in a statement from the secretariat, said, “Cameras should be installed at places where wildlife, especially tigers, are found to monitor their movements. Some tigers should also be fitted with radio collars to monitor their movement, so that people can be alerted and human-wildlife conflicts can be avoided.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/solar-fence-to-reduce-man-animal-conflict-near-tadoba-tiger-sanctuary-in-maharashtra-101632416098472.html

BJP leaders have been talking about safety of women in the state. The incident of the molestation in this case has taken place in a BJP corporator’s office. The complainant was threatened and beaten up by the party’s women workers. BJP leaders like Chandrakant Patil and Devendra Fadnavis should now speak about the action they are going take against the party workers involved,” he said. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar, who visited Borivli police station on Thursday, said women leaders of the BJP who make noise over atrocities against women should now speak up and stand by the complainant. “The police have acted swiftly and registered a complaint. They have assured us to take necessary action against the accused. We do not want to play any politics in the case, but want to know if the women leader of BJP will stand by the complainant,” she said. BJP leader Chitra Wagh said that police should investigate the case and take action against the accused. “We will stand by the complainant and police should take strict action and punish if the accused is found guilty. We have submitted videos of the complainant and accused. Our corporators and MPs have clarified their stand and written to the police.

23-09-2021||Dehradun||BJP minister, blamed for police horse Shaktiman’s death, acquitted by judge||Dehradun: Uttarakhand cabinet minister Ganesh Joshi on Thursday was cleared of charges of assaulting a police horse, Shaktiman, deployed for crowd control at a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rally in the state capital in 2016, the minister’s lawyer said. The horse died a month later due to injuries.The chief judicial magistrate’s court in Dehradun acquitted five people including the small, medium enterprises minister due to lack of evidence and contradictions in statements of witnesses, Joshi’s counsel Manmohan Kandwal said.Ganesh Joshi, the Mussorie legislator, was arrested in 2016 after outrage over a video clip that showed him brandishing a stick and appearing to strike the horse at a BJP protest on March 16, 2016 against the Congress government led by Harish Rawat. The video ended with the horse on its back, in pain, with a policeman trying to get it back on its feet.The lawmaker, seen in the video holding a stick and poised to strike, was not seen hitting the horse in the video or the photograph. He also insisted that he did not hurt the horse. At the time and later, Ganesh Joshi, who spent about five days in custody before getting bail, insisted that he was innocent and was being framed on then chief minister Harish Rawat’s instructions.Following the injury, the horse’s hind leg was amputated and a prosthetic leg was fitted, but it couldn’t survive and died. As a mark of respect, Uttarakhand police named a petrol pump after Shaktiman and erected a statue at Police Lines in Dehradun.On Thursday after the court verdict came in, Joshi said it was a victory of truth. “I was saying from the very beginning that I am innocent. Now it has been proved,” he said. Devendra Bhasin, BJP state vice president, said the Harish Rawat-led Congress government at that time tried to frame Joshi in this case under a conspiracy. “They should now apologise to Joshi as the court has delivered its verdict and truth has won.”Ganesh Godiyal, Uttarakhand Congress president, said his party respects the court’s verdict in the matter but “there is no question of an apology”. “Everyone knows what happened in 2016. It is there in photos and news reports of that time.”When the BJP came to power in 2017, it recommended withdrawal of the case against Joshi, who was charged with rioting, hurting and charging with a stick towards the 13-year-old police horse Shaktiman who fell on the ground during the ruckus and fractured its hind leg. But the effort didn’t succeed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/bjp-minister-blamed-for-police-horse-shaktiman-s-death-acquitted-by-judge-101632415319047.html

Narendra Giri, who was also the Mahant of Bade Hanuman Temple in Prayagraj, was found dead in his room at Baghambari Gaddi Math in the Sangam city on Monday (September 20). “We welcome the move of the state government recommending a CBI probe into the case.

He also said both the personal room of Mahant Narendra Giri and the one in which he was found hanging had been sealed. Giri belonged to the Niranjani Akhara and was also serving as its secretary at the time of his death.“We held a meeting of the Akhara at the Baghambari Math on Thursday and discussed day-to-day business, including how to run the Math, in coming days etc. It has also been decided that a temple or some kind of monument would be constructed at the site where Narendra Giri has been given Bhu (land) Samadhi,” he said. On being asked about the successor of Mahant Narendra Giri and Balbeer Giri, who Narendra Giri has named as his successor in his purported suicide note, he said, “We are still grieving over the departure of one of our close and highly respectable members of the Akhara”. “In days to come, we will sit together and decide who would be the successor,” said Kailashanand. Balbeer Giri is presently a Mahant of the Niranjani Akhara. Likewise, ABAP general secretary Swami Hari Giri, while applauding CM Yogi Adityanath for recommending a CBI inquiry, said, “There should be a thorough probe into the incident and no one should reach to any conclusion before the CBI inquiry is over.

This will bring down the vacancies, as the court was left with just 17 judges against the sanctioned strength of 53 at the start of this month and one more vacancy was to arise at the end of September.Of the eight new judges, six have been elevated from the bar after approval at the Supreme Court collegium meeting on September 23. They include Khatim Reza, Sandeep Kumar, Anshuman Pandey, Purnendu Singh, Satyavrat Verma and Rajesh Kumar Verma.Two others who got elevated as judges of the HC are judicial officers Navneet Kumar Pandey, who is presently the registrar general of the HC, and Sunil Kumar Panwar, who is presently registrar (vigilance) at Patna HC.“The warrants for their appointments will be issued by the President. As per the procedure, now the Centre will send the names after due process to the President.

Ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) leaders also came out in defence of Prasad, who has been in the line of Opposition’s fire for the past few days following a media report that said his kin had got high-value government contracts in violation of rules.The tender for the said work was floated in December 2019 when he (Prasad) was Katihar MLA. His son was one of the bidders and was awarded the contract through due process. The said work was completed on September 2020, before he became the deputy CM. At no point did Prasad influence the process,” said Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, president of the state unit of Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), the biggest constituent of the NDA.“It was a routine meeting to discuss party affairs,” Jaiswal said when asked about a meeting of BJP ministers on Wednesday evening at the residence of deputy CM Renu Devi, also from the same party. BJP state vice-president Rajiv Ranjan said nobody could cast aspersions on Prasad’s character. “He is one of the finest leaders who is thoroughly dedicated for the state’s development,” said Ranjan.Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awami Morcha (Secular), also an NDA constituent, ruled out Tarkishore Prasad’s involvement in the tender process. Its spokesperson Danish Rizwan said, “Unlike the Lalu-Rabr era when tenders were awarded to their acquaintances, the tender process under the NDA government is as clear as water.” After the media report that claimed that the deputy CM’s kin had got contracts worth ₹53 crore in the state government’s Har Ghar Jal scheme to provide tap water to every village household, the Opposition parties have sought to corner the Nitish Kumar government on the corruption issue.Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), has accused the state government of looting the treasuries. On Thursday, Yadav dragged the name of former deputy CM and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi, alleging that the tender of the said project was awarded to Prasad’s kin during his tenure. “Tarkishore Prasad was the MLA of Katihar and it was on Modi’s recommendation that he became the deputy CM,” he said and alleged that tender was given to Prasad’s family for generating money for the 2020 assembly elections. Dubbing the water supply scheme as “Nal Dhan Yojana (scheme to siphon money)”, he asked the CM to name 50 panchayats where the scheme is running efficiently. After RJD and Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) formed an alliance and won the 2015 assembly elections, Modi had levelled serious allegations of corruption against Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, the then deputy CM, through a series of media briefings and posts on social media, which eventually led to a break in the RJD-JD(U) alliance and Yadav’s ouster from the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-dy-cm-trashes-reports-of-favours-to-kin-in-govt-contracts-101632411479318.html

On July 28, judge Anand was brought dead to a hospital about an hour after he was hit by the auto rickshaw in Dhanbad when he was out on a morning walk. The two occupants of the three-wheeler, Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma, were subsequently arrested. The CCTV footage of the location showed the vehicle swerving seemingly deliberately to hit the judge from behind, officials involved in the case had said.Appearing before the division bench of chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujit Narayan Prasad, CBI zonal director Sharad Agrawal informed the court that judge Anand’s death was not an accident, and submitted the weekly probe report as directed by the court.Sources said the zonal director informed the court that they drew the conclusion on the basis of interrogation of the arrested accused, along with scientific investigation, but are yet to get concrete evidence for it.The court then directed the CBI not to waste time and get behind the crime, as any time lost would be detrimental for investigation. It also questioned the probe agency as to why they have not been able to move beyond the two arrested occupants of the auto rickshaw involved in the alleged crime.“The CBI officer informed court that one of the two arrested persons Lakhan Verma also has previous criminal record of mobile theft, and he has been trying to mislead the agency by changing his stand. The agency is interrogating the two accused for a breakthrough,” a source said.Both the Supreme Court and the Jharkhand High Court has taken suo motu cognisance of the incident. The CBI took over the investigation from the SIT headed by an ADG rank officer of Jharkhand Police at the state government’s instance. The HC had ever since directed the central agency to provide probe status report every week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/seems-dhanbad-judge-was-intentionally-hit-by-auto-cbi-tells-jharkhand-hc-101632411478004.html

None of the authorities here seem to respect mangroves as frontline soldiers against tidal attacks.”NatConnect tweeted to all the powers that be a fresh video of the dumping and JCB machine spreading the garbage on mangroves.The HC panel has asked the UMC and local planner CIDCO to find an alternative site and stop dumping on mangroves, Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, said. He recalled that an FIR had been filed against the civic body for violation under the Environment Act in January 2020.Santosh Mali, chief executive officer of UMC, said, “The environmentalists are complaining but the land has been given to us by the collector. In 2006, Raigad Collector had given us land where we started dumping municipal waste. The area is close to the creek. Mangroves have grown amidst the garbage dumped but we have not touched or harmed them.”He added that they have again gone to the Raigad Collector for an alternate five- hectare plot in Jasai for a dumping ground and our request has been granted. “The process is in the last stage and we will get it soon. At present, on the Bori Pakhadi area dumping ground, we will be taking action to conserve the mangroves that have grown. We will take up garbage bio-mining to protect the environment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/under-fire-for-dumping-in-mangroves-uran-municipal-council-to-get-own-dumping-ground-soon-101632410758607.html
23-09-2021||Chandigarh||If Navjot Sidhu is anti-national, he should be behind bars: Wife||AMRITSAR Even as Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu is maintaining a stoic silence over being labelled anti-national by former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, former’s wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu on Thursday said if it was true, why he (Sidhu) was not being put behind the bars.“If somebody is a threat to the national security, jail is the place for such person. I will write to Union home minister Amit Shah, requesting him to send him (Sidhu) behind the bars as he has done something anti-national (as being alleged),” she said. Navjot Kaur, who is a former chief parliamentary secretary, was talking to the media at her Amritsar residence after the appointment of Shivani Sharma as Mahila Congress’ president for Amritsar district. “Navjot played cricket with Imran Khan (prime minister of Pakistan). They were rivals on the ground and friends off it. During his visit to Pakistan, Navjot didn’t bring anything from Pakistan except soil from Guru Nanak’s land, a piece of asugarcane, and a stuffed partridge as a gift for Captain Amarinder,” she said.She said Navjot was called by his ‘friend’ Imran Khan to Pakistan. Imran later ‘honoured’ Sidhu’s wish by opening the Kartarpur Corridor, which was a long pending demand of every Sikh, she said. “All Sikhs around the world were happy with the opening of the corridor,” Kaur said.She said her husband’s other demand was the re-opening of transit trade via the Attari-Wagah border. “This demand was for the farmers so that they can export their produce. Were these things anti-national. Navjot never visited Pakistan for personal reasons,” she added. On Charanjit Singh Channi-led Punjab government, she said, “Channi is a person who will always think about the poor. Whatever he is promising, he will fulfil it.”Dubbing Navjot Sidhu as anti-national, dangerous, unstable, incompetent and a security threat to the state and the country, Captain Amarinder had said that he would fight ‘tooth and nail’ any move to make the PPCC chief the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/if-navjot-sidhu-is-anti-national-he-should-be-behind-bars-wife-101632410521461.html

23-09-2021||Lucknow||Now, UP has separate body to govern training of technicians in medical field||LUCKNOW The state now has a separate body – Uttar Pradesh State Allied Healthcare Council (UPSAHC) – to regulate training curriculum for technicians working in the medical field. The council will govern courses and plan training for technical medical staff working as OT, X-ray, ultrasound and lab technicians in hospitals. The move will improve the quality of education and ensure hospitals get the best staff for better patient care, said health experts.“The Uttar Pradesh State Allied Healthcare Council (UPSAHC) will look after the curriculum of about three-dozen courses, including those for operating theatre technicians, laboratory technicians and physiotherapy,” said Dr AK Singh, head of the Uttar Pradesh State Medical Faculty (UPSMF). The union government has already set up a national body and asked states to form their wings for allied health services. These services are directly connected to healthcare and include all personnel who work in hospitals/clinics other than doctors and nurses. UPSMF registers MBBS or PG doctors who wish to practice in the state, and is the umbrella body for the Uttar Pradesh Medical Council for doctors, Uttar Pradesh Nurses and Midwives Council and Uttar Pradesh Dental Council. And now, the allied healthcare council will also be running in the state. At present, a core committee is making rules for the UPSAHC that will decide on the curriculum and registration of students who clear different technical exams. Prof Vinod Jain, dean, paramedical sciences of the KGMU, is heading the core committee. “Such a body will certainly improve the quality of education and ensure hospitals get the best staff for better patient care,” said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director, Healthcity hospital.“Medical technical education is as significant as MBBS or BDS. If an OT technician has adequate knowledge and is well trained, the doctor/surgeon gets major support inside the operating theatre or the ICU,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors.“Once the rules are made, a separate chairperson, secretary and other office- bearers will hold the office of UPSAHC. A formal decision on the structure of study and exams will then be made just as in nursing and other courses,” said Dr AK Singh. The entire process is likely to be completed in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-up-has-separate-body-to-govern-training-of-technicians-in-medical-field-101632409617806.html

23-09-2021||Mumbai||40% eligible population in Mumbai fully vaccinated against Covid, 85% get at least first dose: Data||Around 40% of the total 9.2 million targeted adult population in Mumbai is fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and 85% population has been administered at least one dose, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data.The highest target of the fully vaccinated population — 59% — is in the age group of 45-60 years, followed by 55% senior citizens above 60 years of age. Further, a 23% target is achieved in the 18-45 years of age group. The data reveals that 52% of the total healthcare workers and 57% frontline workers have been fully vaccinated.However, civic officials assume that 20% out of the total vaccinated citizens in Mumbai are from the satellite towns in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). These beneficiaries are considered to be a floating population, who mostly work in Mumbai but reside in satellite towns.The vaccination for Covid-19 started with healthcare workers in the city on January 16, 2021, followed by frontline workers and senior citizens in March 2021, those above the age of 45 years in April and from May 2021, vaccination was rolled out for everyone above the age group of 18 years.According to BMC data, 9,236,500 or 9.2 million is the targeted adult population in the city that is above 18 years of age and is eligible for vaccination. According to the census of 2011, the city’s population is 12.4 million. The highest number of the beneficiary or eligible citizens in the age group is 5,684,800 or 5.6 million is in the 18 to 45 age group, of which 23% have got both doses and 78% have got their first dose. The second-highest number of beneficiaries are in the 45 to 60 years of age group having 2,082,100 beneficiaries, of which 59% are fully vaccinated and 90% have got at least first dose.The data of the BMC has, however, added a few caveats which include pregnant and lactating mothers, students going abroad etc in the 18 to 44 age group, and bedridden citizens are included in the senior citizen category. The total doses administered data also includes data of disabled citizens.Further, in the case of senior citizens above the age group of 60 years, out of the total 1,469,600 or 1.4 million beneficiaries, 55% are fully vaccinated and 76% have got at least first dose. In the case of healthcare and frontline workers, though age-wise breakup is not available, the BMC anticipates beneficiaries to be around 600,000.The data reveals that around 273,249 healthcare workers are beneficiaries in the city, of which 52% are fully vaccinated and 69% have got at least first dose. In the case of frontline workers, there are 313,625 beneficiaries, of which 55% are fully vaccinated and 76% have got at least the first dose. According to BMC officials, many healthcare and frontline workers have also taken their second dose by registering with alternate phone numbers or as general citizens.Meanwhile, experts anticipate that next year, by this time, we will be in a much more comfortable situation when it comes to vaccination. This considering vaccine for children is also expected in the coming months and the scope of vaccination drive will increase.Dr Madhav Sathe, former microbiology professor at BYL Nair Hospital said, “Considering the challenges in the city and country, we have done very well when it comes to vaccination. I feel many developed countries are also curious about our pace. There will be no problem further even if the supply is good. India has good scope to ramp up infrastructure considering our skills at public vaccination are good owing to polio vaccination.”Dr Sathe added, “By this pace, next year at this time we might have fully vaccinated our adult population. The scope of vaccination drive will increase with vaccines for children arriving, but that would not hinder the pace considering the experience of vaccinating children for polio.”(Quote by Suresh Kakani, Addl MC of BMC to be added)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/40-eligible-population-in-mumbai-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-85-get-at-least-first-dose-data-101632408420209.html
23-09-2021||Lucknow||Concert near Taj Mahal sparks controversy||AGRA A concert organised by the Agra Development Authority (ADA) on Wednesday evening within 315 metres area around the Taj Mahal sparked a controversy as it was allegedly in violation of restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court for holding such programmes within 500 metres area around the monument. The event, ‘Incredible Taj Concert – Harmony’, was organized at Taj View Point on the other side of Yamuna with Taj Mahal in the backdrop, near Mehtab Bagh, an ASI-protected site. ADA vice-chairman Rajender Pensiya denied such allegations, saying the concert was held in compliance of SC’s guidelines. “It was a small-scale programme with 50 people in attendance. Neither any heavy structure was set up nor the decibel levels were beyond limits,” he said. Renowned poets of Agra, including Som Thakur, Ruchi Chaturvedi, Ameer Akbarabadi, Sushil Sarit and Deepak Mehra, rendered their poetry at the event. The concert began at 5.30 pm with a ghazal by Sudhir Narain and ended at 8pm. Commissioner, Agra division, Amit Gupta was the chief guest on the occasion. The event was reminiscent of the famous Yanni show held in the backdrop of Taj Mahal in 1997. Yanni was permitted to hold his mega show on the bank of Yamuna, 500 metres away from the Taj Mahal periphery with restricted sound limits and instructions to disband the pontoon bridge after the show. The then superintending archaeologist of ASI PBS Senger said that the apex court was very clear in its order and had permitted the Yanni Show at a location 500 metres away from the Taj Mahal. “The SC was concerned because heavy construction work was undertaken for the Yanni Show and the pontoon bridge was created. Heavy generators were also in operation for the mega show. The apex court had issued guidelines for any event to be held near the monument and thus it is important as to what was the scale of the Wednesday event and whether permission had been sought from the ASI, if it was within 500 metres of Taj Mahal periphery,” stated Senger. “The SC had issued certain guidelines considering the Taj area as fragile. There are restrictions on heavy constructions, heavy vehicle movement and decibel level violation. Any event could be held near the Taj Mahal only after assessment of impact on the monument,’ said the ADA vice-chairman. “The event on Wednesday evening was on a much lower scale with only 50 people present. Only shades were set up at the venue while vehicles were parked a kilometer away and no construction activity was undertaken,” stated Pensiya. ASI superintendent Vasant Swarankar was not available for comments despite efforts to contact him. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/concert-near-taj-mahal-sparks-controversy-101632408417717.html
23-09-2021||Mumbai||Any change in medical admission should be announced in advance, parents tell Maharashtra govt||Until recently 18-year-old Manusha Pandey was eagerly waiting for the results of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) exams conducted 10 days ago, but now she’s confused. The recent announcement by the state government about considering admissions to undergraduate medical seats based on Class 12 score over NEET has not gone down well with several stakeholders.“Admission rules should be specified in advance, to prepare students for the same. How can the state government even hint at changes to the admission process this late in the year, especially after lakhs of students have already appeared for NEET,” said Brijesh Sutaria, parent and activist. He added that the Supreme Court in a previous order has clarified that admissions to professional courses should be conducted in the common admission process on the basis of entrance exams only.This move comes less than 10 days after the Tamil Nadu Assembly passed a bill seeking a permanent exemption to the state from NEET. The Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021, was supported by several political parties in the state and was introduced after a 19-year old medical aspirant died by suicide hours before the NEET exam was to be conducted on September 11.On Wednesday, the Maharashtra minister for medical education, Amit Deshmukh suggested that the government will review the all-India entrance exam and decide whether it is good for students. He responded to a letter written by a local leader addressed to the state chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray, requesting scrapping of NEET, and conducting medical admissions based on Class 12 scores.“The government added to the anxiety of students with this move, no matter the final decision. The timing for such a discussion is wrong, not only because the exam has already been conducted, but also because Class 12 marks this year were awarded without an official exam. It’ll be unethical to conduct admissions to medical and dental courses based on such scores,” said Anuja Parikh, parent of a UG medical aspirant.Rising Covid-19 cases forced most school education boards to scrap Class 12 board exams this year and instead promote students based on their performance in Class 10, 11 and 12 following a 30:30:40 formula. This pushed the overall performance of students from all boards—while CBSE and ISC schools witnessed a hike in the number of students scoring 90% and 95% in their batches, the state board witnessed a 12-fold rise in the number of students scoring 90% and above this year, including 46 students who scored a perfect 100% in HSC this year.Since the government has not yet given a clear indication about their decision on the status of NEET, students are hoping no changes will be introduced this year.“Most of us have spent two or more years preparing for NEET along with our board exams, so by scrapping the test, the government will ruin our hard work of two years. We request the government to not make any changes to the existing process,” said a student. He added that several student groups in TN have already decided to approach the Apex court about the government’s recent decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/any-change-in-medical-admission-should-be-announced-in-advance-parents-tell-maharashtra-govt-101632408237801.html

They are also done with the tendering process and the work at the site would start next month, a senior officer said.Due to the migration of people from different parts of the state, the population of Digha (a small township near Airoli in Navi Mumbai) has gone up to above one lakh. However, the area does not have any mother-and-child hospital till date. The local residents and activists had long been demanding such a hospital in that area.A senior officer from NMMC said, “We did not have any plot to develop a hospital in Digha. Therefore, we discussed the matter with Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and they allotted a plot for the hospital a few months ago. Recently, we also completed the tendering process and the work on the plot will start in October. The work on this 50-bed hospital will be completed in 18 months. The new hospital will be thrown open to the public in the first half of 2023.”Presently, NMMC has a total of five mother-and-child hospitals – in Belapur, Nerul, Turbhe, Koparkhairane and Airoli.Chitra Patil, 48, a resident of Digha, said, “As there is no mother-and-child hospital in our area at present, we have to go to the hospitals in Turbhe and Airoli. It is very inconvenient as the ambulances are also not available at times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-to-get-another-mother-and-child-hospital-in-digha-101632408001855.html

On September 17, Lucknow had administered over 89,000 Covid vaccine doses and in the next mega vaccination drive the aim is to cross the double mark of the previous high. Vaccine doses will reach the cold chain points a day before and delivered to the centres on Monday morning around 8 am. “Lucknow is administering over 30,000 doses every day on an average and till now over 29% people have been fully vaccinated (both doses). It’s responsibility of eligible beneficiaries to come and take the jab during the mega drive,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general association of international doctors. A senior nodal officer will monitor the drive in each block while block development officer will monitor the proceedings via data entry operator. All data entry operators will be attending a training session on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-mega-vaccination-drive-in-lucknow-on-monday-101632407225550.html
23-09-2021||Other||Emblems of Empowerment: She runs her business with surgical precision||Not one to be tied down by the shackles of the society, Nasira Akhter, 34, always wanted to do something different in life. She initially went with the tried and tested formula – got a commerce degree, pursued an ITI course in computers and stenography, and landed a government job. But her heart lay elsewhere. So, she took the leap of faith, turned down the job offer and put all her energies into setting up a small-scale industry (SSI) in Khonmoh, an idea on which she had been working since her graduation years. Today, Akhter’s SSI unit, which produces surgical items such as bandages, cotton, masks and bedsheets, has an annual turnover of ₹80 lakh and employs over a dozen workers, besides providing work to scores of others—mostly women. “I am the only woman in Kashmir who works in the field of bandage production. There are a few others in Jammu but none in Kashmir. My products reach every city and district-level hospital here,” she says. But setting up a profitable unit requires a lot of planning, research and sound judgement. “After brainstorming various ideas with my brother, I travelled to Delhi, Jind and Muradabad to survey the market and acquire more knowledge about the field. It is there I learnt about bandages,” says Akhter. She took loans from time to time, from different financial and entrepreneurial institutions such as EDI (Entrepreneur Development Institute), KVIC (Khadi Village Industries Commission) and DIC (Directorate of Industry and Commerce) to scale up her business. Her aim now is to raise her unit’s annual turnover to ₹2 crore. “It can only happen if I have access to a government market. The JK Medical Supplies Corporation Limited does not accept our supplies as we are small units. They favour those whose turnover runs into crores. The government should support SSIs.” But she is happy with how far she has come. “I built my establishment from the scratch. I used to travel in public transport, sometimes walk all the way and have blisters on my feet. But I never gave up,” she says. She says her family has been her biggest support system. “My parents, though unlettered, always motivated me and my siblings. They encouraged us to get educated and when I decided to set up my SSI, they even mortgaged their jewellery to help me financially,” says Akhter. Her success has been a motivation for others. “When other young girls see me excelling in a field that has been mostly dominated by males in the past, they are encouraged break the shackles of the society and work towards their dreams,” says the 34-year-old, who got married about a week ago, and back to work within five days.

23-09-2021||Mumbai||With 89% given first dose for Covid, NMMC hopes to reach 100% vaccination in Navi Mumbai by October||With 89% of the people from Navi Mumbai vaccinated with their first dose, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has claimed that it is expecting to reach 100% for the first dose by next month.Once the 100% mark for the first dose is reached, NMMC will discuss the probabilities of vaccinating people who do not have Aadhaar card with Navi Mumbai address. “Till now, we have been concentrating on vaccinating those with Navi Mumbai address. For those who do not have, we have tried to inculcate them with the help of various means by getting a letter from their employers in Navi Mumbai. Since we are approaching 100% vaccination with the first dose, we can now think of vaccinating everyone after reaching the 100%. This will be discussed first and then implemented,” NMMC commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, said.Even as 89% of the total eligible population of 10.60 lakh is vaccinated with the first dose, around 10% to 15% of the same are being considered to be people from outside Navi Mumbai who would have come here for vaccination at private hospitals.“In the beginning of the vaccination drive, when the booking of the slots was online, we had no control over it and many of them from outside Navi Mumbai also came here for vaccination. After it became offline, we have been vaccinating only the residents. The private hospitals, though, did vaccinate people from outside as well. But it applies vice versa too as many Navi Mumbai residents have got vaccinated from Mumbai or from their workplace in Mumbai when the vaccination drive had started,” Bangar added.As of now, 10.09 lakh people have got their first vaccination done while 4,78,216 of them (47%) have got their second dose. “Only 47% are fully protected in Navi Mumbai and the others need to make sure that they get their second doses soon and make themselves secure. We’d now be concentrating more on the second dose as many are due to get them,” a medical officer from NMMC said.Around 6.39 lakh people between 18 years and 44 years have got vaccinated with the first dose, and 2.02 lakh of them have got the second dose as well. In the age group of 45-59 years age group, 2.14 lakh people have got their first dose and 1.52 lakh of them got the second as well. In the 60-plus years category, 90,545 people got the first and 78,424 got both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/with-89-given-first-dose-for-covid-nmmc-hopes-to-reach-100-vaccination-in-navi-mumbai-by-october-101632405662240.html

In the annual budget, the civic body has sanctioned ₹70 crore for the construction of roads but this fund would not be utilised for minor repairs.The LMC’s decision to deduct ₹20 lakh from the quota of each corporator for the patchwork has not gone down well with the corporators. A number of them, those of the ruling party, have expressed their anger over the decision.“Corporators are angry over the decision to deduct the amount from their quota. They say they already suffered a cut in their quota when their fund was diverted for renovation of government schools. I think the mayor should also surrender her quota and then ask us to surrender a part of our quota,” said a senior corporator of the BJP. Another BJP corporator said, “Corporators don’t get salaries like MLAs or MPs, they only depend on the quota for meeting the demands of voters in their constituency. But our quota is being breached, that too when the state is ruled by the BJP. This has never happened in the past.”“Why doesn’t mayor Sanyukta Bhatia surrender her quota of ₹17 crore for the patchwork of city roads. She didn’t give anything for the renovation of government schools when our funds were diverted for the cause,” said Amit Chaudhary, corporator.Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi confirmed that road construction job will not be given nod where only patchwork is required. “In the past, files of road construction were passed on the recommendations of corporators, but now engineers and zonal officers will have to tell whether the road requires a patchwork or construction,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/to-fill-potholes-lmc-to-spend-rs-22-crore-from-corporators-quota-101632405297427.html

Around 20% violators have paid the fine in the past one week and we expect another 25-30% violators to pay the fine before the due date,” said ADG Upadhyay.The notices were sent to violators via SMS on their registered mobile numbers.Out of over 10 lakh pending e-challans, the traffic police have sent maximum notices to violators in Mumbai city, of which 82,409 challans were paid amounting to ₹3.16 crore since September 13.Navi Mumbai was in second place, where 6,726 violators paid the e-challan dues worth ₹54,23 lakh.“Violators were taking the e-challan system lightly. We resorted to approach the court and collect the pending amount,” said Upadhyay. If the violators do not pay the fines, the Maharashtra Police would file a case against them in regular courts, he added.Officials said the vehicle owners who have not received the notice should also check the status of their e-challans on the traffic police website.Since June 14 this year, the traffic police had decided to send their personnel to the doorstep of violators for the recovery of pending e-challans which has resulted in the recovery of ₹1 crore in their kitty. Special teams of constables were asked to visit the addresses of violators who have not paid e-challans of more than ₹5,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pending-e-challans-maharashtra-traffic-police-issue-ultimatum-to-over-10-lakh-vehicle-owners-101632404457368.html
23-09-2021||Mumbai||452 tuberculosis patients contracted Covid-19 in Mumbai||Although Mumbai is being considered as the tuberculosis (TB) capital of India, patients in the city have largely escaped being co-infected with Covid-19. Since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, only 452 TB patients undergoing treatment in the city have contracted the coronavirus. The Covid-19 positivity rate among the tested TB patients is around 1.8%.TB and Covid-19 are infectious diseases which primarily attack the lungs. They present similar symptoms such as cough, fever and difficulty breathing, although TB disease has a longer incubation period and a slower onset. So, to overrule any possibilities of misdiagnosis, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has conducted 25,303 tests for Covid-19 among TB patients with symptoms between March 2020 and August this year. Of this, 452 patients have been identified with TB-Covid co-infection.Doctors said Covid-19 can be lethal for TB patients whose lung capacity is already compromised. In addition, TB patients also tend to have co-morbid or living conditions like malnutrition, diabetes, smoking, HIV among others that increase their vulnerability. Data from BMC shows that 37 TB patients have succumbed to the co-infection since the start of the pandemic.“Patients with TB have two-fold risk of severe Covid-19. So, after the pandemic started, we shifted the TB patients to Covid Care Centres, especially from slums like Dharavi, Bandra (East), Kurla, Govandi among others that record a large number of TB cases every year,” said Dr Pranita Tipre, in-charge of TB department in BMC.In October 2020, the Central health department issued guidelines on Bi-directional TB-Covid-19 screening and screening of TB among influenza-like-illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. Following which, all government and private hospitals were instructed to test symptomatic patients with ILI, SARI and Covid-19 with TB.Doctors have called for more research to understand the reason for low co-infection rates among TB patients.“TB patients are highly immunocompromised which makes them most vulnerable to contracting Covid-19. Despite this, the number of co-infection has been extremely limited. So, there is a possibility that the TB regimen may have somehow saved them from Sars-CoV-2. But we need more studies to establish the fact,” said Dr Lalit Anande, former medical superintendent of Sewri TB Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/452-tuberculosis-patients-contracted-covid-19-in-mumbai-101632404397157.html
23-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court grants a month to Maharashtra govt to fill vacant MSHRC posts||Expressing its disheartenment at the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC) being defunct as the appointment of chairperson and other members has not been done since the retirement of the only presiding judicial member in April, the Bombay high court (HC) granted a month to the state as the last chance to fill up the posts and ensure that the commission became functional in all respects.A division bench of chief justice (CJ) Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing public interest litigation (PIL) filed by activist Naresh Gosavi was informed on Wednesday that the commission was not functioning since April. The PIL filed in 2013 sought directions for filling up vacant posts, assigning a larger premise and allotting adequate funds for functioning autonomously. While hearing another PIL with similar prayers, on July 12, 2021, the bench had asked the state to fill up the vacant posts of the chairperson, members and other staff by September 12. The petitioner Vaishnavi Gholave had informed the bench that an RTI reply had revealed that while only the secretary of the commission had been appointed, the posts of a chairperson, judicial member, expert member and inspector general of police along with 26 of the 51 sanctioned posts were vacant. Thereafter the court had given two months to the state to fill up the posts.On Wednesday, advocate Arif Doctor for MSHRC reiterated that while only the secretary had been appointed, the constitutional posts were still vacant. He submitted that a 2018 order of the HC to the state to fill up the posts within six months was also not complied.After being informed that the state had been forwarded three names by the former chief justice Pradeep Nandrajog, the CJ Datta questioned the state as to why no decision was taken on those names or even those six names which he had recommended. The CJ also sought to know why the chief minister and other senior officials had not met to resolve the issue as such an important body could not be defunct.“It is disheartening to note that the Maharashtra Human Rights Commission is a defunct body at present. Although on behalf of the state it was submitted on July 12, 2021, that the process of appointing the chairperson of the commission as well the other members thereof would be completed by September 12, 2021, little progress in that direction has been made,” observed the bench in its order.Additional government pleader for the state, informed the court that substantial progress had been made with regards to the appointments and another month would be needed to complete the same, hence as the last chance, the stated should be granted a month’s extension, which the court accepted.The bench then noted, “We hope and trust that the state government would rise to the challenge and make the necessary appointments by that date. Earnest endeavour shall also be made by the state to appoint requisite number of staff to make the commission functional in all respects.”The bench directed that both PILs should be heard together and posted hearing of the PILs by Gosavi and Gholave to October 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-grants-a-month-to-maharashtra-govt-to-fill-vacant-mshrc-posts-101632404157858.html
23-09-2021||Mumbai||Money laundering case: SG Tushar Mehta to represent ED in Anil Deshmukh’s petition||The Bombay high court (HC) has allowed the Solicitor General (SG) of India to respond on behalf of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to the petition filed by former home minister Anil Deshmukh for quashing of the summons issued to him by the central agency.​Deshmukh has been issued five summons asking him to appear before ED in connection with the money-laundering and corruption case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 21. On Thursday, when Deshmukh’s petition came up for hearing before the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh informed the bench that SG Tushar Mehta wanted to address the court in the petition, hence sought an adjournment. However, senior advocate Vikram Chaudhri and advocate Aniket Nikam who represent Deshmukh opposed the request and submitted that ED was resorting to delaying tactics on one pretext or the other and the petitioner felt victimised. “This petition demonstrates a hapless state of affairs...Tactics by ED are deplorable. The manner in which it (ED) applied the law, it becomes a matter of oppression,” submitted Chaudhri. While seeking interim relief for his client, Chaudhri stated that previously the ED had secured an adjournment after it had raised an objection on whether a single judge bench could hear the petition. The single judge had conducted a hearing on the issue and had directed the petition to be placed before a division bench. However, Singh denied the allegations and submitted that the objection about the single judge hearing the petition was raised by the HC Registry and hence the ED could not be blamed for the delay. After hearing the submissions that the court adjourned the hearing of the petition to September 29 and asked SG Mehta to respond on behalf of ED through video conference. The court also permitted ED to file a reply if they wanted to. Deshmukh who has been issued five summons by ED till now had written multiple times to the agency to allow him to appear before it through video conferencing in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, as he had not received any response from ED he approached the HC. Deshmukh’s petition apart from seeking quashing of the summons has also sought permission to allow him to be represented by an authorized agent and submit documents or statements to ED through electronic mode. The petition has also sought directions to set up an SIT comprising of ED officers from outside the Mumbai zonal office to carry out the investigation and requested the HC to monitor the probe as per the directions issued by the Supreme Court in another case. ED’s probe has claimed that when Deshmukh was the home minister, he had received an amount of ₹4.7 crore in cash which was collected by now dismissed Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze from various bar owners between December 2020 and February 2021. ED has justified its probe stating that it is in line with the CBI FIR which was filed after the completion of the HC ordered a preliminary inquiry on April 5. The April 5 order was based on the complaint of former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh who had alleged that Deshmukh had ordered police officers to collect ₹100 crore from bar owners every month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/money-laundering-case-sg-tushar-mehta-to-represent-ed-in-anil-deshmukh-s-petition-101632404097187.html

Every year, around ₹5Cr- ₹6Cr is spent on road works. Ulhasnagar has around 130km of road in its vicinity, of which 70km are cement roads and the remaining are asphalt roads.The Hirali Foundation in Ulhasnagar wrote to the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC), the State CM, Uddhav Thackeray, and Thane Collector to draw their attention to the condition of bad roads in Ulhasnagar on Thursday.“The pothole or road repair in Ulhasnagar taken up by the civic body is an eyewash every year. Tender is given to a contractor who does shoddy work. It was shocking to see the state of the road towards VTC ground, which was repaired on September 7 for welcoming Thane Guardian Minister, Eknath Shinde. It could not remain intact for even a week when the road developed huge potholes,” said Sarita Khanchandani, president of Hirali Foundation.The stretch from Town Hall to Follower-lane via Jawahar Hotel is pathetic, claimed Khanchandani. Other roads that are in a bad state are Shreeram Chowk towards Ulhasnagar 4 and towards Ulhasnagar 3 via Powai till Hira Ghat, the road at Kurla Camp, CHM College Road towards the Pinto Park via Neptune Building to Gulaal Tower on one side and OT section of Ulhasnagar 3 towards Radha Swami Satsang.“The entire Ulhasnagar roads are filled with small pebbles and dust. The dust particles are continuously released, causing respiratory ailments. Potholes on roads are also one of the major causes of traffic jams, leading to excessive honking and noise pollution,” added Khanchandani.Meanwhile, the shopkeepers and auto rickshaw union have also plans to repair the roads by begging and raising funds. “We have warned the civic body to repair the roads soon or else we will do it ourselves by begging and raising funds,” said Sonu Ahuja , president of Shivshankar Shopkeepers Association.Rahul Punjwani, a 37-year-old motorist, claimed that hard-earned taxpayer’s money is wasted on road repairs. “All the civic officials or contractors who do the shoddy work should be fined or punished and an example should be set for every city,” he said.The potholes are due to the continuous heavy downpour the city received all these days, claimed the civic officials. “Once the rain stops, all the roads will be repaired and potholes will be filled. Even if the road repair works were done, the heavy rains wash them away,” said Yuvraj Bhadane, UMC PRO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shoddy-repair-work-of-roads-substandard-materials-reasons-for-potholes-ulhasnagar-residents-101632402417117.html
23-09-2021||Chandigarh||Covid humour: Unmasking our inappropriate behaviour||The scene had the signs of a Steven Spielberg movie. Sleepy-eyed, I stood in my balcony and noticed pristine, white circles outside the gate of my hospital. Intrigued, I cast my eyes further and saw the same carefully drawn circles outside the neighbouring commercial establishments, too. Relieved that I wasn’t the only one being targeted, I went down to investigate the matter. It turned out to be the state’s effort to ensure social distancing. People were expected to stand in these circles while doing their business. Needless to say, there were people in the circles, on them and outside them! That was last year. The circles have faded away. We have limped out of the second wave and are heading towards the next. Despite the tragic toll, physical distancing remains an alien concept. Perhaps in the western world where personal space is respected and a decent distance is always maintained, moving further away was easier. But in India, we are used to standing close, literally breathing down each other’s necks. In any case, it is debatable whether the recommended ‘do gaj ki doori (Two-yard distance)’ is logistically possible. If all 1.4 billion of us were to keep this distance, wouldn’t some Indians be pushed into the sea? In the past year, ‘masking laws’ have become stricter and the penalty for non-compliance severer. For the average Indian, this means keeping a mask handy. Not for protection but in case they are accosted by the police. These “law enforcers” themselves seldom wear the mask correctly, leaving their nose jutting out. Most Indians keep it a little lower, like some trendy chin-wear. The few who wear it correctly lower it to talk. In rural India, mask sharing is rampant. It is not uncommon to hear, “Zara apna mask diyo bahar ho kar aana hai (Please lend me your mask, I need to go out).” A rare instance where sharing is not caring. That brings me to the last pillar of Covid-appropriate behaviour, hand washing. It should be easy to follow this instruction, one would assume. But for the vast majority of Indians living in slums and on roadsides, water is a rare commodity. Soap an unheard luxury. Earlier tiny leftover scraps of soap would make their way into the hands of the impoverished. But the advent of liquid soap has put an end to this wastage! The last drop of soap is mercilessly squeezed out and the sachet rinsed before discarding. Hand sanitisers that are supposed to protect when ‘hand washing is not possible’, hardly ever contain the recommended amount of alcohol. Prudence takes precedence here. Why throw it down the drain when it can be used to lift spirits! Coming full circle, a favourite joke to conclude. A seasoned biker took his new motorcycle for a spin. A swaying scooter came from the opposite direction, obviously driven by a novice. The veteran tried to save him but the scooterist kept wavering and inevitably the two collided. Infuriated by the damage to his new bike, the veteran rebuked the scared scooterist. Then to get even, he drew a circle on the road and commanded the trembling man to stand in it while he proceeded to break his scooter. Every time the biker would turn his back to do so, the scooterist would chuckle. After ‘delivering justice’, the man finally asked the scooterist what was so funny. With a twinkle in his eyes, the scooterist responded, “I stepped out of the circle when you were not looking.” The average Indian is no better. He fails to understand that he harms himself by not following rules. Will there be a third wave? Will it be as bad as the second or worse? Only time will tell. One thing is certain though. Our one-celled enemy has an edge over us. While it is constantly evolving and finding new ways to survive and flourish, we definitely aren’t. dr_manjugupta@icloud.com The writer is a Gharaunda-based gynaecologist||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-humour-unmasking-our-inappropriate-behaviour-101632401276970.html

The state has added a solar installed capacity of 2348.47MW in 2021 within eight months. Karnataka comes second with 7469.01 MW, followed by Gujarat 5708MW, Tamil Nadu 4675MW and Andhra Pradesh 4380MW. A senior official said despite Covid-19 situations in 2020-2021, the state has been advancing in solar energy from its second position in December 2020 with 5389.48 MW and has made a record by adding a new solar installed capacity of 2348.47 MW and nearly ₹10,000 crore investments within just eight months in 2021. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said, “Rajasthan with vast tracts of barren land is now leading the green energy revolution in India. Rajasthan’s solar generation potential has been assessed at 142 GW. The state government plans to systematically harness this potential and has set for itself an ambitious target of 30 GW capacity by 2024-25, which will transform the energy scape of the state and the country.” He said Rajasthan’s Solar Energy Policy 2019 has been beneficial to the solar sector investors. Additionally, Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme (RIPS) scheme to promote investment in the state has driven the growth of the overall investment in the renewable energy sector in the state. In fact, in April 2021, the state had approved the customized investment proposals totalling 34,200 MW of Adani, Renew Power, JSW Solar, Greenko in the renewal energy, of which, majority of them are in solar energy clubbed with wind and hydro Dr BD Kalla, minister of energy, government of Rajasthan, said, “with expected Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks (UMREPP) projects, international centricity of climate change policies and zero carbon emission policies, it is assumed that Rajasthan will become the centre of attraction in the Asian continent for investments in the renewable energy sector. Rajasthan has ample barren land and it covers about 60 per cent share of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) which is rapidly growing.” Additional chief secretary, energy, Dr Subodh Agarwal, said “The state’s ease of doing business and policy framework has become a model with this milestone in the solar energy sector. For the ease of doing business, Rajasthan has been constantly innovating the processes and notably, the state has achieved the place among the top states in the country in 2019 with an implementation score of 98.39%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-leads-solar-installed-capacity-in-india-govt-report-101632399358078.html

Police claim that a family dispute is behind this tragic incident. “We have sent both bodies for post-mortem after we received information of the tragic incident. Some family dispute is said to be behind the extreme step. However, we are probing the case from various angles,” Vijendra Sah, station house officer, Rudrapur police station in US Nagar said. Sah said the woman had some altercation with her husband three days ago. She had come to her father-in-law’s house with her six-year-old child after the dispute. The family members went to their rooms after dinner on Wednesday night. The woman too went into a room with her child. Sah said on Thursday morning when she didn’t come out, the family members opened the door and found her dead while the child was lying dead on the bed, lifeless. Sah said she is likely to have used a pillow to suffocate her child before killing herself.

Earlier, an 18-year-old man and a four-year-old child were attacked in the region prompting the forest department to lay trap cages to capture the leopard.Around two dozen incidents of human-animal conflict have been reported in Udaipur over the last two years and left five people dead and 15 others injured.Also Read | Night curfew clamped in half a dozen Uttarakhand villages after leopard terrorForest conservator (Udaipur) R K Khairwa said they have formed teams to capture the leopard and that the same animal probably attacked all three people. He added a healthy leopard never attacks a human. “It seems the leopard is old, unable to hunt, or is injured. There is adequate prey base in the sanctuary area,” he said, ruling out this as a cause of the attacks.Rahul Bhatnagar, a retired Indian Forest Service officer, said there are many villages inside the sanctuary that has also been encroached upon. He added leopard attacks are rare in the sanctuary. He blamed encroachments and said they will increase the conflict. “To reduce conflicts, the prey base needs to be increased and voluntary relocation needs to be encouraged,” said Bhatnagar.According to a 2015 wildlife census, there were 434 leopards in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/leopard-kills-woman-in-udaipur-third-attack-in-three-days-101632397542617.html

The arrested were identified as physiotherapist Dr Rajiv Kumar Singh, his wife Khushboo Singh, a shooter, a liner and another accused.

During the investigation, it was revealed that Vikram and Khusboo knew each other since January this year and had called each other as many as 1,100 times since then. Police claimed that contract killers were hired to eliminate Vikram while the arrested former leader and his wife are the masterminds behind this conspiracy. They allegedly paid ₹3 lakh for the attack on Vikram. The CCTV footage police have gathered from the crime scene also suggested that unidentified criminals were behind this incident. Audio of a conversation, allegedly between Dr Rajiv, Vikram and Khushboo, went viral on social media in which the couple is heard threatening Vikram with dire consequences.

23-09-2021||Patna||Former Bihar CM at loggerheads with BJP over discrimination faced by Dalits||Former Bihar chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi on Thursday lashed out at the ‘self-appointed guardians of faith’ for Dalit being forced to live a life deprived of dignity.ये जो हम कह रहें हैं,बस सदियों का दर्द है,गुस्से का अब-तक हमने इजहार कहां किया…धर्म के राजनैतिक ठेकेदारों की ज़बान ऐसे मामलों पर चुप हो जाती है।अब कोई कुछ नहीं बोलेगा,क्योंकि धर्म के ठेकेदारों के पसंद नहीं कि दलित मंदिर में जाए,दलित धर्मिक कव्यों पर टिप्पणी करे। pic.twitter.com/RMiSpQWqZ5Manjhi in a tweet expressed his anguish and shared a news report of a Dalit couple from Karnataka facing a penalty after their child, aged two years, inadvertently stepped into a temple.“What we are trying to express is anguish that has not been expressed in over several centuries. We have not even expressed our anger yet. The self-appointed ‘political’ guardians of our faith go silent when such reports surface. They do not say anything because they themselves do not like when Dalits enter temple or hold an opinion regarding religious texts,” Manjhi said in a tweet sharing news reports of the Dalit couple facing the penalty.A Dalit family was asked to pay ₹25,000 for "purification" of a Hanuman temple in Miyapur village in Karnataka's Koppal after their child entered the temple. The police arrested five people in connection with the case on Wednesday.Incidentally, Manjhi’s tweet is directed at the Karnataka government which is ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who also happens to be a coalition partner of the HAM in Bihar.His statements also came after few leaders from the BJP criticised Manjhi for calling Lord Ram a fictional character. His remarks were in reference to discussions on demands of including the sacred text Ramayana in school curriculum in Bihar.Manjhi, who expressed his support to the idea of inclusion of the sacred text, however, also said that Lord Ram was a ‘fictional entity’ and not a real person. “I do not believe Lord Rama was a great man. He is a work of fiction. I believe Valmiki and Goswami Tulsidas were great men who came out with such an inspiring character,” Manjhi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.His remarks courted controversy and led to criticism from the BJP. BJP MLA Hari Bhushan Thakur even asked why the former minister was not named ‘Jiten Rakshas (Demon) Manjhi’ instead of Jiten Ram Manjhi.Manjhi was the chief minister of Bihar for a little less than a year and was chosen to lead the state after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when Nitish Kumar stepped down following Janata Dal (United)’s poor performance.Manjhi broke away from the JD(U) and formed HAM in 2015. He joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in 2020 after leaving the RJD-led Opposition Grand Alliance. Manjhi belongs to the Musahar caste, which is also known as Mahadalits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/former-bihar-cm-at-loggerheads-with-bjp-over-discrimination-faced-by-dalits-101632396086994.html
23-09-2021||Mumbai||Commuters fear about potholes, craters on major roads in Thane||Following the death of a youngster due to the bad road conditions in Thane, residents and commuters have raised concerns about commuting over longer distances along the Ghodbunder Road and Thane-Nashik Highway. There are potholes aplenty and uneven patches of roads along these major highways. The pathetic conditions of these highways lead to regular traffic congestion.Moreover, the soon-to-be announced traffic curbs on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Highway near Ghodbunder Road for heavy vehicles due to repair work would add to the existing traffic snarls in the city especially along this major road.Commuters had to endure a nightmarish commute on both Tuesday and Wednesday as 15km-long serpentine queues of vehicles were witnessed on the Mumbai-Nashik Highway. The traffic snarls spilled over to Ghodbunder Road, Waghbil, Kalwa, Majiwada and other areas in Thane city. Although the movement of heavy vehicles has been restricted to only night time, commuters complain that they often find heavy vehicles during peak hours as well.The traffic department has taken efforts to fill the potholes in many places to ensure a smooth flow of traffic. However, the respective authorities continue to stay mum on the poor condition of roads in the city.Vinay Rathod, DCP (Traffic), Thane, said, “The poor condition of roads and the heavy rains that damaged the temporary filling of potholes led to a slow pace of traffic. We have approached the local authorities and asked them to do the needful.” Commuters claimed that they face this kind of problem year after year following a heavy downpour. “The potholes and huge craters force us to drive slowly, causing traffic snarls during peak hours. As it has been raining heavily over the last few days, the size and the number of potholes have increased. Every day, during the peak hours, it takes twice the time to commute,” said Prathiti Shetty, 49, a resident of Mumbra who travels to Thane daily. An officer from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which is in charge of the Thane-Nashik Highway, added, “We have started the repair work of roads from Igatpuri onwards and shall continue till Mulund Toll Naka. A meeting with officials from all authorities related to road repairs was conducted this week, wherein all have agreed to initiate repair work at the earliest.” While both authorities claim that pothole-filling work is undertaken regularly, the ground reality is contradictory. Most stretches along these two highways are riddled with huge craters making commuting difficult. In these times when fuel prices have skyrocketed, commuters lament that they spend a fortune on gas owing to these congestions. With the road being the only option for most, there is no respite from the traffic snarls. In 2019, there were five instances of pothole deaths in Thane district. There were umpteen protests. Commuters fear that if local authorities continue to ignore the condition of the roads, more such accidents may follow. “There is no other option but the road to access areas beyond Ghodbunder Road. Travelling daily on this pothole-filled stretch has caused back and neck pain. I spend an hour, and during heavy rains more than that, to cover an 8km distance to my house. It seems like the Metro will provide respite from these bad roads,” said Paresh Kharkhanis, a 53-year-old resident of Patlipada who travels from Wagle Estate to Patlipada every day by road.Pothole memes on social mediaAkash Kundu and Krishnakant Kshatriya are two youngsters who made use of an online trend to make a plea for better roads in Dombivli. The original song in English by Justin Bieber called ‘Stay’ was used by the duo to create a Marathi parody. This video posted on social media has more than 12,000 views within a day of posting it. In the video, the lyrics have been changed to “I am ashamed to drive a two-wheeler, I am ashamed to drop guests, I am ashamed to pay taxes due to the poor condition of these roads.”In the video, the duo is seen dancing amidst potholes and large craters in various parts of Dombivli city. Apart from this, there are many tweets and memes of poor condition of roads and the increased potholes in Bhiwandi, Kalyan, Dombivli and Thane city that are doing the rounds.RESIDENTSPEAK“It hardly takes 30 minutes from my residence to go to Thane. However, I spend around two hours on a daily basis to cover this distance. On Thursday morning, at around 11.30am I was in front of Jupiter Hospital and by 1.15pm, I had not crossed Kharegaon Toll Naka.”Arvind Gupta, 38, resident of Tata Amantra“Getting stuck in traffic in Thane city is not only time consuming but also makes a hole in our pockets due to the expensive petrol and diesel prices. Being taxpayers, can’t we expect at least roads that are easy to drive on and do not cause traffic jams?”Sahil Sisodia, 44, resident of Patlipada“An absolute mess of traffic and chaos. (It has) been over a week of round the clock bumper to bumper traffic in and around Majiwada. The administration has gone from bad to worse & now no one simply cares.Akshay Agrawal, tweeting to TMC“Traffic in Thane city is highly mismanaged! Because of this the traffic spills on all the subsequent roads. Right from Patni till Kalwa naka and again from Majiwada till Waghbil. This is an everyday affair especially in Evenings. We get stuck for hours at the same place.”Priyannka Desai, tweeting to Thane traffic||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/commuters-fear-about-potholes-craters-on-major-roads-in-thane-101632396524074.html

Police arrested three members of the gang which had targeted a bank dealing with gold loan at Chandernagore on Tuesday. One member is still on the run. Police said that the four-member gang arrived at the bank on two two-wheelers sometime between 2pm and 3pm on Tuesday. The security guard at the gate was first overpowered and taken inside at gunpoint. The other members terrorised the bank officials with their guns. One of the bank employees, however, managed to set off the alarm. Also Read | Bhabanipur bypolls: Here’s why Hardeep Puri thinks Mamata Banerjee is ‘nervous’“When the information reached us, a team of officers from the local police station and some senior officers, including the deputy commissioner of Chandernagore, rushed to the spot. The area was cordoned off. But when we tried to contact our senior officers over mobile, we failed. No calls were going. Even SMS and WhatsApp were not working,” said a senior officer. The dacoits, on sensing that they were trapped, fire a few rounds even though police didn’t retaliate. One was arrested from the spot while the others managed to escape initially. Police swung into action and multiple naka checking points were set up at various exit points of Chandernagore to seal the fate of the other gang members. “When our officers tried to contact me from the spot, while the incident was taking place, they failed. Later, we found that the gang had used a jammer,” said Arnab Ghosh, police commissioner of Chandannagar in Hooghly district. Police found two jammers, improvised firearms from all three arrested members, 60 live cartridges and cutting tools.

I was stopped from stepping out of my residence on the day of Ganesh Visarjan. They stopped me at Karad Railway Station.""I submitted a legal notice to Mulund and MRA Marg police stations under section 149, 340, 341, 342 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). The Mumbai Police and Maharashtra government have to apologise to me within 24 hours," the BJP leader said.Somaiya was detained at Karad Railway Station in the Satara district of Maharashtra in the early hours of Monday. He was expected to visit Kohlapur on September 20 and was en route to the district via train.Ahead of his visit, Kolhapur District Collector had issued prohibitory orders against him and imposed Section 144, prohibiting gatherings on September 20 and 21.The BJP leader was scheduled to visit the properties owned by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra Rural Development Minister Hasan Mushrif in which he claims corruption has taken place. Somaiya had also levelled allegations of money laundering against Maharashtra Cabinet Ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Anil Parab.BJP slammed the Maharashtra government over Somaiya's detention and had alleged that the leader was being targeted because he was exposing scams related to corrupt ministers of the government.Earlier in the day, Mushrif said that he will file a ₹100 crore defamation suit against Somaiya."The allegation which is being made by Kirit Somaiya is part of BJPs big conspiracy and Chandrakant Patil is the mastermind of this. I have been very vocal about the Centre using central agencies against Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and on the issue of Parambir Singh. It is the reason I am being framed by BJP through Kirit Somaiya to stop me," he stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/somaiya-files-complaint-against-state-govt-mumbai-police-over-his-detention-101632365429254.html

Speaking to news agency PTI, Haque had said after resigning that he had sent the interim letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi.“I want to fight the communal BJP in the state in a more apt manner and meet the aspirations of people whom I had represented in all these years,” Haque added.During his time at the Congress, Haque was a five-time MLA from Farakka in the state’s Murshidabad district. He had also served as the secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC). Upon his resignation, Congress’ Bengal president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “I have nothing to say if someone wants to go.”Though Haque refused to answer whether he would join the Trinamool, PTI reported that he is slated to join the TMC at an election meeting.“We are ready to welcome Haque, a veteran politician, to our party fold. He will add more strength to our party in the district.” PTI quoted TMC MP Abu Taher Khan as saying.Another TMC leader Tapas Roy said on Tuesday that leaders of the Congress were realising that they can’t fight the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre and its politics of hatred.

The event also coincided with the celebration of the diamond jubilee year of the air force station, which was established in 1961.Punjab governor Banwari Lal Purohit, Haryana governor Bandaru Dattatreya, Himachal Pradesh governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar, and chief justice of Punjab and Haryana high court Ravi Shankar Jha attended the event.Although the organisers had asked visitors to maintain social distancing, protocols went for a toss amid crowding at the venue.Mismanagement galoreThe programme started at 4.30pm, but viewers started gathering at the lake around 2pm. Amid tight security arrangements, there was only one main entry point to the venue through the Kishangarh road.People were being stopped by the Chandigarh Police by putting up barricades on all sides leading up to the lake. They were asked to go through the back-end of the lake going towards Kishangarh.With no arrangements for car parking, residents parked their cars on cycle tracks, road berms and even on the roads. Long queues of cars parked on the roadside stretched from Sector 7 to Kishangarh-Manimajra light point.“It was a good show, but thereafter it was a nightmare. There were long traffic jams. Police were also finding it tough to manage the traffic as no proper planning was done,” said Ravi Bhagat, a resident of Panchkula, who had come for the air show with his family.While all roads were open for VIPs, the UT Guest House Chowk was closed to the public, even pedestrians. Hundreds of people had to go towards Kishangarh on foot. Because of this many people returned without watching the air show and there were many who stood at the UT Guest House Chowk in anticipation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhbreathtaking-acrobatic-feats-enthral-hundreds-at-sukhna-lake-air-show-101632355300401.html

All shops, including essentials’ stores and chemists, remained closed. However, transport, both commercial and passenger, plied normally. The bandh call had been given by the Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The bandh remained peaceful and there were no untoward incidents reported from anywhere, said a police official. The work in courts was also affected by the strike. The J&K high court bar association had extended support to the bandh call and had decided to abstain themselves from the courts. Reliance has already clarified that the talk of 100 stores being opened in Jammu is “completely untrue”. Opposition, including Congress, National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Apni Party, AAP, CPI(M), Lok Janshakti Party besides several social groups, also supported the bandh call. Police and paramilitary forces were deployed in strength in sensitive areas to maintain law-and- order. JCCI president Arun Gupta said successful bandh vindicated JCCI’s stance and that it will continue to fight for ‘cause’ of Jammu province. He expressed gratitude to the people of Jammu, especially traders’ fraternity and Jammu high court bar association and other bars of Jammu province, for extending their support. “Overwhelming support which the Chamber has received from various quarters of the society in the entire Jammu province is testimony to the fact that the stand taken by apex body of traders is 100% right and the government should consider the demands henceforth,” he said. He said, “The motive of JCCI was in no way to oppose the government as far as abrogation of Article 370 is concerned, as some sections in the political circles were trying to promulgate. The only reason behind this resentment was the lopsided policies of the J&K government towards the business community of the region.” “Lately, the decisions taken by the government especially that of ending the Darbar move practice, treatment with wine shop owners, abrupt closure of bars, standard operating procedures for banquets, debarring of Mahajans, Khatris, Sikhs and Jains communities from purchasing of agricultural land in J&K, issue of sand mining, crushers and brick kiln trade, passenger tax on commercial vehicles, and with current issues of Jammu Bar Association and now the move to invite Reliance stores’ chain in the UT will prove to be detrimental for the trading community,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jammu-traders-observe-peaceful-bandh-against-100-proposed-reliance-retail-stores-101632350799767.html

The weekly cases have also been seeing a marked increase in the city. While in the first week of September, Srinagar recorded 314 cases, the figure went up to 471 in the second week and further up to 526 in the third week. In the last week alone (September 15 to 21), Srinagar contributed almost half (526) of the total cases (1,074) reported in the UT. Srinagar has crossed its August tally of 1,060, in just the first three weeks of September with 1,311 infections, which is an increase of 23.5% from the previous month. Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, head of the community medicine department and Covid in-charge at Srinagar government medical college, said, “There is a slow rise in cases, not steep. The hospitalisations so far are also not increasing much but we need to act cautiously. People need to follow Covid appropriate behaviour.” Of the total 1,450 active cases in J&K, Srinagar has more than half of them at 768 cases.For the past three days, officials have been visiting city markets, particularly city centre Lal Chowk, and penalising traders for non-adherence to Covid-appropriate behavior.

23-09-2021||Chandigarh||13 animals killed in Haibowal dairy roof collapse in Ludhiana||Thirteen animals, including eight cows, four calves and a bull, were killed in a portion of the roof collapsed at a dairy farm at the Haibowal Dairy Complex on Tuesday evening. Four labourers who were present at the dairy farm had a narrow escape. The brothers who own the dairy farm, Vishal, Ravi and Hero Vasan of the Upkar Nagar area, said most of the dead cows were pregnant.Estimating losses of around ₹10 lakh, the owners said the building’s foundation had been compromised due to the presence of a choked drain at the back of the farm, and incessant rainfall over the last few days had not helped matters either. “We have around 70 animals. The accident took place an hour we returned home,” he said. Wastewater from the clogged drain had also accumulated at the farm. The owners and their neighbours tried to rescue the animals, to no avail. The non-availability of a JCB machine at night also delayed the rescue mission. Vishal said, “The structure was around 15 years old but the foundation had weakened due to flow of dairy waste into the drain that passes through the rear end of the farm.” A veterinarian from the animal husbandry department Dr Chatinder Singh provided first aid to the injured animals. “One of the cows has suffered a spinal injury and is critical,” he said. Vishal’s cousin, Rajan, who owns the adjoining dairy unit, said a portion of his unit’s roof had also collapsed in the last week. No casualty was reported.Owners blame MC, seek compensationThe owners have blamed the municipal corporation (MC) for the incident on grounds that they had failed to clean the drain lines and make concrete boundaries around the drain. Vishal said, “The drain remains choked and overflows after rainfall. The wastewater in the drain seeps into the foundation of the buildings, which also results in wild growth.”Seeking compensation for the loss, Vishal said the boundary wall of the drain lines should be made of concrete to avoid any such incident in future. “The foundation of other buildings situated in the area is also being damaged due to seepage,’ he said. Mayor Balkar Sandhu, however, said the incident had nothing to do with the drain lines as many other dairy units are also situated in the area. The structure was weak and may have collapsed due to the rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/13-animals-killed-in-haibowal-dairy-roof-collapse-in-ludhiana-101632349240738.html

In Himachal, an estimated 15,000 students have migrated to government schools since the pandemic outbreak last March.Education secretary Rajiv Sharma said, “This time, we have received orders for 30,000 additional dresses under the Atal Vardi Yojana.” The government had launched the Atal School Vardi Yojana for students of state-run school, under which all students of Classes 1 to 12 get free uniforms. Each student is provided two sets of uniform.As per information, in Classes 1 to 8, there has been an increase of 13,526 in the student strength while in Classes 11 and 12, there was a rise of 9,373. There was no change in the strength of Classes 9 & 10. Majority of the parents have opted for government schools in suburban areas.“The exodus is mostly from smaller private schools. It is possible that parents have more faith in government school but the exorbitant fees charged by private schools could also be the reason,” said the education secretary.Vijender Mehra, head of the Chatra Abhiwavak Sangh, a forum of parents opposing heavy school fees, said, “The fee charged by some of the private schools is too high, and some of the charges are totally uncalled for.”Parents across the states have been constantly demanding that the government regulate private school fee. In wake of the public outrage, Himachal Pradesh government had in June finalised a draft for bringing a legislation to regulate the school fee structure. However, the bill was not tabled in the House during the monsoon session. Himachal would have become the second state after Delhi to introduce such a legislation, if it was passed.The government had constituted a high-level committee, headed by the education minister, to look into the matter. The panel has already submitted its report to the government, which was submitted before the state cabinet for approval so that a necessary law is enacted. The draft of the Himachal Pradesh private schools (regulation of fee and other related matters) Bill, 2021, has already been uploaded on the website of the state education department for seeking suggestions and objections from the public. Despite government orders in the past two years, many private schools did not follow the directions, claiming there was no law in the state to regulate the fee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/since-pandemic-outbreak-15-000-students-in-himachal-have-shifted-to-government-schools-101632347199482.html

The approval came during a meeting between the officials of GMADA and municipal corporation (MC) on Tuesday evening. The civic body, which is to implement the Act, had been writing letters to the authority for past 18 months for approval and possession of sites. MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “Following the meeting, officials visited the earmarked locations and a consensus was reached on seven sites. We are hopeful of getting possession soon, which will help us begin the process to rehabilitate vendors.” Implementation of the Street Vendors’ (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, has been hanging fire since 2015, when MC had first ordered a survey to identify street vendors in the city. The Act is aimed at registering and rehabilitating street vendors, and also safeguarding them against exploitation at the hands of enforcement officers. It also calls for proper rationing of urban streets and spaces. Illegal vendors dot several main markets of the city, especially those in Phases 7, 3B1, 3B2, 9, 10, and 11.A private firm hired by MC to carry out the survey had initially shortlisted 2,295 vendors, but the MC House found gaps in the survey and ordered it anew. Later in 2017, the civic body concluded there were 993 moving and stationary vendors, a number that has since multiplied manifold.In January last year, MC had decided to implement the Act first in Phase 7, where as many as 139 vendors are registered. The MC commissioner had even asked the agency that conducted the survey to mark vending space in the parking areas, but the plan had fallen flat following objections by the market welfare association and area councillor. Thereon, MC issued identity cards to 200 of the 993 vendors, but they were never given designated spaces to carry out their trade. Later in August, GMADA earmarked eight sites, but failed to approve these, until now.Seven vending zonesSector 54, near Bassi Theatre Sector 55, near Phase-1 barrier Sector 56, UT-Mohali border Sector 68, near Temple of Knowledge Sector 77, near waterworks Sector 77, near Akal Ashram Colony Sector 78, near Fire Station||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-gmada-approves-seven-sites-for-rehabilitation-of-street-vendors-101632346181109.html
23-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: PGIMER patients pained by long delays in elective surgeries||Despite the decline in Covid-19 cases in the region, patients’ struggle to secure appointment dates for elective surgeries at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) continues.While the number of Covid patients admitted at the hospital has also dropped sharply, the institute is performing only half the elective surgeries as compared to the pre-Covid times, and patients are being asked to wait for three to four months for a surgery date.Elective surgery is a procedure scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency.Before the virus outbreak, over 200 such surgeries were being conducted every day at various departments of the hospital, as per the authorities.But as Covid cases started surfacing in March 2020, elective surgeries and physical out-patient departments (OPDs) were suspended, with only emergency services continuing.Though elective surgeries were resumed in September, their number never returned to 200 per day. Patients’ long wait was extended further as the planned surgeries were once again called off in March 2021 due to the second wave of the pandemic.While appointments for surgeries resumed at the hospital in June, since then the number has risen to only around 100 per day, despite the huge pendency.Ritu Singla, a 37-year-old woman from Mansa, Punjab, said, “Due to varicose veins, I have been consulting PGIMER’s neurology department for the last few years. My condition worsened last year, so surgery was the only option for relief. But doctors asked me to wait till cases started declining.”“I approached the hospital again in April this year. But even with the Covid cases receding, my wait for an appointment date has not ended. Doctors still want me to wait for another three months. But I cannot bear the pain anymore, so I am approaching a private hospital,” she said.Suffering from kidney stones, Vijay Mishra, a resident of Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, is in the same boat: “I got operated for kidney stones at PGIMER a few years back. But I was again diagnosed with small stones again in June this year. Since then, I couldn’t get appointment for physical consultation at the OPD, despite trying the tele-consultation numbers several times. In August, I finally secured an OPD appointment, but now doctors have been telling me to wait for few more months to get surgery.”‘Covid protocols take time’As per PGIMER’s financial report of 2020-21, uploaded on the hospital’s official website, 2,61,837 minor and major elective surgeries were conducted at the institute in financial year 2019-20. Their number decreased to 34,428 in financial year 2020-21 due to Covid-19 restrictions – an 87% drop.Meanwhile, at 14,704, emergency surgeries also dipped in 2020-21 from 24,022 in 2019-2020.As per the medical records department of the PGIMER, as many as 1,693 emergency surgeries and 3,452 elective surgeries were done in August this year, followed by 1,057 emergency surgeries and 2,302 elective surgeries in September so far.“To handle the Covid-19 surge, various medical institutes in the country had to suspend the elective surgeries, leading to huge pendency. The PGIMER departments are working at full capacity at present and are performing maximum surgeries, keeping in mind the Covid-19 guidelines. Every patient gets tested for Covid-19 and comorbidities before the surgery, and the procedure takes time,” said Dr AK Gupta, dean (research)-cum-medical superintendent, PGIMER.He added, “We are gradually catching up to the pre-pandemic pace for providing medical facilities to non-Covid patients. Both elective surgery count and OPD facilities are being ramped up gradually.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-patients-pained-by-long-delays-in-elective-surgeries-101632346179966.html

Several peasants have already reached the grain markets with their loaded tractor- trailers. The continuous spells of rain since Tuesday morning has mounted the worries of farmers, who are waiting for the procurement process to start at major mandis on Hisar Road and NH-44. Harjit Singh, a farmer from Raiwali village, said he was bound to bring his crop to market as it was ready for cultivation. “I came on Tuesday when it was raining and now, I’ve to wait till the purchase starts. It hasn’t stopped raining for almost two days and my crop needs to get dried, so that it is free of moisture content,” he said. His apprehensions were seconded by a fellow peasant, Soocha Singh, who also sought an early purchase.For these demands, a delegation of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Charuni) led by its district unit president Malkit Singh met deputy commissioner Vikram at his office.He said, “If the crop is not cultivated on time, it gets destroyed due to rain and other reasons and if it is brought to mandi, waterlogging affects its quality.

23-09-2021||Chandigarh||No stopping revolving chair of Ludhiana police commissioner as city gets 18 incumbents in 11 years||The 31-day tenure of Naunihal Singh as Ludhiana police commissioner was not really an aberration as the city has witnessed as many as 18 transfers of the top cop since the commissionerate system was introduced in 2010. It translates into an average tenure of a little over a year for each incumbent with some, like Naunihal, lasting barely for a few weeks. Naunihal was shifted out within three days of change in the state top leadership following the resignation of Captain Amarinder Singh as chief minister on September 18. With new police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar taking charge on Wednesday, the stint of Naunihal, who assumed office only on August 21, as the city’s senior-most cop will go down as one of the shortest. For now, RK Jaiswal holds the record of serving as commissioner for just 23 days in May 2014. Naunihal’s tenure of 31 days has now become the second shortest. The third shortest is of Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh who was transferred after just 38 days of assuming charge. Such transfers — overtly and covertly influenced by political considerations — are against the law. Section 15 of the Punjab Police Act says an officer of the rank of station house officer (SHO) and above shall have an assured tenure of one year, extendable up to three years. It can be cut short only in case of promotion, conviction, suspension, or if the officer is suffering from a grave illness, it adds. In 2014 alone, Ludhiana witnessed appointment of five police commissioners. As of now, Rakesh Kumar Agrawal is the only officer who managed to complete two years, the longest so far. Soon after his joining last month, Naunihal had prepared a roadmap for “improving” law and order in the city which included jurisdiction reorganisation of police stations, police posts and departmental offices. A detailed plan for managing traffic in the city was also chalked out. While he adopted the unconventional measure by summoning the force for patrolling at odd hours, the plans may either get a fresh push or are likely to go down the drain. The officer had also held meetings with industrialists twice. “It is a total wastage of resources and time as officers get changed so fast. Such frequent changes at senior level disrupt the functioning of the police force,” said Badish Jindal, president, Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-stopping-revolving-chair-of-ludhiana-police-commissioner-as-city-gets-18-incumbents-in-11-years-101632344919380.html
23-09-2021||Chandigarh||Who is your chief minister face for 2022 Punjab assembly polls, Sukhbir Badal asks Congress||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday asked the ruling Congress to clarify as who was their chief ministerial candidate for the 2022 Punjab assembly polls. Talking to mediapersons in Chandigarh after inducting industrialist Jagdev Singh Boparai into the party fold, Sukhbir said the Congress high command was trying to befool the people of the state “by frequently changing names of its CM candidate”. “Initially, the name of Navjot Singh Sidhu as party candidate was announced but later they said that the party will go to the polls under Capt Amarinder Singh. Then, Sidhu’s name was floated, undermining the authority of newly appointed CM Charanjit Singh Channi. Not only the people of Punjab but also the state leaders of the Congress want to know who actually is their CM face,” said Sukhbir. Taking a jibe at the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the former deputy CM said both the parties are controlled by their leaders sitting in Delhi. “The Akali Dal is only party which has base in Punjab and has been working for the welfare of the people of the state since it came into existence,” he claimed. The Congress, he alleged, failed miserably in fulfilling the promises it had made to the people of Punjab ahead of the 2017. “Changing chief minister at the fag-end of the government’s tenure will not help the party’s cause. People of Punjab will give a befitting reply to the party in the upcoming elections,” he added. SAD legislator Bikram Singh Majithia was also present on the occasion. New CM being bulldozed by Sidhu: ChughBJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh on Friday questioned if the new Punjab chief minister, Charanjit Singh Channi, was being “bulldozed” by the state Congress president, Navjot Singh Sidhu. In a statement, Chugh said the way Sidhu has been overbearingly guiding and accompanying the chief minister was a clear indication from the Congress high command that Sidhu would be calling shots in Punjab and the rest of the cabinet would play second fiddle to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/who-is-your-chief-minister-face-for-2022-punjab-assembly-polls-sukhbir-badal-asks-congress-101632344799149.html
23-09-2021||Chandigarh||Will ensure justice in 2015 sacrilege cases, says new Punjab CM Channi||Newly appointed Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Wednesday said he will ensure justice in the 2015 sacrilege incidents and that governance under his stewardship will be in consonance with propriety. The CM, who was accompanied by state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and his deputies Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni, attended early morning rituals at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The two also shouldered the palanquin carrying Guru Granth Sahib from the Akal Takht to the shrine’s sanctum sanctorum. “We have come here to seek blessings of Guru Sahib. The governance will be within the boundaries of propriety and decorum. All faiths and social sections will get due respect,” Channi said.“I assure you that there will be justice in the sacrilege cases,” Channi said, referring to the series of desecration incidents of ‘birs’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib after the incident at Bargari in Faridkot district in June 2015 and subsequent protests that left two followers dead in police firing at Behbal Kalan in October 2015 during the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP rule. Six years after the incidents, the delay in action was one of the reasons for the rebellion within the Congress against former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. Five months to go for the assembly elections, the Congress leadership, at the instance of Sidhu, had asked Capt Amarinder to fulfil the pre-poll promise of bringing the perpetrators of the sacrilege and police firing cases to justice. Sidhu said: “Politics in Punjab had veered away from real issues concerning the state but our new CM has brought them back into focus. What I felt in the company of this humble CM in the last few days, I never did in the last 17 years of my political career. Now I am feel that the Congress can serve the people fearlessly. Now, every party worker will fight for truth and rights.”Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) general secretary Bhagwant Singh Sialka, Golden Temple manager Gurinder Singh and others felicitated the CM, his deputies and Sidhu with ‘siropas’. The CM was also presented a replica of the Golden Temple.Later, the three paid tributes to the martyrs at the Jallianwala Bagh besides paying obeisance at the Durgiana Temple and the Ram Tirath Temple. Channi and Sidhu also visited residences of senior party leaders, including former minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, state working president Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Amritsar West MLA Raj Kumar Verka and Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla, in Amritsar. BOX:CM has a brief stopover at tea stall, recites poetryCM Channi and Sidhu had a brief stopover ‘Giani Tea Stall’ near Bhandari bridge, where the CM recited poetry while sitting on a stool and sipping tea after pouring it in a small bowl.“Chalte firte hue mehtab dikhaenge tumhen, humse milna kabhi, ye Punjab dikhaenge tumhen. Chand har chhat pe hai, suraj hai har aangan mein, neend se jaago, naye khwab dikhaenge tumhen (Come, I will show you moonlight while walking around.. I will show you real Punjab. Here, there is moon at every terrace and sun in every patio; wake up, will show you new dreams),” Channi said.Sidhu offered fritters to the CM with locals gathered at the tea stall. He was also seen engaging in banter with those present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-ensure-justice-in-2015-sacrilege-cases-says-new-punjab-cm-channi-101632344499627.html

The video of the incident has gone viral on social media. Forest range officer, Joshimath, Chetna Kandpal, said that after the bear attacked five people in last one week or so, permission was sought for tranquilising it. “When a team of two veterinary doctors shot two darts at it on Tuesday evening, it was still moving and attacked the team of forest officials which went ahead to catch it with a net. As it attacked them, they shot at it in self-defence,” she said. Kandpal said after being hit by the bullet, the team of forest officials tried to save it. “It was being taken for treatment to a nearby facility, but it died on the way,” she said., According to forest officials, with the onset of winters, bear attacks increase as bears come down from snowy higher reaches in search of food. Himalayan black bears can be found in and around Himalayan meadows at an elevation of 10,000 to 12,000 feet high. They come down to 5,000-6000 feet in winter months in search of food. The Himalayan black bear has been listed as a vulnerable species under the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species Incidents of man-bear conflict are reported in the state from time to time. In November last year, a 47-year-old man was killed by a Himalayan black bear in Chamoli district. In the first week of September last year, a 48-year-old man was killed by a bear in Pithoragarh district.

23-09-2021||Chandigarh||USA women’s cricket team selects former Punjab bowler Moksha Chaudhary||Back in 2012, cricketer Moksha Chaudhary from Patiala came very close to realising her dream of playing for India women’s team when she was selected in the probables for 2013 ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup. But she could not make it.Nine years on, the 31-year-old fast bowler has been selected in the United States of America (USA) women’s cricket team, which will compete in the 2021 ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier in Mexico from October 18 to 25.Chaudhary had moved to the USA when she was married in 2017, and she carried her love for cricket overseas. “After my last season with Punjab Cricket Association, I moved to Gurgaon, where I worked with Decathlon and played club cricket. Before I moved to the USA, I got in touch with a few individuals who were part of the USA cricket system or in some way connected to the organisation back then. They provided me with guidance on the structure/pathway of women’s cricket in the USA. So, I started training as soon as I moved to the US, and I played my first official USA women’s cricket tournament in June 2018,” informed Chaudhary, who is a resident of Chelmsford, Massachusetts.The USA women’s team will be competing against Argentina, Brazil, and Canada in a double round-robin event that will decide which team will advance to the ICC Women’s World Twenty20 World Qualifier in 2022.Thapar alumna idolises Jhulan GoswamiA former student of Thapar Institute of Engineering And Technology, Patiala, Chaudhary has always idolised Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath and India’s Jhulan Goswami.“I have played a lot of cricket since moving to the USA. Although getting selected for the national camp is the highlight of my cricketing career in India, I watched and learned a lot from some of the greatest in women’s cricket like Mithali Raj, Jhulan Goswami, Harmanpreet Kaur, and a few others. And now, I am thrilled to play in my first ever ICC event representing the USA,” added Chaudhary, who has also worked on her batting skills and is now a useful middle-order batter.Chaudhary was made aware of the structure of women’s cricket in the USA. She attended her first USA Combine (equivalent to selection trials in India) back in 2018. She then focused more on fitness and skills and developing as an all-rounder, and since then, she has been part of every USA women’s national camp.The USA women’s team has players of Indian origin and Sindhu Sriharsha will captain the 15-member team in the tournament in Mexico. Chaudhary is the only one with roots in Punjab.On the contribution of players from the subcontinent, Chaudhary said, “The women’s game in the USA has strong support from those with a subcontinent background. We do have players from the Caribbean and other parts of the world as well, and most are residents in the USA.”USA cricket growing by leaps and boundsUSA cricket has grown by leaps and bounds and wants to join hands with other big cricket nations in coming years. A lot of male Indian domestic cricketers have also quit cricket in India to pursue the game in the USA.“There has been a lot of progress in recent years. USA cricket has a solid domestic structure that has given players a lot of exposure and opportunities to showcase their talent. The USA women’s team has a very experienced support staff, including our head coach Julia Price, Burt Cockley, strength and conditioning coach, and others,” said Chaudhary, asserting on the team’s bright future ahead, which returns to action for their first international matches in over two years.Chaudhary, who doesn’t miss catching up with her coaches in Patiala on the phone, wants to shine for the USA in the coming years. “I want to play for the USA in the ICC Women’s World Twenty20 World Qualifier in 2022. And thereafter qualify for the Twenty20 World Cup to be held in South Africa in 2023,” said Chaudhary, who is known for bowling with the new ball and also extracting swing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/usa-women-s-cricket-team-selects-former-punjab-bowler-moksha-chaudhary-101632344259164.html

The crimes were committed in the last 24 hours, officials said. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Swapan Sharma said four members of the Kala Kachha gang were targeting secluded houses in the night by obtaining information while posing as cloth sellers in the daytime. “Their kingpin Anwar Kumar, a resident of Indira Colony in Machhiwara was arrested. They were selling stolen ornaments to a Hoshiarpur-based jeweller who too will be booked. His accomplices Shekhar, alias Shankar, Duggo, Avinash and Anju, residents of Kangra in Himachal Pradesh will be arrested soon,” Sharma said. In the second case, four persons — Tarandeep Tarni of Mulowal in Dhuri, Harpal Singh Ghuggi, Gurwinder Singh, alias Godi of Tohana in Fatehabad and Ajay of Narwana in Haryana— were arrested in Dhuri, he added. “The police recovered a .32 bore pistol and two cartridges from them. Their interrogation led us to a man in Madhya Pradesh who was selling illegal weapons. They admitted to have looted ₹1 lakh in cash, 100 gram gold jewellery from a house under the jurisdiction of the Dhuri city police station around a week ago,” he said. Mandeep Singh, alias Babbu, Lakhvir of Janata Nagar and Sudhir Kumar of Dhuri were nabbed with a country-made pistol, 5 cartridges, jewellery and a motorcycle. “Their interrogation led us to a seller of illegal weapons in MP,” Sharma claimed.

Hundreds of city residents joined the army and Major Rajput’s family during his last rites. Haryana assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta was also present. The inconsolable father of Major Rajput, KS Arya said, “He was my only child. How will I live without him.”The 28-year-old had got engaged just a few months ago. While his father is a former commercial pilot and an advocate, his mother Usha is a government schoolteacher. Major Rajput’s parents had left for Udhampur on Tuesday to bring his body to his home town Panchkula. Major Rajput, along with Major Rohit Kumar, was on a training sortie when his Cheetah helicopter crash-landed in Shiv Garh Dhar near Patnitop in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, resulting in grave injuries.

23-09-2021||Chandigarh||Bail jumpers can’t seek parity with other accused, says Punjab and Haryana high court||The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that those jumping bail can’t seek parity in seeking anticipatory bail with those wherein there is an apprehension of arrest on institution of FIR or lodging of complaint or having been summoned by a court for the first time to face trial. The bench of justice Gurvinder Singh Gill said it is only when a person apprehends his arrest pursuant to an accusation having been made regarding commission of non-bailable offence that provisions of section 438 CrPC (provisions which deal with anticipatory bail matters) may be availed of. The court dismissed a plea filed by one Pawan Kumar against whom a complaint under the sections of Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act was filed in January 2018. He secured anticipatory bail but on account of absence before the trial court in July 2019 proceedings and thereafter, protection given to him from arrest was withdrawn and in January 2020, arrest warrants were issued against him. He had approached high court stating that his son left the house without telling anyone and his family members kept on searching for him and it was only in the first week of June, 2021 that he came to know about the whereabouts of his son. It was on account of the mental tension that he could not appear before the trial court. Another argument was that it was also on account of spread of pandemic that he was prevented from causing appearance. The court observed that the petitioner remained absent for a period of almost two years. On claim of son went missing, court found that there was nothing to support the said claim as even DDR was not submitted before the court. Apparently, the contention has been cooked up by the petitioner. His argument that he was prevented on account of Covid-19 can also not be accepted as the virus had not spread in July 2019. Taking note of provisions of the CrPC, the bench observed that it is only upon an apprehension of arrest consequent upon initiation of some criminal proceedings that the said provisions can be invoked. The bench also took note of an SC judgment in which it was held that when an accused is on bail, he is in a way in constructive custody and if the law requires him to surrender or to take him back in custody, it cannot be said that there is apprehension of his arrest on account of accusation as he is deemed to be in constructive custody already and that in such circumstances provisions of Section 438 CrPC cannot be availed of. The court further observed that court cannot lose sight of the fact that there would be certain cases where an accused is unable to appear before the trial court on account of genuine reasons. “In such cases, the accused can surrender before the trial court and it is expected that the trial courts would take a lenient view in genuine cases and decide the regular bail application expeditiously,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bail-jumpers-can-t-seek-parity-with-other-accused-says-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-101632343179417.html

Rahul and Priyanka, who were holidaying in Shimla, went back to Delhi via Chandigarh. They travelled from Shimla to Chandigarh by road and then took a flight to Delhi. Former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar also accompanied them from Chandigarh. Though there is speculation that Rahul is consulting the former PPCC chief on cabinet formation, Jakhar said that it was a chance meeting and nothing should be read into this. “I was travelling to Delhi and they (Gandhi siblings) were also on the same flight,” he said.Jakhar, a Hindu face, was a frontrunner for the chief minister’s post with Rahul’s backing after Capt Amarinder Singh resigned on September 18. However, some party leaders, including Ambika Soni and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, favoured a Sikh CM and later Channi’s name was finalised from among other aspirants.Channi, his two deputies Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu had met central leaders of the party in Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the probables for the state cabinet. The names doing the rounds for inclusion include Pargat Singh, Gurkirat Singh Kotli, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, and Raj Kumar Verka. There is speculation that some former ministers, including Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Sunder Sham Arora may not find place in the new council of ministers.

The process of co-option means appointment to the membership of a committee or any other body by the invitation of existing members.The Directorate of Gurdwara Elections, New Delhi, disqualified Sirsa on the grounds that he is not well-versed with the reading and writing of Gurmukhi as per eligibility conditions for co-option laid down in the DSGMC Act-1971. “I have challenged the biased orders of the directorate….it is not written anywhere in the (DSGMC) Act that Gurbani has to be recited,” he said. “How can he (director) quantify what is less (knowledge of Gurmukhi) or what is more,” asked Sirsa. He added that 212 candidates contested gurdwara polls (held on August 22) and none of them, except him, were made to take the test. This despite the fact that the directorate had cleared my nominations thrice in the past, said Sirsa.. Sirsa, a former DSGMC president, had lost the August 22 election to Shiromani Akali Dal (Delhi) candidate Harvinder Singh Sarna. On August 25, when the result of the polls was announced, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal had announced that Sirsa will continue as the DSGMC president.Sarna had filed a petition in the HC, seeking Sirsa’s disqualification for cooption on the grounds of lack of Gurmukhi knowledge.

23-09-2021||Chandigarh||Fake billing racket: Another Punjabi University employee held||Two days after arresting four people, including the main accused, in the fake billing racket at Patiala University, police made two more arrests on Wednesday. One of them is a university employee while the other is a female relative of the main accused, Nishu Chaudhary. The employee has been identified as Bhupinder Singh, a technical assistant whose name cropped up during investigation. Chaudhary, had deposited ₹4 lakh in Singh’s bank account, said deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Sourav Jindal. Chaudhary’s relative, whose name has been withheld, was also arrested from the university campus.Jindal said Chaudhary has also confessed to his role in the racket. Posted as a senior assistant, he was siphoning off university funds in the name of fake research scholars since 2016. His wrongdoings went unchecked for all these years before he was caught submitting fake bills with the accounts departments in May this year.The other three men arrested along with Chaudhary on Monday are Jatinder Singh, Ashu Kumar and Sonu Kumar. While Sonu is Chaudhary’s driver, the other two used to pose as research scholars. The DSP said investigations have not pointed to the involvement of any senior functionary of the university so far. “The exact amount of funds that were siphoned off will be disclosed once the investigation is over,” he said.According to the preliminary inquiry, Chaudhary and his aides pocketed up to ₹40 lakh. A police official privy to the investigation said Chaudhary has illegal moveable and immovable property in Himachal Pradesh and Patiala. “Police are also gathering records of all his properties so that they could be seized after completing legal formalities,” said the official.In May this year, the cash-strapped university’s internal audit department and finance wing had red-flagged five bills amounting to ₹6 lakh. The stamp and signatures of the department head were found to be fake and the names of research scholars and assistants against whom the bills were raised turned out to be bogus. A three-member committee headed by registrar Varinder Kaushik probed the bank accounts of Chaudhary and others involved. The help of the university’s forensic department was taken to investigate the fake signatures and stamps, which nailed Chaudhary. Following this, police registered a case of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fake-billing-racket-another-punjabi-university-employee-held-101632341979503.html

23-09-2021||Chandigarh||36 nominated members of PU senate notified||The Vice-President of India, who is also the chancellor of Panjab University (PU), has notified a list of 36 nominated members to the varsity senate days before the first phase of the graduate constituency goes to polls on September 26. The list has left out many notable names, which took many members by surprise. This year’s most-notable exclusion is that of the former MP and Union minister Pawan Kumar Bansal’s. Senators said this is the first time that the former minister has not been included in the senate because of his association with the Congress. Bansal, meanwhile, said, “I am not surprised by this exclusion given the way things are going on at the university with the current leadership. For the past few months, I was convinced that this would happen.” Former Union minister Kapil Sibal’s brother VK Sibal, who was among the nominated members last time, has not been included as well.The name of former Chandigarh BJP head Sanjay Tandon has also been omitted. Meanwhile, former mayor Davesh Moudgil has been included as a nominated member for the first time in the PU syndicate. “I want that we work above the party lines for the betterment of students and foster an academic culture in the university,” Moudgil said.PUTA hails enhanced selection of teachersPanjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) has hailed the inclusion of a high number of academicians and professors in this year’s nomination list. PUTA president Mritunjay Kumar said, “Over 20 teachers associated with us have been selected and we hope that these teachers will now rise above their affiliation with political parties or groups and work with PUTA for the betterment of the university.” Interestingly, many of these selected professors had also stood for PUTA elections in 2019, but ended up losing. A senior senate member on the condition of anonymity said that many professors have been chosen due to their proximity to the V-C rather than their academic merit or experience.Another member added how “groupism” within the BJP is also visible in the selection. “This senate selection has many members of the group associated with Satya Pal Jain. Apart from Tandon’s exclusion, the group associated with him has also been neglected. Subhash Sharma, founder-director of Center for Economic Policy Research in Mohali, who was associated with the BJP-RSS group in the last senate, has also been neglected. People who belong to Punjab are also missing in the selections,” he added. The PU student council will once again have no representation here. The term of these nominated fellows would end on October 31, 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/36-nominated-members-of-pu-senate-notified-101632341918921.html

23-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab mandis see 50-fold rise in cotton arrival this year||Amid high demand and better prices being offered by private players, Punjab has witnessed a 50-fold increase in the arrival of cotton crop at mandis as compared to the figures till September 21 last year.According to the Punjab Mandi Board, about 80,000 quintal crop has been purchased at various mandis in the cotton belt spread across south Punjab till September 21. In the corresponding period last kharif season, various purchase centres had reported the arrival of only 1,637 quintals.Industry sources attribute the sharp rise in arrival of the crop to better rates being offered by buyers, after last year’s uncertainty that had hit demand.Notwithstanding the deadly pink bollworm attack, Mansa and Bathinda districts have seen a brisk arrival of 27,000 and 12,000 quintals of cotton, respectively. In Fazilka, nearly 26,000 quintal cotton has been sold by farmers till September 21.According to the mandi board data, cotton is being bought for rates as high as ₹7,010/quintal. In fact, nearly 98% of the produce has been purchased at rates above the season’s expected minimum support price (MSP) of ₹5,925/quintal.This year, Punjab has an estimated 3.25 lakh hectares under cotton. In a few parts, where cotton is sown before May, picking of bolls commences in mid-August but the major harvest begins after September 15. Market watchers say last year, the demand for cotton was low due to uncertainty caused by Covid-induced restrictions.Mandi Board cotton state coordinator Rajnish Goel said the average rate of cotton in September 2020 was about ₹4,500/quintal. As the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) starts buying the non-perishable crop from October 1, farmers have a tendency to stock the produce till the market offers a higher price. “This time the average rate of cotton is ₹6,800-7,000/quintal, which is much higher than the expected MSP. A formal notification of MSP on long-medium varieties, that are commonly sown in Punjab, has not been issued yet, but it is expected to be ₹5,925,” said Goel, adding that Punjab is expected to surpass last season’s production of 50 lakh quintals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-mandis-see-50-fold-rise-in-cotton-arrival-this-year-101632341559093.html
23-09-2021||Chandigarh||Tarn Taran: 5 men let off in illicit liquor cases as police delay challans||The failure of police to file chargesheet in four cases of illicit liquor seizures registered between 2016 and 2018 led to the acquittal of five men in Tarn Taran. The development comes a year after around 140 people were killed while several others lost their vision after consuming illicit liquor in Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur.The four cases in question were registered at the Tarn Taran City police station under the Excise Act. Police were supposed to file challans against the accused within one year or with a special sanction of the state government in case of delay. However, the chargesheets were submitted in the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Rajesh Ahluwalia on Tuesday. The five men are Sarwan Singh alias Bholu (50), Akash Rajput (23), Sakattar Singh (44), Sukhwinder Singh, alias Sethi (35), and Baljit Singh, alias Katta (32), of Tarn Taran. They had been out on bail. Sarwan was booked after the alleged recovery of 200 litres of raw alcohol in May 2017. Akash was allegedly nabbed with 10 bottles of illicit liquor in October 2017, and Sakkattar was booked for allegedly carrying nine bottles of illicit liquor in April 2016. Sukhwinder and Baljit were arrested with 106 bottles of illicit liquor in September 2018.Citing provisions under Section 75 of the Punjab Excise Act, 1914, the court noted that no judicial magistrate shall take cognisance of such offences unless the prosecution is instituted within a year after the date on which the offence is alleged to have been committed or there is a special sanction. “There is no such sanction obtained by the prosecution for filing the challan beyond the period of limitation... Accordingly, the accused is discharged,” the judge said. Slamming the police apathy, senior advocate Sarabjit Singh Verka said action should be taken against those who failed to discharge their duty. “This could be just the tip of the iceberg. There may be many such cases in which challans were not filed on time,” he said.Senior superintendent of police OS Ghumman said: “The matter is not in my attention. I will check and seek a report. We have zero tolerance against all those involved in illicit liquor trade.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tarn-taran-5-men-let-off-in-illicit-liquor-cases-as-police-delay-challans-101632341199019.html

23-09-2021||Chandigarh||Super CM Sidhu dictating terms to Channi: Amarinder||Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday hit out at the “Super CM” Navjot Singh Sidhu and Congress advisers KC Venugopal, Ajay Maken and Randeep Singh Surjewala for their “ostensible” interference in the newly constituted Congress government led by Charanjit Singh Channi. Amarinder, whose resignation paved the way for the new chief minister, questioned his bête noire and state Congress president Sidhu’s interference in Channi’s domain, stating that the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) should just decide on party affairs. “I had a very good PPCC president (Sunil Jakhar). I took his advice, but he never told me how to run the government,” said Amarinder in a statement, contrasting it with the way Sidhu was virtually dictating the terms, with Channi simply nodding along. Amarinder, who had a running battle with Sidhu and several dissenting ministers and legislators for months, quit the CM’s post on Saturday after the All India Congress Committee (AICC) summoned a meeting of the legislature party without informing him. Channi was one of the four disgruntled cabinet ministers who had, at one stage, demanded the two- time chief minister’s removal. Interacting with some news channels, Amarinder said it was a sad situation for Punjab that Sidhu, who could not handle his own ministry, should be managing the cabinet. “If Sidhu behaves as the super CM, the party won’t function,” he said, adding that under this “drama master’s leadership”, it would be a big thing if the Congress managed to touch double digits in the upcoming assembly elections. Pointing out that as the CM, he had called the shots and appointed his own ministers, as he knew the capability of each one of them, he questioned how things were being run from Delhi and how Congress central leaders like KC Venugopal, Ajay Maken and Randeep Surjewala could decide who is good for which ministry. ‘Will pit a strong candidate to defeat Sidhu’ Amarinder declared that he would fight Navjot Sidhu’s elevation as Punjab’s chief ministers tooth and nail, and was ready to make any sacrifice to “save the country from such a dangerous man”. Amarinder said he will pit a strong candidate against Sidhu in the 2022 assembly polls to ensure his defeat. Asserting that he will only leave politics on a high, the former CM said: “I was ready to leave after victory, but never after a loss.” He said he had offered his resignation to AICC president Sonia Gandhi three weeks earlier, but she had asked him to continue. “If she had just called me and asked me to step down, I would have,” he said, adding that, “as a soldier, I know how to do my task and leave once I am called back.” He said he had even told Sonia that he was ready to hang his boots and allow someone else to take over as the CM after leading the Congress to another sweeping win in Punjab. “But that did not happen, so I will fight,” he said, taking strong exception to being subjected to humiliation after a CLP meeting was called in a secretive manner without taking him into confidence. ‘Priyanka, Rahul inexperienced, misguided by advisers’ “I would not have taken MLAs on a flight to Goa or some place. That is not how I operate. I don’t do gimmicks, and the Gandhi siblings know that is not my way,” he said, adding, “Priyanka and Rahul are like my children… this should not have ended like this. I am hurt.” He said the two sibling were quite “inexperienced” and their advisers were clearly misguiding them. Indicating that he was still keeping his political options open, the former CM said he was talking to his friends before deciding on his future course of action. “You can be old at 40 and young at 80,” he said, making it clear that he did not see his age as a hurdle. On allegations of inaccessibility, Amarinder said he had been elected to the Vidhan Sabha seven times, and twice to the Parliament. “There must be something right with me,” he said. Challenges new setup to throw Badals, Majithia behind bars Referring to complaints that he was not acting against the Badals and Bikram Singh Majithia in the sacrilege and drugs cases, Amarinder said he believed in letting the law take its course. “But now these people who were complaining against me are in power; let them throw the Akali leaders behind bars if they can!” he said. Taking a jibe at Sidhu over allegations of inaction against ministers involved in illegal mining, he said: “Those very ministers are now with these leaders!” While Channi was intelligent and well educated, he, unfortunately, had no experience in managing home affairs, which was critical for Punjab that shares 600-km border with Pakistan, said Amarinder. The amount of weapons and ammunition coming into Punjab from Pakistan is alarming, he said, once again slamming Sidhu for his “close personal relations” with the Pakistani leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/super-cm-sidhu-dictating-terms-to-channi-amarinder-101632340958951.html

The residents rued that open dumping of garbage at the roadside and near the residential area creates nuisance and results in unhygienic conditions. Repeated requests of the residents living in the close vicinity of the dumping site to shift the same have failed to yield any results. They said they had even submitted complaints at the state level but to no avail. BJP leaders led by state executive member Bikram Sidhu stated that a complaint regarding the issue has also been forwarded to MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal.Sidhu stated, “The area looks filthy owing to the dump as it is established on the main road. The garbage spread on the road also creates traffic bottlenecks. Also, the presence of the dump encourages stray cattle menace. The dump is situated near the residential area and if the authorities fail to remove it in 21 days, we will raise an agitation in the area.”Despite attempts made to reach MC health officer Vipal Malhotra, he was not available for comments. Earlier, the officials stated that the MC is working to install a static compactor in the area to remove the open dumpsite. Garbage collected from houses is dumped at different secondary garbage dumpsites in the city, from where the waste is shifted to the main dumpsite at Tajpur Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-sbs-nagar-residents-bjp-leaders-seek-shifting-of-garbage-dump-site-101632340779230.html
23-09-2021||Delhi||More patrolling, mechanised sweeping: MCDs’ action plans||The three municipal corporations have submitted their action plans to control air pollution in the city before the annual winter spike, said officials of the civic bodies.Largely similar, the three action plans to curb pollution from waste burning and dust focus on intensive patrolling, increased mechanical sweeping, targeted operation of GPS monitored water sprinkling tankers and a new portal, being developed with the help of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to monitor large construction sites.Shyam Sunder Agarwal, mayor of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) said the civic body will once again focus on deploying water sprinklers and mechanical sweepers and is likely to broadly replicate last year’s plan.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) action plan said it will procure four new electrical road sweepers that can cover inner colony roads, and added that a dashboard has been set up to monitor in real-time the operations of 24 mechanical road sweepers and 83 water sprinklers that will be pressed into action.A senior official from the north corporation overseeing the formulation of the plan said the municipal corporations will, with DPCC, develop a common portal, on which it will be mandatory to register all construction sites above 20,000 sqm area. The civic body will also deploy 48 patrolling teams to check instances of waste burning in the city.“Earlier, the patrolling teams operated at night, but we have decided that they will now function round-the-clock over the coming months. We have kept the target of planting 20,000 trees and 30,000 shrubs, of which 17,098 trees and 25,493 shrubs have been planted till August 31,” the official said.The north MCD has also set up a separate dust control and management cell headed by its chief engineer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/more-patrolling-mechanised-sweeping-mcds-action-plans-101632340125993.html
23-09-2021||Delhi||What do the new targets mean for Delhi?||The World Health Organization’s (WHO) new standards for acceptable pollution levels announced on Wednesday mean that Delhi’s prolonged battle for clean air is going much worse than previously thought. Even the handful of good air quality days that Delhi was getting each year were not really so as per the new “safe” norms, shows an analysis of recent years’ data by HT.The rare days that Delhi met the 24-hour targets of air pollution in 2019 and 2020 go down drastically if seen against the revised standards, while in 2021, not a single day has passed where the Capital’s air has been acceptable by the new threshold, according to the analysis.The revised standards were issued by WHO on Wednesday for six air pollutants which include PM2.5 and PM10. For daily PM2.5 levels, the safe zone was brought down from 25µg/m³ in 2005 to 15µg/m³, while it was reduced from 50µg/m³ to 45µg/m³ for PM10.

23-09-2021||Kolkata||Someone else will be CM if I don’t get every vote, says Mamata at campaign meet||Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday told voters in Ekbalpore that someone else would become West Become chief minister if she did not manage to get all their votes. She was referring to the September 30 bypoll at south Kolkata’s Bhawanipore from where she is contesting.“Cast your vote even if it rains. I will suffer if I don’t get even one vote. Don’t be complacent and assume that my victory is ensured. Please don’t do that. If you want to see me as chief minister you must vote for me. Every vote is crucial. If I do not win, someone else will become the chief minister since we are in the majority,” Banerjee said at her first election meeting in Ekbalpore area where members of the Muslim community comprise a sizeable chunk of voters. Speaking in Hindi and Bengali and using a few Urdu words such as taqdeer (destiny), Banerjee said, “I contested from Nandigram but there was a conspiracy to defeat me. The matter is being heard by a court. It is destiny that I am contesting from Bhawanipore again to become chief minister.” For the record, TMC trailed the BJP at two Hindu-dominated civic body wards in Bhawanipore in the last two polls that Banerjee won. Around 20% voters in this constituency are Muslims. “Voters of Kidderpore (of which Ekbalpore is a part) supported me six times when I contested and won the Kolkata South Lok Sabha seat. I am sure you will support me again,” said Banerjee. “The BJP is a party of liars. They allege that Bengalis are not allowed to perform Durga Puja and Kali Puja. People from all communities freely practice their religions here whereas in Tripura, the government has imposed Section 144 (of the Cr. PC). How can Tripura residents perform Durga Puja?” said Banerjee. She was referring to the prohibitory orders the Biplab Deb government has imposed till November citing the Covid-19 pandemic. Because of this, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee could not hold the TMC’s first rally in Agartala. Before the March-April assembly polls, Banerjee surprised everyone when she announced in East Midnapore’s Nandigram that she would contest the local seat against her protégé-turned-adversary, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari, and not Bhawanipore, her old seat. In the polls held on April 1, Adhikari, the incumbent candidate, defeated her by around 1500 votes and subsequently became the leader of the opposition in the state assembly. Reacting to Banerjee’s appeal to Ekbalpore voters, Adhikari said, “The person responsible for this bypoll is Suvendu Adhikari. A defeated chief minister is making desperate efforts. She did not learn from the Nandigram lesson.” Bhawanipore witnessed a flurry of activity on Wednesday as Banerjee, Adhikari, Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta and Bengal BJP’s new president Sukanta Majumdar campaigned in different parts of the constituency. Majumdar entered into an altercation with the police when he and the BJP workers were stopped from visiting homes of voters at Harish Chatterjee Street where the chief minister lives. The area is marked as a high security zone. Akash Magharia, deputy commissioner of police (south), who stopped the BJP team, said, “There are restrictions in this zone. Moreover, we could not allow so many people in view of the pandemic. Nobody could show vaccination certificates.” The highest concentration of Kolkata’s Sikh community is based in Bhawanipore. Puri offered prayers at Gurdwara Sant Kutiya Ji and also visited the ancestral homes of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose and Bharatiya Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee before meeting voters at several locations. Banerjee took a dig at Puri saying he should tell voters why price of cooking gas has touched the ceiling. In a rebuttal, Puri said, “The chief minister should tell people why the state is against imposition of goods and services tax (GST) on petrol and diesel. A major component of fuel prices in Bengal comprises state tax. She should think before making this a political issue.” While addressing residents of Lord Sinha Road, where non-Bengali Hindu voters and members of the business community are in the majority, Adhikari attacked the chief minister. “What has this government given in five months? The defeated chief minister only offers doles and subsidies. Bengal’s debt burden is hovering around ₹5,00,000 crore. Never expect jobs and industries here,” said Adhikari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/someone-else-will-be-cm-if-i-don-t-get-every-vote-says-mamata-at-campaign-meet-101632340118986.html

The allotment was done in connivance with LIT officials,” he added.“Clause 15 of allotment agreement stated that the land can only be used to propagate the ideals and principles of former Prime Minister Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru by constructing an educational institute. Clause 16 states that the land cannot be sold, leased, or rented out. However, 30 illegal shops and a commercial building have been established and rented out. The trust has also established an exhibition centre and an auditorium and rent them out for holding events,” alleged Monga.LIT superintending engineer Buta Ram said that no such complaint has been received by his office.“I will look into the matter and check the record.

23-09-2021||Chandigarh||Offered to resign 3 weeks ago: Captain Amarinder Singh||Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh lashed out at the Congress leadership, and vowed to defeat his arch rival, state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, underlining that a recent change-of-guard had failed to stem factional tensions in the party months before polls.In interviews with local news channels, Singh called party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra “inexperienced”, said he had offered his resignation to party chief Sonia Gandhi three weeks ago, and warned that with Sidhu as the CM face, Congress will struggle in elections scheduled for early next year.“Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi are like my children...this should not have ended like this. I am hurt,” Singh said. “Fact is the Gandhi siblings are inexperienced and their advisors are clearly misguiding them.”The two-time CM also said he was humiliated by the party calling a meeting of all lawmakers without informing him beforehand. “I would not have taken the MLAs on a flight to Goa or some other place. That is not how I operate. I don’t do gimmicks,” he added.This is the first time Singh has publicly spoken about the Congress leadership since a feud erupted between him and Sidhu in early May. The party attempted to resolve the differences, but the fight raged on, ultimately culminating in Singh’s dramatic resignation on Saturday.A day later, three-time MLA and senior Dalit leader Charanjit Singh Channi took over as CM.Two senior Congress leaders, HT spoke to, refused to comment on Amarinder’s remarks.Singh also said that he had tendered his resignation to party president Sonia Gandhi three weeks before he was removed, but that she had asked him to continue. “If she had just called me and asked me to step down, I would have,” he said, adding, “as a soldier, I know how to do my task and leave once I am called back.” Singh said that he asked the Congress president to ask someone else to take over as CM and lead the party to another sweeping victory. “But that did not happen, so I will fight,” he said, adding that he will leave politics on a high.In his comments, Singh praised Channi but questioned his lack of experience in tackling border issues. He reserved the sharpest attacks for Sidhu, a former state minister who resigned from the cabinet in 2019 after Singh changed his portfolio. Singh said he would fight any attempt to name Sidhu the party’s CM face tooth and nail , and added that he was ready to make any sacrifices to save the country from such a “dangerous” man. “Will pit a strong person against him to ensure his defeat in the 2022 assembly polls,” Singh said, without adding more details.On Saturday, the former CM had said he was not looking to change parties and would remain in the Congress.He also accused Sidhu and other central Congress leaders of meddling in the state’s affairs, naming senior leaders KC Venugopal, Ajay Maken and Randeep Singh Surjewala in particular.“If Sidhu behaves as the super CM, the party won’t function,” he said, adding that under this “drama master’s leadership”, it would be a big thing if the Congress managed to touch double digits in Punjab in the next elections. The Congress holds 80 of the state’s 117 seats.“I had a very good PPCC president (Sunil Jakhar). I took his advice but he never told me how to run the government,” said Singh.On allegations of inaccessibility, Singh said he had been elected to the state assembly seven times and twice to the Parliament. “There must be something right with me,” he said,Responding to the charge that he didn’t take action against Akali Dal leaders in the sacrilege and drugs cases, the former CM dared the new leadership in the state to take action. “Let them throw the Akali leaders behind bars if they can,” Singh retorted.Despite repeated attempts, Sidhu and Channi couldn’t be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/offered-to-resign-3-weeks-ago-captain-amarinder-singh-101632339474762.html

The practice has been ensuring enormous benefits to farmers harvesting the stubble in the fields for the past few years.The farmers who have been decomposing the stubble in the fields are now using fewer fertilizers, saving their money, witnessing improved soil health, and increased fertility.Lakhwinder Singh, a farmer from Jagraon’s Agwar Pona village, said he has been managing stubble through the in-situ technique for the last five years.“I have been using 20% less DAP and urea in the field. The soil structure has also improved considerably,” told Singh.He added that he has been using a paddy stubble chopper to harvest residue in the soil that has helped increase his yield of potato crop considerably and reduced his dependence on fertilizers.While sharing his experience, he said the practice had improved soil health and led to a significant increase in the yield of wheat, moong, and potato.Agriculture development officer (ADO) Raminder Singh said if all farmers adopt these techniques, they can save crores of rupees that they incur on purchasing nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash.He said the management of paddy stubble would add up substantial amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash. Singh said residues help protect the soil from wind and water erosion and keep the soil cool by preserving precious water.Exhorting the farmers to adopt in-situ crop residue management wholeheartedly to manage the stubble, he said that burning paddy stubble is very hazardous for the farmers and land, which is considered a mother by our agriculturalists. He said that the burning of paddy ruins the health of soil besides casting a castigating effect on the environment.He added that due to stubble burning, several major and micronutrients of soil get destroyed, adding that the burning of paddy stubble produces several poisonous gases which harm human health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-farmers-warm-up-to-crop-residue-management-101632339278951.html

We have decided to conduct an annual board exam for Class 8 students across state for the current academic session of 2021-22,” he added.In 2010, the Haryana board had conducted Class 8 exams last time in which 3.44 lakh students, of 3.67 lakh, had passed the exam.Pawan Kumar, principal of a private school in Bhiwani which is affiliated to the CBSE, said the decision taken by the Haryana board is creating a lot of problems for their students.“We have separate boards and we follow different rules than the schools affiliated with the BSEH. Moreover, there is some difference in the curriculum opted by us. This move will decrease the level of education and lead to instability in the career of the children,” he added.The union bearers of the CBSE and ICSE school unions have decided to go to court against this decision.“The decision of the state education department is illegal. We will talk to the state government about it. If needed, we will also approach the court. This move will curtail the level of education in CBSE and ICSE schools. If the board wants to experiment with its students it is free to do so but it should not intervene in the CBSE and other boards matters,” said the principals of two Rohtak-based CBSE schools.Talking over the phone, BSEH chairman Jagbir Singh defended the government’s decision to conduct Class 8 board exams of all students studying in Haryana irrespective of their boards.“The BSEH used to conduct board exams for Classes 5, 8, 10 and 12. With implementation of the RTE 2011, the board exams are being held only for Classes 10 and 12. From this academic session, the annual examination of the children of Class 8 of all the boards in Haryana will be taken by the Haryana school board,” Jagbir said.“Those who are opposing the move can go to court to challenge our decision.

23-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: ‘Mohabbat’ trumps all||Love has spread like a virus. This being the chaotic Walled City, it is more appropriate to say that love has leaked along the gallis and kuchas of Shahjahanabad like sewage water from a broken drainage pipe.To cut the story short: love, which is mohabbat, has transmuted into mohabbat ka sherbet. This cooling drink has trumped all the other drinks one would encounter in the historic Mughal-era quarter, such as meethi lassi, karadi ka doodh, bel sherbet, sattu ka ghol, ganne ka juice, jal zeera pani, and of course Rooh Afza, the legendary rose drink that was born in Old Delhi at the turn of the last century. (Although mohabbat ka sherbet does have Rooh Afza as one of its principal ingredients.)The stalls for this drink are particularly ubiquitous in the main street of Matia Mahal. Just too many establishments happen to be of mohabbat ka sherbet. Many of these are mere carts. Others are part of a larger enterprise, such as Salim Tea House that recently started to stock the drink in a separate street-facing counter. Even some garment stores are selling it.One sherbet place has a large billboard that, at night, lits up in red—disco style—with the signage ‘sharbat e mohabbat.’ It claims to be the original shop that started this drink nine years ago.The sherbet consists of watermelon juice mixed with a concoction of milk, Rooh Afza syrup and lots of sugar. A few sellers garnish the drink with rose petals. Most prepare the sherbet in advance and keep it cold with slabs of ice. Sometimes artfully cut slices of water melons are arranged symmetrically upon the pink tetra packs of full-cream Amul Gold Milk. The stalls remain crowded throughout the day, throughout the long evening and way beyond the midnight. The sweating drinkers swallow down the entire glass in one or two gulps, and quickly move on.Curiously, no sherbet seller is able to confidently tell that just why is this drink named after mohabbat.One imaginative stall owner explains that may be because the sherbet is as sweet as mohabbat. But then Old Delhi’s sickly sweet street chai too ought to be called mohabbat ki chai.Whatever, the winters are about to start, and while most mohabbat ka sherbet stalls will continue to serve the drink (“since these days melons remain available the year round”, according to one hawker), the pleasure of such an icy drink will not be as thrilling in the cold season.Come after the sunset, when the aforementioned billboard of the “original” sherbet landmark (shop no. 1125) lights up the night sky.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-mohabbat-trumps-all-101632338230026.html

The state agriculture marketing board has already deputed its staff at the entrance of all mandis and they are maintaining records of all farmers, paddy varieties and quantity of the paddy that they are brining in.Mandi officials said there were some loopholes and traders, with the help of farmers, took advantage causing loss to the government with fake or bogus procurement.The chief administrator of the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board (HSAMB) has already given a strong message as three secretaries of grain markets of Karnal, Taraori and Indri have already been suspended for alleged discrepancies in arrival of paddy.As per reports, the mandi secretaries of Karnal and Indri were suspended for not following the instruction issued by the department to deploy employees on gates for record of arrival of paddy in the mandi.Vinay Yadav, chief administrator of the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board, said, “We have taken steps to bring more transparency and corruption-free procurement from this season.”“We have taken steps and now the records of all varieties coming in the mandis is being maintained and strict action will be taken against officials for any irregularities or complaints of bogus procurement,” he added.What need to be fixed?Even the registration on the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Bayora’ portal has been made mandatory for all farmers to sell their Parmal paddy on minimum support prices, but there were some loopholes as many farmers who grow basmati varieties and also have other crops also get the registration of Parmal varieties.This will help commission agents to sell the produce on non-registered farmers, especially those from UP, on the portal of local farmers.But now, the government is maintaining records of all varieties of paddy coming into the mandis and this will help the government counter the fake procurement of Parmal varieties.Instructions have also been issued to the officials to mention the variety of paddy – Basmati or Parmal – to ensure that farmers cannot sell Parmal varieties on registration of Basmati varieties.“As the government has already started direct payment to farmers in the last rabi season, there were reports that the farmers also sell their registration to the commission agents helping them sell the produce of UP farmers on their registration and the registered farmers would return the payment to them after deducting their commission,” said an official, on condition of anonymity.The government has also decided to conduct a physical verification of all registered farmers with the help of officials of the revenue department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-takes-steps-to-counter-bogus-foodgrain-procurement-101632337903474.html

Sinha later said that the video was edited and selective portions of his instructions were shown to create a controversy.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had admitted that the choice of Sinha’s words was not right.“He (Sinha) should not have used such language though it is the job of officials to enforce law and order. I’m not saying he should not have enforced the rule of law strictly,” Khattar had said.The chief minister also clarified that Sinha was deputed at a spot about 10-12 kilometres away from the spot where the lathi-charge took place.The Commission will complete the inquiry and submit the report to the state government within a month from the date of publication of notification in the official gazette, an official spokesperson said.The August 28 lathi-charge on protesting farmers who were allegedly trying to disrupt a BJP meeting had led to a standoff between the farmers’ organisations and the state government. The police said four farmers and 24 cops were injured in the clash.The agitating farmers, led by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders, on September 7 had laid a siege at the Karnal mini-secretariat. The farmers demanded registration of a criminal case against IAS officer Ayush Sinha and compensation for injured farmers.Even as the talks remained inconclusive for a couple of days, a breakthrough was achieved when the state government deputed additional chief secretary Devender Singh to hold negotiations.The farmers called off the protest after the state government made a commitment to hold a judicial inquiry into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/commission-of-inquiry-set-up-to-probe-karnal-violence-101632337719053.html
23-09-2021||Pune||Boost for air quality forecasting : Safar gets international recognition||PUNE: In a significant boost for air quality forecasting across the country, Safar (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research) - the first official indigenous framework to forecast air quality in the four megacities namely, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad as mandated under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) - has been accepted internationally.The findings of Safar were published in the form of a research paper titled, ‘India’s maiden air quality forecasting framework for megacities of divergent environments’ in the peer-reviewed international journal, ‘Environmental Modelling and Software’ on Tuesday. The Safar -project was led by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune in association with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Utkal University, Bhubaneshwar.Founder and project director Dr Gufran Beig said that the Safar framework is a one-stop solution for air quality management leading up to mitigation, and also helps formulate micro specific air action plans based on robust science. “Air pollutant forecasting is an important part of the air quality early warning framework reported in this work for Indian megacities of vivid micro-environments. But the chaotic nature and complexity of air pollution itself makes prediction a challenging task, particularly in a city which is highly influenced by meteorology due to its geographical location which is considered in this work,” Dr Beig said.According to the research analysis in the peer-reviewed journal, the estimated total emissions of particulate matter (PM2.5) from all sources across the megacities were calculated as 77 gigagram per year (Gg/Yr) for Delhi; 57 Gg/Yr for Ahmedabad; 45 Gg/Yr for Mumbai; and 30 Gg/Yr for Pune. “High population density due to urbanisation is the main reason which directly or indirectly drives PM2.5 emissions in all four metropolises,” said Dr Beig.The most predominant emission source of PM2.5 is transportation, whose share was found to be 41% in Delhi, followed by 40% in Pune, 35% in Ahmedabad, and 31% in Mumbai. The uncontrolled combustion pattern in the highly dense slum population was significantly high in Mumbai. The share of biofuel emissions was the highest in Mumbai (15.5%), followed by Pune (11.4%), Ahmedabad (10.2%), and Delhi (3%). Industrial emissions were found to be the highest in Mumbai (31.1%), followed by Pune (21.6%), Ahmedabad (18.8%), and Delhi (18.6%).Dr Beig said, “Now that India has championed the capability to develop its own air quality framework, we need to take advantage of it and replicate in other cities as originally envisaged in the NCAP plan document rather than borrowing foreign framework at a cost. We need to upscale as per the NCAP plan.”Safar chose to demonstrate its forecasting model in four different and contrasting micro-climates namely, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad. The prototype can be scaled up to the remaining 128 non-attainment cities (cities that do not meet the prescribed air quality standards set by the Union environment ministry of India) of the country as per the commitment to NCAP, Dr Beig said.“Using this forecasting model, all urban local bodies (ULBs) can also issue timely health advisories publicly, to alert citizens on ‘bad air’ days, which will help save vulnerable groups from the severe health impact of air pollution,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/boost-for-air-quality-forecasting-safar-gets-international-recognition-101632336819740.html

Darekar said that the NCP kisses painted cheeks and has no time for the poor. His statement came days before well-known laavni dancer Surekha Punekar was set to join the NCP. A case has been registered against Darekar under section 509 (insult to a woman’s modesty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Sinhagad road police station.In a video posted on her Twitter handle, Rupali Chakankar, president of the Nationalist Mahila Congress Party, the women’s wing of the NCP, said, “Opposition party leader Darekar made highly perverted statements in Shirur. He made these remarks insulting women’s modesty while speaking at a public rally. Since that day, many women have expressed their anger towards his statement. He should have shown some shame and apologised but he said instead that he does not give much importance to such things. Projecting women as second-class citizens and insulting them and then reacting in this manner to criticism is a sign of intellectual turpitude. Therefore, I have registered a case against him at Sinhagad road police station.”Reacting to this, Jagdish Mulik of the BJP pointed out some controversial statements made earlier by Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut and how the police refused to register a case against him even after a complaint was lodged. A statement made by Mulik in this regard issued by the BJP read, “BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil was referred to in a series of statements invoking violence made by Sanjay Raut on September 4. The city BJP unit on September 6 demanded that a case be registered against Raut. However today, police inspector Sanjay Mogale of Deccan police station sent a written letter as per which, Raut’s statements were not foul and not directed at any specific person.”While the outcome of the case registered against Darekar remains to be seen, the sexism in his comment can hardly be ignored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fir-against-bjp-s-pravin-darekar-for-saying-ncp-kisses-painted-cheeks-101632336518491.html

23-09-2021||Lucknow||'Sit together and suggest how to regulate bail pleas': SC tells UP govt, Allahabad HC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked both the Uttar Pradesh government and officials of Allahabad High Court to sit together and jointly submit the suggestions for regulating the matters of bail applications during the pendency of the appeals of the convicted persons.The top court said that if the suggestions are not given, then it may formulate some guidelines on its own.A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and BR Gavai said that Allahabad High Court registry has 20-25 page suggestions, which are like counter-suggestions to those already given by Uttar Pradesh government.The top court was informed that Allahabad High Court had filed the suggestions last evening.“State government has said something and now you (Allahabad High Court) have said something. They have given suggestions and now you have given counter-suggestions of 20-25 pages. How are we supposed to zero in on the most suitable ones? If you are unable to give suggestions then we will formulate some guidelines on our own,” the bench said.Additional Advocate General Garima Prashad, appearing for Uttar Pradesh, said that sometime be given to them as now they have come to know about the thinking of the High Court and they will sit together and compile the most suitable suggestions.The bench said that the High Court may itself issue some directions which may meet its expectation and both the UP government and registry staff of the High Court can sit together and sort out the problem.It posted the matter for further hearing on October 5.The top court is hearing 18 criminal appeals of the convicts in heinous offences seeking bail on the ground that they have spent seven or more years in jail and be granted bail as their appeals against the convictions are yet to be listed for regular hearing in the high court due to the long pendency.The High Court has given a slew of suggestions to the top court like in cases of serious and grave offences, rights of the victim and his family should be considered before granting bail to an accused.It suggested to the top court that a ‘victim impact assessment’ report should be obtained after consulting the victim and the report should clearly state all concerns along with vital information on physical, mental and social impact of the crime and impact the bail may have on the victim.The high court's registry has given its suggestions to the top court in pursuance of an earlier order asking it to help in laying down “broad parameters” for regulating the matters of bail applications during the pendency of the appeals of the convicted persons.“That when a person is convicted, the presumption of innocence vanishes and a heavy presumption of guilt supplants it. However, a person accused of crime shall not, until he has been finally adjudged guilty in the court of last resort, be absolutely compelled to undergo imprisonment or punishment, but may be admitted to bail also after conviction and pending the appeal”, it has said.The high court further said that priority should be given to hearing those criminal appeals where the accused has undergone more than half sentence in view of provisions of CrPC.“A different yardstick will have to be evolved for grant of bail to more serious crimes like white collar and organised crimes against the State and its citizens since the criminals involved here are habitual and hardened criminals who commit crimes in a planned and sophisticated manner,” it said.To address the huge pendency of cases, the High Court suggested that dedicated benches should be constituted for hearing long pending criminal appeals."If a person is released after spending - years in jail, the very object of imposing a life sentence would be defeated. If an accused of heinous crimes is released on bail after spending - years in jail, he will never make any effort to decide his appeal early,” it said.On August 25, the top court had said that before the court gives its "imprimatur" or authoritative approval to any suggestions/proposals given by the UP government it would be appropriate that the high court itself examines it and makes its own suggestions.On August 23, the UP government had suggested to the top court that bail pleas of life convicts, if they have undergone 10 years of jail term, and in other cases where half of the period of the maximum sentence awarded have been spent, can be considered by the High Court.It has said that to ensure “public peace and the well-being of the society, life convicts who are hardened criminals, repeat offenders, kidnappers, in crimes related to massacre (three or more than three murders), habitual criminals, and fall in prohibited categories as per the U.P Jail Standing Policy - no bail should be granted”.“As of August 2021, there are approximately 1,83,000 Criminal Appeals pending both at Lucknow Bench and Allahabad High Court,” it said.“As of August 2021, there are 7,214 convicts in various jails across Uttar Pradesh who have already undergone more than 10 years of their conviction and their Criminal appeals are pending before the High Court,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-court-asked-to-sit-together-and-suggest-steps-to-regulate-bail-pleas-101632335401910.html

The three-member ward system introduced by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is likely to help three parties - Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress – during seat-sharing arrangements if they decide to fight the upcoming polls together. In the elections, the new system – a deviation from four-member wards - can lead to fewer defections and may help the BJP in Pune more than the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which was insisting on a two-member panel, observed political leaders. The cabinet also cleared a proposal for municipal councils by introducing two-member wards, while the Nagar Parishads will have a single-member ward system. Earlier, the election commission had asked the government to prepare a draft report for delimitation of wards under a single-ward system in 18 municipal corporations including Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Various leaders including the NCP’s Ajit Pawar had however, advocated a two-member ward in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, where the party hopes to wrest power from the BJP in civic elections slated for early next year. “The decision of three-member wards in all the municipal corporations was taken unanimously. The earlier system of a four-member panel made the ward too large and was problematic for carrying out development,” said minister for Urban development Eknath Shinde. The Urban Development ministry had originally brought the four-member panel proposal before the cabinet, though NCP ministers opposed it during the coordination committee meeting that took place earlier this week. The NCP officially welcomed the decision saying the party is prepared to contest the polls. “The previous government had introduced four-member wards, which often became too big for development. For elected representatives also, it was difficult to reach out to all citizens since the ward was big. The NCP welcomes the three-member ward system,” said NCP spokesperson Ankush Kakade. Political observers noted that those with a strong connect and a strong network of workers can be beneficiaries, as much as those wanting to tide over a party’s image. With a ground-level network of workers, the new system can be beneficial to the BJP while for the Congress, which is struggling to get back in the game in Pune, it is likely to pose a challenge. “For the BJP, which often fights elections on the basis of the party’s overall image instead of individual candidates, the new system can work,” said a BJP corporator. The BJP currently rules PMC with 99 corporators while NCP has 42, Congress 10, Shiv Sena 10 and MNS 02, in the house of 164 members. With the merger of 23 villages under PMC, the tally of corporators is likely to go up to 166. As per the reservation system for local bodies, 50% of wards have to be reserved for women. The BJP, with a strong women’s wing may benefit under this system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/threemember-wards-in-pune-pcmc-if-ncp-and-bjp-both-gain-where-is-congress-101632335919940.html
23-09-2021||Pune||PMC GB okays Swargate to Katraj underground Metro route||PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), at its general body meeting on Wednesday, cleared the extension of the underground metro rail route from Swargate to Katraj, a distance of 5.4km. This will be part of the official Nigdi to Katraj metro route, effectively a new route for Pune.As the central government decided to reduce its financial share for the proposed Swargate-Katraj stretch, the general body had to ratify the proposal again, which will now move to state government. Once the state government clears it, the proposal will move to the Centre, whose clearance will allow the work to begin.Maha-Metro officer Atul Gadgil said, “Permission is due from the Maharashtra government and then it would take three months to get permission from the central government. The work should be able to start by July 2022.” Gadgil added, “Originally, the first corridor was between PCMC and Swargate, but now PMC has given the nod for the route between Swargate and Katraj. PCMC also allowed it to run upto Nigdi on that end. It will be now known as the Nigdi to Katraj route. From Swargate to Katraj, Maha-Metro has recommended it all be underground.” On permission from the centre, a Maha-Metro official requesting anonymity said, “The central government will bear 10 per cent of the cost rather than 20 per cent because it is an extension to the original plan. Hence, the Urban development department can give the ok for this proposal. There is no need for it to go before the Union cabinet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-gb-okays-swargate-to-katraj-underground-metro-route-101632335620432.html

The PMC general body, on Wednesday, cleared the PMRDA proposal requesting for the plots of land for metro stations.A plan to construct underpasses on Ganeshkhind road was also cleared by the GB.The Congress party and the Shiv Sena have demanded that the PMC calculate the cost of the lands before handing them over to PMRDA and Maha-Metro. “PMC should consider the cost of the land as its share in the metro project,” a corporator said, on condition of anonymity. All political parties have objected to a PMC proposal that allows certain cases where property tax is disputed, to be mediated upon by the Lok Adalat.‘Why give property tax defaulters any concession?’ The standing committee of the PMC had allowed 500 such cases to move before the Lok Adalat, also offering defaulters a concession for in the penalties due. Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “PMC is giving the wrong message to the citizens who are paying property tax regularly on time. Ideally, PMC should give concessions to honest tax payers, but in the name of revenue increase, PMC is giving concessions to defaulters.”The Shiv Sena also made the same demand and said that the administration should consult with elected members before allowing such proposals.Mayor Murlidhar Mohol instructed the municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar to check the legality of all issues involved with property tax defaulters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-handover-land-for-hinjewadi-to-shivajingar-metro-corridor-101632335318535.html

They blamed the civic administration for its failure to provide basic services to the residents of these villages.The corporators said that with 11 villages earlier and 23 villages more recently having been merged with the PMC, their expectations had gone up and they were hoping for good water supply, garbage management and other basic infrastructure in these villages. However, despite instructions to the administration to provide basic services, it was dragging its feet on the matter.BJP corporator Dilip Vede Patil said, “Many citizens are demanding adequate water supply but the civic body is not able to provide it. It is unable even to get possession of properties from the zilla parishad.”MNS corporator Vasant More said, “As the villages were merged, we immediately starting the process of collecting tax. If we are collecting tax, it is our responsibility to also provide basic services.”NCP corporator and opposition leader Deepali Dhumal said, “The administration needs to carry out basic works from the departmental budget. If we are not able to provide basic services, we should stop collecting taxes.”Meanwhile, BJP corporator and leader of the house Ganesh Bidkar said, “We are trying to give justice to the merged villages. The PMC has provided Rs5 crore for road works and Rs12 crore for various developmental works. It is also the state government’s responsibility to provide funds for creating infrastructure in these areas. The PMC has earmarked Rs72 crore from its annual budget for these newly merged areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/merged-villages-corporators-blame-pmc-admin-for-failure-to-provide-basic-amenities-101632335084149.html
23-09-2021||Noida||Noida: Day after anti-encroachment drive, illegal vendors back at Brahmaputra Market||A day after the Noida authority carried out an anti-encroachment drive at Sector 29’s Brahmaputra Market, illegal vendors who were removed from the spot returned on Wednesday and transacted business. The Noida authority carried out an anti-encroachment drive on Tuesday after several complaints from residents of Arun Vihar, which comprises wards in sectors 29 and 37. Members of Arun Vihar Residents’ Welfare Association (AVRWA) said that the authority’s move on Tuesday seemed nothing less than an eyewash. “This is not the first time that this has happened. We have been living here for the past 30 years; we have lost count of the number of times the vendors have come back hours after an anti-encroachment drive. The Noida authority needs to take strict action so that the vendors do not encroach the market and conveniently shift to the new vending zone that has been created for them in the area,” said Colonel (retired) IP Singh, chairman of AVRWA. Brahmaputra Market is one of the oldest and popular market complexes in Noida. According to officials of the Noida authority, the illegal vendors here have been asked to shift to a separate vending zone that has been created nearby but the vendors resisted the move. Before carrying out the drive on Tuesday, authority officials made public announcement in the market asking licensed vendors to shift to the vending zone created near the post office along the T-junction of the Ambedkar Market in Sector 37.“We have taken note of the matter and will take strict action against the vendors who violated our orders and again encroached upon the public place in the market,” said Indu Prakash Singh, Noida authority’s officer on special duty.SK Gupta, president of Rehri Patri Sanchalak Welfare Association, said vendors who have licence are under the impression that they are allowed to conduct operations at the Brahmaputra Market.“The vendors at the Brahmaputra Market have been given licences by the Noida Authority to shift to the vending zone. However, after a survey of the market, we have found that the vendors are under the impression that they are allowed to continue operating from the Brahmaputra Market. We will inform them and try to resolve the matter,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-day-after-anti-encroachment-drive-illegal-vendors-back-at-brahmaputra-market-101632333819813.html
23-09-2021||Noida||Health centres in Ghaziabad told to inoculate those above 45 who have not taken a single shot of Covid vaccine||The district health department has directed the primary health centres to take efforts to inoculate beneficiaries in the 45+ age group, who have still not taken the Covid-19 vaccine. According to officials, a week long door-to-door survey conducted from September 7 to 16 found that 102,698 beneficiaries in the 45+ age group have not even taken the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. In a communication on Tuesday, U P chief secretary R K Tiwari issued directions to the districts to identify clusters, where most of the beneficiaries in the 45+ age group have still not taken the vaccine and get them inoculated at the earliest. “We have asked all our health centres to ensure that beneficiaries who have been left out of the inoculation drive get vaccinated. For this, we are calling up such beneficiaries from the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre. We are expecting to finish the work of calling up most of the beneficiaries and asking them to come to the vaccination centres to by this week,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer. “The door-to-door survey figures have been shared with the respective health centres and they have been asked to get maximum beneficiaries vaccinated. With this, we are also trying to increase the second dose coverage, which has improved following the increased allocation of vaccines,” said the CMO. Till end of August, the daily vaccine allocation to the district was about 17,000 doses per day, which has now been scaled up to about 25,000 doses per day. In terms of overall coverage, the district has set a target of vaccinating 2,806,929 beneficiaries, which includes healthcare workers, frontline workers, those in the 18-45 years age group and those above 45+. According to data available with the health department, so far, 1,874,577 beneficiaries have taken the first dose, which accounts for 66.78% of the targeted population while 633,239 beneficiaries have been completely vaccinated, taking the second dose coverage to 33.78%. “Both beneficiaries who are scheduled to take their second dose and those who have still not taken a single dose should be vaccinated on a priority basis ahead of a third wave of Covid-19. It is only after the second dose that proper protection is achieved against infection,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). According to official figures, there are 1,880,267 beneficiaries in the 18-45 age group, of whom 276,475 have taken both doses. In the 45+ category, the district has set a target of vaccinating 878,250 beneficiaries, 312,773 of whom have been completely vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/health-centres-in-ghaziabad-told-to-inoculate-those-above-45-who-have-not-taken-a-single-shot-of-covid-vaccine-101632333699788.html
23-09-2021||Delhi||Consultant finalised for work on phase 2 of Delhi’s Chandni Chowk, will restore facades in heritage market||The Delhi government’s Public Works Department (PWD) has finalised a consultant for carrying out restoration of facade of the buildings in Chandni Chowk in the second phase of the heritage market’s redevelopment project. Under the second phase, all buildings on the 1.4-km Chandni Chowk stretch will get a facade uplift. A senior PWD official, who asked not to be named, said the consultant for façade restoration was selected last week. “The consultant was finalised last Friday. They will look after the façade restoration and other projects,” the official said. Officials from Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), the nodal agency for the redevelopment project, said work on façade restoration will be initiated soon. Garima Gupta, managing director, SRDC, said façade restoration will be done keeping in mind the diverse architectural and heritage value of buildings in Shahjahanabad. Gupta added that the agency will brainstorm on ideas that can be adopted for the area. “A uniform façade may not go with the heritage character of Shahjahanabad. We will come up with ideas and adopt the best possible practices for the preservation of the area’s heritage,” said Gupta. She said that work on façade restoration will start immediately after the appointment of the consultant. “If the consultant appointment has been done, we intend to start immediately,” she said. Annabel Lopez, project consultant, INTACH Delhi, said any exercise entailing façade restoration at Chandni Chowk should be focused on preserving the unique character of the place. “Each building in the area is unique in architectural style. Each building has to be conserved but its identity has to be retained. There are a number of notified heritage buildings in the area. Standardisation of façade should not be done the way it has been done in Amritsar where original identity and architecture of the buildings was completely lost,” said Lopez. Sanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said that it was important to curb illegal construction activity in the area before proceeding for façade restoration. “All unauthorised construction in the area should be stopped on the main road since people are spiling the façade. Everything should be restored as per the original ethos,” said Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/consultant-finalised-for-work-on-phase-2-of-delhi-s-chandni-chowk-will-restore-facades-in-heritage-market-101632332800335.html

23-09-2021||Delhi||AAP accuses BJP of trying to sell Delhi civic schools to coaching centres; party calls claims ‘baseless’||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of trying to sell the premises of municipal schools in Delhi to private coaching centres, a claim that the party, which runs Delhi’s civic bodies, called “baseless”.While the AAP is in charge of the government in Delhi, the BJP rules the city’s three municipal corporations (MCD), which go to the polls next year.“The BJP has floated tenders to sell 14 MCD schools to private coaching centres. The BJP has made MCD a corruption, theft and deception factory. While the number of students studying in Delhi government schools is rising exponentially, the headcount in MCD schools has reduced from three lakh (300,000) to two lakh thirty thousand (230,000) in the last few years, thanks to dismal conditions sponsored by the BJP,” said Saurabh Bhardwaj, the AAP’s chief spokesperson, while addressing a press conference.Bhardwaj said that the schools are located in Narela, Paharganj, Civil Lines and Karol Bagh, which come under the jurisdiction of the North Delhi municipal body.He further said, “The Kejriwal government spends 25% of its budget on education, and the MCD spends only 1.5% on education. The BJP-ruled MCDs claim they don’t have enough land for Mohalla clinics, but sell school buildings to private players without thinking twice. There are only 30-40 children left in several MCD schools; they do not even have enough students to run those schools.”Dismissing the allegations as “baseless”, Delhi-BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The MCD is not leasing or selling any of its schools to private coaching centres and it seems in his fervour to defame municipal corporations, AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj does not verify facts before speaking. The North MCD has several school buildings lying empty as certain areas especially, in the city zone have gone commercial, with very little population left thus rendering schools useless... All over the country, municipal primary schools run on funds given by the Centre and state governments under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. So, the North MCD doesn’t have to use its funds on education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-accuses-bjp-of-trying-to-sell-delhi-civic-schools-to-coaching-centres-party-calls-claims-baseless-101632328959626.html
23-09-2021||Mumbai||With highest seven-day Covid positivity rate, Ahmednagar is cause for concern for Maharashtra||Ahmednagar, which has 5.3% seven-day Covid positivity rate — the highest in Maharashtra, is now the biggest concern for the state public health department. Officials attributed it to violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour after restriction relaxations were announced in the second week of August, as well as robust testing.In the first week of September, the district had a seven-day positivity rate of 4.8%, which has now increased by 0.50%, as per the latest report of the public health department. Though officials do not have an exact answer for the high positivity rate in the district, they have ramped up testing along with genome sequencing — an exercise to study the changes in the structure of a virus over time.“Several reasons can be contributing factors, such as thick tail which means the virus keeps circulating in the area, infecting the susceptible population. Trend shows the infection rate is higher in rural parts of the state than in cities,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical advisor to the state on Covid-19.Health officers claimed the district is conducting around 10,000-12,000 tests daily, which is adding to positivity rate. In the past seven days, the district has conducted 96,824 tests — the third highest number of testing done in the state after Mumbai and Pune.Violation of Covid safety norms has been a major contributor in the spread of Covid-19, said district collector Rajendra Bhosale. “People have been attending family functions without wearing masks. This is leading to circulation of the virus in the crowd. Recently, we have raided a few such functions and police complaints have been registered against the violators,” said Bhosale.Neighbouring districts like Beed and Nashik have also been asked to keep an eye on new Covid-19 patients.Meanwhile, the cumulative seven-day positivity rate of Maharashtra has remained 2.5% for the past two weeks. However, medical experts are anticipating a surge in cases in the next two weeks due to the violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour during Ganesh Chaturthi.“Amid the festival season, Mumbai has already witnessed a slight 0.10% rise in seven-day positivity rate compared to the previous week. The virus has an inoculation period of 14 days, so, we have to wait and watch,” said a senior health officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/with-highest-seven-day-covid-positivity-rate-ahmednagar-is-cause-for-concern-for-maharashtra-101632328658304.html

They were produced before the court of chief judicial magistrate Harendra Kumar who sent them to 14-day judicial custody, said a senior police officer. Sandeep Tiwari could also be produced in court on Thursday after interrogation, a senior police official said. The police had a tough time controlling the crowd of lawyers at the district court and escorting Anand Giri and Aadya Tiwari out from the court premises. A case of abetment of suicide was lodged against Anand Giri at George Town police station on the complaint of sewadar Amar Giri. The FIR did not include Tiwari’s name, but his name was also added to the FIR later on the basis of the purported suicide note in which he was also accused of harassing Mahant Narendra Giri, said police.

23-09-2021||Lucknow||Thousands pay last respects as mahant Giri given Bhu Samadhi||PRAYAGRAJ Mahant Narendra Giri, president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP), was given a ‘Bhu Samadhi’ in a huge pit near a lemon tree in the open garden of his Bagambari Gaddi Math here on Wednesday in accordance with his wishes conveyed in his purported suicide note.His body was kept in a sitting posture in a square-shaped cave, which was prepared on one side of the pit. And all the offerings – flowers, honey, milk, sugar, salt and gems – were showered on the body before being covered. Members of the Niranjani Akhada of Prayagraj and his disciples including his close aid Balbeer Giri (whom the mahant had named as his successor in his purported suicide note), placed his mortal remains in the cave portion of the pit. The entire area was veiled by a large saffron cloth, which was later removed. The 30-minute ceremony was held amidst chanting of Vedic mantras by seers, keeping with the traditions of the akhada. Seers paid homage by offering a handful of soil each on the mortal remains of the mahant. Earlier in the day, Giri’s mortal remains were handed over to the office-bearers of the Niranjani Akhada after the post-mortem examination of the mahant’s body at the SRN hospital by a team of five experts. From here, the mortal remains were kept in an open vehicle, decorated with flowers. Thereafter, the Nagar Yatra (procession) was taken to the Sangam, the holy confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and the Saraswati. A huge number of the Giri’s followers, disciples, seers and locals along with political leaders including deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya participated in the large procession taken to the Sangam where his body was given a holy dip in the Ganga before the yatra culminated at the math. On the way, the procession took a brief halt at the Bade Hanuman temple where Giri served as chief priest right for years till his last breath. In the morning, seers had reached the Sangam city from various corners of the country for the last darshan of Mahant Narendra Giri. Schools up to Class 12 were closed in Prayagraj on Wednesday in view of the huge turnout of people for Giri’s last rites. Secretary of the Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani, Shri Mahant Ravindra Puri said, “A saint can be given samadhi in two forms, either Jal (water) Samadhi or Bhu (land) Samadhi. As it is our moral duty to protect the river from any pollution and respect the wishes of Mahant Narendra Giri, we had decided that Narendra Giriji would be given Bhu Samadhi.” .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/thousands-pay-last-respects-as-mahant-giri-given-bhu-samadhi-101632316897640.html

This is designed to limit campaigning too early.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tedros-poised-for-re-election-at-who-as-support-grows-diplomats-say-101632420230180.html

Now, they are the target||The Kabul airport blast in August and the subsequent explosions in many places in Afghanistan prove that the Islamic State is using the Taliban's tactic to attack the new government in Afghanistan. A Reuters report analysed the recent attacks and said that though the Taliban are underplaying the threat from the ISIS-Khorasan, the danger is real.The report said that the attackers used the same tactic the Taliban once used - pasting sticky bombs to the underside of the cars. This was the Taliban's operation style and using this they attacked officials and civil society figures."We are worried about these sticky bombs that once we used to apply to target our enemies in Kabul. We are concerned about our leadership as they could target them if not controlled them successfully," one of the Taliban intelligence officials told Reuters.While the return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan has apparently bolstered groups like ISIS-K and al Qaeda, ISIS-K is now a threat to the Taliban government.The Taliban have claimed to have killed three ISIS-K men on Wednesday night but according to intelligence officials Reuters spoke to, the group is still capable of striking an attack.The ISIS-K first emerged in late 2014 and then declined around 2018 as they were targetted by both the Taliban and the US forces. According to analysts, ISIS-K has a strength of under 2,000 fighters and it draws many of its fighters from the ranks of the Taliban or Pakistan's TTP. The release of the prisoners by the Taliban, after it captured Afghanistan strengthened the organisation to some extent, though its fund has dried up. While there are visible signs of resentment in the Taliban amid reports of clashes between the Taliban and the Haqqani, teh ISIS-K has the chance of gaining new members, the report said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-once-used-sticky-bombs-to-attack-now-they-are-the-target-101632413404351.html

Meade base north of Washington Thursday was just an exercise, with no casualties as originally reported, a base official said.Andrew Arconti, chief of plans and operations at the base, told AFP that the ostensible incident was a planned exercise for such emergencies, after another official had confirmed the incident to AFP."The reports of a shooting at Fort Meade are false. This was a planned exercise," the base said in a subsequent statement.Initially, various base officials had confirmed to US media that there had been an "active shooter" who had been "contained."The initial reports drew attention because Ft. Meade, in Maryland, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Washington, is home to the government's largest and most secretive signals intelligence agency, the National Security Agency, as well as the US Cyber Command, which conducts offensive and defensive cyber operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/official-says-shooting-at-at-us-army-base-was-an-exercise-no-casualties-101632415300766.html
23-09-2021||World||Indian PM Narendra Modi meets CEOs of American firms||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened his three-day visit to the United States on Thursday with back-to-back meetings with CEOs of five top American companies - from IT sector to finance to defence to renewable energy - that are looking to either bring new investments into India or expand their existing presence.Two of these CEOs are of Indian descent: Vivek Lall of the defence giant General Atomics and Shantanu Narayen of Adobe.“We talked about an incredible opportunity to advance the industry not only domestically in India but India as an export(er) of technology, everything about the digital transformation, enabled by 5G combined with the design in India,” Cristiano Amon, CEO of IT giant Qualcomm, said after the meeting. “We talked about semiconductors which is kind of an important, I think, topic of conversation. And, we talked about the opportunity to continue to build an incredible mobile ecosystem that is developing in India.”As a newcomer to the field of semiconductor, India has been aggressively wooing manufacturers to set up shop there. Securing semiconductor supply-chain is expected to be a key issue for discussion on Friday at the first in-person summit of the Quad leader US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.The four leaders are expected to agree to work together to secure the semiconductor supply chain. The US and Japan are the world’s top makers of semiconductors along with China, Taiwan and South Korea.Other CEOs who met Narendra Modi were Mark Widmar of First Solar, which is a manufacturer of solar panels; Stephen A Schwarzman of Blackstone, a global investment management company.Mark Widmar said after the meeting that India has struck “really strong balance between industrial policy as well as trade policy” which makes it an ideal opportunity for companies like First Solar to establish manufacturing in India”.Discussions with Narayen, an Indian-American, focused ‘on leveraging technology to provide smart education to youngsters and enhance research”, the prime minister’s office wrote in a tweet, adding, “They also discussed the vibrant start-up sector in India, powered by the Indian youth.”Previewing these meeting a source said on Wednesday that these “are CEOs that represent very large corporate interests, companies that have a particular expertise that’ve invested in India and have the potential to invest significantly in India.”The meeting with Lall is specially noteworthy in view of 30 Predator MQ-9 unarmed drones made by General Atomics that Indian plans to acquire, in addition to the two already in service with the Indian Navy.Vivek Lall said he had an “outstanding” meeting with the prime minister and welcomed recent policy changes in India’s drones policy as “very laudable policy prescriptions and reforms” that “catalyse a lot of interest and investments in India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-pm-narendra-modi-meets-ceos-of-american-firms-101632413758333.html
23-09-2021||World||Taliban Cabinet has no 'actual' power and that's why they are fighting: Report||Amid reports that Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar was physically attacked by Haqqani leader Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani, following which several speculations over the present condition of the Taliban leader, reports suggest that the divisions among the Taliban are deeper than what appears to be. While the Taliban and the Haqqanis are on two separate camps, there is a division between the hardliners and the moderate Taliban leaders and a division between Taliban fighters and Taliban politicians, Al Jazeera reported.Quoting analysts, the report said that the present Cabinet does not have actual power. The real power lies among a secretive shura in Kandahar where Taliban chief and government head Hibatulah Akhundzada is based. Several Taliban leaders are unhappy with their positions in the administration, the report said.Hardline versus moderate facesLeaders like Mullah Baradar, Sher Muhammad Abbas Stanikzai are the moderate faces of the Taliban, while Mullah Muhammad Yaqoob, son of Taliban founder Mullah Muhammad Omar, is one of the hardliners. The Cabinet that the Taliban have finally announced is inclusive at its best as no further accommodation is possible, the report said quoting experts.Fighters versus politiciansThe report said that Taliban fighters are after the spoils of the war while the Taliban leadership is trying to allay the fears of the people. “Sources speaking to Al Jazeera said as with other Afghan governments, the divisions among the Taliban fall along personality lines. But unlike previous administrations, the Taliban does not just suffer from overly ambitious members or opposing political views, its split is much more fundamental,” the report said. While the new leadership is torn in all these divisions, Mullah Baradar has disappeared from the public view amid reports that he had been killed. To refute those reports, the Taliban released his video where he was seen reading a statement that there was no strife inside the Taliban. Baradar was also photographed attending a meeting with the United Nations officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-cabinet-has-no-actual-power-and-that-s-why-they-are-fighting-report-101632412929817.html
23-09-2021||World||EU demands single charging plug for phones, Apple raises concern||The European Union unveiled plans Thursday to require smartphone makers to adopt a single charging method for mobile devices.The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, proposed legislation that would mandate USB-C cables for charging, technology that many device makers have already adopted. The main holdout is Apple, which said it was concerned the new rules would limit innovation, and that would end up hurting consumers. iPhones come with the company’s own Lightning charging port, though the newest models come with cables that can be plugged into a USB-C socket.The push by the EU will certainly be cheered by the millions of people who have rummaged through a drawer full of cables for the right charger. But the EU also wants to cut down on the 11,000 metric tons of electronic waste thrown out every year by Europeans.The commission said the typical person living in the EU owns at least three chargers, and use two regularly, but 38% of people report not being able to charge their phones at least once because they couldn’t find a compatible charger. Some 420 million mobile phones or portable electronic devices were sold in the EU last year.The new rules also call for standardizing fast charging technology and giving consumers the right to choose whether to buy new devices with or without a charger, which the EU estimates will save consumers 250 million euros ($293 million) a year.After attempting for more than a decade to cajole the industry into adopting a common standard - efforts that whittled dozens of different charging plugs down to a handful - the EU’s executive Commission is pushing the issue.“Chargers power all our most essential electronic devices. With more and more devices, more and more chargers are sold that are not interchangeable or not necessary. We are putting an end to that,” Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said. “With our proposal, European consumers will be able to use a single charger for all their portable electronics – an important step to increase convenience and reduce waste.”Companies will get two years to adapt to the new rules once they take effect. The rules would apply only to electronics sold in the European single market's 30 countries, but, like the EU’s strict privacy regulations, they could end up becoming a de facto standard for the rest of the world.Apple said it shared the European Commission's commitment to protecting the environment but questioned whether the proposals would help consumers.“We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,” the company said in a statement.Breton denied that the new rules would slow innovation.“If Apple wants to continue to have their own plug, they will have the ability to do it. It’s not against innovation, it’s just to make the lives of our fellow citizens a little bit more easy,” Breton said at a press briefing in Brussels, adding that device makers could still put two different ports on their phones if they want.Under the proposed law, which must still be scrutinized and approved by the European Parliament, phones, tablets, digital cameras, handheld video game consoles, headsets and headphones sold in the European Union would all have to come with USB-C charging ports. Earbuds, smartwatches and fitness trackers aren’t included.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-demands-single-charging-plug-for-phones-apple-raises-concern-101632402631278.html

And now there are two sets of representatives of Afghanistan in the United Nations. A diplomatic source told Pakistan newspaper Dawn that the former representative would continue to occupy the mission until "the credential committee takes a decision". On Tuesday, the former representatives even attended the session that US President Joe Biden addressed.The currently accredited ambassador of Afghanistan in the UN is Ghulam Isaczai. On September 15, he sent a letter to the UN saying that his team will represent Afghanistan in the UNGA session.On September 15, Afghanistan's new foreign ministry, now under the control of the Taliban, sent a letter to the UN requesting to participate in the session. Taliban leader Suhail Shaheen was named as the representative.Afghanistan is slated to address the United National General Assembly by September 27 and it is unlikely that a decision will be taken before that on whether the Taliban representative to UN will be accepted. Reports said the United National will not make a decision until and unless the issue of Taliban's recognition is addressed.However, both the letters have been sent to the credential committee of the UN after consultations with General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid of Maldives.So how will the ousted team of Afghanistan speak at the international forum? Reports said there is an option to not allow that team either because giving them a platform might indicate the UN's support to the ousted government.When the Taliban last ruled from 1996 to 2001, the UN refused to recognise their government and instead gave Afghanistan’s seat to the previous government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-may-not-take-part-in-unga-depite-naming-suhail-shaheen-as-spokesperson-101632401940836.html

23-09-2021||World||‘Frustrated’ US lawmakers walked out of briefing on Afghanistan: Report||Lawmakers reportedly walked out of a “classified briefing” on Afghanistan with members of US president Joe Biden's administration, doing so as their questions went "unanswered." The briefing was held by officials from the State Department, Department for Homeland Security, and Office of the Director of National Security for members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Also Read | It's Indo-Pacific in Quad, Afghanistan a priority in UNGAThe “frustrated” lawmakers belonged to the ruling Democratic party, as well as Biden's predecessor Donald Trump's Republicans, CNN said of Wednesday's interaction, adding that Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the committee, told the channel that “everyone walked out of the meeting.”“I don't think they know all the answers, quite honestly,” McCaul told CNN.The source of “frustration,” according to the lawmakers, is that they don't understand why State Department officials continue to say, both privately and officially, that about 100 more American citizens in Afghanistan wish to be evacuated in the wake of the Taliban's August 15 power grab, but, on the other hand, also say that 75 Americans have been flown out of the war-torn nation in recent weeks.The State Department, however, has described “dynamic situation on the ground” as the reason why a more precise figure cannot be provided. “As a general matter, we do not comment on communications with the Congress, especially those held in a classified setting,” CNN quoted an official as saying.Some Democrats, meanwhile, gave a totally different sequence of events, saying that many members were “satisfied” with the meeting. The reason for leaving the briefing, they said, was that several Republicans were not wearing their Covid-19 face masks.The United States completed its military pullout from Afghanistan on August 30, day before a self-imposed deadline to do so. Though this ended its 20-year-long military presence in that country, president Biden came under fire over its execution, with desperate Afghans thronging Kabul International Airport to leave their homeland for safer destinations.

Using a French-English mix, Johnson asked France to “get a grip” and give allies in the United States and Australia “a break”, even as Paris recalled its ambassadors from the US and Australia, and snubbed Britain.Speaking a day after he met US president Joe Biden in Washington, Johnson told reporters: “I just think it's time for some of our dearest friends around the world to 'prenez un grip' (get a grip) about all this, 'Donnez-moi un break' (give me a break) because this is fundamentally a great step forward for global security.”Also Read | Boris Johnson says humanity must ‘grow up’ and face climate changeHe was translating the English phrases ‘get a grip’ and ‘give me a break’ literally into French.Notably, France has been fuming ever since the United States and the United Kingdom made the surprise announcement about the deal to build nuclear submarines for Australia – thus scuppering a previous French deal to sell conventional submarines. Paris called the US-Australian plan, which was launched as part of a new Indo-Pacific security group along with Britain, a stab in the back and also pulled its ambassador from Australia.However, in a move that is expected to simmer down the tensions, US president Joe Biden held a phone call with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron this week – a “friendly” conversation which had the two leaders, according to the White House, vowing to launch “in-depth consultations... for ensuring confidence” and to meet in Europe at the end of October.Also Read | French Prez Macron, upset over AUKUS, dials PM Modi, discusses Indo-PacificHowever, Boris Johnson's recent comments towards France are likely to further fuel Paris' anger, the Reuters news agency reported citing two diplomatic sources, who said that there had already been instructions to limit contacts with Britain in the immediate term.Britain's role in pushing the new partnership appears to have been bigger than initially thought, officials have said, with the deal taking shape during a summit of G7 leaders in Cornwall in June that President Emmanuel Macron also attended.“It’s true that going back on a commitment made and the word he gave is something that Boris Johnson finds hard to see why that would be a problem,” Nathalie Loiseau, former French Europe minister and European lawmaker, said on Twitter. “This is the whole problem, however, when one claims to want an international order based on rules and relationships based on trust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/give-me-a-break-says-boris-johnson-as-france-upset-over-submarine-deal-101632383445032.html

23-09-2021||World||US court orders Facebook to release data related to violence against Rohingya in Myanmar||A US federal judge has ordered social media platform Facebook to hand over records related to accounts it had shut down in 2018 and were linked to the anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar, Reuters reported on Thursday.The judge in Washington DC criticised Facebook for failing to hand over critical data to investigators seeking to prosecute the country for international crimes against the Muslim minority Rohingya, rejecting the tech monopoly’s arguments of protecting privacy as “rich with irony”."Facebook taking up the mantle of privacy rights is rich with irony. News sites have entire sections dedicated to Facebook's sordid history of privacy scandals," the judge said in the ruling.Facebook has been refusing to release data on violence against Rohingya, citing a US law which bars electronic communications companies from disclosing user information, but the judge ruled since the accounts were deleted, they would not be covered under the law and not sharing the content would "compound the tragedy that has befallen the Rohingya".The Rohingya, who have been described by United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as "one of, if not the, most discriminated people in the world", are one of the many ethnic minorities in Myanmar. Majority of Rohingya Muslims used to reside in Rakhine state prior to their exodus in August of 2017. After the crackdown by the Myanmar military, also known as Tatmadaw, during the rule of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled the country to neighbouring countries like Bangladesh.The Myanmar army was believed to have carried out mass killings and rapes of Rohingya Muslims. A report published by UN investigators in August 2018 found Myanmar's military guilty of carrying out mass killings and rapes with "genocidal intent".Also Read: Myanmar junta leader casts doubt on return of Rohingya refugeesGambia, a small Muslim-majority nation in West Africa, has taken up the cause of violence against Rohingya in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing Myanmar of violating the 1948 UN Convention on Genocide, and wants data from Facebook to fight the case.The New York Times published a report in October 2018, unearthing how members of Myanmar military had turned Facebook “into a tool of ethnic cleansing” by putting up fake posts on how Islam was a global threat to Buddhism, and a false story about the rape of a Buddhist woman by a Muslim man.The report also found that Myanmar military exploited Facebook's wide reach to create a hate campaign against the country's Muslim minority Rohingya population that goes back half a decade. While Facebook did take down these social media accounts run by military personnel in August of 2018 the actual extent of the damage caused by it remains unknown.These posts and accounts which since then have been deleted have been held responsible for turning a majority of the population indifferent to what was inflicted on the Rohingya. In 2018, UN human rights investigators said Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fuelled the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-orders-facebook-to-release-data-related-to-violence-against-rohingya-in-myanmar-101632381105914.html

On this day, Australia's prime minister Scott Morrison sent out a video message on social media in Auslan, the native sign language of Australia, to salute the “tireless work” that the interpreters are doing in his country to keep fellow Australians informed even in dire times during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Also Read | International Day of Sign Languages today: Theme, history, significanceIn a short video clip posted on the Australian prime minister's official Instagram handle, Scott Morrison appeared beckoning in the Auslan sign language to show his support for the deaf community. “It’s harder than the amazing Auslan interpreters make it look,” he wrote in the caption. “I need to keep practicing but today is all about having a go so I encourage all Australians to learn some Auslan and give it a try.”A post shared by Scott Morrison (@scottmorrisonmp)“Hi, my name is ScoMo,” the Australian prime minister communicated in the short video message, “How good is Auslan! Thank you to all the Auslan interpreters for your hard work during Covid-19. I encourage everyone to learn some Auslan. Happy International Day of Sign Languages!”In the post's caption, Morrison added: “I’d like to say a heartfelt thank you to all our Auslan interpreters for your tireless hard work, stepping up day after day to help keep your fellow Australians informed during this Covid-19 pandemic.”He also thanked the Deaf Society and Deaf Services of Australia for the work they do to help empower with non-verbal communication those who are hearing impaired.While it is unclear how many sign languages currently exist across the world, most countries generally have their own native sign language, and some have more than one. Some of these sign languages, like Auslan, have also obtained legal recognition.This year’s theme for the International Day of Sign Languages, declared by the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) - ‘We Sign For Human Rights’ - projects “how each of us – deaf and hearing people around the world – can work together hand in hand to promote the recognition of our right to use sign languages in all areas of life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-international-day-of-sign-languages-scott-morrison-uses-auslan-to-send-a-message-101632378970378.html
23-09-2021||World||Not going AUKUS way: India okay with Quad emerging as non-military entity||While India has sought to publicly downplay the impact of the recently launched security alliance between Australia, the UK and the US (AUKUS) on the Quad - both of whom are focused on the Indo-Pacific region - it is secretly pleased that the latter group has been “de-securitised” as a result.India has been wary about militarising the Quad - the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - it conducts with Australia, Japan and the United States. AUKUS, with its unabashedly security bearing, has “de-securitised” the Quad, and this “is what we have wanted”, a person familiar with these discussions said on condition of being identified only as a source.“We have no intention of militarising the Quad”, the source added, on the eve of crucial talks Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold with US officials over the next two days. The person insisted that a lot of people have mistakenly tied the Malabar military exercises - which India has hosted and conducted with Japan and the US for years and now Australia - to the Quad as the group’s security and defence aspects.They are “not linked”, said the source.There was some talk in the waning days of the Trump administration of giving the Quad a formal structure, something like an Indo-Pacific version of the Nato military alliance.India has enthusiastically welcomed the non-military and non-security direction the Quad has taken in recent months as it has elevated its exchanges to the summit level, driven by US President Joe Biden, the source said, pointing to the three working groups launched at the virtual summit of the leaders in March: on vaccines, emerging technologies and climate.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join President Joe Biden, Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga for the the first in-person summit of the Quad leaders on Friday. Joe Biden, the host, indicated this in his maiden UN General Assembly speech on Tuesday and their talks will be focused on tackling “challenges ranging from health security to climate to emerging technologies”.The Indian side is going into the in-person summit with the expectation of building on the initiatives of the March meeting.Modi has a packed calendar of engagement before and after the Quad. On Thursday, his first full day in Washington DC, on his seventh visit to the US as prime minister, his key ceremonial meeting will be with Vice-President Kamala Harris, the first Indian-American to hold the post of the second most powerful political position in the United States.Their discussions could range from the “management of Covid-19 to issues like cooperation in the high-tech sector and the space sector, where the vice-president has an interest and a number of areas including resilient and secure supply chain, which is something of great interest to both sides”, the source said.There is a possibility of an announcement of an India visit by Kamala Harris at some stage. People familiar with the discussions asked to “wait for tomorrow”.The prime minister starts the day with meetings with CEO of some of the America’s top companies in solar power, IT, hedge fund and equity. Meetings with top US CEOs have been a recurring feature of Narendra Modi’s visits to the US. Indian-American Shantanu Narayen, of Adobe will be among them.Narendra Modi will also hold a long-overdue meeting with Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison, whose two previously scheduled visits to India were cancelled. Scott Morrison, although, had given Narendra Modi a heads-up on the AUKUS announcement.Narendra Modi is scheduled to meet Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga for the last bilateral of the day of Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-going-aukus-way-india-okay-with-quad-emerging-as-non-military-entity-101632378281452.html
23-09-2021||World||Boris Johnson says humanity must ‘grow up’ and face climate change||Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, told world leaders on Wednesday night that humanity must “grow up” and learn to deal with climate change. In his impassioned speech, the British premier compared the collective conscience of humans to an impetuous 16-year-old – a teenager on a bender – and said that it is high time that we stopped trashing the planet. “My friends, the adolescence of humanity is coming to an end,” Johnson addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. “We must come together in a collective coming of age.”Boris Johnson's UNGA speech comes ahead of a major United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, which he is set to host in six weeks' time. The Wednesday address is meant to be preparation for Johnson's demands to press governments for tougher emissions, cutting targets, and more money to help poor countries clean up their economies.“If we keep on the current track then the temperatures will go up by 2.7 degrees or more by the end of the century,” he said. “And never mind what that will do to the ice floes.”Johnson said that we will see desertification, drought, crop failure, and mass movements of humanity on a scale not seen before. “Not because of some unforeseen natural event or disaster, but because of us, because of what we are doing now,” he said.The British prime minister said that humanity is behaving like an impetuous 16-year-old, “just old enough to get ourselves into serious trouble”.“We have come to that fateful age when we know roughly how to drive and we know how to unlock the drinks cabinet and to engage in all sorts of activity that is not only potentially embarrassing but also terminal,” Johnson said, adding that human beings “trash” the environment again and again with the inductive reasoning that we will somehow be getting away with it since we have got by so far.In positive developments with regards to climate change this week, two of the world's biggest economies – China and the United States – have vowed to cut back on carbon and increase funding on climate-conscious projects. While China's president Xi Jinping said that his country will no longer fund coal-fired power plants abroad, US president Joe Biden announced a plan to double financial aid for green growth to poorer nations to $11.4 billion by 2024.The United Kingdom, for its part, has vowed to reduce carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050, and Johnson has championed the expansion of renewable energy, saying the UK could become the “Saudi Arabia of wind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-says-humanity-must-grow-up-and-face-climate-change-101632373618896.html
23-09-2021||World||Canada elections: Liberal MP George Chahal likely in trouble for violating rules||Tipped to become a member in Justin Trudeau’s new Cabinet, newly elected Liberal Party MP Harnirjodh Chahal, better known as “George Chahal”, from Canada’s Alberta province is in trouble for allegedly violating election rules.On election night, Liberal candidate George Chahal defeated incumbent Conservative MP Jag Sahota from Calgary-Skyview in Alberta and was immediately tipped for inclusion in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s next Cabinet. The win is important for Liberals as Alberta (34 seats) has always been a Conservative Party bastion. In 2019 elections, Liberals were wiped out and failed to open an account. This year, Conservatives have won 30 seats out of 34, Liberals have won 1 and results are yet to be declared in remaining 3 seats.So, a win for Liberals from Alberta is important to ensure a representation in the Cabinet which was not there in 2019.However, the emergence of footage showing George Chahal removing election material of his opponent may well jeopardise that possibility. George Chahal bested his rival by approximately 3,300 votes with commentators singling him out as a serious candidate for entering the Cabinet.However, constituent Glenn Pennett released security camera footage on Facebook that showed George Chahal personally removing Jag Sahota’s flyer from his doorstep and putting his own campaign material there. That could comprise a contravention of the Canada Elections Act, multiple news outlets reported.Jag Sahota, meanwhile, according to the outlet CBC News, believes that “legal action” is warranted in this matter.The Toronto Sun cited George Chahal’s spokesperson as saying the flyer was removed as it had the wrong polling station mentioned but that has been denied by both Jag Sahota’s campaign as well as Pennett himself. “We had our voting cards from Elections Canada and it was the same address on Sahota’s flyer. But he took it away,” Glenn Pennett told CBC News. “He should be charged because he’s destroying somebody else’s papers. If he’s going to be dishonest, he should resign.”In fact, Pennett said the flyer George Chahal left behind contained the wrong address for his polling station, listing one 18km away.If the matter is investigated, it will be done by the commissioner of Canada Elections.George Chahal was elected to the Calgary City Council in 2017 and this is his debut in national politics. He has a master’s in environmental design from the University of Calgary, and he and his wife Aman, have three daughters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-justin-trudeau-s-party-mp-likely-in-trouble-for-violating-election-rules-101632375223517.html
23-09-2021||World||Under Taliban, thriving Afghan music scene heads to silence||A month after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, the music is going quiet.The last time the militant group ruled the country, in the late 1990s, it outright banned music. So far this time, the government set up by the Taliban hasn’t taken that step officially. But already, musicians are afraid a ban will come, and some Taliban fighters on the ground have started enforcing rules on their own, harassing musicians and music venues.Many wedding halls are limiting music at their gatherings. Musicians are afraid to perform. At least one reported that Taliban fighters at one of the many checkpoints around the capital smashed his instrument. Drivers silence their radios whenever they see a Taliban checkpoint.In the alleys of Kharabat, a neighborhood in Kabul’s Old City, families where music is a profession passed through generations are looking for ways to leave the country. The profession was already hit hard by Afghanistan’s foundering economy, along with the coronavirus pandemic, and some families now too fearful to work are selling off furniture to get by.“The current situation is oppressive,” said Muzafar Bakhsh, a 21-year-old who played in a wedding band. His family had just sold off part of its belongings at Kabul’s new flea market, Chaman-e-Hozari. “We keep selling them … so we don’t die of starvation,” said Bakhsh, whose late grandfather was Ustad Rahim Bakhsh, a famous ustad — or maestro — of Afghan classical music.Afghanistan has a strong musical tradition, influenced by Iranian and Indian classical music. It also has a thriving pop music scene, adding electronic instruments and dance beats to more traditional rhythms. Both have flourished in the past 20 years.Asked whether the Taliban government will ban music again, spokesman Bilal Karimi told The Associated Press, “Right now, it is under review and when a final decision is made, the Islamic Emirate will announce it.”But music venues are already feeling the pressure since the Taliban swept into Kabul on Aug. 15.Wedding halls are usually scened to large gatherings with music and dancing, most often segregated between men’s and women’s sections. At three halls visited by the AP, staff said the same thing. Taliban fighters often show up, and although so far they haven’t objected to music, their presence is intimidating. Musicians refuse to show up. In the male sections of weddings, the halls no longer have live music or DJs. In the women’s section — where the Taliban fighters have less access — female DJs sometimes still play.Some karaoke parlors have closed. Others still open face harassment. One parlor visited by the AP stopped karaoke but stayed open, serving waterpipes and playing recorded music. Last week, Taliban fighters showed up, broke an accordion, and tore down signs and stickers referring to music or karaoke. A few days later, they returned and told the customers to leave immediately.Many musicians are applying for visas abroad.In the family home of another ustad in Kharabat, everyone’s go-bag is packed, ready to leave when they can. In one room, a group of musicians was gathered on a recent day, drinking tea and discussing the situation. They shared photos and videos from their performances around the world — Moscow, Baku, New Delhi, Dubai, New York.“Musicians do not belong here anymore. We must leave. The love and affection of the last years are gone,” said a drum player, whose career has spanned 35 years and who is the master of a leading music education center in Kabul. Like many other musicians, he spoke on condition he not be named, fearing reprisals from the Taliban.Another musician in the room said the Taliban broke a keyboard worth $3,000 when they saw it in his car as he crossed through a checkpoint. Others said they were shipping their most valuable instruments outside the country or hiding them. One had dismantled his tabla — a type of drum — and hidden the parts in different locations. Another buried his rebab, a stringed instrument, in his courtyard. Some said they hid instruments behind false walls.One who managed to leave already is Aryana Sayeed, a top female pop star who was also a judge on the TV talent show, “The Voice of Afghanistan.” Already used to death threats by Islamic hard-liners, Sayeed decided to escape the day the Taliban took over Kabul.“I had to survive and be the voice for other women in Afghanistan,” said Sayeed, now in Istanbul. She said she was asking Turkish authorities to help other musicians get out of her homeland. “The Taliban are not friends of Afghanistan, they are our enemies. Only enemies would want to destroy your history and your music,” she said.At the Afghanistan National Institute of Music, most of the classrooms are empty. None of the teachers nor the 350 students have come back since the takeover. The institute was once famous for its inclusiveness and emerged as the face of a new Afghanistan. Now, it is guarded by fighters from the Haqqani network, an ally of the Taliban considered a terrorist group by the United States.Inside the institute, pictures of boys and girls playing hang from the walls, dusty pianos rest inside locked rooms, and some instruments have been stacked in a container on the school’s patio. The fighters guarding the site said they were waiting for orders from the leadership on what to do with them.“We’re not interested in listening to these things,” one fighter said, standing next to a set of dhambouras, a traditional string instrument. “I don’t even know what these items are. Personally, I’ve never listened to them and I’m not interested.”In a classroom at the end of the corridor, a Taliban fighter rested on a mattress listening to a male voice chanting on his cell phone, apparently one of the instrument-less religious anthems common among the group.Back in Kharabat, Mohammed Ibrahim Afzali once ran the family business repairing musical instruments. In mid-August, he put away his tools, broke the instruments left in the workshop, and closed down. Now the 61-year-old sells chips and snacks to help feed his family of 13.“I made this tiny shop. God is merciful, and we will find a piece of bread,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-taliban-thriving-afghan-music-scene-heads-to-silence-101632373153210.html

It has so far recorded 4,135 cases, 27 deaths, 3,819 recoveries and 289 active cases. On Wednesday, authorities reported 15 new cases, all found in Auckland.In 2020, the government had managed to eliminate Covid-19 and the country remained largely virus-free until the Delta variant struck last month, leading to the imposition of a nationwide lockdown.According to a report by the New York Times on Monday, under the government's four-tier system of Covid-19 rules, Auckland will now be placed under level 3 lockdown.Under level 3, some businesses, including restaurants and retail outlets are allowed to reopen by using contactless collection methods. People are advised to stay at home and work from home under this level. However, they are allowed to visit supermarkets and some food retailers, banks, pharmacies, petrol stations.The rest of New Zealand has been under a level 2 lockdown for the past two weeks, the New York Times report added.Prime Minister Arden said on Thursday that vaccinations will replace lockdowns as the main tool against Covid-19, allowing authorities to isolate only those who are infected."If that rate (of vaccinations) is high enough then we will be able to move away from lockdowns as a tool," Arden said, adding, the highest possible vaccine rates will give more freedom.New Zealand has seen a sluggish start to its vaccination campaign against Covid-19.At present only 40% of the adult population is fully vaccinated and of this, 75% have received at least one dose. There are over 1.2 million people aged 12 and above who have not even received the first vaccine dose, a report by stuff.co.nz said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-lockdown-in-new-zealand-can-be-lifted-if-says-pm-jacinda-ardern-101632368355205.html

Various unilateral sanctions or restrictions on Afghanistan should be lifted as soon as possible,” Wang Yi said.“Afghanistan’s foreign exchange reserves are national assets that should belong to the country’s people and be used by its own people, and not be used as a bargaining chip to exert political pressure on Afghanistan,” he said.Afghanistan’s peaceful reconstruction and medium- and long-term development cannot do without financial support from the international community, the Chinese diplomat said.China, Wang Yi said, calls on G20 members to actively take practical measures to help Afghanistan ease the current liquidity pressure.“International financial institutions should also provide financing support for Afghanistan’s poverty reduction, sustainable development, people’s livelihood, and infrastructure projects,” he said.Wang Yi called on the Group of 20 (G20) to speed up their efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.The Chinese foreign minister said that the Afghan Taliban has announced the establishment of an interim government, which means that their domestic and foreign policies were still being adjusted and have not yet been fully finalised.He said the international community should support the Afghan people’s wish to independently choose a development path that suits their national conditions.China announced earlier this month that it had decided to urgently provide 200 million yuan ($30.96 million) worth of grains, winter supplies, vaccines and other medicines to Afghanistan, including an initial 3 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, Wang Yi noted.The Chinese diplomat urged “certain countries” that had caused the current difficult situation in Afghanistan to shoulder their responsibilities and make concrete efforts to help the Afghan people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/economic-sanctions-on-afghanistan-must-end-chinese-fm-wang-yi-at-g20-101632370841387.html
23-09-2021||World||'Need to do our part': Joe Biden calls on rich countries to escalate Covid-19 vaccine donations||President Joe Biden called on other countries to help vastly expand production and availability of coronavirus vaccines and treatments in order to end the Covid-19 pandemic.Biden hosted a virtual vaccine summit on Wednesday, coinciding with the United Nations leaders’ meetings in a bid to marshal more aid to developing nations where inoculations, treatments and supplies remain scarce. It also is a bid to counter criticism directed at the US and other wealthy countries that are planning booster shots that would reduce doses available to be shipped elsewhere.The summit highlighted how difficult it will be to attain Biden’s goals. He called for 70% of the world to be vaccinated by this time next year but a report by an anti-poverty group says the world isn’t on pace to hit that target. Biden also called for pledges of a billion more doses, and promised 500 million more doses from the USPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan announced during the summit that his country would provide about 60 million doses “in total,” according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.Biden cast the summit as a starting point, saying leaders would gather again in several months, and advocates have said the US push should be lauded. But the summit’s test will be whether the global response, and donations, will rise after months of vaccine nationalism that has steered doses overwhelmingly to rich nations. “This is a global tragedy,” Biden said. “And we’re not going to solve this crisis with half-measures and middle-of-the-road ambitions. We need to go big and we need to do our part.”The summit’s attendees include the leaders of the UK, Canada, South Africa and Indonesia, private-sector figures and representatives of non-governmental organizations. Biden led one of four sessions, on vaccinating the world, while Vice President Kamala Harris led another. Nearly all of it was held behind closed doors. The White House didn’t release a list of attendees. Biden said the US will buy another 500 million doses of Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE’s vaccine for donation abroad, pushing the total US donation pledge above 1.1 billion doses. The doses will be produced in the US and be shipped through Covax, the global vaccine sharing system, to low-income and lower-middle-income countries, beginning in January and running through next September.Biden also announced $370 million in US funding to help with vaccine administration abroad. “Getting those vaccines into people’s arms may be the hardest logistical challenge we face,” he said. He pledged another $383 million in funding for Gavi, an agency co-leading Covax. Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity before the summit took place, declined to say how much the Pfizer order would cost, but said the contracting process is continuing. The doses will be provided on a not-for-profit basis, they added. Pfizer confirmed the deal in a statement. The company plans to produce them at four plants across the USAn analysis released Wednesday by the ONE Campaign, an antipoverty advocacy group, shows that the world will fall about 1.2 billion people short of Biden’s 70% goal by next September. Biden’s 500-million-dose announcement will make a dent but not bridge the gap.“Everyone is on the hook to agree to a global plan to get 70% of the world vaccinated. This donation gets us closer to that goal, but the US cannot do this alone, other wealthy countries must be bolder and more ambitious,” Tom Hart, ONE’s acting chief executive officer, said in a statement.Biden also called on other countries to increase pledges of shots and to donate them, rather than sell them. “We need other high income countries to deliver on their own ambitious vaccine donations and pledges,” Biden said.Reporters were escorted out of the summit shortly after Biden’s remarks and it wasn’t immediately clear whether any other nation pledged to donate shots. The US released, as part of the summit, a call for a billion more doses to be purchased for or donated to developing nations.The new US commitment is on top of a 500-million-dose donation announced in June at the Group of Seven summit in the UK Distribution of those vaccines began last month. Combined with 130 million doses shipped out so far that had initially been bought for domestic use, the US donation total is now at least 1.13 billion doses, more than double the total delivered domestically.Of those, at least 330 million have been pledged by the end of 2021. The remaining 800 million, including all of Biden’s new pledge, are to be delivered in 2022. This is the first time that the US has set a global vaccination target, though advocates are urging more aggressive ones. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has called for 70% of the world to be vaccinated by the end of June, three months before Biden’s timeline.“In some ways June and September are just too late,” said Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, a non-profit group. He gave the US credit for hosting the summit. “We’re so excited that they are taking leadership on this, because there is unfortunately a leadership void, but we needed to get all this done yesterday,” he said. Doctors Without Borders welcomed Biden’s pledge but said it’s not enough to end the pandemic and will arrive too late -- and urged him to donate more excess supply now.“It’s unfathomable that millions more people are going to die waiting for vaccines just because of where they live,” the organization’s director of programs, Carrie Teicher, said in a statement. She added that the US must help bolster global vaccine production.The summit comes as the US prepares to begin giving booster shots to millions of Americans, a step that health advocates warn will divert vaccines and increase inequities among nations.Harris announced that the US would contribute at least $250 million to jump-start a new Global Health Security Financial Intermediary Fund, aimed at funding pandemic preparedness. Biden also set a goal of testing one out of every 1,000 people per day by the end of this year in all countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/need-to-do-our-part-joe-biden-calls-on-rich-countries-to-escalate-covid-19-vaccine-donations-101632368034340.html

The delta variant has also become more fit and transmissible over time and is now actively replacing all other Covid-variants in circulation, Van Kerkhove added."Less than one percent each of Alpha, Beta and Gamma are currently circulating. It's really predominantly delta around the world," the health body official said on Wednesday.“Delta has become more fit, it is more transmissible and it is out-competing, it is replacing the other viruses that are circulating," Kerkhove said during a social media interaction.The delta variant has been detected in 185 countries till date. This variant drove the second wave in India and was behind the surge of coronavirus cases in the US.The WHO has downgraded alpha, beta, gamma along with three other variants - eta, iota and kappa - to “variants under monitoring”, indicating that they “no longer pose a major added risk to global public health” as they are being outcompeted by delta."This is really due to changes in circulation and that the variants of interest are just out-competed by the variants of concern. They're just not taking hold," Van Kerkhove added.Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies chief, also interacted with reporters in a social media session, warning that dip in number of cases is followed by spikes but countries with significant vaccination rate has less to worry about. “It shows us that vaccines work,” he said.The delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, was first detected in India in late 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-globally-dominant-variant-replacing-other-variants-of-concern-who-101632365656266.html

The day supports and protects the linguistic identity of people who are deaf along with other users of sign languages.This year’s theme, declared by the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) - ‘We Sign For Human Rights’ - projects “how each of us – deaf and hearing people around the world – can work together hand in hand to promote the recognition of our right to use sign languages in all areas of life.”What are sign languages?Sign languages are the ones that use visual-manual modality to convey the meaning.The United Nations (UN) describes sign languages as full-fledged natural languages, structurally distinct from spoken languages.The convention on the rights of persons with disabilities recognises and promotes the use of sign languages. The convention clarifies that they are equal in status to spoken languages. It also obligates states to facilitate the learning of sign languages and promote the linguistic identity of deaf people.History of International Day of Sign LanguagesAccording to the UN, the International Day of Sign Languages was first celebrated in the year 2018 as part of the International Week of the Deaf. “The choice of 23 September commemorates the date that the WFD was established in 1951,” the UN said in its website.The WFD has said that there are over 70 million deaf people across the globe and 80% of these are from developing countries. Collectively, over 300 different sign languages are used.SignificanceThe International Day of Sign Languages aims to raise awareness about the importance of sign languages. The resolution which established the day recognises the importance of preserving sign languages as a part of linguistic and cultural diversity.Quotes“Human eyes are the sign language of the brain. If you watch them carefully, you can see the truth played out, raw and unguarded”: Tarryn Fisher“I come from a place where you don’t need to talk all the time. There are sign languages you learn”: Warwick Thornton“Sign language is the equal of speech, lending itself equally to the rigorous and the poetic, to philosophical analysis or to making love”: Oliver Sacks“Systems of morals are only a sign-language of the emotions”: Friedrich Nietzsche||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-of-sign-languages-today-theme-history-significance-101632362265179.html
23-09-2021||World||Apple to give store workers bonuses up to $1,000 next month||Apple Inc. will give store employees as much as $1,000 in one-time bonuses next month, a rare move that follows a tumultuous effort to get its retail operations back on track after pandemic shutdowns. The iPhone maker will give $1,000 to retail staff hired before March 31, while anyone who joined after that date will receive $500, according to people familiar with the situation. New workers for the holiday shopping season will get $200, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. The payouts also will go to AppleCare and online sales workers as well. But the good tidings came with a bit of coal. In a separate memo, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook criticized leaks to the press. Key details of Apple’s recent product launch event were reported ahead of time, along with information from a companywide meeting held last week.Cook said he’d heard from many employees who were “incredibly frustrated to see the contents of the meeting leak to reporters,” according to the memo, which was obtained by Bloomberg News. “This comes after a product launch in which most of the details of our announcements were also leaked to the press.”The memo sparked fresh concerns from some employees who feel that Apple’s policies are too restrictive. It’s also a potential distraction at a time when the company is focused on rolling out new iPhones and other devices. Preorders began for the iPhone 13 last week, and it reaches stores on Friday.The Sept. 14 launch event, which also included the new Apple Watch Series 7 and a redesigned iPad mini, kicked off the company’s holiday season blitz. This Christmas will provide a key test of Apple’s retail operations as the company navigates the waning of the pandemic. The bonuses will be an unusual perk since Apple rarely gives companywide payouts. The last major one was $2,500 worth of restricted stock units in 2018. That bonus followed tax changes allowing Apple to bring back cash from offshore accounts at a lower cost. The new bonuses will be issued via cash in paychecks, rather than as stock units, the people said.A representative for Apple declined to comment. The bonuses were presented to retail workers as a recognition of the difficulty of working through the pandemic. Since Covid-19 struck in 2020, Apple stores around the world closed and reopened multiple times -- and thousands of workers were given online sales roles while physical locations were shuttered. Retail employees were still paid as normal when stores were closed.Apple also is facing a tight market for labor, with employers across the U.S. struggling to attract enough staff. Still, some workers see the bonuses as an acknowledgment of growing unrest among both retail and corporate staff, according to the people. Employees have complained about pay equity and other concerns at the Cupertino, California-based technology giant, with two high-profile cases getting investigated by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board.At the companywide meeting with employees last week, Apple addressed questions about pay equity and a new anti-abortion law in Texas. Apple said it resolves pay gaps when it finds them, and that it was monitoring the situation in Texas to see how it could help.Cook also discussed the recent trial between the company and Epic Games about Apple’s App Store policies and announced new Covid-19 vaccination and testing policies.He followed up this week with the complaints about leaks. “I want to reassure you that we are doing everything in our power to identify those who leaked,” Cook said in the memo, which was previously reported by the Verge. “As you know, we do not tolerate disclosures of confidential information, whether it’s product IP or the details of a confidential meeting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-to-give-store-workers-bonuses-up-to-1-000-next-month-101632362209548.html

On Wednesday, he was also scheduled to attend a meeting of the G-20 foreign ministers on Afghanistan and of the G-4, which is seeking permanent seats for India, Brazil, Japan and Germany on the UNSC.Jaishankar met his South Korean counterpart Chung Eui-Yong and had wide-ranging conversations on different aspects of the bilateral relationships, including Southern Policy and India’s Act East Policy. “Pleased to meet FM Chung Eui-Yong of the Republic of Korea. A wide-ranging conversation on different aspects of our relationship. RoK’s New Southern Policy and India’s Act East Policy have strengthened our convergence in the Indo-Pacific,” he tweeted.While interacting with his Italian counterpart Luigi Di Maio, who is the current G20 chair, Jaishankar discussed challenges related to vaccine accessibility and smooth travel. “Discussed challenges related to vaccine accessibility and smooth travel. Look forward to joining him at a discussion on Afghanistan tomorrow,” he tweeted.The Union minister also met with his Finnish counterpart Pekka Haavisto and discussed the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Jaishankar held a discussion on the Indo-Pacific issues during his meeting with his Chilean counterpart Andres Allamand. “Another perspective on the Indo-Pacific from FM @allamand of Chile. Also engaged on expanding our economic engagement, including on green energy,” he tweeted.Earlier, in his address to the General Debate on Tuesday, Erdogan had said, “We maintain our stance in favour of solving the ongoing problem in Kashmir for 74 years, through dialogue between the parties and within the framework of relevant United Nations resolutions.”Erdogan had raised Kashmir also in his address in 2019, which was the last in-person meeting of the general assembly. At that time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reiterated India’s support for “independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity” of island nation after a meeting with Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades. Cyprus backs India’s claims to a permanent seat in the UNSC.The long ongoing conflict in Cyprus began in 1974 when Turkey invaded its northern part in response to a military coup on the island which was backed by the Greek government. India has been advocating a peaceful resolution of the issue in accordance with the UN resolutions.In a 1998 resolution, the United Nations Security Council called upon “all States to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus...”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/respect-un-resolutions-on-cyprus-jaishankar-101632339666850.html

The vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech will be made in the United States and shipped to low and lower middle-income countries starting in January.Bats with Covid-like viruses found in LaosScientists have found another clue to the origin of the Covid-19 virus, with bats living in caves in Laos found to be carrying a similar pathogen that experts suggest could potentially infect humans directly.Researchers from France’s Pasteur Institute and the National University of Laos said their findings showed that viruses genetically close to the SARS-CoV-2 virus “exist in nature” among bat species found in the limestone caves of northern Laos, which neighbours China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-donate-500mn-more-doses-to-other-countries-101632336223376.html
23-09-2021||World||Macron, Biden set to meet to ease tensions||US President Joe Biden said he will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron in October, seeking to mend ties after a US nuclear-powered submarine deal with Australia outraged officials in Paris.Biden held a phone call with the French president on Wednesday, the first time the they spoke since the submarine deal was announced last week. In a joint statement, the two countries said Biden and Macron “agreed the situation would have benefitted from open consultations among allies on matters of strategic interest to France and our European partners”.The agreement between the US, Australia and the UK scuttled a previous $66 billion deal for France to build a diesel-powered sub fleet for Australia. French officials complained they were taken by surprise and cut out of talks on a broader defence alliance between the three English-speaking countries.In an unprecedented move, France recalled its ambassador from Washington on Friday in protest. Macron will return the ambassador next week, according to the joint statement.The French also asked that a US and EU summit scheduled for next week be postponed. The fate of that summit wasn’t mentioned in the statement.The White House has said it was Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s obligation to inform France he was ending their deal for diesel-powered subs. Morrison has said he had made concerns about the French subs clear to Macron’s government and that they wouldn’t meet Australia’s future security needs.Biden and Macron will meet in Europe, according to the statement. The US president is scheduled to attend the G20 summit in Rome and the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in October-November.Earlier, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told France to “get a grip” and give allies in the US and Australia a break over a row about the trilateral nuclear submarine deal that tore up the separate French contract.Speaking a day after he met Biden in Washington, Johnson told reporters, “I think it’s time for some of our dearest friends around the world to ‘prenez un grip’ about all this, ‘donnez-moi un break’, because this is fundamentally a great step forward for global security.” He was translating the English phrases “get a grip” and “give me a break” literally into French.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-biden-set-to-meet-to-ease-tensions-101632336094240.html
23-09-2021||World||Pregnant women with mRNA Covid vaccine jabs pass antibodies to babies: Study||In one of the first studies conducted in the world, it has been found that pregnant women who have been vaccinated with mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots, against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), pass high levels of antibodies to their babies.The study revealed that as many as 36 newborns tested at birth had antibodies against Covid-19 after their mothers were vaccinated by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna doses. For the study, antibody levels were measured in the umbilical cord blood of the women whilst they were pregnant to differentiate if the presence was from past infection or vaccines.“We didn’t anticipate that. We expected to see more variability,” NYU Langone Health System obstetrician and co-author of the study, Ashley Roman said.The study was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology – Maternal Fetal Medicine, on Wednesday.How will the study help?Data from September 11 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that only 30 per cent of women aged between 18 and 49 are vaccinated against Covid-19 in the US, despite various studies stressing on prenatal vaccine safety.Since the study had a small subjects’ group, the research team is now looking at results from a bigger sample group and the longevity of the immunisation among newborns.“We pushed this data out relatively early because it’s a unique finding and it has important implications for care,” Roman said, adding that as of now the research team urges all expecting mothers to get jabbed for maternal benefits. What did the study find?For the research, the team studied blood from the umbilical cord of 36 pregnant women to specifically look for two elements – first, antibodies to spike protein that appears post-vaccination or contracting Covid-19; and second, antibodies to spike nucleocapsid protein that is solely present after getting coronavirus.Also Read | SC seeks Centre's response on plea seeking priority Covid-19 vaccination for pregnant womenIt was found that a total of 31 samples of pregnant women tested negative for nucleocaspid protein – meaning they developed immunity from vaccination. The remaining five expecting mothers were not tested for the nucleocaspid protein – thus, ceasing the researchers from ascertaining if the antibodies’ presence was from vaccination or infection. What does the CDC say about pregnant women getting jabbed with Covid-19 vaccines?According to the latest findings shared by the CDC, coronavirus vaccines are safe for pregnant and lactating women. The data shows that studies of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines on pregnant animals didn’t find any safety concerns. The US government agency also highlights that Covid-19 vaccines do not cause infection, including in pregnant women and/or their babies. In fact, it says that as per early data, inoculating a pregnant woman with coronavirus vaccine reduces the risk of contracting the infection among them. (With inputs from Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pregnant-women-with-mrna-covid-vaccine-jabs-pass-antibodies-to-babies-study-101632334391279.html
23-09-2021||India||Ensure internet in all jails for e-bail orders: SC o states, UTs||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed all the state and Union territories to ensure the availability of internet facility with adequate speed in each and every jail of the country so that prison officials could release the inmates without delays after receiving the electronically-authenticated bail orders. “We are concerned about the plight of the jail-inmates who are not released despite the bail orders passed by this Court due to delay in communication of such orders. It is high time to utilize the information and communication technology tools for efficient transmission of Court’s orders,” said the bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana. The bench, which included justices L Nageswara Rao and Surya Kant, was considering a suo-motu (registered on court’s own motion) case initiated last month following reports that several prisoners were not released despite the grant of bail by the Supreme Court. One of the chief reasons for delay in their release was the time taken in transmitting the orders of the Supreme Court to the concerned jail. The court had then contemplated to adopt the procedure termed as “FASTER” (Fast and Secured Transmission of Electronic Records) to ensure that such situation does not arise in future. The FASTER (Fast and Secured Transmission of Electronic Records) system proposes transmission of e-authenticated copies of the orders of the Supreme Court to the duty-holders for compliance and due execution, through a secured electronic communication channel. The court, on July 16, asked its secretary general Sanjeev S Kalgaonkar to submit a proposal suggesting the modalities to implement the FASTER system, after consulting solicitor general Tushar Mehta, amicus curiae (lawyer requested to assist the court) Dushyant Dave and other stakeholders. On Thursday, the bench took up the proposal submitted by Kalgaonkar, following which it directed chief secretaries of all the states and UTs to make internet facility available in all prisons, adding wherever it is not available presently, communication shall be made through the nodal officers of the state governments under FASTER system. The bench also directed the director general, National Informatics Centre (NIC), secretary (home) of all states and UTs and their director general of prisons to ensure smooth and successful implementation of FASTER system in coordination with the registry of the Supreme Court. It further ordered that concerned rules and practice directions shall be modified suitably by all the authorities to recognize the e-authenticated copies of the orders of the apex court communicated to them through FASTER system. The court has fixed the hearing of the matter after two weeks to assess the progress made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-internet-in-all-jails-for-e-bail-orders-sc-o-states-uts-101632421620246.html

After stabbing her in the neck, the accused attempted to kill himself by slitting his throat but survived and is being treated at a local government hospital, they added.Police said the victim was a second-year student studying a diploma course in Medical Laboratory Technology in a private college on the outskirts of Chennai. She was returning home after college and was waiting at the Tambaram railway station to go home to Chrompet. The accused, also in his 20s, who was stalking her stabbed her with a knife at the station. Eyewitnesses informed the police and stopped the accused from harming himself, police said.The victim was taken in an ambulance to the Chromepet government hospital where she succumbed to her injuries. “She got acquainted with him two years ago during train journeys. They were not in the same college,” said a senior police officer not wishing to be named. “It’s a case of estranged love. The accused is in a stable condition. We have booked him for a murder case now and investigations are on going.”Police said the accused is a native of Nagapattinam district and is an employee of a private manufacturing company in Maraimalai Nagar. The victim was avoiding him for a while, police said, adding that he tried to speak to her at the railway station when the two had a verbal spat. Police have registered a case under section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The accused is being treated at Chennai’s Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. The victim’s body has been sent for post mortem. Similar instances at railway stations have shocked the public in the past in the city. In 2019, a 27-year-old man attacked a woman with a machete at Chennai’s Chetpet railway station leaving her with grievous injuries in a crowded platform. The man then jumped in front of a train to end his life. The two of them had known each other from their hometown in Erode district. In 2016, in another case at Chennai’s busy Nungambakkam railway station, a 24-year-old woman was murdered by her stalker for rejecting his advances. He had stalked her for a few months before the crime. The accused was arrested from his native in Tirunelveli district and the case was closed after he died by suicide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20yrold-woman-stabbed-to-death-by-stalker-in-chennai-101632421199076.html
23-09-2021||India||Electrocution of minor girls on waterlogged Bengal road triggers political slugfest||The death of two minor girls, who were electrocuted on Wednesday after touching the pole of a street light on a waterlogged road at South Dum Dum near Kolkata, has triggered a slugfest between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). TMC’s Dum Dum Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy and education minister Bratya Basu, the local legislator, had to visit the affected families on Thursday following an agitation by residents of the area. The BJP promptly took up the issue. The government and the South Dum Dum Municipality jointly announced a compensation of ₹2 lakh each for the families but they refused to accept it. The families also made critical remarks about the TMC-run civic body, accusing it of not taking precautionary measures in the wake of similar deaths in other parts of the state since Monday. The municipality ordered an inquiry. The girls, Shreya Banik, 12, and Anuskha Nandy, 13, were making their way through a waterlogged street when they touched the lamp post, the base of which was submerged in stagnant rain water. Both were declared dead on arrival at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, said the local police. “No amount of money can make up for the loss the families have suffered. We are only following routine. What happened is heart-breaking but people should not be doing politics over this. Action will be taken if negligence on the part of anyone is established,” Roy said. Leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, held the government and CESC Ltd, the sole electricity provider for Kolkata and the adjoining districts, responsible for the deaths. Demanding a compensation of ₹50 lakh each for the families, he said, “The government should apologize in public in 24 hours.” “We provide only the power. Junction boxes for street lights are maintained by the civic body,” an executive of CESC Ltd said on condition of anonymity. Amid record rainfall since Monday, at least 10 people in Bengal have died of electrocution either in their homes or in the streets in several districts. In north 24 Parganas district, where the two girls died, three members of a family were electrocuted inside their home on Monday while a man died in the Khardah area on Wednesday. Surajit Roychaudhury, a coordinator of the South Dum Dum Municipality faced the ire of the families of the two girls. “When it was raining heavily, we switched off the street lights fearing an accident but local people started complaining. We had to restore the connection,” he said. Although rainfall declined in Dum Dum on Wednesday morning many streets remain inundated because the Bagjola canal, the main outlet, is still overflowing, Roychaudhury added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/electrocution-of-minor-girls-on-waterlogged-bengal-road-triggers-political-slugfest-101632420660164.html

It will boost respect for women and help to protect dignity," added Khatoon, one of the village dignitaries who will monitor Kumar.Women in the village said the order had made a positive impact by making crime against women a subject of discussion in their community."This is a remarkable step and a different kind of punishment that sends a message to society," said Anjum Perween.India's rape laws were overhauled after a 2012 gang rape in New Delhi but the number of offences remains high, with more than 28,000 rapes reported in 2020.Police have long been accused of not doing enough to prevent violent crime and failing to bring sexual assault cases to court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-on-bail-accused-of-rape-told-to-wash-women-s-clothes-for-six-months-101632420177761.html

Rahulji gave his approval for the visit.. We are all prepared and now the CM is likely to visit Delhi in the first week of October and then he will discuss the final dates with Rahulji,” said Chaubey told a news conference on Wednesday.The minister added that the second visit will be in Surguja division of the state and third is planned in the plains of Chhattisgarh . On August 28, emerging after a long meeting with the Congress high command on suggestions that he should move aside because of a reported two and a half year power sharing agreement with colleague TS Singhdeo, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel seemed to have bought some time. Baghel claimed that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi would visit the state the next week, especially Bastar, to see for himself the work that was being done. The next day, when Singhdeo returned, he said that he had spoken to the leadership too and they had kept a “decision safe”. In December 2018, in the aftermath of a dominant Congress performance where the party won 68 of 90 seats, even as the party’s Delhi leadership sought to put out leadership fires in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh emerged as a problem too.Four state leaders, Baghel, home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, speaker Charan Das Mahant and Singh Deo flew to Delhi, all eyeing the chief minister’s post. As Mahant settled for speaker, friction between Baghel and Singh Deo meant that Sahu first emerged as the frontrunner, but pushed by the idea that a third leader would take the top position, Baghel and Singh Deo, along with Punia and Gandhi, reportedly arrived at a power-sharing arrangement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupesh-baghel-to-fly-to-delhi-to-discuss-rahul-gandhi-s-chhattisgarh-visit-sked-101632419218759.html

Targeting the Congress, which still has a base in the district where its state president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury represents the Berhampore Lok Sabha seat, Banerjee said, “Both Congress and TMC are confronting the BJP but only our party has proved that it can defeat the BJP. The Congress has failed to do so.” “The BJP is selling national assets like the Railways, the airports. Have you seen the Congress protesting anywhere? The two parties have a secret understanding. Jangipur residents have also told me that they see no difference between the local BJP and Congress,” said Banerjee. “In 2024, the TMC will oust the BJP from Delhi. The entire nation wants Mamata Banerjee. Congress talks big. This is the district that presented to India President Pranab Mukherjee. His son Abhijit Mukherjee joined the TMC in July. The Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist) have been reduced to zero in Bengal in the recent polls. They forged an alliance in 2016 and this year as well. This only helped the BJP,” said Banerjee. “Reality across the nation is that Congress is losing all elections to the BJP. The TMC, on the other hand, is winning,” said the chief minister’s nephew. “I promise that we will win the next assembly polls in Tripura. Our organisation is being formed. The Tripura government is so scared that it has issued prohibitory orders to stop rallies. The BJP tried to conquer Bengal using money power and central probe agencies against us. It thought that we can be silenced too like the Congress. I have been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate several times. We are not scared. We will make you (BJP) run from Delhi,” said Banerjee. “TMC will go to all states that the BJP is ruling. We will oust the BJP from these states. The more you provoke us the more powerful we become,” he added. Assembly polls in the district’s Jangipur and Samsergunj seats could not be held in March-April as the TMC candidates died of Covid-19. The elections will be held on September 30 along with the Bhawanipore bypoll in Kolkata from where the chief minister is contesting. Addressing a campaign meeting in the Chakraberia area of Bhawanipore, the chief minister on Thursday said, “Probably it was my destiny that I would look at Delhi from Bhawanipore. The BJP has enforced many anti-people laws. The farm laws are among these and must be withdrawn immediately.” Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury reacting to Abhishek Banerjee’s statement on Thursday evening said, “At a time when Sonia Gandhi has called for the unity of all Opposition parties against the BJP, the chief minister and her nephew are making all efforts to sabotage this unity. The TMC is doing this because it has received favours from Narendra Modi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-alone-can-take-on-bjp-not-congress-says-abhishek-banerjee-at-campaign-meet-101632416758657.html

The agency is interrogating the two accused for a breakthrough,” a person aware of the development said.Dhanbad additional district judge Uttam Anand was brought dead to the hospital on July 28, about an hour after he was hit by the auto rickshaw outside magistrate colony near Randhir Verma square in Dhanbad when he was out for his routine morning walk.The two occupants of the three-wheeler, Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma, were arrested and the vehicle recovered by Jharkhand police after CCTV footage from the location showed that the vehicle seemingly swerved deliberately to hit the judge from behind.Both the Supreme Court and the Jharkhand High Court took suo-motu cognisance of the incident. The CBI took over the investigation from the SIT headed by an ADG rank officer of Jharkhand Police at the state government’s insistence. The HC has directed the central agency to provide a probe status report to the court every week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seems-dhanbad-judge-was-intentionally-hit-by-auto-cbi-tells-jharkhand-court-101632412438129.html

The Rajya Sabha MP said it was hurtful to see that the senior Congress leader referred to someone as ‘brother’ whose ‘hands were bloody due to the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers at the nation’s borders’.Baluni also attacked Rawat and said that his statements were an affront to the people of Uttarakhand, where almost every family has a member in the armed forces.Rawat in a Facebook post justified his statement and said that if Prime Minister Narendra Modi can greet and hug then Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif, how is seditious for Sidhu to hug Bajwa since both are Punjabis, referring to the fact that both belong to undivided Punjab before the Partition of India.Rawat also criticised Baluni and said that he does not need lectures on nationalism. “Anil Baluni ji does not need to remind me of the military tradition of Uttarakhand. My family, from soldier to brigadier, are glorified in various positions. I am also proud that my son-in-law was martyred in Kashmir fighting terrorism, so I don't need lectures from BJP on nationalism,” Rawat said.Sidhu’s appointment gave the Bharatiya Janata Party a fresh chance to criticise the Congress claiming that several senior Congress leaders themselves expressed their concern at Sidhu’s recent elevation as Punjab state unit president of the party.Sidhu was chosen to lead Congress in Punjab which is heading to the polls next year. Soon after his elevation, his differences with former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh came to the fore. The differences led to fellow MLAs rebelling against Singh and also led to Punjab getting a new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, a year ahead of the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rawat-slammed-for-calling-pak-army-chief-brother-says-lost-son-in-law-in-jk-101632408588652.html

State health Minister Veena George said the health department will go by the directive of the Union health ministry and make necessary changes. Medical experts said the state will have to at least double the existing deaths (24,191) to include all Covid-19 related fatalities. There were many complaints that the state was under-reporting many deaths to maintain the low death rate, which is still one of the lowest in the country, below 0.5 per cent against the national average of 1.30 per cent. “The state will prepare an updated list of those who succumbed to the pandemic. We will include those who died even after testing negative for the virus after a month,” said the minister adding the government will help all families who lost their family members to the viral infection. Many hospitals said they are getting frequent inquires for proper death certificates to identify the exact cause of death. Earlier the Union health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research had released fresh guidelines which stated that those who succumbed to Covid-19 at home or the hospital within 30 days of testing positive and those who stayed in a hospital beyond 30 days of testing positive and succumbed to the virus will now be counted as Covid-19 fatalities. Later, the Centre submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court in this regard. Kerala on Thursday reported 19,682 new Covid-19 cases with a test positivity rate of 16.14 per cent after 1,21,945 samples were tested, said the state health ministry. It also reported 152 deaths taking the total fatalities to 24,191. Active cases currently stand at 1,60,046 and the number of recoveries has climbed to 20,510.Thrissur district topped the list of new Covid-19 cases at 3033, followed by Ernakulam at 2,564 and Kozhikode at 1,735. Statistics show cases and TPR are coming down gradually after the state remained the one with the highest viral caseload for more than three months. The second wave of infections aggravated after the Onam festival in August-end. Though it reported high number of cases there were no health crisis or shortage of oxygen in any part of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-update-covid-19-fatality-list-says-health-minister-veena-george-101632408717694.html

23-09-2021||India||Defence ministry places order for 118 Arjun Mk-1A tanks worth ₹7,523 crore||The defence ministry on Thursday placed an order worth ₹7,523 crore with Heavy Vehicles Factory, Avadi, for 118 locally made Arjun Mk-1A tanks to sharpen the army’s combat edge, a fortnight after India cleared projects worth ₹33,000 crore to equip the Indian Air Force with new medium transport aircraft and airborne early warning systems in a push to the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India campaign). The order came seven months after the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) - India’s apex procurement body – accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for the tanks. The Arjun Mk-1A is an upgraded version of the Arjun Mk-1 main battle tank (MBT) currently in army service. The new tank will come with 72 upgrades over the existing variant including 14 major improvements, officials familiar with the development said. The upgrades significantly enhance the tank’s lethality, mobility and survivability. “The Mk-1A is equipped with accurate and superior firepower, all-terrain mobility and invincible multi-layered protection provided by an array of advanced technology systems. It can take on the enemy during day and night. By virtue of these capabilities, this indigenous MBT will be on a par with any contemporary in its class across the globe,” the defence ministry said in a statement. The execution of the order is expected to involve 200 Indian vendors and generate 8,000 jobs. Five Mk-1A t tanks will be delivered within 30 months, followed by 30 tanks every year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed over a prototype of the Arjun Mk-1A tank to army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane in Chennai on February 14. The army’s existing tank fleet consists of T-90, T-72 and the Arjun Mk-1 tanks. The improvements on the new tank include better firepower, auto target tracker, remote-controlled weapon system, explosive reactive armour, advanced laser warning and countermeasure systems, containerised ammunition bin, advanced land navigation systems and improved night vision capabilities, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The tank has been configured and designed for Indian conditions and is suitable for deployment to protect the frontiers, defence ministry officials said. However, some experts have flagged concerns about the bulky tank, saying its weight (68 tonne) could limit the army’s deployment options.The Defence Research and Development Organisation’s Chennai-based Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) has designed and developed the tank. The Mk-1A tanks will be manufactured at the Ordnance Factory Board’s (OFB) Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi, outside Chennai. The tank order comes at a time when the OFB - India’s main producer of weapons and military equipment - is being corporatised to boost its efficiency and competitiveness in a long-awaited reform in the country’s defence manufacturing sector. The Union Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had in June cleared the corporatisation of the board. The OFB, which controls 41 ordnance factories, is being split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives, vehicles, weapons and equipment, troop comfort items, opto-electronics gear, parachutes and ancillary products. Ordnance factories are currently engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, mine-protected vehicles, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers. The development of the Mk-1A tank began in June 2010 and it was fielded for user trials two years later. Extensive trial evaluation was conducted in various phases covering 7,000 km and substantial firing of various ammunitions during 2012-2015, the defence ministry statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-ministry-places-order-for-118-arjun-mk-1a-tanks-worth-rs-7-523-crore-101632405717828.html

23-09-2021||India||2 killed, several including 9 cops hurt in violence during Assam eviction drive||Two civilians were killed and several others including 9 policemen were injured in violence during an eviction drive in Assam’s Darrang district on Thursday afternoon. According to police, a mob of nearly 2000 people attacked the police team during the eviction drive following which police resorted to baton charge and firing that resulted in the death and injuries. Several videos of residents targeting the police team and police personnel firing at civilians and beating them with batons have been doing the rounds on social media following the incident. A photographer present at the scene is seen kicking an injured civilian lying at the scene in one video. “Police are doing their duty. As per my information, people attacked the police with machetes, spears and other things. Eviction has restarted (after violence) and will continue tomorrow as well,” chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told journalists in Guwahati. A similar eviction drive was carried out in two villages in the Garukhuti area of Dholpur on Monday in which nearly 800 families who were settled on nearly 4500 ‘bighas’ of government land were evicted. There was no violence on Monday. Residents of these areas mostly comprise of Bengali speaking Muslims. The areas where the eviction drive is taking place are part of Assam government’s Garukhuti Project, which aims to remove encroachers from 77,420 ‘bighas’ of land and start agricultural and allied activities for indigenous youth. This year’s state budget mentioned that the government plans to “develop this cluster as a beacon of resurgent Assam” and earmarked ₹9.6 crore for it. “As per the government plan of removing encroachers from the area, we have been carrying out evictions in four zones. While the process is taking place peacefully in other three zones, violence erupted at the fourth zone on Thursday,” Sushanta Biswa Sarma, superintendent of police, Darrang said. He mentioned that nearly 1500-2000 people had gathered at the area. At first there was no issue, but when police started removing encroachments using JCB vehicles, the mob started pelting stones and attacking the police with machetes, spears and other things. “One police officer was hit with a machete on his head and sustained serious injuries. We had to resort to firing to disperse the crowd and protect our personnel. As per our information, two civilians have been killed and 9 policemen were injured. Additional force was deployed in the area and the situation is under control now,” said Sarma. Opposition Congress condemned the police firing on residents and termed the eviction drive carried out during the pandemic as inhuman and violation of Supreme Court directives. “SC had given a directive against eviction during pandemic situation, yet the Assam government is behaving in an autocratic manner to evict the residents of Dholpur who have been living in the area since the 1970’s. Before eviction government should have arranged for rehabilitation and alternative housing,” state Congress president Bhupen Kumar Borah said. “These residents are mostly cultivators and their source of sustenance is being attacked. A government’s job is to work for welfare of people and not create problems for people by making them homeless. Congress warns the BJP government not to indulge in actions that will turn Assam into a police state,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-killed-several-including-9-cops-hurt-in-violence-during-assam-eviction-drive-101632403197109.html

LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan said it will be a total shutdown in the state and some examinations scheduled on that day will be shifted to another day. “Farmers have been agitating for almost a year. The Union government is ignoring their repeated pleas. The country has never witnessed such an indifferent government. We will support their movement whole-heartedly,” he said appealing to all parties and trade unions to make the bandh a success. Though many merchant association and others asked the LDF to make it a symbolic protest in view of the pandemic situation, the ruling front did not agree. “It is our duty to support such an agitation,” said Vijayaraghavan. Usually in the state such protests turn into a forced shutdown crippling normal life. At least 40 farmers’ outfits under the banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha have given a call for a countrywide bandh on September 27 which the protestors said will make their movement stronger. They said many trade unions, banks workers’ associations, transporters and others pledged support to their agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/total-shutdown-in-kerala-on-september-27-as-ruling-left-congress-support-bandh-101632400617336.html

"Those who do not have enough mobility that they can be brought out of their home, or if someone has a disability or some special needs that they can't be brought to the centre… for them we have made the provision of at-home vaccination under supervision," Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said as India has achieved the milestone of vaccinating 66% of its adult population by at least one dose of the vaccines. "We have the confidence that our vaccine is safe and the system that we will bring in place to take vaccines to the residence will be safe, effective, nurturing and supportive. It will follow the SOP. This is an important development," Dr Paul said. Order in this regard has been issued and the local teams will take part in such vaccination drive. The Centre has written a letter to all states in this regard on September 22. Also Read | Covishield: 'No technical concern', says UK high commissioner after meeting with India"It is understood that there are still some persons who might be bed-ridden or have extremely restricted mobility or disability and/or special needs that may hamper their accessibility even to the near-to-home centres. It is advised that a line-list of such potential beneficiaries and their caregivers may be prepared in the catchment area of every planning unit and collated at the district level," the letter said.The health ministry said that the vaccination drive aims to be equitable and citizen-centric. Hence, the decision to reach those people who are not being able to come to the vaccination centre for some valid reasons has been taken. On September 17, India achieved a milestone of inoculating over two crore people on a day and as a result, now there are six states/UTs in the country, including Lakshadweep, Chandigarh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Sikkim, which have 100 per cent coverage of the first dose of the vaccines. Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Kerala, Ladakh and Uttarakhand are on their way to achieving 100% first dose coverage and at present, they have 90% coverage of the first dose, according to health ministry data.How will the vaccination drive reach home?The health ministry has urged the states that vaccine wastage has to be kept minimal even as the drive is now being extended to the residence of the beneficiaries. All SOPs related to the maintenance of cold chain, prescribed temperature, safe injections, waste disposal, adverse events following immunisation are to be followed diligently. "Planning of such a drive should be cognizant f the fact that open vial policy is not applicable on Covid-19 vaccines and hence it should be ensured that vaccine wastage is minimal," the Centre's letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-okays-covid-vaccination-at-home-for-people-with-special-needs-101632396949520.html

23-09-2021||India||Armed with microbes, India prepares to fight season of deadly farm fires||Northern India, including Delhi, is bracing for an annual spell of notorious winter smog caused by agricultural fires, but authorities say they are ready to put up a novel fight, armed with a liquid concoction swarming with microbes. A proprietary microbial solution developed by the state-run Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), known as Pusa decomposer, is the best bet yet to prevent fires set by farmers to millions of acres of crop residue after summer paddy harvests, experts say. Farmers are reluctant to use machines to clear rice stalks because it pushes up post-harvest costs by 11-12%, Hukum Singh, a rice-grower in Haryana said. Last year, the Delhi government devised an elaborate plan to distribute several hundreds of litres of the solution to farmers within its territory. Official results reported to a top anti-pollution commission showed the solution was “effective”. Also Read | Ahead of harvest season, officials meet to discuss air pollutionThe Delhi government is preparing to treat at least 4,000 acres of crop residue this year too. On Monday, the Delhi government’s environment minister Gopal Rai announced it would start spraying the decomposer from October 5 to prevent stubble burning. Farmers across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh typically harvest paddy in October and then set their fields on fire to clear rice stalks for the next crop. The burning of crop residue in more than seven million hectares has emerged as a deadly cause of winter pollution, resulting in weeks-long smog in New Delhi during October and November. The fires are so widespread that they are visible from space. Westerly winds carry the smoke from burning fields towards the national capital. Air pollution in Delhi typically spikes to alarming levels, breaching the “severe” level. Air pollution kills up to an estimated 30,000 people in Delhi annually, according to a 2015 report of New Delhi’s Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Burning paddy straw has emerged as a big problem in the past two to three decades as farmers have shifted to mechanized combine harvesters, which cut the grainy part of a rice plant, leaving the stalk intact. A special mix of microbes in the decomposer developed by the IARI gorges on any kind of organic biomass. In the process, it turns rice stubble into fluffy manure. “The technology has been given to several agritech firms, which will distribute it to farmers in these northern states free,” said YV Singh, IARI’s principal scientist of microbiology. Yet, this is a modest beginning. Authorities in Punjab are preparing to use decomposer technology in about 700,000 acres to begin with, while officials have identified another 600,000 acres in Uttar Pradesh, Singh, the top IARI scientist, said. About 100,000 acres in Haryana have been targeted too. Private firms see a big potential and are harnessing big data and artificial intelligence to bring efficiency in using the decomposer under technology-sharing deals. Nurture.farm, a Bangalore-based agritech firm, is targeting 500,000 acres in Punjab and Haryana through its platform. The company says its platform has the potential to reach 1 million farmers. “We are using satellite mapping to identify farms where crop burning has been carried out. Using a shared-economy platform, we are spraying farms with the decomposer for free,” said Dhruv Sawhney, the business head of nurture.farm. For now, the cost of production of the decomposer, which is a bioenzyme, is ₹35 per acre, which is “nominal”, said Sawhney. The decomposer comes in the form of capsules that contain an activated package of eight strains of fungi, Singh said. To prepare a solution of 25 litres, farmers need to add 5 capsules of the decomposer, along with jaggery and checkpea flour, to water. Within a week, a good layer of fungi admixture is formed. To decompose paddy stubble in one hectare, farmers need to spray 25 litres of this solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-with-microbes-india-prepares-to-fight-season-of-deadly-farm-fires-101632396223081.html

23-09-2021||India||Ahead of harvest season, officials meet to discuss air pollution||Representatives of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi met on Thursday to discuss the preparedness ahead of the harvest season when farm fires emerge as a major contributor to winter pollution in the region.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said the meeting mainly focussed on the prevention of the fires, which are caused when farmers set alight paddy stubble left after harvesting. He added between July and September, the ministry issued six advisories and over 40 directions related to air pollution prevention via the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region (NCR) and adjoining areas on all emission sources—industries, construction, and demolition activities, etc--and how to control them.Yadav said he has spoken to Punjab and Delhi’s chief ministers, and they assured him they will do all they can to prevent air pollution. He referred to stubble burning in the neighbouring states and said the main issue is that there is a very small window between the time farmers harvest paddy and when they begin sowing winter crop. “They are using a bio enzyme developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute...which helps decompose stubble in around 30 to 35 days.” He added this year more solutions are being tried to address the issue.Yadav said he cannot say how much air pollution will reduce this winter, but he was hopeful that there will be an improvement as many schemes were being implemented to deal with the problem. He added using stubble as biofuel is one of the important interventions this year. But groups representing farmers said they have an even shorter window this time. “There was heavy rain in many parts of Punjab today also. Because of monsoon rains, harvesting and stubble disposal is unlikely for the next 15 to 20 days,” Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union. “We have been asking the Centre to offer direct subsidies to farmers on per quintal basis so that they can manage the stubble themselves and not burn it. There will be stubble fires this year also. The bio-enzyme is not fully effective, it can help partially,” he added, saying that over a thousand farmers were also heading to Singhu border in Delhi to repeat their demand for the repeal of farm laws and increasing minimum support price of certain crops. “The government will have to listen to us,” he said. The practise of burning farm residue sends up plumes of smoke that is carries by north-westerly winds to over Haryana, Delhi and parts of Uttar Pradesh. Here, this smoke proliferates and descends, blanketing a city like Delhi which has high urban air pollution, to create what has been described as a gas chamber. Over the past five years, the situation becomes so severe that schools have yet to be closed and the administration has issued stay-at-home advisories for vulnerable people like children and the elderly. Pollution from Diwali firecrackers also typically makes it worse, and there has been little improvement despite it being an annual crisis.Yadav said the National Thermal Power Corporation has floated a tender for 20 million tonnes of stubble for four years. He added in Gujarat’s Kutch and parts of Rajasthan, paddy stubble was also being procured for fodder for cattle.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar attended the meeting in his capacity as the state’s environment minister. Delhi’s environment minister, Gopal Rai, his Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan counterparts, Dara Singh Chauhan and Sukhram Bishnoi, also attended the meeting. Special chief secretary Anirudh Tiwari represented Punjab at the meeting.A Union environment ministry official said the area used to grow Pusa 44 variety paddy, which matures late and leaves a lot of stubble, has reduced this year. “Punjab also ran a campaign...(that helped reduce)... the area under paddy (cultivation)...marginally. Overall area under Basmati (cultivation) has increased which normally does not cause trouble with stubble because it decomposes easily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-harvest-season-officials-meet-to-discuss-air-pollution-101632395022834.html

However, the minister also said that there is a lack of action plan.Rai made the remarks after the Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav chaired a meeting with the environment ministers and state officials of the NCR states namely Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab.“Neighbouring states have said that they're ready for the experiment of bio-decomposer to tackle stubble burning, However, there is a lack in the action plan,” Rai said after the meeting, news agency ANI reported.Also read | Stubble fire: Bio-decomposer solution to be prepared from Sept 24, says Gopal RaiFurther, during a press conference, Rai also said that the neighbouring states and the central government should prepare for spraying bio-decomposer on a war footing to tackle the pollution due to stubble burning. “To solve the problem of stubble pollution, the Delhi government will spray bio-de-composer in about 4,000 acres of agricultural area free of cost. The Central and the concerned State Governments should prepare for [the] sprinkling of bio-decomposer on a war footing as a measure,” he said.Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal too had said that the air quality in the national capital will deteriorate from the middle of October as the state governments have not taken action to support their farmers. His government has been pushing for the adoption of Pusa bio-decomposer, a microbial solution for stubble, to be distributed for free to the farmers in the neighbouring states.Among other measures to curb pollution in the region, Rai said that he has requested Union minister Yadav to facilitate CNG (compressed natural gas) powered public transport in NCR. In addition, he has also asked for the banning of firecrackers during the festival of Diwali in the neighbouring states too. Notably, Kejriwal had already announced that the sale, storage and usage of firecrackers would not be allowed in Delhi during Diwali this year too.The meeting came a day after the World Health Organization revised its guidelines for the global air quality standards, providing evidence for the damage that air pollution causes to human health. The guidelines also recommend new air quality levels to protect the health by reducing the levels of some major pollutants that also contribute to climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neighbouring-states-ready-to-try-bio-decomposer-for-stubble-pollution-delhi-minister-gopal-rai-101632393423746.html

On the other hand, Puri said, the Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government has increased prices by ₹3.51 per litre since July, taking the per litre cost of petrol over ₹100-mark."If your question is do you want the petrol prices to come down then the answer is yes. Now, if your question is why the petrol prices are not coming down, then the answer is because the states don't want to bring it under GST," PTI quoted Puri as saying.Puri was in West Bengal campaigning for BJP’s candidate Priyanka Tibrewal contesting against West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Bhabanipur bypolls."The Centre charges ₹32 per litre (as taxes on petrol). We charged ₹32 per litre when the fuel price was USD 19 per barrel, and we are still charging the same even when the price rose to USD 75 per barrel.

The Taliban-US deal was negotiated between Qatar, Pakistan, UK and US Special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.The fact is that all Taliban leaders, who were part of the Doha process, have been side-lined by the Pakistani ISI backed Haqqani Network with all the critical positions including Interior, Intelligence, Border and Tribal Affairs given to hardcore global designated terrorists. The side-lining of Mullah Baradar, Mullah Yaqoob and Sher Mohammed Stanakzai in the Taliban regime reveals the extent of grip Pakistan has over the Sunni Pashtun terror force.It is evident from the conversations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar have had with their interlocutors over the phone and in New York that recognition to the Taliban regime is not coming soon as none of the conditions of UNSC resolution 2593 has been fulfilled. Despite being promoted by Pakistan, even its iron brother China and Russia are thinking twice before getting into the Afghanistan mess.

The fact is all the contenders to succeed PM Suga have defined their future agenda by adopting a strident line against China.Australia will AUKUS Anglo-Saxon pact in its bag has taken the deterrence to China to a different level with eight US/UK built nuclear powered conventional attack submarines or SSNs expected to patrol Indo-Pacific waters by the next decade. The AUKUS pact has dove-tailed the strategic element into Quad as India believes in strategic autonomy and Japan is to still shed its pacificist doctrine. And all Quad partners and other countries are of the opinion privately that nuclear submarine is any day a better sub-surface deterrent to the ever-growing Chinese Navy. It is the AUKUS pact that has brought the challenge to Chinese military capability in the South China Sea and beyond.Even though on the face of it, India wants to be a global factory of the world with Quad partners joining hands, it is also very clear about acquiring at least three SSNs in the coming decade. The India-China stand-off in East Ladakh is still a work in progress with PLA still to restore status quo ante in Hot Springs area, Depsang Bulge and Demchok.It is in this backdrop that Quad leaders are meeting in the White House and a strong statement is expected by the end of day on September 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-indo-pacific-in-quad-afghanistan-a-priority-in-unga-101632389618131.html

They will search the area,” said the officer.Deputy Commissioner of Police, Harish Pandey, said the explosion could be the result of a cracker blast. “It looks like a cracker explosion definitely. The major impact is from the cracker only. It seems almost 80 boxes were stored here, we still have to calculate,” Pandey said. “Probably, the person who was handling those boxes was right next to it when the box exploded.

Gopi, who also met Kallarangatt this week, provided no further details. The BJP was first to support the Bishop when he made the controversial statement on September 9. His statement triggered a war of words between community leaders. The opposition parties urged the government to call an all-party meeting. Vijayan rejected the idea saying there was no need for discussing non-existent issues.Syro-Malabar Church has backed the Bishop and said his statement was a warning against certain evil tendencies and was not meant against any community.There was no immediate response to Gopi’s claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-call-christian-leaders-meet-amid-narcotic-jihad-row-says-kerala-mp-101632384761895.html

Justice Ramana informed senior advocate CU Singh about constitution of a committee during the hearing of an unconnected matter. Singh represents one of the petitioners in the bouquet of cases on Pegasus. “Please tell other lawyers too that we will pass our order next week,” the CJI told Singh. The court had, on September 13, reserved its order in the case after the Union government declined to make public whether its agencies used the Israeli software. Also Read | SC panel recommends transfer of Andhra chief justiceDuring the last hearing, the government refused to share any more information on use of Pegasus by its agencies or hand out specific information on alleged interception of some of the petitioners. The bench, which included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, then said the court will pass an interim order in the next 3-4 days on constitution of an expert committee and on other ancillary issues related to an independent inquiry after considering the materials placed by the petitioners before it and the submissions made by the counsel for the parties. After taking time earlier to reconsider the government’s previous stand against filing a detailed response on the bunch of petitions, solicitor general Tushar Mehta reiterated that use of a particular software like Pegasus cannot be a subject matter of any affidavit or a public debate. He said the government stands by its August 16 affidavit filed on the Pegasus snooping matter. This affidavit neither confirmed nor denied the use of the military-grade spyware to hack phones of ministers, politicians, businessmen, activists and journalists and offered to instead set up an expert committee. The government’s submissions were strongly objected to by petitioners’ lawyers who included senior counsel Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan, Rakesh Dwivedi, Dinesh Dwivedi, Colin Gonsalves and Meenakshi Arora. The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. According to this consortium, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning a phone into a pocket spy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-set-up-an-expert-committee-to-inquire-into-pegasus-row-101632379361356.html

Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) - the umbrella organisation which is spreaheading the protest - said that the movement is a testimony to the will and determination of lakhs of farmers across the country that would only grow stronger.The 40 farmers organisations under SKM have given a call for "Bharat Bandh" on September 27, which the protesters said will make their movement stronger."Various sections of the society are being reached out to by farmers' outfits in different parts of the country to get their support and solidarity to the farmers' cause, which is also becoming a movement to protect India's democracy," the SKM said in a statement.Here are the latest developments about September 27 Bharat Bandh:• The All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AlBOC) has extended its support to 'Bharat Bandh'. AIBOC requested the government to re-open dialogue with the Samyukta Kisan Morcha on their demands and rescind the three contentious farm laws.• Meanwhile, the SKM said that workers' unions, trade unions, employees' and students' unions, women's organisations and transporters' associations are being roped in for the planning of the "bandh".• Kisan mahapanchayats are also being organised to get more citizens to rally around the "Bharat Bandh" call.

However, the farm union leaders did not attend the meeting.• Haryana home minister Anil Vij said in Chandigarh on Wednesday that the Supreme Court will be apprised of the development.• The court had last month said the Centre and the neighbouring states of Delhi should find a solution to the road blockades at the borders of the national capital.• The farmers have been sitting at the Delhi borders since November last year demanding the repeal of the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year. They claim that these laws favour corporate houses and will hurt their earnings.• The government, which has held multiple rounds of talks with the farmers in a bid to break the deadlock, has rubbished all the allegations, saying the farmers are not receiving correct information regarding the landmark reforms.

India and China have been locked in a border row for over 16 months, a phase that witnessed a deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley and saw tensions spiral between the rival armies on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso last year.Speaking to HT from Ladakh on Tuesday, Stanzin said, after a long time nomads on their own initiative had decided to take their flock to grazing lands in Khu-la and other areas, but faced restrictions from the Indian side.“Ideally the government should take steps to help the nomads in providing access to grazing lands, take steps for border area development. This year after a gap of 8-10 years the nomads on their own decided to take their yaks to Khu-la and tsogtsalu but they could not reach the areas that are their traditional grounds. This indicates that despite the disengagement things are still not normal on the ground,” he said. Also Read | Why military has sought more time to induct women into NDAHe said allowing the nomads unfettered access to their traditional grazing lands also ensures that the land parcels are not reduced on account of border dispute.“It (going to grazing lands) was purely an initiative by the villagers of Phobrang, Yourgo and Lukung village. Because nomads play an important role in guarding the border, they work as both ear and eyes to the nation,” he said.Officials in the army headquarters declined to comment on the matter. The two armies kicked off talks to cool border tensions in June 2020.Disengagement has taken place in the Pangong Tso sector and Gogra or Patrolling Point-17A.But problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved. To be sure, the problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff.Both armies have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre and the deployments haven’t thinned after the disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector and PP-17A.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-councillor-says-nomads-had-no-access-to-grazing-land-101632374681436.html

He added the people of the state have seen the party deliver on its promises and for “consistency and continuity”, they will vote for the BJP.Yadav is in charge of the Manipur election and was in the state last week for a preparatory meeting ahead of the polls. He said the state has come a long way since the time it was used to facing blockages and bandhs. “In the last five years, there have been no blockages like the economic blockage that went on for four months (November 2016 to March 2017)…. People feel relaxed,” he said.The BJP won 21 of the 60 seats in the state in 2017 and formed the government there with support from parties such as the Naga People’s Front and the National People’s Party (NPP). The ties between the BJP and the NPP remained testy, with differences frequently coming to the fore. On more than one occasion, chief minister Biren Singh had to rely on the central leadership’s intervention to iron out differences. In 2020, the government was on the verge of collapse when four of the NPP legislators withdrew support but came around after negotiations were held in Delhi.Also Read | Manipur’s iconic all-women market to reopen after 5 monthsNPP chief Conrad Sangma has said there will be no pre-poll alliance between the two parties. On whether Sangma’s statement is a precursor to the alliance being called off, Yadav said, a decision on it will be taken based on the post-poll situation. “… What anyone says now is not important. We have been working on the ground and have run a strong alliance government... the major player in Manipur is the BJP and as of date, there is no alternative of the party in Manipur.”He said Congress has “shrunk” and added many from the party leaders have shown the inclination to join the BJP. He added in the run-up to the polls, the trend of Congress leaders joining the BJP will continue. On what would be the BJP’s poll planks in Manipur, he said, “We are committed to ensuring an atmosphere of peace. Manipur has made a significant contribution in the sectors of art, sports, and culture and the Prime Minister wants equal development for the state. We will work on the concept of national ambition and regional aspiration.”Yadav said the BJP has a “long list of accomplishments” which includes providing Ayushman health cards to over 400000 beneficiaries, electricity and roads in villages, and encouraging organic farming. On whether Biren Singh would be the face of the election, he said, “We have provided a stable and strong government. He has been the chief minister rest of the decisions will be taken by the parliamentary board (the highest decision-making body) of the party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-alternative-to-bjp-in-manipur-bhupender-yadav-101632373421188.html
23-09-2021||India||Sharp decline in fertility rate among Muslims: Study||India’s religious composition has not changed significantly since 1951 with the fertility rates of the two major religious groups--Hindus and Muslims--almost converging, according to a report by the Pew Research Center, a non-profit organisation based in Washington DC. The report said every religious group in India “has seen its fertility fall, including the majority Hindu population and Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Jain minority groups”. It added the fertility rate among Muslims has witnessed a sharp decline. The report said between 1992 and 2015, the fertility rates of Muslims fell from 4.4 to 2.6. Among Hindus, it has declined from 3.3 to 2.1. The fertility gap between Muslim and Hindu women shrank from 1.1 to 0.5 children. “This indicates the gaps in childbearing between India’s religious groups are much smaller than they used to be,” the report said.Also Read | Don’t require all-party meet, says Kerala CM Vijayan in ‘narcotic jihad’ rowThe study said it is due to the “declining and converging fertility patterns” that there has been only a marginal change in the religious composition of the country since 1951. India’s average fertility of 2.2 has fallen from what it was in 1951. But it is still higher than developed economies such as the US.The study is based on data sourced from India’s decennial census and the National Family Health Survey. It looked at the three main factors known to cause changes in the religious composition of populations — fertility rate, migration, and conversions. The report said neither migration nor conversions have had any impact on the religious composition of the country. Interestingly, the report notes that conversions are rare in India.A Faizur Rahman, the secretary-general of the Islamic Forum for the Promotion of Moderate Thought, said it is the Muslim realisation that education is the only way to come up in life that has resulted in the reduction of their family size through birth control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharp-decline-in-fertility-rate-among-muslims-study-101632373241284.html

Assistance providers must be accorded unimpeded, unrestricted, and direct access,” Jaishankar said in a series of tweets after the virtual meeting.“Taliban’s commitment not to allow the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in any manner should be implemented. The world expects a broad-based inclusive process that involves representation from all sections of Afghan society,” he said.The Taliban swept across Afghanistan last month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1. On August 15, the capital city of Kabul fell to the insurgents.The Taliban claimed victory over opposition forces in the last holdout province of Panjshir on September 6, completing their takeover of Afghanistan three weeks after capturing Kabul.The Taliban has said that Afghan territory will not be used against any country.Jaishankar said the UN Security Council resolution 2593 on Afghanistan reflects global sentiment and should continue to “guide our approach. India’s engagement will be driven by its historical friendship with the Afghan people.”The resolution, adopted under India’s Presidency of the 15-nation Council in August, demanded that Afghan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts, and reiterated the importance of combating terrorism in Afghanistan, including those individuals and entities designated pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999), and noted the Taliban’s relevant commitments.It had condemned in the strongest terms the deplorable attacks of August 26 near Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, which were claimed by the Islamic State in Khorasan Province, an entity affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Da’esh), and resulted in deaths and injuries of over 300 civilians and 28 military personnel.The resolution took note of the Taliban’s condemnation of this attack.Following the G20 meeting, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted “Had a productive dialogue at #UNGA76 with G20 Foreign Ministers and International Organisation Principals on Afghanistan.

The surrenders coincided with World Rhino Day and are expected to discourage hunting and poaching of wild animals in the area.Pramod Boro, a chief executive member of the Bodoland Territorial Council that administers the four districts in the region, also gave financial aid to the poachers who decided to give up poaching and take up alternate vocations. “Handed over ₹50,000 ex-gratia and assured two handloom clusters to 57 poachers who surrendered their arms…..Our govt. is committed to take every possible step to make ‘Poaching free BTR’,” tweeted Boro, who heads the United Peoples Party Liberal, an ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.Boro asked all poachers to stop killing wild animals and said they plan to introduce rhinos to the Raimona National Park.Rathin Barman, joint director, Wildlife Trust of India, said the initiative to have the poachers surrender their arms started after Raimona was declared a national park. “Poachers were identified and educated about protecting wildlife...,” he said. “In Assam and rest of northeast... various tribes have been involved in traditional hunting. Most of the weapons surrendered were self-made muzzle loaded rifles. Some of the poachers have already given up hunting, but they decided to hand over their weapons to the government.” Barman said there is no data on the number of poachers in the area and the process of surrender of arms would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/57-poachers-surrender-arms-in-assam-101632371381189.html

The heads of General Atomics, Qualcomm, semi-conductor major, BlackRock global investment company, First Solar, non-conventional energy leader, and Adobe, US leader in software.It is understood that Apple CEO Tim Cook dropped out at the last moment due to health reasons as Covid numbers are climbing in the US.It is quite evident from the line-up that PM Modi meetings with the CEOs are with the specific intention of India being a key part of global resilient chain, a military power which matches over the horizon capabilities in the Indo-Pacific and speed up non-conventional energy needs to go beyond the climate change commitments for climate justice.While all the companies are global leaders in their own right, the meeting with General Atomics head acquires significance as Indian Navy is already operating two Predator MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicles for building maritime domain awareness from Gulf of Aden to Lombok Straits in Indonesia.With Indian Navy as the lead player, India has plans to acquire 30 Predator armed UAVs with each service getting 10 each for muscling its stand-off capabilities. The Predator can be armed with seven Hell-Fire air to surface missiles (ASMs) or laser guided bombs. The UAV operates at a ceiling of 50,000 feet and has an endurance of nearly 27 hours. It is a multi-mission aircraft with multi-mode radar for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting.It is important for India to acquire armed drones as its own indigenous capability is limited with both Beijing and Islamabad operating Chinese made armed drones. Pakistan is also eyeing to acquire armed drones for Turkey, which now is a self-appointed leader of Sunni world and wants to bring back orthodox legacy of the bygone Ottoman Empire. The Turkish drones were used to good effect in the Azerbaijan-Armenian conflict with Pakistani mercenaries operating against Armenia.With the Biden administration giving a green signal for India to acquire Predator drone, it is only a matter of time when the Indian Navy brings up the proposal before the Defence Acquisition Committee (DAC) for the process to take off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/predator-drone-on-his-mind-pm-modi-to-meet-general-atomics-ceo-101632371040729.html

23-09-2021||India||Sangh-backed committee wants memorial to mark 100 years of Moplah killings||The 1921 Malabar rebellion martyrs remembrance committee, a group backed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has demanded that September 25 be marked as Malabar Hindu genocide day and a “memorial” be built to mark the killings a 100 years ago in Kerala’s Malappuram. The RSS is opposed to recognising the killings that began in August 1921 as a part of an uprising against the British or the landlords and asserts that those were “targeted killings of Hindus”.“Even Annie Besant had challenged Gandhiji to come and see what happened in Malabar. Muslims in Mumbai had said this is not Islam; in a statement that was published in the Hindu, they said this (killings) is a one-sided attack on a society, forcing them to convert. C Sankaran Nair, who was the president of the Indian National Congress called it a genocide… however after 1975 it was illegally deemed as part of the freedom struggle,” said J Nandakumar, the all India convener of Prajna Pravah, a Sangh-backed think tank, and a member of the committee. Also Read | With its ear to the ground, how the BJP is sharpening its poll strategyNandakumar said while the Kerala government has not considered their demand, they are hopeful the Centre will consider the observations of BR Ambedkar, Annie Besant and more recently CI Issac, member of the Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR), who has dubbed the incident as communal outrage. Last month, a three- member committee of ICHR, formed to review the names of freedom fighters from 1857 to 1947, considered removing the names of 387 “Moplah rioters”. On September 25, the committee will hold an exhibition and a programme in Delhi’s Palika Park to pay homage to those who died a century ago. A day later, it will make a formal demand for building what could be India’s first genocide memorial. Events will be held across the country to commemorate the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanghbacked-committee-wants-memorial-to-mark-100-years-of-moplah-killings-101632370901045.html

23-09-2021||India||Covishield gets UK nod, but Indians still have to quarantine. The dispute, explained||The United Kingdom is facing a severe backlash for what many have called its “selective vaccine policy” after the country issued its revised international travel advisory on Wednesday, in which it approved several formulations of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine – including the Covishield shot manufactured by the Serum Institute. But it has still kept countries like India, which use Covishield, in the list where travellers are required to be quarantined when they reach Britain.The guidelines provided in the latest advisory suggest that Britain has no problems with the formulation of the Covishield vaccine, but with the Covid-19 vaccine certification provided by India through the CoWIN app.The new rules issued by the UK have triggered a controversy here in India, with several lawmakers heavily criticising the “discriminatory policy” and with diplomats warning of retaliation on an official level.Here's what the entire controversy is about, explained in ten brief pointers:1. The UK government issued an updated international travel advisory on Wednesday (September 22), where it listed the Covid-19 shots which will be deemed as ‘approved vaccines’ for travellers visiting Britain from any part of the world from October 4 onwards.2. This new list included Covishield, the formulation of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). In essence, the UK will consider a traveller as ‘fully vaccinated’ if they are inoculated with a full dose of any of these vaccines – Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or the Janssen shot. It will also consider the different formulations of the four aforementioned vaccines – such as Covishield (AstraZeneca), Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), or Takeda (Moderna).3. However, even though the UK kept Covishield, manufactured by the SII, in its list of ‘approved vaccines’, it kept India in the list of countries whose travellers need to quarantine for 10 days when they reach the UK. This has been done due to some issues with the certification process in India, said UK officials.4. For context, there are currently 18 nations – including Denmark, Canada, and Antigua and Barbuda – that have been cleared by London for the UK ‘green list’. Travellers vaccinated in these countries – even with Covishield – can fly to Britain without having to follow mandatory quarantine protocols. However, a traveller flying to the UK from India will still have to undergo 10 days of mandatory home quarantine even if they had been inoculated with the same Covishield vaccine due to India's vaccination certificate through the CoWIN app.5. This is what is being called a ‘discriminatory policy’ by diplomats on the Indian side. Earlier this week, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla warned that if the UK did not amend its policy on Covishield, India could impose ‘reciprocal measures’. However, the new advisory issued by Britain a day later did not make it any easier for Indian travellers flying to the UK, despite recognising Covishield as an approved vaccine.6. Alex Ellis, the British high commissioner to India, said on Wednesday, “We're clear Covishield is not a problem. We have been having detailed technical discussions regarding certification, with the builders of the CoWIN app and the NHS app, about both apps.7. Ellis, however, said the UK wants to make the process of travelling as easy as possible. “We listen very carefully to what the Indian government says but ministers have to take decisions and they have been clear that Covishield is not an issue,” he said in an interview with a news channel.8. National Health Authority CEO RS Sharma, however, said he was not aware of any concerns being raised by the UK about the Covid-19 vaccine certification by India, asserting that the Co-WIN system is WHO-compliant. “I am not aware of any concerns being raised by the UK,” the PTI news agency quoted him as saying. “The British high commissioner met me on September 2 and wanted to know details about the Co-WIN system.”9. In his video remarks at the global Covid Summit hosted by US president Joe Biden on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also said that international travel should be made easier through mutual recognition of vaccine certificates, amid several countries adopting different sets of rules to allow foreigners to enter their territory in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic that has caused unprecedented disruption.10. External affairs minister S Jaishankar has also strongly taken up the issue of Covishield-vaccinated travellers being required to quarantine in the UK with newly-appointed British foreign secretary Elizabeth Truss at a meeting in New York. “Urged early resolution of quarantine issue in mutual interest,” said the foreign minister in a tweet informing of his meeting with the UK foreign secretary earlier on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-gets-uk-nod-but-india-not-on-vaccine-list-the-dispute-explained-101632362712334.html
23-09-2021||India||India working with other nations on vaccine certificate recognition: Minister||Union minister Rajeev Chandrashekhar said on Wednesday the Indian government is working with several countries to recognise its vaccine certification on a mutual reciprocal basis. This came on the day the UK added Covishield, the India-manufactured Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, to its list of approved vaccines. After an earlier travel advisory of the UK government did not recognize the vaccine, the Indian government had cautioned against reciprocal measures over “discriminatory” action against a UK-licensed product. Also Read | UK recognises Covishield, but still no green light for IndiansAddressing the media, Chandrashekhar said, as the world will seek a more rule-based, transparent and democratic future in the post-Covid order, India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will play a significant role in shaping it. On Wednesday, PM Modi embarked on a three-day visit to the United States to address the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). He will also participate in the Quad Leaders’ Summit and hold a bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House during the trip. To a question about some countries not recognising Indian vaccines, he said fear and paranoia about travel have become high in the pandemic and every sovereign country will take a decision which it thinks is in the best interest of its people. Stating this as his personal opinion, the minister said there is nothing right and wrong about this as some countries will take stronger view on what vaccine will be accepted by their medical fraternity because of “the unknown” about the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-working-with-other-nations-on-vaccine-certificate-recognition-minister-101632367780768.html

23-09-2021||India||Someone else will become Bengal chief minister if I don’t win: Mamata Banerjee at Bhabanipur bypoll campaign||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said someone else from her party would become the chief minister of West Bengal if she did not win the Bhabanipur assembly bypoll, scheduled on September 30. “Cast your vote even if it rains. I will suffer if I don’t get even one vote. Don’t be complacent and assume that my victory is ensured. Please don’t do that. If you want to see me as chief minister you must vote for me. Every vote is crucial. If I do not win, someone else will become the chief minister since we are in the majority,” Banerjee said at her first election meeting in Ekbalpore area, in South Kolkata, where members of the Muslim community comprise a sizeable chunk of voters. Speaking in Hindi and Bengali while using odd Urdu words, Banerjee said, “I contested from Nandigram but there was a conspiracy to defeat me. The matter is being heard by court. It is destiny that I am contesting from Bhabanipur again to become chief minister.” For the record, TMC trailed the BJP at two Hindu-dominated civic wards in Bhabanipur in the last two polls that Banerjee won. Muslims comprise around 20% of total voters in the constituency. “Voters of Kidderpore (of which Ekbalpore is a part) supported me six times when I contested and won the Kolkata South Lok Sabha seat. I am sure you will support me again,” said Banerjee. “The BJP is a party of liars. They allege that Bengalis are not allowed to perform Durga Puja and Kali Puja. People from all communities freely practise their religions here whereas in Tripura the government has imposed Section 144 (CrPC). How can Tripura residents perform Durga Puja?” said Banerjee. She was referring to the prohibitory orders the Biplab Deb government has imposed in Tripura till November, citing the Covid-19 pandemic. TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee could not hold the party’s first rally in Agartala because of the restrictions. Before the March-April assembly polls, Banerjee surprised everyone when she announced in East Midnapore’s Nandigram that she would contest the local seat against her protégé-turned-adversary, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari, and not from Bhabanipur, her old seat. In the polls held on April 1, Adhikari defeated her by around 1,500 votes and subsequently became the leader of the opposition in the state assembly. Reacting to Banerjee’s appeal to voters, Adhikari said, “The person responsible for this bypoll is Suvendu Adhikari. A defeated chief minister is making desperate efforts. She did not learn from the Nandigram lesson.” Bhabanipur witnessed a flurry of activities on Wednesday as Banerjee, Adhikari, Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta and Bengal BJP’s new president Sukanta Majumdar campaigned in different parts of the constituency. Majumdar entered into an altercation with the police when he and the BJP workers were stopped from visiting homes of voters at Harish Chatterjee Street, where the chief minister lives. The area is marked as a high security zone. Akash Magharia, deputy commissioner of police (south), who stopped the BJP team, said, “There are restrictions in this zone. Moreover, we could not allow so many people in view of the pandemic. Nobody could show vaccination certificates.” The highest concentration of Kolkata’s Sikh community is based in Bhabanipur, where Puri on Tuesday offered prayers at Gurdwara Sant Kutiya Ji and also visited the ancestral homes of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose and Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee before meeting voters at several locations. Banerjee took a dig at Puri saying he should tell voters why price of cooking gas has touched the ceiling. In a rebuttal, Puri said, “The chief minister should tell people why the state is against imposition of goods and services tax (GST) on petrol and diesel. A major component of fuel prices in Bengal comprises state tax. She should think before making this a political issue.” While addressing residents of Lord Sinha Road, where non-Bengali Hindu voters and members of the business community are in the majority, Adhikari said, “What has this government given in five months? The defeated chief minister only offers doles and subsidies. Bengal’s debt burden is hovering around ₹5 lakh crore. Never expect jobs and industries here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/someone-else-will-become-bengal-chief-minister-if-i-don-t-win-mamata-banerjee-at-bhabanipur-bypoll-campaign-101632345579570.html

It is also under consideration to take the festival to the remotest parts of the country, with nearly 75 locations under consideration to live stream the festival. The concepts to air a platform original and organise master classes were discussed at a meeting between Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur. “Good discussion with Mr @reedhastings (Co-Founder & CEO Netflix),” Thakur said on Twitter. “Today consumers of content are traveling the world through stories; India offers a variety of opportunities and ideas - in multiple languages.” Netflix’ original films -- which include international releases like screen legend Sophia Loren in her son’s film, The Life Ahead, also out November 13 on Netflix -- may be slated to be launched in India at the festival. “The film is not finalised yet but it will be one of our big international releases,’’ he said.The platform is also looking to add to master classes, a standard function of the festival, by tying up with experts who can help teach them, the official cited above said. “These could be a director of photography, cinematography or any kind of creator, who may share their experience with their peers,” the official added. The festival will be a first-of-its-kind hybrid event, especially if it manages to scale to the remote parts of the country wherein it is trying to showcase a live stream. A Netflix film launching in India will further boost the festival’s popularity. HT reached out to Netflix but did not receive a response immediately. A second official familiar with the matter said that IFFI was in talks with several online streaming platforms. “Nothing has been concretised yet,” the official said. “We are still figuring out the contours of how the process will work. Talks are happening with all platforms.” The platforms, including Netflix, seem to be on board despite the government’s controversial social media and intermediary guidelines. The first official mentioned above said the guidelines were not a major concern for the platforms as they already self-regulate. “It’s good that there is framework… Netflix is part of all major film festivals, it will not miss out on India as it happens to be a big market,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-looks-to-screen-first-netflix-original-at-international-film-festival-of-india-101632344979157.html

On Wednesday, he was also scheduled to attend a meeting of the G-20 foreign ministers on Afghanistan and of the G-4, which is seeking permanent seats for India, Brazil, Japan and Germany on the UNSC.Jaishankar met his South Korean counterpart Chung Eui-Yong and had wide-ranging conversations on different aspects of the bilateral relationships, including Southern Policy and India’s Act East Policy. “Pleased to meet FM Chung Eui-Yong of the Republic of Korea. A wide-ranging conversation on different aspects of our relationship. RoK’s New Southern Policy and India’s Act East Policy have strengthened our convergence in the Indo-Pacific,” tweeted Jaishankar.While interacting with his Italian counterpart Luigi Di Maio, who is the current G20 chair, Jaishankar discussed challenges related to vaccine accessibility and smooth travel. “Discussed challenges related to vaccine accessibility and smooth travel. Look forward to joining him at a discussion on Afghanistan tomorrow,” he tweeted.The Union minister also met with his Finnish counterpart Pekka Haavisto and discussed the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Jaishankar held a discussion on the Indo-Pacific issues during his meeting with his Chilean counterpart Andres Allamand. “Another perspective on the Indo-Pacific from FM @allamand of Chile. Also engaged on expanding our economic engagement, including on green energy,” he tweeted.Earlier, in his address to the General Debate on Tuesday, Erdogan had said, “We maintain our stance in favour of solving the ongoing problem in Kashmir for 74 years, through dialogue between the parties and within the framework of relevant United Nations resolutions.”Erdogan had raised Kashmir in his address also in 2019, which was the last in-person meeting of the UN general assembly. At that time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reiterated India’s support for “independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity” of island nation after a meeting with Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades. Cyprus backs India’s claims to a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.The long ongoing conflict in Cyprus began in 1974 when Turkey invaded the northern part of the country in response to a military coup on the island which was backed by the Greek government. India has been advocating a peaceful resolution of the issue in accordance with the UN resolutions.In a 1998 resolution, the UN Security Council called upon “all States to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and request(ed) them, along with the parties concerned, to refrain from any action which might prejudice that sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as from any attempt of partition of the island or its unification with any other country”.The UNSC resolution also called for the “all concerned to commit themselves to a reduction in defence spending and a reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus to help restore confidence between the parties and as a first step towards the withdrawal of non-Cypriot forces”.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-erdogan-mentions-kashmir-in-unga-jaishankar-says-important-to-respect-un-resolutions-on-cyprus-101632344439209.html
23-09-2021||India||Supreme Court rejects plea against BJP leaders Raman Singh, Sambit Patra in ‘toolkit’ case||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to interfere with an order by the Chhattisgarh high court staying investigation against former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Sambit Patra in the alleged “toolkit” case but told the high court not to be influenced by the observations made in the FIR in deciding the petitions.The Chhattisgarh government moved a petition against the June 11 interim order passed by a single judge of the Chhattisgarh high court that said that the FIR against Singh and Patra, among others, was politically motivated, borne out of political grudge and rivalry, and none of the offences contained in the FIR were made out. The high court order came on separate petitions by Singh and Patra. Satisfied that a prima facie case was made out for staying of the FIR, the single judge stayed further proceedings in the case, and sought a response by the state government.Dismissing the state’s appeal against the interim order, the bench headed by chief justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana said, “The special leave petition is dismissed. We request the High Court to dispose the petition expeditiously. The observations (made in the order) will not come in the way of the High Court in deciding the matter.”Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Chhattisgarh government told the Supreme Court that with the scathing observations passed by high court, there was no scope left for the state government to get a fair hearing.“The case made out by the court says that the FIR is only on the ground of malafide and political grudge. Since he is a political person, these findings are given straight away that no case is made out. What is left for me to go back for?” Singhvi said.The bench, also comprising justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli said, “We are not interfering with the high court order. Let the high court decide finally. You will have the opportunity to challenge the final decision.”The FIR against Singh and Patra among others was filed on May 19 at Civil Lines police station in Raipur on a complaint filed by the chief of the Chhattisgarh unit of the Congress-affilated National Students Union of India (NSUI). The case was registered under sections relating to statements promoting enmity within community, causing breach of public tranquillity, forgery to harm reputation, and disobedience of orders by a public servant.The FIR said that Singh and Patra, through their Twitter handles, tweeted images showing an alleged toolkit prepared by the Indian National Congress (INC). The tweets in question were posted on May 18 showing a document allegedly issued by “AICC Research Department”. These posts accused the Congress of hatching a conspiracy to discredit the country in the international media by taking advantage of the pandemic situation. Twitter tagged the tweets by Singh and Patra among several others who tweeted the document as “manipulated media”.As per Twitter policy, this tag is given to such content where the microblogging site has reason to believe that the said media or the context in which it is presented is significantly and deceptively altered or manipulated.In the FIR registered with the Chhattisgarh Police, the Congress claimed that the document tweeted by the accused was on an allegedly forged letterhead of All India Congress Committee(AICC) and this amounted to spreading false and fabricated content.Simultaneously, even the Delhi Police took up the probe into the same events following a complaint and questioned the Twitter India Managing Director and visited Twitter offices in Delhi and Gurgaon in connection with their action to flag the tweets as “manipulated”.The case had also seen the intervention of the Union government which issued notices to Twitter to remove the “manipulated” tags as it amounted to prejudging the veracity of tweets which is a subject matter of investigation by the law enforcement agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-plea-against-bjp-leaders-raman-singh-sambit-patra-in-toolkit-case-101632343358985.html

23-09-2021||India||Uttar Pradesh govt recommends CBI probe into death of Akhara Parishad chief Narendra Giri||Lucknow/ Prayagraj: Uttar Pradesh recommended a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the death of influential Hindu seer Narendra Giri on Wednesday night, hours after he was laid to rest in Prayagraj and a post-mortem report suggested that the holy man may have died by asphyxiation. Giri -- the president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, the highest decision-making body of 13 Hindu monastic orders, and mahant (chief priest) of the Bade Hanuman Temple in Prayagraj -- was found hanging from a ceiling fan in his room in the Baghambari Gaddi Math in Prayagraj on Monday evening.A purported suicide note by the seer named his disciple and the Math’s de-facto number 2 till recently, Anand Giri, Bade Hanuman Temple priest Aadya Tiwari, and his son Sandeep Tiwari of harassing him, said police. Anand Giri and Tiwari were sent to 14-day of judicial custody on Wednesday. “On the instructions of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, a probe by the CBI has been recommended in the incident pertaining to the sad death of chairman of Akhara Parishad chief Mahant Narendra Giri,” the state home department tweeted in Hindi.On Tuesday, Adityanath had promised to spare no culprits in the case. A formal notification in this regard is likely to be issued by the Centre in a day or two, people familiar with the development said.An 18-member special investigation team of Uttar Pradesh Police is already probing the case. The federal agency is expected to examine the post mortem report, crime scene and take assistance of forensic experts from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) after formally taking over the probe. The post-mortem examination of the seer was conducted by a panel of five doctors -- two from Motilal Nehru Medical College and three from the chief minister’s office -- at SRN hospital inPrayagraj. No injury marks were reportedly found on the body and the viscera was preserved after the examination, said people aware of developments. The report suggested death due to asphyxiation, said police officials. The entire procedure, which was conducted for over two hours, was videographed and the report handed over to authorities in a sealed envelope, they added. Earlier in the day, Prayagraj chief judicial magistrate Harendra Kumar sent Anand Giri and Aadya Tiwari to 14 days’ judicial custody while a third accused -- Tiwari’s son Sandeep -- was arrested.A case under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) was lodged against Anand Giri at Georgetown police station on a complaint by Pawan Maharaj, a staffer at the math who reported the note to the authorities. While the FIR initially did not include Tiwari’s name, it was later added on the basis of the purported suicide note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-govt-recommends-cbi-probe-into-death-of-akhara-parishad-chief-narendra-giri-101632342519090.html

The girls, Shreya Banik, 12, and Anuskha Nandy, 13, were making their way through a waterlogged street when the accident happened. They were declared dead on arrival at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, local police said. The girls, both of whom were class 6 students, were going to their private tutor. Krishna Banik, an eyewitness, told the local media that the girls tried to grab the post to save themselves from the water splashed by passing vehicles. Surajit Roychaudhury, a coordinator of the South Dum Dum Municipality said, “We rushed to the spot on hearing about the incident. The electrical lines were disconnected. Water has accumulated in the area because Bagjola canal, the main outlet in this area, is overflowing.” Three members of a family died due to electrocution inside their inundated home in the North 24 Parganas district on Monday. Between Monday and Tuesday, Kolkata and its adjoining areas experienced more rainfall than what had been recorded in the last 14 years. Though rainfall has been very light since then, numerous streets in the state capital and the nearby townships are still inundated. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is contesting the September 30 assembly bypoll at Kolkata’s Bhawanipore constituency, had to cancel her campaign in the Ekbalpore area on Tuesday because of waterlogging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-minor-girls-electrocuted-on-waterlogged-road-near-kolkata-101632341679126.html
23-09-2021||India||Why do farm concerns not get as much political attention as they should?||An analysis of the report of the latest Situation Assessment Survey (SAS), the findings of which were first reported on September 11, offers an insight into the reasons for the problems in the agriculture sector not finding a resonance in politics.A large majority of the population at the bottom of the social hierarchy in India does not have significant stakes in agriculture. The social groups, who are still invested in farming, are also the ones who are more successful in getting out of villages. This creates a political vacuum for a social-economic class that can build pressure for an effective policy framework to rescue Indian agriculture from its current crisis. Even those who are left in villages are sidetracked by other issues and unlikely to make efforts to develop a genuine farmers’ solidarity.Here are four charts which explain this argument in detail.The socially downtrodden are over-represented in rural IndiaBR Ambedkar, India’s most important social reformer and also the father of the Indian Constitution, wanted Dalits or the Scheduled Castes (SC) to get out of villages. “The love of the intellectual Indian for the village community is of course infinite, if not pathetic... What is a village but a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow-mindedness and communalism?” Ambedkar wrote.Ambedkar’s was not a subjective rant against village life, something Mahatma Gandhi, the tallest leader of the Indian freedom movement always eulogised. Dalits hardly owned any land in the village and during Ambedkar’s time, they were mostly bonded labourers for the upper caste “oppressors”. Ironical as it is, it is the upper castes which took Ambedkar’s lesson seriously and started moving out of villages. A comparison of estimated population shares of SC, scheduled tribes (ST), other backward classes (OBC), and others, shows that SCs and STs are significantly over-represented in India’s villages.Population share of SC-ST-OBC and others in rural and urban India

He was declared brought dead at the hospital. Superintendent of police, Ranchi (rural), Naushad Alam said, “The incident occurred around 7pm. It is too early to say anything about people behind the crime. We are completing the legal formalities and investigating the case.”The incident triggered a sharp attack from the opposition BJP, which accused the chief minister Hemant Soren of failing to control the law and order situation.Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda rushed to the hospital where the victim was taken after the incident.“His death is due to complete administrative failure. He had a threat to his life as he was attacked in past as well about which the administration was aware. He even applied for an arms license. The administration neither provided him security nor issued the arms license.” Munda said.The Union minister demanded that Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren order a probe to establish the lapses.Former chief minister and BJP national vice president Raghubar Das also targeted the Soren government, saying “no section of society are safe in the current regime, be it tribals or women”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-bjp-leader-jitram-munda-shot-dead-on-outskirts-of-ranchi-101632340658892.html
23-09-2021||India||Bhupesh Baghel vs TS Singh Deo in the spotlight after FIR against Congress leader||RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh Police have registered a criminal case against state Congress secretary Pankaj Singh, known to be one of health minister TS Singh Deo’s closest aides for allegedly manhandling and abusing a medical worker in a hospital in Bilaspur. But the First Information Report (FIR) put the focus back on the leadership struggle in Chhattisgarh after Bilaspur MLA Shailesh Pandey asked if Pankaj Singh was targeted for being close to the health minister.“Police are not able to explain why they have booked Singh. Police are saying that the instructions for FIR were given by senior officials hence... I asked the police, are they registering cases against us because we are close to Singh Deo?… Last year I was also booked by police for just helping the poor and now Singh was targeted...These questions should be answered,” said Shailesh Pandey, who is also known to be close to Singh Deo, said.On Tuesday, the Congress MLA reached the police station along with his supporters to protest the police move.Health minister Singh Deo could not be reached even after repeated attempts.Also Read: The inside story of the Bhupesh Baghel-TS Singh Deo battle in ChhattisgarhBhupesh Baghel and Singh Deo have been locked in a tussle for the chief minister’s chair in Chhattisgarh that brought them to Delhi last month for meetings with top Congress leaders.On August 28, emerging after a long meeting with the Congress high command on suggestions that he should move aside because of a reported two and a half year power-sharing agreement with colleague Singh Deo, Bhupesh Baghel seemed to have bought some time. He said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi would visit the state the next week, especially Bastar, to see for himself the work that was being done. The next day, when Singh Deo returned, he said that he had spoken to the leadership too and they had kept a “decision safe”.Also Read: In Chhattisgarh, the Congress leadership impasse refuses to endIn December 2018, in the aftermath of a dominant Congress performance where the party won 68 of 90 seats, friction between Bhupesh Baghel and TS Singh Deo meant that Tamradhwaj Sahu, now home minister, initially emerged as the frontrunner for chief minister, but pushed by the idea that a third leader would take the top position, Baghel and Singh Deo, along with Punia and Gandhi, reportedly arrived at a power-sharing arrangement.The trigger for the Congress MLA’s swipe at Bhupesh Baghel is an incident at Bilaspur hospital on September 18, when Pankaj Singh visited the government-run Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences (CIMS), Bilaspur, after receiving a call from a patient. Superintendent of Police, Bilaspur, Deepak Jha said they received a complaint on September 19 regarding the incident the previous day. “A patient had come for a radiology examination at CIMS and for some reason the machine was dysfunctional. Since, there was a delay due to the technical glitch, the patient called Pankaj Singh, who reached the hospital. Singh got irritated with the delay and manhandled and abused the radiographer, Tula Tande. The next day, Tande reached police and lodged a complaint” said the Bilaspur SP said.Police said that they have investigated the case and retrieved CCTV footage from the hospital and subsequently registered a case on Monday.“We have booked Singh under the section 186 IPC (obstruction in government work), section 353 (criminal assault on a govt employee on duty) and section 3 of Chhattisgarh Medical Service Persons and Medical Service Institutions Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property Act 2010,” the Bilaspur district police chief said, adding that the preliminary stage of investigation is complete and police will proceed for Singh’s arrest based on the final findings of the investigation.Congress’s state communication head, Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said the matter should not be politicised as it is a case of allegedly breaking the law, a message aimed at his own party.“We are living in a state where even CM’s father was booked by the police because he had given a statement which is against a particular community. The arrest of Singh should not be politicised and let the law take its own course,” said Trivedi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupesh-baghel-vs-ts-singh-deo-in-the-spotlight-after-fir-against-congress-leader-101632339699071.html
23-09-2021||India||UP govt recommends CBI probe into Giri’s death||Uttar Pradesh recommended a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the death of influential Hindu seer Narendra Giri on Wednesday night, hours after he was laid to rest in Prayagraj and a post-mortem report suggested that the holy man may have died by asphyxiation.Giri — the president of the Akhara Parishad, the highest decision-making body of 13 Hindu monastic orders, and mahant (chief priest) of the Bade Hanuman Temple in Prayagraj -- was found hanging from a ceiling fan in his room in the Baghambari Gaddi Math in Prayagraj on Monday.A purported suicide note by the seer named his disciple and the Math’s de-facto number 2 till recently, Anand Giri, Bade Hanuman Temple priest Aadya Tiwari, and his son Sandeep Tiwari of harassing him, said police. Anand Giri and Tiwari were sent to 14-days of judicial custody on Wednesday.“On the instructions of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, a probe by the CBI has been recommended in the incident pertaining to the sad death of chairman of Akhara Parishad chief Mahant Narendra Giri,” the state home department tweeted.On Tuesday, the CM promised to not spare the culprits.A formal notification in this regard is likely to be issued by the Centre soon, people familiar with the development said.The federal agency is expected to examine the post mortem report, crime scene and take assistance of forensic experts from Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL).The post-mortem examination of the seer was conducted by a panel of five doctors -- two from Motilal Nehru Medical College and three from the chief minister’s office -- at SRN hospital. No injury marks were reportedly found on the body and the viscera was preserved, said people aware of developments. The report suggested death due to asphyxiation, said police officials.The entire procedure was videographed and the report handed over to authorities in a sealed envelope, they added.Earlier in the day, Prayagraj chief judicial magistrate Harendra Kumar sent Anand Giri and Aadya Tiwari to 14 days’ judicial custody while a third accused -- Tiwari’s son Sandeep -- was arrested. A case under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) was lodged against Anand Giri at Georgetown police station on a complaint by Pawan Maharaj, a staffer at the math who reported the note to the authorities. While the FIR initially did not include Tiwari’s name, it was later added on the basis of the purported suicide note in which he was also accused of harassing the top priest. The duo were arrested on Tuesday.Giri was laid to rest at Baghambari Math later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-recommends-cbi-probe-into-giri-s-death-101632339299633.html

Devaraju, who lives in K R Puram, was arrested on the basis of a complaint by the woman at Jeevan Bhima Nagar police station in east Bengaluru.The incident, police said, took place between 4 am and 5 am when the woman was returning home from a friend’s house. The woman alleged that she had fallen asleep when the driver stopped the cab away from her house and sexually assaulted her. “He then fled from the location,” a police official said, seeking anonymity. Police said the woman managed to snatch the accused’s phone which helped the cops to track him. The accused, police said, is a resident of Andhra Pradesh and was employed with a private cab aggregator for the past two years. Additional commissioner of police, (East) S Murugan said a case under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code was registered and the woman will be sent for medical examination.

23-09-2021||India||476 calls made by satellite phones in state since 2020, say Karnataka police||A day after Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra said that intelligence agencies have tracked 476 calls made by satellite phones in the state since 2020, police on Wednesday said that these calls were traced to foreign countries, but refused to divulge the specifics of these calls. They, however, said their teams are on the ground collecting information. On Tuesday, responding to a Zero Hour question raised by former Congress minister UT Khader, the home minister had said: “After the 2011 Mumbai terror attacks, the usage of satellite phones is prohibited on Indian waters by the Directorate General of Shipping. There were 256 instances of satellite phone usage in 2020 and 220 so far this year in the coastal region.” He added that the state and central agencies, including the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), are keeping a close watch on the use of satellite phones. Such phone connects to satellites, unlike the normal cell phone which is connected to terrestrial mobile sites. They bypass the local telecom system which means the agencies are unable to track the conversation. “Even though it is difficult, we have our ways of tackling them. Some of the calls may come from international shipping and whatever has emerged from the state, we are tracking them,” said a senior intelligence official. This comes after the city police arrested a native of Rajasthan, Jitendra Singh, for allegedly sharing sensitive information about the Indian army with Pakistan’s Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI). The City Crime Branch (CCB) in a joint operation with the Military Intelligence had arrested the accused on Monday. The accused allegedly took videos and photos of army bases, firing ranges, and movement of the Indian army and shared them with ISI agents. He wore an Indian army uniform while taking photos and videos. Cops are also investigating his purpose of visiting Bengaluru. The police have retrieved his mobile data and are tracking his contacts. On September 1, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had said that police had received inputs about possible terrorist activity on the coasts of Kerala and Karnataka and added the state administration is keeping a watch for any suspicious activity in the coastal and adjoining forest areas. “I can’t discuss some issues openly, but I want to tell you that Karnataka Police along with NIA is keeping a strict vigil on any anti-national activity in coastal and adjoining forest areas. NIA had also picked up a person who was involved in such activities. We have also issued a high alert in coastal areas,” said the chief minister. It was then claimed by the police that a central Intelligence report had warned that terrorists could infiltrate from the coastal districts of the state. The fresh alert comes days after the chief minister’s statement. So far, 15 Islamic State sympathizers have been arrested from Karnataka. The latest arrests were reported on August 11, when the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Zufri Jawhar Damudi from Karnataka’s Bhatkal town in connection with terror activities of a group propagating the violent ideology of the Islamic State (IS). A day before that NIA had arrested Ammar Abdul Rahman of Mangalore and Shankar Venkatesh Perumal of Bengaluru in connection with the case after conducting simultaneous searches in Jammu and Kashmir and Karnataka. NIA has arrested that 130 IS sympathizers from across India between 2014 and 2021. According to the NIA list at the time, a maximum of 33 people have been arrested from Tamil Nadu, followed by Kerala (24), Uttar Pradesh (19), Karnataka (15) Telangana (14), and Maharashtra (12) While answering a question regarding ‘reports of the presence of Islamic terrorists in southern states of India’, during the monsoon session in September 2020, the Union ministry of home affairs told parliament: “Some instances of individuals from different states, including the southern states, having joined Islamic State (IS) have come to the notice of Central and state security agencies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/476-calls-made-by-satellite-phones-in-state-since-2020-say-karnataka-police-101632337958708.html
23-09-2021||India||Karnataka high court upholds arms act exemption to Kodavas, Jamma land holders||The Karnataka high court on Wednesday upheld the constitutional validity of the Union government’s notification that grants exemption to members of the Kodava community and Jamma tenure land holders in the coffee growing region of Kodagu, from the requirement to obtain a licence to carry and possess firearms. A division bench of acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum heard the matter which was first filed on June 30 by 41-year-old Captain (Retd) Chethan YK, also a resident of Kodagu, who sought to know why only one race was given this exemption. Sajjan Poovayya, senior counsel who appeared for the Bengaluru Kodava Samaj said that the exemption was made from the British colonial era which permitted members of this race and those who hold Jamma land, that includes people from other communities, be exempted from obtaining a licence. Poovayya said that there are 40-50 exemptions in the Arms Act and one of them is for the Kodava race whose exemption was called into questioning by the HC in 2017 after the Centre’s review. The Centre, in 2019, brought a fresh and identical exemption with a periodical review from 2019-29 and then review it every 10 years. “But that exemption again as I said is not a blanket ban as you have to go through a process of police verification, you have to indicate there is a limitation on the number of weapons in each household, etc, etc,” Poovayya said. The Kodavas, who are from Kodagu in Karnataka, about 225 kms from Bengaluru, have a distinct culture in terms of their language, attire and bear weapons which is part of their ethnic identity. Several members of this community have made a name for themselves in the armed forces as well as in the field of sports with many representing India in games like hockey and other areas. Field Marshal KM Cariappa and General KS Thimmaiah are some of the most notable who belong to this community. The respondents argued that the weapon is part of its religious and cultural identity and supported the arguments under Article 25 and 26 that the gun is both a cultural and religious symbolism from them. Gagan Ganapathy, the advocate on record for one of the defendants said that there is no antecedents to suggest the misuse of the weapon and also that the Kodavas are a martial race. “That order states that there is nothing unconstitutional about it (exemption) and does not violate Article 14,” Ganapathy said. He added that the court observed that the notification was in accordance with law and also that from time immemorial the Kodavas were a martial race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-high-court-upholds-arms-act-exemption-to-kodavas-jamma-land-holders-101632337904725.html
23-09-2021||India||Will complete Bengaluru Metro Ph 2 project by 2024: CM Bommai||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday reiterated that the Phase-II of the Bengaluru Metro should be completed by 2024, a year ahead of the original deadline, so as to ensure that the project becomes a “lifeline” for the residents of India’s IT capital. After witnessing the completion of the 885 meter underground stretch, Bommai told reporters that the subsequent reaches or stages of the Metro would be completed much faster. “Metro is a prominent plan for Bengaluru . When Metro second phase (Phase-II) is completed, then it would mean another 56 kms (of metro lines),” he said. The statement comes even as the Metro project continue to witness long delays, forcing over 12 million residents of the city to depend on private transport for commuting. According to the Metro chief, Anjum Parvez, the average tunneling per day per machine is around 4 meters with wire-duct is double this length. The Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has managed to complete just around 60 kms in the last 13 years, averaging around 4 kms per year, Hindustan Times had reported in February. “The first phase was a little difficult because it was new,” Bommai said, adding that the learnings from this phase would help quicken the other stages and make it operational. The chief minister said that the speedy completion of the Metro would reduce the load on the roads. With over 9.4 million vehicles, poor quality of roads, dug up streets and other basic infrastructure problems, Bengaluru’s infamous traffic became a global phenomena when it was adjudged to have the world’s worst traffic, according to a 2019 report by Netherlands-based TomTom. Each year due the delay, Metro officials said, would add to at least a 5% escalation in project cost. Bommai has also asked officials to draw up plans to more than double the existing metro line plan to 317 kms with the Phase-III operations. Metro is a major project undertaken in almost all big urban centres across the country. According to the Union government, about 730 kms of Metro lines are operational in 18 different cities and another 1,049 kms of Metro rail / RRTS projects are under construction. A Metro line is also being constructed till Bengaluru international airport, about 40 kms away from the city and is scheduled to be completed in 2025. Bommai said that the government wants to take the Metro till the airport and that the Centre has shown a lot of interest and has provided financial support as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-complete-bengaluru-metro-ph-2-project-by-2024-cm-bommai-101632337838779.html
23-09-2021||India||Political slugfest over nod to Chanakya University Bill||The Karnataka Congress on Wednesday lashed out at the Basavaraj Bommai government and its decision to deviate land acquired for industrial purposes to an organization having close links with the Sangh Parivar for the setting up a university. Claiming that the allocation was a “misuse of power” that has caused loss to the exchequer and the people of the state, former chief minister and leader of the opposition Siddaramaiah on Wednesday said, “The government by misusing its power took a decision in the Cabinet meeting to allot 116 acres and 16 guntas of land which was acquired for defence industry and compensation of ₹1.50 crore per acre. At this rate, the land (116.16 acres) comes up to ₹175 crore. He added that this land was given to the Centre for Educational and Social Studies (CESS) to set up Chanakya University for ₹50 crore. Siddaramaiah further alleged that all the members of this university have close ties with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the BJP, and are “Manuwadi’s”. @BJP4Karnataka is gifting highly priced land to RSS agency at cheaper price. It is unfortunate that government has flouted all the rules to set up University & passed a Bill to favour RSS mouthpiece which does not have any experience of running educational institution,” Siddaramaiah said on Twitter. The Karnataka legislative council passed the Bill on Wednesday amid absolute commotion in the Upper House with the Congress continuing to oppose it. On Tuesday, the government had hurriedly passed the Chanakya University Bill in the Lower House during the ongoing monsoon session of the state legislature. The Congress accused the BJP of deviating land acquired for the Aerospace Park near Devanahalli, near Bengaluru Airport, for a private university which does not even have the eligibility. “The University shall be a multi-disciplinary institution committed unflinchingly to the service of society through excellence in teaching, development of knowledge and direct contributions to the world of practice. The concerns of India and Indian knowledge systems will deeply inform all the knowledge endeavors of the University including teaching , research and practice Higher Education in Sciences, Engineering and Technology, Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, Commerce, Management, Medicine, Health Sciences, Pharmacy, etc,” according to the Bill. The university is proposed to be set up by Bengaluru-based Centre for Educational and Social Studies (CESS), an initiative by an organization called the Vidyarthi Shikshana Seva Trust and is headed by Dr. MK Sridhar, who has a doctorate in philosophy, worked in various colleges and has served as the member secretary of the Karnataka Knowledge Commission. CESS did not respond to queries by mail nor responded to calls made by Hindustan Times. The CESS was established in 2006 and, on its website, claims to be “engaged in myriad activities in the domain of education for over a decade and positioned itself to meet the current challenges in the society keeping education as a focal point.” Taking a dig at the assembly speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri for passing the bill, Siddaramaiah said, “The speaker gave importance and pushed this up even though there were 8 other bills. The speaker should be impartial, above politics and political parties. Yesterday, the way he acted did not seem impartial.” The speaker had praised the government and encouraged more such organisations that promote and teach “Indian culture” to prevent students and the educational system from getting “westernised”. DK Shivakumar, the Karnataka Congress president, also the promoter of an educational institution, said that any college that needs to be in existence for at least five years to be eligible to apply for the status of a university. “Why are you acquiring land for some other purpose and why are you deviating this. You are setting a very bad precedent. They have no qualification or eligibility and this is a misuse of power to promote RSS,” Shivakumar said. The Congress president also said that each acre on the National Highway near the airport costs around ₹10 crore per acre and 116 acres have been given for a paltry ₹50 crore. The Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) acquired land here to accommodate the Aerospace and Defence Park which has not been the biggest success for the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-slugfest-over-nod-to-chanakya-university-bill-101632337778767.html
23-09-2021||India||Police officers still don’t know how to speak politely, says Kerala high court||Disapproving of a police report which said there were no lapses on the part of one of its officers who allegedly used abusive language against a doctor, the Kerala high court on Wednesday said officers of the force “don’t know how to speak politely”.“Your police officers still don’t know how to speak politely,” the court said to the state government.The observation by Justice Devan Ramachandran came during the hearing of a plea by a doctor, claiming abusive language was used against him by police officers when they stopped his vehicle.The court said that a report by the Assistant Commissioner of Police of Kollam with regard to the incident stated that there were “no serious lapses” on the part of the officer concerned, but it did not explain how he came to that conclusion.“I have gone through the statement filed by the ACP, Kollam. Not satisfied by the contents thereof,” the judge said and asked “are only policemen allowed to live in the country?””He (petitioner) is a doctor, a respectable person. He states that abusive language has been used against him. Are you (police) saying use of disrespectful language (words like ‘da’) against a doctor requires no enquiry?” the court asked.It said that the state police chief, on the high court’s orders, has issued directions not to use such language, but the ACP’s report does not deal with the allegation of use of abusive language by the officer concerned.The court directed the Kollam ACP to “make a proper enquiry” into the allegation by the petitioner and file an action taken report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-officers-still-don-t-know-how-to-speak-politely-says-kerala-high-court-101632337598683.html

The Bishop’s statement triggered a war of words between religious communities and opposition parties urged the government to call an all-party meeting. “How can we call an all-party meeting on such non-issues? Both are non-existent. We don’t want to call a meeting on non-existent issues. Some people are trying to exploit the situation by whipping them up, and we have to isolate them first,” the chief minister said, reeling out statistics. He stated the government has information about 100 people who joined the Islamic State (IS) till 2019 of Kerala origin?, out of these, 72 slipped out from countries (mainly middle-east) where they were working.“Out of 72, 71 are Muslims. And some of the people who went to IS-held areas from north Kerala were converted much earlier. There are no complaints that some women were converted and forcibly taken to war-torn areas,” he said. Even the Union government and several courts made it clear that love jihad and narcotic jihad practices never existed, Vijayan said. He said after 21 people left from north Kerala in 2016, the special branch of police started several re-radicalisation camps to bring youngsters, who were attracted to some extremist forces, to the mainstream. He reiterated that social evil like narcotics has no religion and it is highly improper to put into the account of a particular religion. He said, in 2020, around 4,941 cases were registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, and 5,422 people were arrested in connection with them. “Out of these, Hindus were 2,700 (49.80 %), Muslims 1,869 (34.47%) and 853 (15. 73%) belong to Christianity. It shows offenders belonged to all religions. Such crimes are not religion-based. There are no unusual numbers from any particular community either,” the CM said, adding that some forces were trying to fish in troubled waters, and their attempts will remain a daydream. He said strict action will be taken against those who vitiate the communal fabric of the state. When asked whether any action will be taken against the Bishop he said he had already made it clear no case will be registered against him. He criticised the opposition Congress and BJP for exploiting the issue for some political gains. (CAN WE PUT THIS IN A QUOTE?)Opposition leaders are yet to react to the CM’s statement. Addressing a church ceremony in Kottayam on Sept 9, the Bishop said that Catholic girls and youth were targeted by it. “Wherever arms are not used, narcotic drugs are being used, and Catholic girls turn victims. Some groups are functioning in the state to support them. To understand this, one needs to analyse how women from other religions landed in the Islamic State camps,” he said, referring to the trip of 21 people, including five converts to Islam, from north Kerala to Afghanistan in 2016. Meanwhile, Vijayan welcomed the decision to pay compensation to Covid-19 victims but said it is quite unfair states will have to take the whole responsibility. “We all know the poor economic condition of states after pandemic set in. We hope the Centre will adequately compensate states,” he said, adding virus cases were dipping slowly. On Wednesday, the state reported 19,675 cases Wednesday with a test positivity rate of 16.45 after 119,594 tests. It also logged 142 deaths, and the toll crossed 24,000 (24,039).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-require-all-party-meet-says-kerala-cm-vijayan-in-narcotic-jihad-row-101632337478715.html
23-09-2021||India||Actor Tarun appears before ED in 2017 drugs case||Actor Tarun appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) here on Wednesday as part of a money laundering probe in connection with a high-end drugs racket that was busted in the city in 2017.He is one of the 10 Telugu film industry (Tollywood) personalities who were summoned by the ED.Since August 31 this year noted filmmaker Puri Jagannadh, actresses Charmee Kaur, Rakul Preet Singh and Mumaith Khan, actors Nandu, Rana Daggubati, Ravi Teja, P Navdeep and Tanish have so far appeared before the central agency.On July 2, 2017 the Telangana’s Prohibition and Excise department, had busted the drug racket by arresting a three-member gang. Subsequently, several cases related to the drug trafficking were registered and over 20 people were arrested including a US citizen, who was a former aerospace engineer and had worked with the NASA, a Dutch national, a South African national besides seven B.Tech degree holders employed with multi-national companies here.The names of some Tollywood personalities surfaced during the interrogation of persons arrested in connection with the racket.A Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Prohibition and Excise department, as part of its investigation had also probed the alleged drug-links with Tollywood, and had then questioned 11 people connected to the Telugu film industry.The ED summoned the Tollywood personalities who were among those questioned by SIT and they were asked to appear before it.The racket supplied high-end drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), and it is suspected that people from the film industry, employees of MNCs and college students were among their customers.Orders were placed through the ‘Darknet’ (secretive websites or online networks) and the drugs were delivered by courier including from overseas, the investigators had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-tarun-appears-before-ed-in-2017-drugs-case-101632337419738.html
23-09-2021||India||Kerala high court questions fixed rates for post Covid treatment in Kerala||When deaths even after 30 days of a person turning negative for coronavirus is treated as a COVID death, then by the same rationale treatment for post-Covid complications should also be reckoned as part of corona care was the prima facie view expressed by the Kerala High Court on Wednesday.A bench of Justices Devan Ramachandran and Kauser Edappagath expressed the view while directing the state government to clarify why it issued the August 16 order by which treatment charges were fixed for post-Covid complications for those above poverty line.“Government must clarify why the order dated August 16, 2021 was issued, particularly when, as of now, deaths which occur 30 days after a person turns negative for Covid-19 is also accounted as a Covid death.“On a parallel reasoning, treatment which goes on after a person turns negative, must, prima facie, be also reckoned as a Covid treatment,” the bench said and asked government pleader S Kannan to seek instruction on the issue.The query by the court came after perusing a memo filed by the state government, through Kannan, stating therein that Covid infection and complications due to it are different from disease management point of view.The government further said that “to reduce the financial burden on the public due to the Covid-19 pandemic and assist the financial constraints of the population, the rates at which the treatment for post Covid syndrome, multi-system inflammatory syndrome and Covid associated mucormycosis demands to be fixed”.The rate fixation of these treatments would also ensure that the private hospitals in the state do not charge exorbitant rates from such patients, the government has said in the memo.It has also said that cost of treatment for persons above the poverty line (APL) for any ailment has to be borne by the patients always, but considering the very high cost of treatment of complications due to Covid, treatment has to be made available to APL category patients at reasonable costs.It has further stated before the court that poor and financially constrained people can avail free treatment for post Covid complications at public hospitals.The court was hearing a review petition filed by the Kerala Private Hospitals Association in relation to the Covid treatment charges fixed by the state for treatment of coronavirus in private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-questions-fixed-rates-for-post-covid-treatment-in-kerala-101632337418731.html
23-09-2021||India||Full inoculation or Covid -ve report now mandatory to enter Tirumala||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, which manages the Lord Venkateshwara temple in Tirumala, Chittoor, on Wednesday made it mandatory for all pilgrims to produce a complete Covid vaccine certification or RT-PCR Covid negative test report, not older than three days, before entering the temple premises, chairman YV Subba Reddy said in a statement. The decision was taken keeping in view the health security of the devotees coming from all parts of the country, he said. “Devotees coming with online special entry tickets or slotted Sarva darshan (SSD) tokens (issued to pilgrims to have free darshan of Lord) should possess either 2-dose vaccination certificate or come with Covid-19 negative test report, which they have taken three days before reporting on the allotted day of the darshan,” Reddy said in the statement.He urged all the devotees to strictly follow the Covid-19 guidelines for their benefit as well the others. While the Tirumala temple has remained open even during the second wave of the Covid pandemic, it restricted the entry only for the pilgrims who purchased the ₹300 tickets for darshan and the VIPs.The TTD resumed free darshan at Tirumala temple from September 9, for the sake of devotees, with certain restrictions. To start with, only 2,000 devotees, that too only from Chittoor district, were allowed in a day under the SSD token system introduced at the ticket counters at Alipiri, the foothills of Tirumala.However, Subba Reddy announced on Wednesday that the issuance of SSD tokens for common pilgrims at the off-line counters at Alipiri would be stopped from September 26 to prevent the spread of the Covid-19. “As the overcrowding at SSD token issue centres earlier had allegedly become a source of the spread of Covid-19, the TTD has decided to do away with it and take up issuance of tokens only online,” the TTD chairman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/full-inoculation-or-covid-ve-report-now-mandatory-to-enter-tirumala-101632337360266.html
23-09-2021||India||Cong demands govt action in Amazon, Mundra drug haul issues||New Delhi: The Congress on Wednesday demanded a criminal action to be initiated against Amazon for “bribery” and sought a special commission, headed by Supreme Court judges, to look into the ₹21,000 crore heroin consignment seized at Gujarat’s Mundra port. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “India’s Law Ministry’s Annual Budget is ₹1,100 crores. How can a company’s budget be almost ₹9,000 crores in legal fees? It has now come out that this was money being given as bribe.” “So the question is very simple, the so called alleged bribery of ₹8,546 crore was being given to whom in Modi Government, who received this money?” asked Surjewala. The Union government has received preliminary details of “abnormally” high legal expenditures by e-commerce giant Amazon India in two financial years (2018-19 and 2019-20), which amounts to ₹8,546 crore, two people aware of the development said, and added that the spends were being investigated. The company, however, said expenses categorised as legal, include fees for several professional consultancy services. “Will Prime Minister of India raise a demand from his US counterpart that criminal action be initiated in United States for alleged bribery against Amazon? Will Prime Minister of India answer that? Is this not a serious breach of National Security? And considering that Government has totally failed, should this matter not be investigated by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court of India?” Surjewala said. A similar demand has been made by Surjewala for an investigation into the biggest drug haul. “The second scandal is even more scaring, it is not India’s, but, the world’s biggest drug haul appears to have happened right here in our country,” referring to the recovery of 3000 kgs of heroin worth Rs.21,000 crores. “Why is it drug cartel prospering right under the nose of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah? Why has Mundra Port not been investigated? And considering that Narcotics Control Bureau, DRI, ED, CBI, IB, Home Ministry everybody was sleeping, how can the drugs than come in such a large quantity?” said Surjewal, demanding an investigation by a special commission of sitting judges of the Supreme Court of India and a special SIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-demands-govt-action-in-amazon-mundra-drug-haul-issues-101632337120877.html
23-09-2021||India||RN Ravi steps down as Centre’s interlocutor in peace talks after Naga groups object||New Delhi: The Centre’s interlocutor for Naga peace talks since 2014, RN Ravi, with whom Naga groups had refused to hold any discussions, on Wednesday stepped down from the post. A ministry of home affairs spokesperson said Ravi’s resignation was accepted with immediate effect.The development comes days after Ravi was moved as Governor of Tamil Nadu from Nagaland, where he held the post of Governor as well.Isak-Muivah-led National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM), while seeking his ouster, had claimed last year that Ravi misinterpreted the 2015 Framework Agreement between the Naga groups and the Centre and tried to manipulate it.In a statement issued in August last year, NSCN-IM said Ravi was creating hurdles in the final settlement of the Naga political issue.His removal on September 9 from Nagaland is being seen as a positive step towards finalising the peace deal, especially at a time when all the members of the Nagaland legislative assembly have agreed to come together to push for settlement and pave the way.“The trust deficit between Ravi and Naga groups had deepened so much in last two years that talks had not moved at all. The process has begun again,” said a government official.The biggest and oldest of the Naga rebel outfits, NSCN-IM had been in peace talks with the central government since 1997 and signed a Framework Agreement (FA) on August 3, 2015, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which was to be the basis for a final deal on the long-pending Naga issue.Though peace talks with NSCN-IM and other pro-talks rebel outfits (Naga National Political Groups-NNPGs) concluded in October 2019, a formal deal to end the decades-old Naga political problem is still awaited.Former Intelligence Bureau (IB) special director, Akshay Mishra, is currently handling the peace talks “unofficially”, but government officials familiar with the development said Mishra’s name as interlocutor will be made formal soon through a notification. Mishra has already been advising the Centre on the matters of north-east since his retirement in June this year.There are also indications that IB chief Aravind Kumar may join as an additional interlocutor for the Naga peace talks.Officials said Naga groups have so far appreciated the handling of the issue by Mishra.Assam chief minister and convener of North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), Himanta Biswa Sarma, and Nagaland CM, Neiphiu Rio, met key NSCN-IM leaders, including Th Muivah, on Tuesday to accelerate the peace process.“At Dimapur today, we held a discussion with NSCN(IM) representatives in presence of Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio about the ongoing peace talks with GoI (Government of India)... We are keen that the ongoing peace talks fructify into concrete results soon,” Sarma tweeted on Tuesday evening.The Naga peace talks were stalled in October 2019 over differences on issues related to the 2015 Framework Agreement, and NSCN-IM’s insistence on a separate Naga flag and constitution.Mishra, who will be in Nagaland till September 23, is scheduled to meet the working committee of seven Naga nationalist political groups (NNPGs) with whom the central government had signed an “agreed position” in 2017.Ravi didn’t respond to HT’s calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rn-ravi-steps-down-as-centre-s-interlocutor-in-peace-talks-after-naga-groups-object-101632336818630.html
23-09-2021||India||IMD alerts: Heavy rain to continue in 10 states due to cyclonic circulation till Sept 26||The monsoon seems to continue this year beyond the expected time limit with several states, including Gujarat, West Bengal and Maharashtra, either witnessing rise in water level of nearby rivers or waterlogging in vast areas. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has now made a forecast that the situation would continue for the next four days in all the three states and seven more regions.In its latest bulletin, the IMD said that a low pressure currently lies over southwest Jharkhand and the north of Chhattisgarh along with the cyclonic circulation. The low pressure is expected to weaken during the next 24 hours and move west-northwestwards as a “cyclonic circulation across north Chhattisgarh and north Madhya Pradesh” over the next three days.Furthermore, the IMD bulletin also stated that a cyclonic circulation lies over west Rajasthan and its neighbourhood at lower tropospheric levels and is likely to remain till September 24.Earlier in the day, visuals shared by news agency ANI showed villages in Waghodia tehsil of Vadodara city in Gujarat heavily waterlogged. People in the visuals were seen walking amid rainwater that reached their waist level. A similar situation was reported in Maharashtra’s Nashik where Godavari river’s water level went up owing to excessive rain.Gujarat: Villages got waterlogged in Waghodia tehsil of Vadodara owing to incessant rainfall in the region; visuals from earlier today pic.twitter.com/ITKzVjB3Y7Meanwhile, Kolkata – the capital of West Bengal — among several other districts and towns in the state, continues to face waterlogging with several parts of the city inundated due to constant rainfall activity. On Monday, the weather department noted that Kolkata received the highest rainfall in the past 14 years on a single day in September. Till 8.30am on Monday, counting from 24 hours before the time, the city received 142 mm rain – the highest since September 25, 2007.Here are the key IMD alerts for 10 states till September 26:1.     Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall is likely over Gangetic West Bengal and Odisha for the remaining part of September 22. The IMD bulletin added that a low-pressure area is likely to form over east-central Bay of Bengal around September 24 evening, which will possibly move west-northwestwards towards Odisha in the subsequent 48 hours. Under this influence, a fresh spell of heavy rainfall is expected over Odisha and its adjoining regions from September 25 onwards.2.     The IMD bulletin said that fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy downpours is expected over east Rajasthan and Gujarat till September 26.3.     Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls is expected over Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha and Madhya Pradesh till September 24, and over central Maharashtra, Goa, Konkan, and Marathwada till September 23. The rainfall activity in these regions will witness a reduction after tomorrow.4.     Uttarakhand will witness scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy downpour till September 26. A similar weather, the IMD bulletin forecasted, is expected over east Uttar Pradesh till September 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-to-continue-in-10-states-due-to-cyclonic-circulation-imd-101632336080539.html
23-09-2021||India||NIA to probe fake currency case in Bangladesh||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has registered a case over a sophisticated counterfeit Indian currency smuggling racket running out of Dhaka, laying the ground for the federal agency’s first probe in Bangladesh, people familiar with the development said.The fake currency operation in Dhaka is suspected to be controlled from Pakistan. The probe, a senior NIA official said, “has been taken up after noticing that a new module was involved in the transportation of very high quality fake Indian currency notes in the denomination of ₹500 and ₹2,000”. An NIA team will soon visit Dhaka to interrogate the suspects and find the entire network, the official said.A 2019 amendment in the NIA Act enables the agency to probe terrorist activities outside India if Indians or Indian interests abroad are targeted. The change in law was patterned on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s powers which empower the US agency to carry out investigations outside the United States.This will be NIA’s third probe abroad. Last year, the agency took up the investigation into the March 25, 2020 attack on a gurdwara in Kabul, in which 27 Sikh devotees including an Indian national were killed. Its second case was registered in December against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun led Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) for organising protests at Indian missions in various countries including the US, the UK, Germany, Canada, etc.An FIR recently registered at Paltan Model police station by the Dhaka Metropolitan Police in connection with the case has already been taken over by the NIA. The FIR was registered after five people, including two Pakistani nationals, were arrested in Dhaka with fake Indian currency of ₹46 lakh.A second NIA official said although India and Bangladesh have a joint task force mechanism to share real-time information on the fake currency smuggling, New Delhi decided to investigate the syndicate on its own to identify the handlers and unearth the larger network. Indian officials believe it will lead them to Islamabad. “The FICN (fake Indian currency notes) produced in Pakistan are sent to Bangladesh by air/sea and then smuggled to India via the porous border. It seems Pakistan is trying to perfect counterfeiting the new ₹500 and ₹2,000 denomination notes to destabilize the Indian economy,” said a counterterrorism official, requesting anonymity. He acknowledged that “there has been a gradual improvement in the quality of FICN being seized”.According to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, FICN worth ₹92 crore was detected and seized across India in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-to-probe-fake-currency-case-in-bangladesh-101632336575842.html
23-09-2021||India||Isro likely to miss 3 key missions despite reducing targets||Despite the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) reducing its launch target from 16 to five projects in 2021 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the agency is likely to miss some critical missions, according to people aware of the matter.The space agency was to launch two earth observation satellites, one navigation satellite, one purely scientific mission, and the first unmanned flight under the Gaganyaan mission as per its revised targets for the year.Two of the missions were to use the new small satellite launch vehicle in two development flights. Isro qualifies a launch vehicle after two successful development flights. The small satellite launch vehicle or SSLV will mostly be used for commercial launches, according to people aware of the matter.There have only been two launches this year – the purely commercial PSLV C-51 launch in February carrying Brazil’s earth observation satellite Amazonia-1 and the GSLV-F10 mission in August carrying an Indian earth observation satellite EOS-03 that failed.To be sure, the space agency has plans for three more missions before the end of the year, including the first development flight of the SSLV. The other two will use India’s workhorse PSLV to launch two earth observation satellites EOS-04 and EOS-06.“The three planned missions appear unlikely this year,” a senior scientist at the agency said on condition of anonymity.Ajey Lele, senior fellow at Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, said: “It is critical for Isro to quickly conduct the SSLV launches; they have been delayed for far too long. It will be a commercial satellite and some of the slots even in the development flight has been booked by foreign agencies. If the launches do not happen soon, they might move to other launch service providers and Isro will lose market.”The space agency will also miss the launch of the navigation satellite NVS-01 that is to replace one of the satellites in India’s own regional GPS-like system NAVigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC).The NVS-01 satellite is to replace the IRNSS-1G satellite that was launched in 2016 and has a mission life of 12 years. Among the still functioning satellites in the constellation, the earliest to be launched is IRNSS-1B launched in 2014 with a mission life of 10 years.“This is likely to be one of the satellites where the atomic clock malfunctioned,” said Lele. There was no confirmation from Isro. All three atomic clocks – one main and two back-ups – on the first satellite of the constellation IRNSS-1A failed, prompting the space agency to launch a replacement satellite IRNSS-1H (which failed) and IRNSS-1I (which is currently working). Officials from the space agency also confirmed that the failure of the atomic clock has affected more satellites.There was no official response from Isro on the matter.“The pandemic has hit the space agency hard, making it difficult to integrate components coming in from various parts of the country. These delays are important in terms of missions like NavIC that needs a constellation of satellites; if the entire system is not up and running we are not utilising the life-years of the other satellites. However, when it comes to purely scientific missions such as the Gaganyaan, the delay does not have much impact. In case of Adiya-L1 the only challenge is that most of the hardware was ready but it could not be launched. After AstroSat’s good data, many scientists are awaiting data from the solar mission,” said Dr SM Ahmed, head of central instruments laboratory at University of Hyderabad and formerly a scientist with the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre who worked on Chandrayaan-1 mission.“The pandemic has affected missions world over; US’ artemis mission is also behind schedule,” Dr Ahmed added.The NVS-01 replacement satellite was to be launched on board Isro’s Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle or GSLV, the same one that failed this August. Four of the fourteen GSLV missions so far have failed. In comparison, only two of the 53 PSLV missions have failed.The space agency had also targeted the first of the two unmanned flights under the Gaganyaan mission for 2021, but it is unlikely to happen this year.“There have been delays in most missions of Isro, there are several more tests that need to be done before even the unmanned mission. The space agency also needs to launch two relay satellites. Another much awaited mission of Isro is the solar mission Aditya-L1. The other scientific Isro missions have produced good data, and the scientific community is waiting for it,” said Lele.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-likely-to-miss-3-key-missions-despite-reducing-targets-101632336519718.html
23-09-2021||India||Padmanabhaswamy temple trust to face audit of 25 years: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: An administrative committee mandated to conduct a special audit of the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple in Kerala will also scrutinise the finances of the temple trust over a 25-year period from 1989-90 to 2013-14, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday, rejecting the trust’s contention that the top court’s verdict last year did not cover the trust. The three-judge bench comprising justices UU Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi also told the committee headed by the Thiruvananthapuram district judge to complete the audit within three months.“In the light of developments leading to the passing of judgment dated July 13, 2020, it is quite clear that the audit contemplated by said direction was not intended to be confined to the temple but was also with respect to Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple Trust (SPSTT),” the bench said on Wednesday.The court relied on two extracts from its 2020 judgment to turn down the trust’s request.Firstly, the report of senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, who as amicus curiae, produced a report recommending a special audit of not just the temple but the trust as well. It noted that the April 15, 2014 report of former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) Vinod Rai, specifically pointed out that the temple trust’s utilisation of income hadn’t been adequately established.Second, the bench also noted that senior advocate Arvind Datar, who appeared for the trust in proceedings leading to the 2020 verdict, agreed to the trust’s audit on May 5, 2015.The temple, located in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram, came under media glare in 2011 when a vast treasure was discovered in its vaults, known as “Kallara” in Malayalam. The vaults were opened pursuant to a May 2011 order of the apex court. It was estimated that the intrinsic value of the treasure in five of the six vaults which were opened amounted to more than ₹90,000 crore.In its petition objecting to the district committee’s move to audit its finances, the temple trust requested the court to give a finding that it should be declared as an independent entity to ensure that it does not come under the management of the administrative committee. The bench refrained from going into that aspect, saying, “This will require assessment of facts which analysis may appropriately be done by a court or an authority competent to go into that question after the special audit is conducted.”The administrative committee, which was also entrusted with the interim management of the temple and its properties, filed two reports before the top court indicating that the temple’s financial position was in a bad shape due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown last year. As there was no income during the lockdown, the committee dipped into the temple’s savings to meet routine expenses to cover money incurred on performing rituals, and paying salary, wages and pension of staffers.Senior advocate R Basant, who appeared for the committee, said the temple faced an “unprecedented crisis” as its income wasn’t not enough to meet its monthly expenses of ₹1.25 crore and sought the help from the temple trust and the government to tide over the situation.The July 2020 order was crucial for the running of the temple as it set aside a Kerala high court direction of 2011 allowing the state government to take over the temple. The Supreme Court held that the temple will be managed by the royal family and will enjoy shebaitship, the right to maintain and manage the temple and the deity. The administrative committee was told to manage the affairs of the temple as an interim measure.When the administrative committee decided on October 27, 2020 appoint an auditing firm to look into the temple and the trust’s finances, the trust refused to cooperate with the auditor and filed an application before the Supreme Court stating that the 1965 trust formed by then ruler of Travancore, Sree Chithira Thirunal Bala Rama Varma was not meant to oversee the puja and other rituals and had nothing to do with the day-to-day functioning of the temple.Datar, who appeared for the trust, submitted that rental income from some buildings was the trust’s primary source of income and the funds were spent towards upkeep of these buildings besides minor administrative expenses and offerings for the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/padmanabhaswamy-temple-trust-to-face-audit-of-25-years-supreme-court-101632336279192.html
23-09-2021||India||World Rhino Day: Assam burns rhino horns to bust myth on medicinal value||Nearly 2,500 rhino horns, which officials say was the world’s largest such stockpile, were burnt and destroyed in Assam’s Bokakhat on Wednesday to mark World Rhino Day and discourage the myths that have propelled poaching of the endangered pachyderms. About 2,479 horns weighing around 1300kg, which had been seized from poachers and illegal traders or recovered from dead rhinos in the state’s national parks and wildlife sanctuaries since 1979, were burnt in six large pyres at a stadium in Bokakhat, 240 km east of Guwahati. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, accompanied by several cabinet colleagues, lit the pyres remotely through drones. “Through this event, we want to convey to the world that...there is no medicinal value to them (rhino horns). We want to urge people not to kill these rare animals or buy their horns based on superstitions or myths. We should allow rhinos to live and grow naturally,” Sarma said. The chief minister said it was necessary not to sell the horns and add value to the illegal poaching industry. “Some are saying that instead of destroying the horns we should have sold them. But like the way we can’t sell seized drugs to earn revenue, the same way a government can’t earn money by selling rhino horns,” he said.He added that this may be the largest such pile to be destroyed. “In South Africa, they have burned seized rhino horns, but the quantity is not that large. I think today we are setting a world record,” Sarma said. Though there is no scientific basis, the demand for rhinoceros horns is born out of demand in some Asian countries such as China and Vietnam, where these are used to practice traditional medicine. Each horn, which is made up of keratin (found commonly in hair and nails), is valued over thousands of US dollars, driving the rampant killing of rhinos in Asia and Africa. At 71%, Assam is home to the world’s largest population of one-horned rhinoceros. According to a 2018 census, there are nearly 2,650 rhinos in the state with around 2,400 of them in the Kaziranga National Park. Rhinoceros are listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, as endangered animals and there is an international ban on trade of rhino horns under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 allows for destruction of wildlife parts (including rhino horn) under Section 39 (3). On September 16, the Assam cabinet had approved destruction of the horns kept in treasuries. While 2,479 horns were destroyed in Assam on Wednesday, 50 more associated with pending court cases will be kept in state treasuries and 94 others will be preserved for exhibition or educational purposes. The state government said it will set up a natural history museum near the Kaziranga national park to keep the preserved pieces. Before destroying them on Wednesday, experts verified the horns using scientific methods at the 12 treasuries where they were kept. Each horn was cleaned, weighed, photographed, labelled with a unique barcode, DNA samples extracted, and packed and sealed again in the presence of several witnesses. Of the total 2,623 horns in state treasuries, 15 were of African rhinos (which have two horns) and 21 were found to be fake. “This is a rare event... the horns were verified in a very transparent manner before destroying them. We also want to convey a stern message to poachers not to dare target another rhino in Assam,” forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya said at the event on Wednesday. In recent years, the state government has taken measures to clamp down on poaching, including arming forest personnel with sophisticated weapons and increasing surveillance using drones. The measures have helped greater one-horned rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis) move up from the ”endangered” to ”vulnerable” category in IUCN’s red list of threatened species. According to government figures, the number of rhinos in Assam has risen by nearly 1,000 from 1,672 in 1999 to 2,605 in 2018.“Scientifically, rhino horns don’t have any value, but they have a price in some markets based on superstitions about its medicinal properties. If we preserve them, it will convey the message that we believe in such superstitions. It’s good that the horns stored in Assam are being destroyed,” Rathin Barman, joint director, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) said. “I congratulate the Assam government on the decision to burn the rhino horns and send the message that they don’t have any medicinal value. The horn looks best on a living animal and is not suited for any other purpose,” said Bibhab Talukdar, chief executive officer (CEO) of Aaranyak, a wildlife non-governmental organisation (NGO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-rhino-day-assam-burns-rhino-horns-to-bust-myth-on-medicinal-value-101632335918823.html
23-09-2021||India||Supply chains for vaccine raw materials must be kept open to hike production: PM Modi||The supply chains for Covid-19 vaccine raw materials must be kept open so that India can increase production and resume vaccine supplies to other countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a virtual Covid-19 summit on Wednesday. At the same time, international travel should become easier through mutual recognition of vaccine certificates so that the world can cope with the pandemic’s economic impacts, Modi said while addressing the summit called by US President Joe Biden. In his remarks at the opening of the summit convened on the margins of the UN General Assembly, Biden announced the donation of another 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine to low and middle income countries, taking total US commitments to more than 1.1 billion shots. Modi noted the pandemic has resulted in “unprecedented disruption and it is not yet over”. Biden’s initiative is timely and welcome as much of the world is yet to be vaccinated, he said. “As newer Indian vaccines get developed, we are also ramping up production capacity of existing vaccines. As our production increases, we will be able to resume vaccine supply to others too. For this, the supply chains of raw materials must be kept open,” he said. India is working with partners in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad to leverage the country’s manufacturing strengths to produce vaccines for the Indo-Pacific region. India and the South Africa have proposed a waiver of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for Covid-19 vaccines, diagnostics and medicines to scale up the fight against the pandemic, Modi said. “We also need to focus on addressing the pandemic’s economic effects. To that end, international travel should be made easier, through mutual recognition of vaccine certificates,” he said. Modi recalled India’s role in helping other nations tackle the pandemic by producing cost-effective diagnostic kits, drugs, medical devices and PPE kits, and sharing medicines and medical supplies with more than 150 countries. “Earlier this year, we shared our vaccine production with 95 other countries and with UN peacekeepers. And like a family, the world also stood with India when we were going through a second wave,” he said. India is now running the world’s largest immunisation campaign, and had vaccinated 25 million people on a single day. More than 200 million Indians were fully vaccinated, and India is willing to share its digital platform CoWIN and other digital solutions freely as open source software, he said. Biden too highlighted the US partnership with Quad members India, Japan and Australia to help produce one billion vaccine doses in India to boost global supplies by the end of 2022. “The US is buying another half billion doses of Pfizer to donate to low and middle income countries around the world,” he said. “This is another half billion doses that will all be shipped by this time next year. And it brings our total commitment of donated vaccines to over 1.1 billion vaccines.” He added, “Put another way, for every one shot we’ve administered to date in America, we have now committed to do three shots to the rest of the world.” Biden also announced the launching of the European Union-US vaccine partnership to expand global vaccinations, and said the US will provide an additional $370 million to support administering and delivery of vaccines worldwide. More than $380 million will be provided to GAVI to facilitate distribution of vaccines in regions with the greatest need, he added. The summit, Biden said, was focused on “supercharging efforts” in three key areas – vaccinating the world by dramatically ramping up vaccine production, donations and delivery of doses, addressing the oxygen crisis in hospitals around the world and making other treatments more accessible, and building back better so that global health security infrastructure becomes more resilient. He said US secretary of state Antony Blinken will convene a meeting of foreign ministers later this year to check collective progress, and proposed a second virtual Covid summit in the first quarter of 2022 to keep efforts fully aligned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supply-chains-for-vaccine-raw-materials-must-be-kept-open-to-hike-production-pm-modi-101632335798511.html
23-09-2021||India||‘Aggressive’ plan for $115 billion India, UAE trade in 5 years: Goyal||India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have drawn up an “aggressive and ambitious” time frame aiming to conclude a comprehensive trade negotiation by December 2021 and hope to sign a formal free trade agreement in the early part of 2022 to achieve over $115 billion bilateral trade in five years.Indian commerce minister Piyush Goyal said after the latest round of discussions the two partners are looking at the possibility of crossing the initial figure of $100 billion. “Both the teams will reassess as both of us feel that the possibilities are far more than as both goods and services will complement each other,” he said.Earlier, the agreement was expected to raise bilateral trade in goods to $100 billion and services to $15 billion within five years of signing the agreement. UAE was India’s third largest trading partner with about $59.12 billion of bilateral trade in 2019-20, a non-Covid period.“The first round of CEPA negotiation will be held tomorrow and day after [September 23-24] in Delhi,” Goyal said on Wednesday in New Delhi at a joint press conference with UAE minister of state for trade Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi. The two partners want to sign a formal India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in March 2022 after completing internal legal procedures and ratification.Zeyoudi said the UAE is excited about the trade agreement with India, which will boost bilateral trade between both nations. “India is now UAE’s second largest trading partner,” he said adding that during the first half of 2021, the total volume of non-oil trade between the two countries reached $21 billion.Goyal said India is participating in a big way at Expo 2020 Dubai, which begins on October 1, 2021, and said that Indian participation would help to boost bilateral trade and investment. He extended his deepest appreciation to the UAE for its support during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, especially for supplying liquid medical oxygen and medicines. Zeyoudi also thanked India for its support during the pandemic that included keeping supply chains open. Both ministers underlined the need to coordinate and promote cooperation under the framework of the memorandum of understanding signed in January 2017 between the two countries for cooperation on trade remedy measures.UAE has been an important trade alley of India for over five decades. It is India’s second largest export destination after the US with exports worth $29 billion in 2019-2020. India’s major exports to the UAE include petroleum products, precious metals, stones, gems and jewellery, minerals, food items such as cereals, sugar, fruits and vegetables, tea, meat, and seafood, textiles, engineering and machinery products, and chemicals.India’s top imports from the UAE include petroleum and petroleum products, precious metals, stones, gems and jewellery, minerals, chemicals, and wood and wood products. India imported $10.9 billion of crude oil from the UAE in 2019-2020. UAE is the eighth largest investor in India with investments worth $11 billion between April 2000 and March 2021. Investments by Indian companies in the UAE are estimated to be over $85 billion, according to official data.The UAE is also home to more than 3.5 million Indian expatriates, reportedly the largest ethnic community that constitutes roughly 30% of the total population. In recent years, the two sides have also boosted strategic and security cooperation as part of India’s focus on its extended neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aggressive-plan-for-115-billion-india-uae-trade-in-5-years-goyal-101632335739709.html
23-09-2021||India||Common links appear in two Tihar deaths||New Delhi: On May 14, 2021, prisoner Shrikant Rama Swami died in Delhi’s Tihar jail number 2 after allegedly getting into a fight with other inmates. He was to be released on bail the next day. About three months later, on August 3, gangster Ankit Gujjar, one of western Uttar Pradesh’s most wanted men, was found dead inside Tihar’s jail number 3. The two high-profile cases have several features in common – from allegations against prison officers and questions over jail treatment to missing CCTV footage and charges of poor handling of the investigation – according to case documents and witness statements seen by HT. Both Tihar officials nor Delhi Police declined to comment on the record.PHONE CALLS A DAY BEFORE THEY DIED Swami, a resident of Delhi’s Ashok Vihar, was arrested in a murder case in 2015.Jail authorities told the court that three undertrials beat Swami with cricket bats around 7am on May 14. He died on his way to the hospital at 11.30am. After his death, Delhi Police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested four inmates and said that he was beaten to death by the four prisoners because Swami bullied them. Swami’s sister filed a petition in court May 22,alleging that Swami had called her just a day before he was murdered. The petition said that her brother feared that he would be murdered by prison officers. It was on the basis of this petition that the high court transferred the case to the CBI on July 20. Gujjar, a 29-year-old with least 13 cases in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh against him, was beaten to death by prison officers inside Tihar’s jail 3 on August 3, according to a complaint by his family. The prison department said Gujjar and two others were injured in a scuffle that broke out after jail officers confiscated a cell phone, data cable, and a knife inside Gujjar’s cell.A day before Gujjar was found dead inside the jail, he called his sister from the jail, alleging a threat to his life from the prison officers, said case documents. Later, the family made 16 distress calls to the Delhi Police control room informing them that Gujjar had been beaten inside the jail, according to a status report prepared by the police and submitted to the Delhi high court. The first call was made at 10.55pm on August 3, within three to four hours of the initial scuffle inside the jail, when Gujjar was still alive. When contacted a senior prison officer, said, “The two cases are different. The fact that Shrikant was murdered by other inmates has been substantiated by other eyewitnesses too. Gujjar’s case is different. One should not combine the two cases.”‘MISSING’ CCTVs On May 15, Delhi Police wrote to the superintendent of jail number 2, seeking a copy of the CCTV footage in ward 2, -- barrack number 4 where Swami was allegedly assaulted by other inmates and barrack number 6 where he was later shifted. Prison officers did not provide the footage claiming that the cameras were not functioning. In the status report, police wrote , “Notice was given to jail authorities to provide CCTV footage of the incident. But they stated that the CCTVs in ward 2 are not in working condition.” In Gujjar’s case too, the cameras inside ward 1A(where he was assaulted) and 5A(where he was shifted and later found dead) were “switched off for maintenance work”, according to replies by jail officers to the police.In response to the allegations from Gujjar’s family that jail officers deliberately switched off the CCTVs, the above-mentioned jail officer said, “In Shrikant’s case, we could not provide the footage because the installation of the CCTV cameras was still in progress. But as on September 20, the process is complete. Around 7,000 CCTV cameras have been installed. The process is also complete. The cameras have a recording facility of at least 30 days.”DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENTS IN THE DOCKOn May 14, Delhi Police’s control room received a distress call from inside Tihar jail. The caller, who claimed to be an eyewitness, said that a deputy superintendent had murdered Swami. Police confirmed that the call was received from inside the jail at around the same time when Swami was being rushed to the hospital but are yet to trace the identity of the caller. During investigation, Delhi Police later traced the owner of the SIM card(from which the distress call was made) to a woman in north Delhi’s Mukundpur but the woman told police that her phone had been stolen but she never reported it.Gujjar, 29, was allegedly assaulted by jail officers on August 3after he slapped one of the officers when they were conducting a search of his cell, according to status report filed by prison department. On August 9, Delhi Police filed a case of murder against a deputy superintendent. To be sure, the deputy superintendent who was named in the distress call is different from the one in Gujjar’s case. Dissatisfied with Delhi police’s investigation and allegations of extortion against jail officers which led to the murders, the Delhi high court transferred both cases from the Delhi police to the CBI – the Swami case on July 20 and the Gujjar case on September 8. BOTH HAD ’REFUSED TREATMENT’On September 8, while ordering the transfer of Gujjar’s murder probe to the CBI, the Delhi high court directed the agency to look into the role of jail doctors. The high court on Wednesday noted that when Gujjar was injured, his life could have been saved if proper medical treatment was provided. On September 11, HT reported that the prison’s inquiry report showed that while Gujjar had suffered 12 injuries on his body, the jail doctors only gave him a painkiller “because Gujjar refused treatment” at around 1 am on August 4. According to a jail superintendent’s report in the Swami murder case, he too had “refused treatment.” In that case, the superintendent submitted a report to the police claiming that at around 7 am on May 13, the prison officers saw four inmates -- Arun, Akash, Ganpat and Kishan -- beating Swami with a cricket bat. “ The inmate Arun was also injured and blood was oozing out from his head when the jail officials intervened. Immediately Arun was taken to jail dispensary where he was given stitches and Shrikant was asked to come to the jail dispensary, however he refused to go to the dispensary.” Sometime later (the time is not specified in the report), jail officers found Swami complaining of “pain and trepidation in his body” and also noted the “injury in his body” after which he was rushed to the dispensary and later to the Safdarjung Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Some jail officers said they found prison doctors negligent in discharging their duty in the two cases. “The prison department will soon write to the state government about the conduct of the doctors inside. The CBI is investigating the role of every person in the case,” said a second prison officer, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/common-links-appear-in-two-tihar-deaths-101632335499250.html
23-09-2021||India||MP woman suffers partial vision loss after acid attack: Police||A 20-year-old woman suffered partial vision loss after she was allegedly attacked with acid and brutally thrashed by two men in Panna district, police said on Wednesday. The incident took place on Tuesday when the accused arrived at the woman’s house and started fighting with her brother. A sister of the accused, police said, had recently eloped with an unknown person and the two men suspected the role of the siblings behind it. “She told Pawai Police that the accused -- Summi Raja and Goldi Raja -- arrived at her house and started fighting with her brother. They later took her and her brother to a nearby forest and allegedly thrashed them,” Panna superintendent of police Dharmraj Meena said. “The accused also tried to molest the woman and when she objected, they threw acid in her eyes. They fled from the spot as the woman started crying for help. Her brother also went missing after the incident,” he added. The woman was rushed to a district hospital by a passerby but later referred to an eye hospital in Chitrakoot. A case under section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt), 294 (using obscene language) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code was registered against the accused. “The woman has suffered burn injuries in her eyes and has suffered partial vision loss. The doctors are not sure about the acid used but are trying hard to save the eyes from getting permanently damaged,” district collector Sanjay Mishra said. A search for the accused and the woman’s brother is underway, police said.(With inputs from Anupam Pateriya from Sagar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-woman-suffers-partial-vision-loss-after-acid-attack-police-101632335438626.html
23-09-2021||India||Kerala high court allows minor rape survivor to medically terminate pregnancy||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday allowed another minor rape survivor to medically terminate her pregnancy, which was a result of a sexual assault on her, a the third such order passed by the court in the last week. The latest victim was 16 weeks pregnant. The survivors of the earlier two cases were more than 26 weeks pregnant, and the court constituted a medical board following which, termination was allowed on recommendation. In March 2021, an amendment was made by the Parliament to the Medical Termination Pregnancy Act (MTP) of 1971, to increase the permissible termination period from 20 to 24 weeks, exceeding which, the high court can pass a special order in exceptional cases. In the latest case, the parents of the 16-year-old survivor moved the court after two private hospitals refused to terminate her pregnancy since a case was registered against the perpetrator of the crime. But a government lawyer, whose opinion was sought by the court, said in this particular case the permission of the court was not required under the MTP Act since it was under the permissible period of termination. The survivor’s counsel also contended in the high court that delivery at this age would be detrimental to the physical and mental health of the survivor. The court later directed her parents to approach a government hospital with a copy of the amended act and the court order to terminate her pregnancy.It later disposed of the father’s petition. During the hearing of a POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act case about two months back, the court had expressed concern over the growing number of sexual assault cases against minors. In the last year, the court permitted 12 minor survivors who were sexually assaulted, to medically terminate their pregnancy. In six cases, the offenders were relatives of the survivors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-court-allows-another-minor-to-medically-terminate-pregnancy-after-sexual-assault-101632306516339.html

The bug has then been fixed and was also acknowledged by the IRCTC. Also, the IRCTC has said that their e-ticketing system is well protected with the state of the art cyber-security technologies.The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), India, based on the alert by the teenager, marked the vulnerability to the IRCTC, which then fixed it, thus preventing the potential hack of millions of user records from the largest online ticket reservation portal in the country.P Renganathan, the 17-year-old class 12 student from Tambaram, Chennai, said that he tried to reserve a train ticket by logging into the IRCTC’s portal a few days earlier, during which he came across certain vulnerabilities in the system that could compromise its security features, according to a report in The Hindu on Tuesday. Renganathan could access the data about the other passengers such as name, gender and age and also journey-related data such as PNR number, train details, departure station and the data of journey, due to the critical Insecure Object Direct References (IDOR) vulnerability on the platform, the report also showed.He said that a hacker could have been able to cancel a ticket of the passenger without their knowledge, a claim that the IRCTC has denied, due to the vulnerability and it caused the risk of the data of millions of passengers being leaked.“Since the back-end code is the same, a hacker would have been able to order food, change the boarding station and even cancel the ticket without the knowledge of the bona fide passenger. Other services like domestic/international tourism, bus tickets and hotel bookings would have been possible in the user profile of other passengers. Most importantly, there was a risk of a huge database of millions of passengers getting leaked,” The Hindu quoted him as saying.Earlier on August 30 the teenager had raised the issue with CERT, India, which had notified the IRCTC immediately. The bug was fixed five days later by the IRCTC, the report showed.However, IRCTC later clarified that the issue has been fixed on September 2 and that the website is “well secured and protected” and is subjected to regular third party security audits. Further, it also said that there is no chance of cancelling ticket booked by another user or changing their boarding station without logging in from the same account from which the ticket was initially booked. “Railways E-ticketing system is a well-protected system equipped with state of the art cyber security technologies at Network, System and Application layers. The system has been regularly audited by third-party security auditors for security vulnerabilities. The website ensures secure data transfer with its users and payment gateways/ Banks with end to end data encryption. However, as and when any bugs and vulnerabilities are reported from any quarters, it is taken up and resolved,” IRCTC's PRO Anand Kumar Jha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17yearold-teenager-from-chennai-finds-bug-in-irctc-s-ticketing-portal-report-101632223767951.html
23-09-2021||Today's||In Indian politics, the challenge of transition||Retire when people ask why and not when they ask why not,” is a memorable quote attributed to cricketing great Vijay Merchant, who called it a day after scoring a masterful century against an English side in 1951. Timing your retirement right is never easy, but at least in cricket, there is a selection committee that can nudge you to call it quits. In politics, on the other hand, there is neither a retirement age nor an institutionalised mechanism to facilitate a smooth transition to a new order. As a result, ensuring a generational change remains one of the biggest challenges in Indian politics.Take the recent political upheaval in Punjab, where a 79-year-old chief minister (CM) was virtually forced out of office in far-from-ideal circumstances. In 2017, Captain Amarinder Singh claimed he was fighting his last election. Then, earlier this year, he suddenly changed his mind, insisting that he would continue to “serve the people”. By the end, an increasingly inaccessible Captain resembled a forlorn general, disconnected from his legislators and the people, and yet unwilling to withdraw from the political battlefield, pushing the Congress leadership into a difficult situation where the party dithered for months before finally showing him the door.Singh is not the only Congressman wanting to cling to power after a long innings. In Rajasthan, 70-year-old Ashok Gehlot is a three-time CM but will not cede an inch of space to his much younger rival, Sachin Pilot. In Uttarakhand, a 73-year-old Harish Rawat is still hoping to be the party’s face in next year’s election. In Haryana, the 74-year-old two-time former CM, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, is still dreaming he can pull off a hat-trick. In Madhya Pradesh, the Kamal Nath-Digvijaya Singh duo, both in their mid-70s, tried to squeeze out the youthful Jyotiraditya Scindia from the power equations. The Congress Working Committee has several septuagenarians and even the odd octogenarian in its ranks. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s age predicament wasn’t too different from the Congress till Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi dramatically arrived on the scene seven years ago. One of the new PM’s first acts was to create a margdarshak mandal, a body of “eminent leaders” to guide the party leadership. It was designed to keep out the previous generation of leaders from all the BJP’s core decision-making bodies. At the time, what was labelled a retirement home was seen as a shabby, disrespectful way of treating those who had devoted their lives to the party, including Modi’s mentor, LK Advani. Seven years on, the idea is slowly beginning to make sense. By effectively putting a 75 years cut-off date for senior leaders, the BJP has effected a generation change within the party hierarchy without too much resistance. Every BJP CM across states is now under 70, many in their 50s while the likes of Devendra Fadnavis and Yogi Adityanath became CMs in their 40s. The one exception to the rule was BS Yediyurappa, 78, who was forced to step down last month.Modi’s status as the BJP’s unquestioned supreme leader vests in him unbridled power, as witnessed in the surgical strike on the Gujarat cabinet last week. A less-domineering leader would have struggled with the pulls and pressures of party factionalism as a weakened Congress leadership has realised in recent times. Only an imperious high command where the lines between decisiveness and dictatorial behaviour are blurred has the capacity to ease out the old guard without demur.Interestingly, regional parties, which increasingly resemble tightly controlled family-run businesses, are controlled by leaders who will not retire or give way easily to even their children. The indefatigable Sharad Pawar at 80 remains the Nationalist Congress Party’s tallest leader. For almost half a century, M Karunanidhi was the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam mascot. It is only illness that has almost forced Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad to relinquish power to the next generation of Yadav leaders. In Odisha, the 75-year-old visibly tiring Naveen Patnaik remains the Biju Janata Dal’s solitary figure, with no clarity yet on who will succeed him.In the absence of inner-party democracy, arriving at a fine balance between gen-next aspirations and an ageing political leadership seems difficult. In politics, the premium placed on experience and stature makes it even more problematic to bring about any overnight change. Here are a few practical suggestions to break the geriatric deadlock. One, introduce a legislative amendment by which there are term limits — say a maximum of four to five terms for any Member of the Legislative Assembly or Member of Parliament. Two, have a rotational policy for leadership positions in any party organisation. No individual, for example, can be party president for more than two terms up to a maximum of four years each. Three, have a one-person-one post principle at all levels, including party committees.Four, ensure that at least half the election tickets must be mandatorily given to individuals below the age of 50. And five, create a political mentorship structure that promotes a healthy, less-fractious relationship between generations. Which party will show the gumption to bite the bullet before it is too late? Or does eternal power remain the ultimate elixir of life? Postscript: Since the margdarshak mandal concept is seen as one possible way in which to usher in a generational shift, here is a key question: Will Mr Modi, who turns 75 in 2025, apply the same retirement rule to himself? Or will he, like Captain Amarinder Singh and many others, insist on continuing to “serve the people” in perpetuity?

23-09-2021||Editorials||In poll-bound states, the challenge for the Congress||The Congress has been focused on Punjab, with good reason. Among the states going to polls early next year — Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Goa and Punjab — it is only in the north Indian state that the party is in power. While it has picked a new Dalit chief minister (CM), the party’s mismanagement of the transition — Captain Amari-nder Singh is upset, and there are factions jostling for leadership — will add to its electoral challenge.
23-09-2021||Editorials||The battle against air pollution||The World Health Organization (WHO), on Wednesday, released its revised Global Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs), its first update since 2005. The new AQGs provide an assessment of the health effects of air pollution, set new thresholds for key air pollutants, and provide recommendations to improve air quality. The revision was necessary because, since 2005, there has been fresh evidence that shows harm from air pollution begins at much lower levels than previously thought. According to the new metric, the average 24-hour exposure to PM2.5 must remain below 15µg/m³, down from 25µg/m³. In the case of PM10 particles, the safe threshold has been lowered from 50 to 45µg/m³. The AQGs report adds that air pollution causes seven million premature deaths annually. Disparities in air pollution exposure are increasing worldwide; low- and middle-income countries have growing levels of air pollution because of urbanisation and economic development that relies on the burning of fossil fuels.
