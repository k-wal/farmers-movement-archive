Police said they have registered a case against 150 unknown persons for the incident.Adityanath unveiled the 15-foot statue of the king on September 22.Police identified the arrested suspects as Deepak Nagar, 32, and Vikrant, 30, residents of Ecotech 3 in Greater Noida. A group of people gathered at the Mihir Bhoj statue on Tuesday and painted over the name, police said, adding that a video of the incident emerged on social media. “We scanned the video and arrested two persons involved in the incident. We have launched a search to arrest other suspects,” said Pradeep Tripathi, station house officer of Dadri police station. The statue has been the centre of a controversy since its inauguration at the Mihir Bhoj PG College in Dadri. The Gurjar community has been protesting against the removal of their caste’s name from the plaque installed below the statue. The community leaders maintain that the king belonged to the Gurjar community. The Rajput community has also claimed that the ninth-century king belonged to their caste. Ramchandra Verma, secretary of Gurjar Vidya Sabha, a trust which manages the Dadri college, on Tuesday filed a complaint against unknown persons after the incident. Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said based on the complaint, Dadri police registered a case against 150 unknown persons under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 153 (deliberately giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 427 (mischief) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. The officials said that police personnel have been deployed at the Dadri college after the incident.The incident took place soon after Rajya Sabha MP Surendra Nagar visited the statue and offered tributes to the ninth-century king. “The word ‘Gurjar’ was never removed from the plaque. Some members of opposition parties are creating trouble,” said Nagar, a leader of Bharatiya Janata Party. Tanmay Shankar, media in-charge, Noida unit of BJP, alleged that the people involved in blackening the plaque were associated with Samajwadi Party. “The Samajwadi Party has lost ground in Gautam Budh Nagar. All the three MLAs in the district belong to BJP. The opposition party is trying to create a divide between Gurjar and Rajput communities for an electoral dividend,” Shankar said. Denying the allegations, Inder Pradhan, GB Nagar district president of Samajwadi Party, and a member of Gurjar Swabhiman Bachao Samiti, said that there were a number of people at the spot when the incident took place. “The members of BJP were also at the spot, and it is not clear who had damaged the plaque. The Samiti has called a meeting in Greater Noida on October 2 to decide the next move,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mihir-bhoj-controversy-two-arrested-for-smearing-black-paint-on-up-cm-s-name-on-plaque-101632940104276.html

The tally of malaria and scrub typhus stood at 15 and 39 respectively on Wednesday. Officials said of the total 288 dengue cases reported in the district so far, 208 patients required to be admitted to hospitals, taking the rate of hospitalisation to about 72.22%. Officials of the district malaria department said city areas like Govindpuram, Harsaon, Pratap VIhar and Vijay Nagar among others were put under the ‘red zone’, indicating a high load of dengue cases. “In this category, we have placed such localities from where dengue cases are being reported in clusters. The localities under the red zone make up for about 50% of the overall dengue cases reported so far. In the next category (orange zone), we have placed localities, such as Shastri Nagar and Mahendra Enclave, where cases are being reported but not in clusters. These account for about 30% of the overall dengue cases reported so far,” said G K Mishra, district malaria officer. Mishra added trans-Hindon localities of Vaishali, Vasundhara, Indirapuram and Sahibabad fall under the ‘yellow zone’. “These localities do not have cases in clusters, but cases are sporadic. These account for about 20% of the dengue cases. We are mapping each and every dengue case on a map and have identified localities accordingly. Extensive anti-larvae and fogging drives have been taken up in high-risk areas,” said Mishra. According to official figures, the total number of dengue cases was 621 in 2016, 232 in 2017, 68 in 2018, 88 in 2019 and 15 in 2020.

29-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Agencies gear up to complete road repairs by Oct 30||With the Uttar Pradesh government issuing directions to all municipal corporations and local bodies across the state to complete repairs and ensure roads are pothole-free by October 30 and even residents complaining of roads going from bad to worse following heavy rain during monsoon, officials of the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation said they have expedited the road repair works and are likely to complete the works by the stipulated deadline. The directions with regard to road repairs were issued by the additional chief secretary of the state urban development department. According to official data of the Indian Meteorological Department, Ghaziabad district received 310.2mm rain between June 1 and September 29 against the normal precipitation of 544.7mm this monsoon. Residents said roads in Rajendra Nagar, Shalimar Garden Extension 1, Shalimar Garden (main), Vikram Enclave, Tulsi Niketan and at Apsara border are in an abominable state. “The entire stretch below the Red Line of the Metro is very patchy and roads in other localities have potholes. Due to waterlogging caused by heavy rain, roads in many localities have been damaged. If not repaired in time, it will soon lead to air pollution, which will be another difficulty that commuters, who take these stretches daily, will have to brave,” said Jugal Kishor, a resident of Shalimar Garden. He added residents have for long have been demanding road repairs. The current state of the roads pose a risk to those travelling in two-wheelers, said Kishor. “There are instances of vehicles getting damaged due to potholes and patchy road stretches.The roads in many sectors of Vaishali, such as Sectors 2,3, 4 and 5, need immediate repairs,” said B K Pandey, a resident of Vaishali. Mohan Sangwan, who lives in Indirapuram, said the condition of roads is no different in his area where 70km of the road network is maintained by the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA). “The roads at Kala Patthar near Swarn Jayanti Park and its adjoining areas have suffered most during the monsoon. Patchy roads and potholes are a common sight. The CISF road is in a bad state for the past one year due to the water pipeline project,” said Sangwan. The situation is same in Patel Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Raj Nagar and Govindpuram among other areas. “In Indirapuram, the Jal Nigam will start repairing the CISF Road while the GDA will immediately start the work of making the roads pothole-free. The GDA will issue separate tenders for repairing potholes and road resurfacing work, the second work will start within a week. According to our estimates, of the 70km road network in Indirapuram, about 3% is damaged,” said A K Chaudhary, executive engineer, GDA. Officials from the Ghaziabad municipal corporation said they are likely to spend about ₹40 crore for making the roads pothole-free and carrying out resurfacing work. “The engineering department has almost completed the assessment; tenders for resurfacing will be floated soon for each of the roads which have been damaged during monsoon. Filling up of potholes may cost us about ₹5 crore. We are expediting the process and are likely to complete the road works in October itself,” said municipal commissioner M S Tanwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-agencies-gear-up-to-complete-road-repairs-by-oct-30-101632939863088.html

He has not sought any prayer in the writ petition for his appointment / continuance as Chairman of the Centre, In fact, his prayer is that a Chairperson of CSPILAS be made strictly in accordance with the Statutes 18(2)(c) (1) of the Act of 1966,” he further noted.Placing reliance on the Jawaharlal Nehru University Act, the petitioner contended that Statute 18(2)(c)(1) stipulates that each Centre/Department is required to have a chairperson and the chairperson is required to be appointed by the executive council from among the professors and senior fellows within the Centre itself.Saxena’s counsel added the statute does not confer any discretion on the university to act otherwise than the rules prescribed and that the only discretion which lies with the university is that if there is only one professor in the centre, then an associate professor may also be appointed.Saxena also said that neither he nor another professor at the centre could get the position as he had already served two consecutive terms and the other candidate was removed midterm due to some misconduct.Directing the university to proceed in accordance with law, the court said, ““There cannot be any dispute that JNU has been established under the Act of 1966 and is governed by the statutes and ordinances which are statutory in nature. It is the statute 18 of the statutes which govern the appointment of the chairperson of all centres under the school, including CSPILAS.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-sets-aside-jnu-s-appointment-of-centre-chairperson-says-not-done-as-per-statutes-101632939803057.html

The MSEDCL has exposed power theft to the tune of Rs3.42 crore, taken action against the violators under section 135 of the Indian Electricity Act, and managed to recover the said amount.Action was taken after MSEDCL regional director Ankush Nale ordered a strict clampdown as part of a special mission to curb the rising number of power thefts. Hundreds of MSEDCL engineers and staffers participated in the drive that yielded strong recovery of power theft bills. MSEDCL authorities claimed to have checked 17,037 connections across domestic, commercial, industrial and agricultural consumers. A preliminary inquiry revealed theft of 20.66 lakh units of electricity following which the flying squad handed over the bills to the violators and recovered the amount in question. Pune had the highest number of power thefts followed by Satara and Solapur at the second and third spot, respectively.The MSEDCL authorities pointed out that the modus operandi of the violators included tampering with electricity meters, putting hooks on supply lines, and even bypassing underground cables by tapping the main power supply line. When power theft is detected, the authorised person can immediately disconnect the supply after he/she has sufficient prima-facie evidence, according to MSEDCL officials. In the event of such disconnection, the authority is under obligation to lodge an FIR within 24 hours of disconnecting the power supply. The supply is required to be restored within 48 hours of payment of the amount assessed as liability on account of theft.Lodging of FIRAfter disconnection of supply, it is mandatory to lodge an FIR within 24 hours. When there is no disconnection, it is not mandatory to lodge an FIR immediately. In the meantime, if the person who has committed the theft pays the amount assessed as liability on account of theft and comes forward for compounding of the offence and also pays the compounding charges, it is not necessary to lodge an FIR. However, an intimation to that effect has to be sent to the police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msedcl-initiates-criminal-action-against-2-237-consumers-for-power-theft-recovers-rs3-42-cr-101632939743183.html

He was in a relationship with the main accused, identified as Sonia (26), for over three years but their relations were strained for the past few months as he wanted to end their relationship and marry a woman of his family’s choosing, the police said.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that unhappy over the turn of events, Sonia came to the city from Jalandhar in Punjab along with an acquaintance, identified as Yakub (24), and killed Asif. The duo allegedly called Asif to an isolated place outside Ghata village, where they attacked him with an iron rod and a stone, and bludgeoned him to death.“It appears that Asif wanted to get out of this relationship and this had enraged Sonia, who entered into a conspiracy with Yakub and came all the way from Jalandhar to kill the victim,” he said.A case was registered at the Sector 56 police station, after a resident informed the police about the body of a man, bearing severe injury marks, lying inside an autorickshaw outside Ghata village.Sangwan said that the police teams started an investigation soon after receiving the information. “The two accused, Sonia and her accomplice Yakub, also a resident of Budaun, were arrested on Monday itself,” he said.A senior police official, requesting anonymity, said that the woman also feared that Asif could harm her in the future as he was allegedly in possession of their intimate photos and videos.The police said that after questioning the duo, they recovered the rod and stone used in the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/woman-accomplice-held-for-murdering-boyfriend-to-death-in-gurugram-101632938666601.html

Finally they blocked lanes 26, 27 and 28, and this went for around 45 minutes,” Khan said.MCEPL officials said that vehicular movement slowed down from 9am to 10am and congestion was witnessed at the toll plaza after three lanes on the Delhi to Jaipur side were blocked. It was only after the intervention of Gurugram police that the matter was resolved and service lanes opened.When asked, officials of the Delhi Police refused to comment on the matter.Kherki Daula toll plaza witnesses heavy movement of traffic during peak hours in the morning and evening and around 100,000 vehicles pass through the plaza daily.

29-09-2021||Gurugram||Murders, suicide: Five bodies found in Palwal residence||Five members of a family, including three minors, were found dead at their residence in Aurangabad village of Palwal district on Wednesday morning. The police are suspecting that the head of the household poisoned and smothered his family members to death, following which he committed suicide.Police officials said that a family discord could be the reason for the extreme step, but they are probing the matter from all angles. The bodies were sent for an autopsy in the evening, the results of which are awaited.According to an initial probe, the head of the family, Naresh Kumar, either gave poison to his wife, Arti, and their seven-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son and a nine-year-old niece who lived with them, or served them sleeping tablets and later smothered them to death with a pillow, the police said, following which Kumar allegedly hanged himself.The police said that all bodies were found in the same room and there was no suicide note recovered from the spot.A case has been registered against Kumar on a complaint filed by his father and the matter is being probed, the police said.Sajjan Singh, the deputy superintendent of police, Hodal, said that after questioning the family members, they ascertained that Kumar was not under any financial stress and that he had recently returned to the village on Tuesday after a trip to Jhansi. “His father told us that there was no indication of stress or any other issue that was revealed by Kumar. He also interacted with his family normally,” Singh said.Kumar was a landowner and was engaged in farming, and a few months earlier, he started running a dhaba in collaboration with his in-laws in Jhansi, the police said. “The man smothered them and committed suicide by hanging. It appears family differences were the reason behind taking this extreme step,” Singh said.The deaths were reported by Kumar’s father, who, according to the police, found the bodies when he went to his son’s house to check on them as there was no movement. The father lives in a separate room in the same compound.Singh also said that in his complaint to the police, Kumar’s father did not raise suspicions of foul play or conspiracy.Bhagat Singh, Kumar’s brother, said that they were shocked by the incident as the family did not have any financial burden and there were no issues to indicate any stress or tension.Residents of Aurangabad who had gathered near the victims’ residence also expressed their surprise over the deaths, and said that a thorough probe should be conducted into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/murders-suicide-five-bodies-found-in-palwal-residence-101632938662997.html
29-09-2021||Gurugram||MCG works: Rao Inderjit Singh lays foundation stone for nine projects||Nine projects of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), comprising green work as well as road renovations, were launched by the Union minister of state and Gurugram MP, Rao Inderjit Singh, on Wednesday. A foundation stone ceremony was held in this regard at the PWD rest house in Civil Lines, for the projects that cumulatively cost ₹35 crore.According to the details released by the MCG, a 1.4-kilometre section of the Dhanwapur Road, connecting Dhanwapur railway crossing (Sector 104) and Dwarka Expressway, will be fixed. This has been a longstanding demand of residents in the area. The stretch is accessed by thousands of commuters daily as it connects commuters travelling between Dwarka in Delhi with parts of Old Gurgaon and vice versa.Despite its significance, the four-lane stretch is ridden with potholes and heavily degraded, with little bitumen covering. Residents have been raising demands for fixing the stretch with the MCG since early 2018.“This stretch of road was built in 2008 and has been in abysmal condition since 2012. Through social media as well as during meetings with MCG officials, we have been pressing for its repair to be carried out regularly since 2018. The condition of this stretch worsens during rains as it practically becomes a muddy swamp due to which crossing it becomes even a tough task,” Yashesh Yadav, the president of Dwarka Expressway (DXP) Welfare Association, said.To fix this, the MCG will be relaying the entire stretch at a cost of ₹1.6 crore.Besides this stretch, six projects pertain to the development, renovation and beautification of parks and green belts in sectors 21, 15 Parts 1 and 2, and wards 20 and 21, at a cost of ₹13.1 crore. The two other projects comprise the construction of community centres in Sector 12A and Kanhai at a cost of ₹20.37 crore.Singh also inaugurated a heart and vascular institute at a private multi-speciality hospital in Sector 44.In his speech at the venue, Singh said that the city’s Civil Hospital Sector 10 will also be reconstructed with state-of-the-art health facilities. “The construction work of this hospital will be done in two phases. For this, the land of the adjoining government school has been taken. With the construction of this hospital, the residents of Gurugram will get better health facilities. The matter was discussed with the chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in the past and he has suggested that the Civil Hospital should be reconstructed on a priority basis,” Singh said.Constructed in 1967, the condition of the city’s Civil Hospital has degraded over the years, with studies done by the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2019 and by the MCG in 2016 recommending demolition and reconstruction of the hospital at the earliest. The hospital has over 200 beds and receives a footfall of more than 2,000 people every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-works-rao-inderjit-singh-lays-foundation-stone-for-nine-projects-101632938544161.html

CM took a complete review of the potholes on some state and national highways of the state. “It will be ensured that there will be no shortage of funds for the pothole repair works. However, if it is observed that the funds are not utilised properly and any negligence is found [in pothole repair work], then the concerned contractors will not be spared. Also, action will be taken against the engineer responsible for the road to make them accountable for the pothole-riddled roads,” said Thackeray as per a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO).

29-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to develop a well-planned city around Shirdi airport||The Maharashtra government has decided to develop the area around Shirdi airport in Ahmednagar as a well-planned city on the lines of Naina (Navi Mumbai Airport-Influenced Notified Area) project in Navi Mumbai. The decision was taken in a meeting of Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation (MADC) chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday. The influence area around the airport has also been named ‘ASHA’ (Area around Shirdi Hub Airport).MADC is a special purpose company established by the state government to plan, construct, operate and maintain airports in the state.It has been appointed as special planning authority for the ASHA project. The company will now prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the project, the officials said.Shirdi is a popular temple town of the country, owing to the shrine of spiritual guru Sai Baba. Its airport is located at Kakadi in Kopargaon, which is 14-km from Shirdi and is spread over a 350-hectare area. It has surpassed airports like Aurangabad, Nanded, Nashik and Kolhapur, in terms of passenger load and is the fourth busiest airport in Maharashtra after Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. In 2020, it was used by 569,000 passengers, up from just 229,000 in 2019.“Identify the area around the airport to settle a city with all the facilities in Shirdi and also set up one of the best development centres in the state,” the chief minister said during the 76th board MADC meeting at his official residence Varsha, Malabar Hill in south Mumbai.The state government is planning to acquire around 1,600-hectare of land around the airport to develop the city.“The idea is to have a well-planned city around Shirdi airport like the NAINA project around Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) in Navi Mumbai. We are anticipating that it would become one of the busiest airports in the coming years and at a later period it will not be possible to expand so now itself we will acquire the land around the airport and make sure we will have a really good modern well-planned city around it in the years to come,” said Valsa Nair, principal secretary, (civil aviation) general administration department.Deepak Kapoor, vice chairman and managing director, MADC said that they will be focusing upon developing four types of industries in the project which will be mainly the maintenance and repair industry of aircraft, cargo and logistics, infrastructure for religious tourism and hotels and hospitality sector.“Shirdi is close to Nashik and the city has a huge plant of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) where they manufacture Sukhoi, Jaguar fighter jets. Considering Shirdi’s proximity to Nashik, we will be focusing on developing the aviation maintenance and repair industry. Since the Nashik-Shirdi belt is a huge centre of horticulture produce such as pomegranate, grapes, guava, we are planning to develop a cargo hub and logistics industry. We will also be focusing on creating religious infrastructure as a lot of people visit Shirdi temple and the last area of focus would be developing hotels and the hospitality sector,” Kapoor told HT.“The board has given us a go-ahead only today so now a DPR will be prepared. We have a large team of urban planners working with MADC, who will get down on the field, areas will be identified. We will then identify how much private land and how much government land is required and take further steps,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-develop-a-well-planned-city-around-shirdi-airport-101632935423075.html

Hence, to ensure that the victim of a crime, as also the society, has the satisfaction that justice has been done, HC refused to reduce the sentence of three men convicted for raping a woman in Pune.“The sentencing policy adopted by the courts, in such cases, ought to have a stricter yardstick so as to act as a deterrent,” said the division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice Sarang Kotwal, while upholding the sentence headed down to Ranjeet Gade, Ganesh Kamble and Subhash Bhosale, all convicted by Pune sessions court on October 21, 2011.“There are a shockingly large number of cases where the sentence of punishment awarded to the accused is not in proportion to the gravity and magnitude of the offence, thereby encouraging the criminal and in the ultimate making justice suffer, by weakening the system’s credibility,” the bench added. The trio was accused of raping a woman on April 1, 2010, and then leaving her at her place of residence.According to the complaint filed by the woman with Pune Police, she was married and was originally from Nagpur. She had travelled to the US with her husband and returned to India in March 2010. Though her husband returned to the US thereafter, as she had a Master’s degree she worked in a private hospital. On April 1, 2010, as she was unable to get a bus to go to a seminar, when she was offered a ride in a car by two of the accused, she assumed the car to be of a call centre and as they were going in the direction of the seminar venue, she boarded it.However, rather than taking her to the venue the duo drove the car from one place to another and also picked up the third accused. She was gagged and threatened and then told to call her mother but not disclose her situation else she would be raped by 8-10 persons. Later the trio took her to a secluded spot and raped her and then dropped her near her residence.The advocates for the convicts argued that the trio had been convicted based on the witness account and their identification by the survivor which was questionable as the police had already shown the photo of one of the accused to her before the identification parade. Further, it was argued that the allegation of rape was false as the woman had consented to the sexual intercourse. The advocates further stated that the trial court had convicted the trio for conspiring, wrongful confinement, rape, gang rape and criminal intimidation and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The advocates pleaded that as the accused had been in jail since 2010, some leniency should be shown, and the sentence is reduced. Additional public prosecutor S V Sonawane however argued that the identification parade and DNA evidence clearly showed that the trio had raped the woman and as she had refuted the claim of consensual sex, the trial court was right in meting out the life sentence, hence the HC should not entertain the appeals. After hearing the submissions, the court held that in light of the crime against another woman in Pune wherein she was raped the criminal sentencing by the Courts had become a subject of concern.Holding that the accused had taken advantage of the helplessness of the woman and raped her and subjected her to extreme trauma, the high court said it was not inclined to reduce the sentence and hence dismissed the appeals. The court while appreciating the sentence meted out by the trial court judge however expressed dismay at the way in which the judge had gone into the details of the rape even while the survivor was uncomfortable disclosing it and said that such a practice should be avoided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/deterrent-punishment-for-rapists-necessary-bombay-high-court-refuses-to-reduce-sentence-of-three-101632934702451.html

29-09-2021||Mumbai||Ahead of Goa polls, Shiv Sena calls BJP real ‘beef party’, will field candidates on 22 seats||Shiv Sena has decided to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Goa in the Assembly polls next year and will field candidates on 22 seats in the state. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the party will take the failure and “politics of falsehood” of the BJP government to the people. The Sena mouthpiece Saamana slammed the BJP over cow slaughter in Goa, stating that it is the “real beef party”.Raut, who is on a two-day visit to the state, attacked BJP stating that the party led an anti-casino campaign in Goa, but is now supporting it the most. He also said that many villages and tourist spots in the state are in the clutches of drugs and narcotic substances.“Daily the Goa government comes up with a new lie. Goa is a huge tourist destination, but many villages and beaches are now in the clutches of drugs. Bharatiya Janata Party campaigned against casinos [in Goa] and came to power and grew. Today, they are supporting the casinos... this is politics of falsehood, that needs to come to the knowledge of the people. We will take these issues to the people,” Raut said on Wednesday.Raut is expected to meet party officials in Goa to discuss the roadmap for the Assembly polls, slated to be held in February-March 2022. He could also meet up with regional parties to forge an alliance for the election. He, however, iterated that the party would go solo if the alliance does not materialise. “We are going to contest on 22 seats. Whether an alliance happens or not, we are going forward with our plan. If somebody joins hands with us, well and good, if not, then we have the capability to go solo. We have voters in 32 assembly segments,” Raut said. The party is expected to take the Hindutva line and Marathi language as its agenda for the upcoming polls. Slamming the BJP government in Goa, the editorial in Saamana on Wednesday said, “It is the BJP [in Goa] which has truly become a ‘beef party and ‘Hindutva’ is just a mask. When there is a ban on beef in the country, but in Goa, you get cow meat. If this isn’t sham, then what is?”Raut added that Maharashtra and Goa have linguistic and cultural ties. “Balasaheb also went there to campaign. Though we have not got success there we do have our organisation there. Many parties are not entering Goa, including Aam Aadmi Party and Trinamool Congress. Goa and Maharashtra have always had ties. We share the same language and culture.”In an indirect attack on BJP, the Sena MP said, “Today the situation is such in Goa that nobody can say which legislator will go where after getting elected from one party. The people of Goa are also fed up. They vote for one party, the legislator jumps to other parties.” Raut was referring to several Congress legislators joining BJP after the 2017 election in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ahead-of-goa-polls-shiv-sena-calls-bjp-real-beef-party-will-field-candidates-on-22-seats-101632934223919.html

According to Noida authority officials, six realtors have not paid water charges for group housing societies for several years. These realtors are bulk consumers and owe the authority at least ₹25 lakh each.These societies are located in sectors 34, 74, 75 and 137. Authority officials said that they have decided to not cut the water supply because it will affect the apartment owners living in these societies.“We have issued recovery notices to six realtors, who repeatedly failed to pay for water consumption in their respective societies. The small consumers pay on time but some big defaulters, who owe more than ₹25 lakh, are delaying the payment,” said RP Singh, deputy general manager of the Noida authority and head of the water department.The authority has set a target to recover at least ₹70 crore from consumers of water. So far, since April 2021, the department has recovered ₹56.03 crore.“We aim to recover the remaining amount at the earliest as we have issued notices to all the defaulters. We will increase our revenue collection from water consumers and may collect around ₹100 crore this financial year 2021-22,” said Singh.As per the prevailing rates, the authority charges ₹188 per month from a middle-income group flat owner; ₹225 per month from a high-income group flat owner; and, ₹280 from a duplex flat owner. An owner of a 200 square metre plot pays ₹268 per month and the authority charges ₹505 per month from the owner of a 350 sqm plot. Noida has at least 80,000 consumers from all categories, said officials of the authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-issues-notices-to-realtors-to-recover-water-dues-worth-16-crore-101632933923103.html
29-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi restaurant that 'denied entry to woman in saree’ shut down over licence||A south Delhi restaurant, which recently drew flak for allegedly denying entry to a saree-clad woman, has been shut after civic authorities issued it a closure notice for operating without a trade licence, officials said Wednesday. A video of an argument between the woman and the restaurant staff went viral on social media last week."The Aquila restaurant was operating without a proper licence. It has now been shut after we issued a closure notice. We are also exploring other actions including imposing a penalty in accordance with the DMC (Delhi Municipal Corporation) Act against the eatery as it was functioning without approval from the civic body," South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) mayor Mukesh Suryan told PTI, confirming that the restaurant has been closed.The Aquila Restaurant, located at Ansal Plaza in Andrews Ganj, was issued a closure notice by SDMC officials on September 24 for operating without a valid licence. However, the restaurant came under scrutiny due to a social media post by a woman who alleged she was refused entry at the eatery because she was wearing a saree.She also posted a short video of her argument with the restaurant staff, alongside a couple of pictures of herself in the saree. The restaurant, however, claimed that the incident was "misrepresented". The National Commission for Women (NCW) had also asked the Delhi Police to probe the incident.The case was built against the investigation by the area public health inspector found on September 21 who found the facility running under unhygienic conditions. The notice also flagged alleged encroachment on public land."The public health inspector again inspected the site on September 24 and found that the trade is running under the same condition. You are directed to close the trade within 48 hours of the receipt of this notice failing which suitable action including sealing will be taken without assigning further notice," read the SDMC notice issued to the restaurant-owner.The owner responded to the notice saying: "I have closed-down the above said trade immediately and I shall not run the same trade without SDMC Trade Licence under insanitary condition from health point of view and create nuisance."In the SDMC House meeting today, Congress councillor from Andrews Ganj Abhishek Dutt raised the issue and moved a proposal demanding a fine of ₹5 lakh be imposed against any restaurant, bar or hotel that denies entry to any person wearing traditional Indian attire."The Aquila restaurant was running illegally without licence. The notice was issued to the eatery only after I raised the issue. Now, the authorities have informed that the restaurant has been shut. It is a matter of probe that how the restaurant was running without a licence," he told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-restaurant-that-denied-entry-to-woman-in-saree-shut-down-over-licence-101632930174024.html
29-09-2021||Noida||Noida authority allocates ₹25 crore for development of parks, sports facilities||The Noida authority on Wednesday said that it has allocated ₹25 crore to develop a park and sports facilities in each of the 81 villages falling under its jurisdiction. Each facility will have dedicated space for women, who pursue sports for fitness or want to make a career of it. The move comes after farmers demanded facilities in their respective villages at par with urban areas. Farmers have been protesting against the Noida authority since September 1 demanding better facilities in villages, among other benefits, as they gave up their lands for development of the city.“In response to the farmers’ demands, we have allocated ₹25 crore initially; this corpus may increase in future as per requirement. We have issued orders directing the staff to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) in 15 days so that these facilities can be developed as soon as possible. The motive is that people in villages, especially women, can make use of these sports facilities,” said Praveen Mishra, additional CEO of Noida authority.To begin with, the authority’s land department will identify plots in the villages and the civil department will develop the sports facilities. Since almost all urban villages in Noida are overflowing, with a spurt in population, finding land for the development of park and sports facilities is not that easy, said villagers.“If any village does not have adequate space for the facilities, we will make a cluster of two or three villages and identify land to develop the facilities that will be at suitable distance from the villages. We have decided to develop the facilities on green belt, so that we can develop sports facilities as well as expand green cover. We want to develop this facility as a hub of activities for women empowerment,” said Mishra.The DPR will chalk out the type of equipment and facilities the sports complexes will have. The authority will spend ₹50 lakh to ₹1 crore on each facility, said officials.Farmers said besides the sports facilities, the Noida authority should also work on improving other civic amenities. “The sports facilities and parks will benefit people. But the authority should also focus on improving sewer lines, drainage and roads, which are in an abominable state,” said Raghuraj Singh, a farmer leader from Bishanpura village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-allocates-25-crore-for-development-of-parks-sports-facilities-101632933502655.html

29-09-2021||Mumbai||Air taxi service yet to take off in India||The much-hyped first air taxi service in the country, which was launched with fanfare by the Haryana government earlier this year was discontinued in August, barely seven months after becoming operational. This has come as a shock as expectations were that this new segment of urban commute will emerge as the next focus in the aviation sector after the government notified drone norms last month. An air taxi, which usually has a capacity of four people, including the pilot, is a passenger service which typically makes short flights to provide people with on-demand air services to locations within a particular region. Specialised aircraft such as very light jets may be part of such services, offering seats to a small number of passengers. However, the concept of air taxis is not alien. Ehang has already begun with the concept in China and is exploring deployments in Dubai; other cities in Europe have done intercity trials of a car that can be doubly used as an air mobility vehicle. “It’s not about if air taxis are possible, it’s just about when will the air taxis come in India,” said Smit Shah, director of Drone Federation of India (DFI). Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia had recently announced that air taxis are being researched globally and many start-ups are coming up in this segment. The Ministry of civil Aviation (MoCA) published its new liberalised drone policy on August 26, hinting the launch of air taxis in the near future. However, the grounding of first-ever air taxi service in the country on account of “regulatory” challenges puts a question mark on the sustainability of such a business in the long-term. It is expected that India’s new drone policy will only help these companies take their products to the next level which could pave the way for unmanned aerial vehicle transportation. Operated by the Chandigarh-based ‘Air Taxi’, air commuting services were launched on three routes from Chandigarh – Hisar-Chandigarh- Hisar, Hisar-Dehradun- Hisar and Hisar-Dharamshala-Hisar. “Most passengers were women, college students or elderlies, who would find it difficult to commute via road, especially to and from Chandigarh. However, despite a good response, the company shut its operations on August 1 owing to regulatory challenges,” Capt. Varun Suhag, director of Air Taxi said. “We had a project of deploying 30 of these air taxis on different routes which would be seamless connectivity to small towns. The issue is that regulations in India are half written, visual flight rules (VFR) need a minimum of 5km visibility, in instrument flight rule (IFR) one can operate in zero visibility, but IFR can be operated where airports have instruments. Small airports don’t have the facilities hence pilots operating to such airports have to fly only on VFR and visibility can drop below 5km at any point, especially in North India. The US and Europe have special VFR flights, in which they are permitted in 1500m (1.5km) and above visibility, which enables the pilot to call for special VFR. This provision is not written in the Indian regulation, making it difficult for flights to operate on a regular basis,” Capt. Suhag added. He said that the concept of air taxis that is now being spoken about is not different as the distances between two places will be smaller, security and visibility requirements. There is a lot of talking and less of action. However, industry experts believe that air taxis will be the future of India. “Air taxis will be a reality – not just in India but globally – in this decade,” said Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer, CAPA advisory. “As per the market analysis, affordability is still something that the stakeholders need to work upon along with the government agencies, as the operation of air taxis is a costly affair considering the huge investment required for manufacturing, certification, operation, vertiports/ charging/ refueling station and associated costs,” said an expert who did not wished to be named. Aerial vehicles can be used as air metros, business Jets, air ambulance, emergency cargo/ stores delivery apart from the primary use of air taxis. “VTOL has been working on two configurations for vertical take-off and landing air taxis. The first configuration’s prototype is ready and the mock is under manufacturing, the second configuration’s design is under review, so we anticipate by 2025 one of our configurations will be positively launched,” said Kalyan Chowdhury, founder and managing director of VTOL, Aviation India Pvt.Ltd. under industry academia collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. However, being a UAV manufacturer and also an R&D organization, Chowdhury said that he has faced several challenges pertaining to the regulatory framework, certifications, cybersecurity, air traffic management, operational infrastructure and commercial implications while developing the VTOL Air Taxi product. “So once the challenges are addressed by the regulatory authorities, stakeholders, government agencies, air taxis will soon be a reality in India,” Chowdhury added. Another air taxi company eplane, which was created at IIT Madras and has been around since 2019, said it is looking to launch its first air taxi service by early next year. “The idea is to build flying taxis to move people within cities. We’ve raised one round of funding, close to USD one million last year. We’re looking at early 2022, February-March, when we run the first flight,” Pranjal Mehta, chief executive officer (CEO) of eplane said. According to a global survey conducted by McKinsey this year, traveller’s interest in using passenger advanced air mobility (AAM) [air taxis] was highest in India and Brazil. Around 47% of Indian respondents said they would definitely consider using an AAM vehicle in the future, depending on use case. 41% of Indian respondents wanted shorter travel times. The survey revealed that four Indian cities were among the world’s ten most congested in 2019, prior to the pandemic. 36% of Indian consumers said they would definitely pay five times the price of their current transport mode to hop on an AAM vehicle for a trip to or from an airport. About 76% of Indian respondents said they would be willing to pay extra to have items delivered within one to two hours by cargo drone, the survey revealed. “In India, an hour trip of 10km becomes 10 minutes with an air taxi. People are willing to pay up to five times more for this service,” Mehta added. Talking about their applications, Shah said that air taxis will initially be useful where time is of essence (when VIP movements or high earning people want to travel from urban centres to airports would be one area, or do critical logistics where time will be important and not cost).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/air-taxi-service-yet-to-take-off-in-india-101632933202424.html

29-09-2021||Noida||Men break shops’ shutters, flee with 600 smartphones in Ghaziabad||A group of men stole about 600 smartphones and the recording device of a CCTV camera from two shops in Navyug Market in Ghaziabad early Wednesday morning. Police said the incident came to light on Wednesday morning when locals spotted the broken shutters of the two adjacent shops. Sumit Tyagi, the owner of the two shops said the thieves could only take the recording device of a CCTV camera away from one of the shops.“On the CCTV of the other shop, we saw that five or six men arrived at the shops in a Brezza car around 3.40am on Wednesday. The group tried to break into four shops in the market, but they could only break the iron shutters of my two shops,” Tyagi added. Police said the men uprooted the shutters by tying one end of a rope to the shutter handles and the other to their car, and accelerating.Tyagi said that the men took 15-20 minutes to gather the smartphones and the recording device.“My employees are preparing an estimate of the loss, but it is expected that they fled with about 600 new smartphones and the loss is expected to be in range of ₹60-70 lakhs,” he added. The two shops are located about 40-50 yards away from the local police post. “Our PCR van was on night duty and crossed the two shops at least 10 minutes before the thieves arrived.

29-09-2021||Mumbai||BMC to scrap ₹1.2-K crore bids for roads in Mumbai over quality concerns||Following controversy over contractors quoting upto 40 percent less that estimated cost of ₹1,200 crore for road repairs and maintenance contracts, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday decided to scrap the tenders and reinvite bids. Further, the civic body has now decided to refloat bids worth ₹2,200 crore by adding a few more roads. The BMC says this time the conditions will be stringent to ensure quality of the road can be met.On September 13, additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu in his letter had sought justification from the deputy municipal commissioner of infrastructure on how the quality will be maintained amid the contractors quoting less than 30% of the estimated cost. With contractors offering to build roads at such a low cost, concerns were being raised over the quality. In his letter, Velrasu had stated, “I have received 30 tender files on the road works in city, eastern and western suburbs. It is surprising to see most of the tenders are quoted very much on the lower side. The department needs to explain how it intends to maintain the quality under control. When road supervision of 100% is not possible during the execution at senior level, how will the quality of execution be ensured by the road department?”Following this, the road department was asked to submit a reply to the additional municipal commissioner, who later in consultation with municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal took the decision to float the bids again. Velrasu confirmed that the bids will be refloated.One of the conditions of the revised tender document, would be holding back up to 20% payments, which would be given only in between the 6th-10th year after the road is repaired.A BMC official said, “In such a case, we propose to pay 4% each year which would be divided between four years. The 4% payment every year after the sixth year will also be done after testing the roughness of the road.”According to BMC officials, they will also have quality monitoring auditors for each zone, which is an upgrade from the current three such auditors for the whole city.Ravi Raja, leader of Opposition in BMC and Congress corporator, said, “One month has passed that the BMC has not taken a decision on it.”Prabhakar Shinde, BJP’s group leader in BMC, said, “We were demanding retendering and it is good if they have taken such a decision. However, the proposal has yet not come on our table.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-scrap-1-2-k-crore-bids-for-roads-in-mumbai-over-quality-concerns-101632932122770.html
29-09-2021||Mumbai||Heavy rains disconnect 3 villages in Shahpur with rest of Thane district||Heavy rains across Thane district on Monday night led to the district losing contact with three villages in Khadavali, Shahpur. The villages of Bere, Valkas and Juhugaon had lost contact as water levels rose onto the Khadavali Bridge that connects the rest of the district with these villages. As the water receded and rainfall reduced by afternoon, they managed to revive the connection with these villages.“We had informed these villages situated adjacent to water banks to remain cautious as the Cyclone Gulab alert was declared across the district. The situation in Khadavali is better now. Moreover, there were no other major incidents despite heavy rainfall all through the night,” said Anita Javanjal, district disaster management officer, Thane.Meanwhile, water levels in the catchment areas have increased. Both Bhatsa and Barvi dams are overflowing. Andra dam situated in Pune has received only 36mm rainfall on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/heavy-rains-disconnect-3-villages-in-shahpur-with-rest-of-thane-district-101632932062731.html
29-09-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Gulab brings 100mm of rain to Mumbai||The city received 100.5mm of heavy rain in the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Wednesday, due to the passage of the remnants of Cyclone Gulab over the region as the weather system travelled westwards towards the Arabian Sea. However, as forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and experts, the influence of the weather system receded during the day, with the met department’s monitoring station in Santacruz recording just 15.4mm of rain in the nine hours ending 5.30pm. The cyclonic storm turned into a well-marked low pressure area on Tuesday, covering Gujarat on Tuesday, and is expected to emerge in the northeast Arabian Sea around Thursday. The system may further intensify on Friday, leading to the development of cyclone Shaheen which is then expected to move toward either Pakistan or the middle-east, IMD officials have said. “Though chances are less, we cannot rule out the possibility of its intensification into a cyclone. The low-pressure area (remnants of Gulab) will move westwards across central India, bringing a lot of rain in the region... With an incursion of moisture from the Arabian Sea, the system will be reinvigorated. Rapid intensification of the low-pressure system cannot be ruled out now because the ocean and atmospheric conditions are favourable. The cyclone or depression will move towards northern parts of the Arabian Sea,” Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD, said. As it passed through the state, Marathwada sub-region bore the most damage. At least 17 people were killed in Maharashtra due to heavy rain, which triggered floods, thunderstorms and lightning strikes over the past two days, which also led to significant damage of kharif crops. Though some respite is now expected from Thursday, there will be more showers to come in the first week of October due to delayed withdrawal of monsoon, which would lead to further crop damage. Mumbai, meanwhile, has been placed a green category weather alert by the IMD on Thursday, indicating chances of moderate rain. Since June 1, the city has received a total of 3152.7mm of rain, which is well above the seasonal long period average of 2,205mm. This marks the third consecutive year that Mumbai has recorded over 3,000mm of rain during the monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-gulab-brings-100mm-of-rain-to-mumbai-101632931522182.html
29-09-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt plans to utilise ‘river ranching’ to make Ganga clean, pollution-free||VARANASI In a continuation of its efforts to make the Ganga pollution-free and clean while maintaining the ecosystem of the river, Uttar Pradesh government has decided to incorporate ‘river ranching’ under the Namami Gange programme. According to a press statement from the department of fisheries, an action plan has been formulated in this regard and under the plan, about 15 lakh fishes of different species will be released into the river by the department of fisheries in 12 districts of the state. These districts include Ghazipur, Varanasi, Mirzapur, Prayagraj, Kaushambi, Pratapgarh, Kanpur, Hardoi, Bahraich, Bulandshahr, Amroha and Bijnor. Nearly 1.5 lakh fishes each will be released in Ganga in Varanasi and Ghazipur districts. River ranching would help in achieving sustainable fisheries, reducing habitat degradation, conserving biodiversity, maximising social-economic benefits and would also remove factors causing pollution, officials said. Principal secretary, Namami Gange, Anurag Srivastava, said that the practice of river ranching was a part of the efforts being made by the state government for cleanliness of the Ganga and conservation of groundwater. NS Rahmani, deputy director of department of fisheries, said that the ‘river ranching’ was also used to control pollution and improve marine life in the river. “In this activity, different species of fish are released in the river, which destroy factors that increase the level of nitrogen. These fishes will also aid in maintaining the cleanliness of the river as they feed on organic remnants. Due to overfishing and pollution in the Ganges, these fishes are also decreasing for the last 20 years,” he said. According to Rahmani, about 1500kg of fishes present in an area of ​​about 4000 square meters control about 1mg per litre of nitrogen waste. Therefore, the government has decided to release nearly 15 lakh fishes into the Ganges to control excess nitrogen in the river. “If nitrogen exceeds 100 mg per liter or more, it becomes highly detrimental to the fish diversity of the river. Consequently, the fishes cannot reproduce and lay eggs, which leads to their extinction. Through this practice, the released fishes will be made to grow and proliferate for restoration of the fish stock, which will not only protect the aquatic organisms but will also reduce the pollution. By the end of September, fishes such as Rohu, Catla and Mrigal will be released into the Ganges,” said Rahmani. As part of its resolve of making the Ganga pollution-free, the Yogi government has already constructed sewage treatment plants (STPs) to eliminate flow of untreated sewage into Ganga under the Namami Gange campaign. Besides, to monitor pollution along the river, the government has also deployed Ganga Task Force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-govt-plans-to-utilise-river-ranching-to-make-ganga-clean-pollutionfree-101632930802892.html

This comes a few days after a nationwide strike, or Bharat Bandh, was held on Monday following a call by one of the farmers’ bodies to mark the first anniversary of the three controversial farm laws getting Presidential assent.The sit-in protest on Wednesday was organised by the Congress as part of the direction from the central leadership in continuation of the virtual meeting done by party president Sonia Gandhi with like-minded parties. The participating leaders from across the political spectrum underlined that the farm laws were against the interest of farmers, and the Centre would have to ultimately withdraw them or leave. “In a democracy, this is the only righteous way to make our demands heard. Ultimately, more and more people would add weight to our words and they (Centre) will have to act, or else people would throw them out of power,” said Congress legislature party leader Alamgir Alam.On a specific question if their protest would make any impact, state Congress president Rajesh Thakur said, “It might take some time, but we will continue to raise our demand together. Ultimately, the Centre would have to budge. We were four parties together when we brought down the Raghubar Das goverment in 2019; now, 19 of us are together. We will throw them out of power even at the Centre in 2024,” he said. Hitting out at the BJP government, JMM principal general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said their effort is to upset the incumbent “corporate power” in 2024. “This is just the beginning. We will soon be meeting again and chalk out a future course of action,” he said. JMM women’s wing president, Mahua Majhi, said the government cannot ignore the demands of farmers, as they make the backbone of the Indian economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-non-nda-parties-hold-sit-in-protest-against-farm-laws-101632930683465.html

Talking to reporters here at the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) office, Prakash, also the national spokesman of Indian National Congress (INC), also questioned the alleged silence of Prime Minister Modi, home minister Amit Shah and others over recovery of around 3,000 kg of heroine from the Mundra Adani Port in Kutch district of Gujarat. The port is run by the Adani group. “Recovery of such a huge quantity of narcotic drug exposes how private companies were indulging in compromising on the national security. This was just tip of an iceberg. Such type of the private entities could also serve a conduit for illegal supply of arms and explosives,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/centre-putting-national-security-in-danger-with-under-privatisation-plan-congress-leader-101632930623905.html

Defending his planning and development minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav, the CM told reporters, “This was his (minister’s) way of speaking. The demand for special status for Bihar is quite old and it will continue.”Kumar was talking to reporters after reviewing preparations for the proposed visit of President Ram Nath Kovind to participate in the celebrations being organized to mark the centenary year of the Bihar Legislative Assembly building, which hosted the inaugural session of the joint Bihar and Orissa Provincial Council on February 7, 1921.The ruling Janata Dal (United), to which both Kumar and Yadav belong, had to face the Opposition’s fire after the minister said there was no point pursuing the demand for a special status for Bihar and that the state government would instead press for a special package. A special category status (SCS) is mainly given to hilly regions, states bordering another country or states not having their own viable sources of revenue generation.Kumar denied having received any letter from leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav urging him to seek an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a meeting with an all-party delegation from the state to apprise him about the damage caused to the state due to floods and excessive rain. “I am yet to get that letter but came to know through media. However, there is no need for this. There is a procedure for this. A central team had visited the flood-affected areas to access the damage and on the basis assistance will be provided,” said Kumar.Tejashwi on Wednesday claimed he had written to the CM urging that an all-party delegation should meet PM on the issue of floods and inter-linking of rivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/demand-for-special-status-to-continue-nitish-101632930622174.html

How can a decree passed before such a higher court be forceful, Jha asked.At the most, section 385 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was applicable in the case for putting a person in fear of injury, in order to commit extor­tion which prescribes two years imprisonment and not section 387 of IPC for putting a person in fear of death or of grievous hurt in order to commit extortion, which is applied in the first information report (FIR), he argued.Advocate Shekhar Jagtap and Sairuchita Chowdhury, who appeared for the state, had argued that when the decree was signed the complainant Agarwal was in Rajasthan, Punamiya had forcefully taken his signatures on plain papers, threatening him with police action and that Punamiya had used his connections with Singh to threaten and extort money.In July 2021, the Marine Drive police have registered an FIR against Param Bir Singh, DCP Akbar Pathan, Assistant Commissioner of Police Shrikant Shinde and other police officers.The police had arrested builder Sanjay Punamiya, a resident of Marine Drive and his associate Sunil Jain in connection with the case.Punamiya and complainant Shyam Sundar Agarwal were partners in several projects in Gorai, Borivali and Bhayandar but they parted ways in 2011. As per Agarwal, Punamiya used his links with Singh to extort funds from him after they fell out.As per the FIR, Punamiya using his influence with Singh had purportedly registered false cases against Agarwal.Thane police had arrested Agarwal in 2017, after which Punamiya had allegedly sent an associate, Manoj Ghatkar, to offer a settlement. Ghatkar met Agarwal’s nephew Sharad and Shubham at Param Bir Singh’s residence says the complaint.Ghatkar threatened them and asked them to pay ₹20 crore or face charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA).Agarwal paid ₹9 crore and handed over a plot at Bhayandar to Punamiya’s associate Sunil Jain.In 2021, when Singh was the Mumbai Police Commissioner, Punamiya filed another complaint at the Juhu police station for threats. Police raided and confiscated Agarwal’s Vile-Parle office but nothing was brought on record.Inspector Nandkumar Gopale, Asha Korake and DCP Patthan also demanded money from Agarwal. Patthan even threatened to arrest Agarwal if he failed to pay Singh and Punamiya.On March, 30, Punamiya forcibly obtained Agarwal’s signature on some property documents. Agarwal paid ₹15.5 crores by cheque to Punamiya at DCP’s office where he was taken forcibly and also paid money to DCP and ACP.The officers have claimed they have been falsely implicated in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/case-of-extortion-against-param-bir-singh-court-grants-bail-to-sanjay-punamiya-sunil-jain-101632927562395.html

Instructions have been issued to start and complete the work at the earliest.The city has witnessed heavy traffic jams over the last few days, with the Ghodbunder Road being the worst affected. The jams are primarily caused due to heavy vehicles that enter Thane from the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and from Gujarat to go to Mumbai.“We have created a coordination team comprising officials from the Thane, Raigad and Palghar districts to tackle the problem. Parking lots are being created so that heavy vehicles can park there during peak hours and be released in a staggered manner,” Shinde said.He added that possible locations were surveyed in Uran, Kharegaon, Dapodi and Bhiwandi.“We surveyed a 50 hectare plot at JNPT, a 100 hectare plot at the Razdan junction and several smaller plots as well. Work on these plots will be conducted on war footing,” said Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shinde-surveys-spots-for-parking-heavy-vehicles-in-thane-to-ease-traffic-congestion-101632927443603.html

The estimated expenditure of the ₹2.50 crore project has exceeded by about ₹80 lakh. Despite the Public Works Department (PWD) pledging ₹1.25 crore towards the restoration project, the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) administration is struggling to arrange financial resources as it faces acute fund shortage. The board had directed the Shivaji Market traders’ association to pay their pending dues to be used for reconstruction and restoration work. Following the directions, the traders had deposited around ₹20 lakh till date while the Cantonment MLA Sunil Kamble has given ₹25 lakh for the project from the MLA development fund. PCB CEO Amit Kumar said, “As far as the restoration work is concerned, we have already given the NOC to the PWD for carrying out the work. The only major challenge being availability of funds as the board is facing financial conditions where we are struggling to pay monthly salaries to staff. Currently, the deficit amount has to be procured so that it can be sent to the department concerned for carrying out the restoration work,” he said. A massive fire broke out at the Chhatrapati Shivaji market on the night of March 15 which destroyed at least 25 shops in the fish and chicken section of the market. Chhatrapati Shivaji Market, a grade I heritage structure, has been a bustling marketplace since its construction in 1885 by British army officer Lt Gen John Ross as per the design by Gen Cecil D’Urban La Touche and WM Ducat. The heritage structure still awaits restoration owing to lack of funds from PCB which is yet to receive central government funds for the past three years. Shivaji Market Traders Association president Manzoor Shaikh said, “We had given ₹22 lakh of the ₹25 lakh pending dues to the PCB and PWD will be giving ₹1.25 crore for the project. The remainder amount is to be given by the board and now the ball is in their court. We are worried that the restoration project has been inordinately delayed.” PCB is facing the worst financial crisis in its history since its inception with the administration struggling to pay the staff’s monthly salary. Many development projects have been affected as the administration is facing fund shortage of around ₹300 crore. Projects affected Construction of commercial complex at Dhobi ghat: ₹16 crore Construction of footover bridge on Shankarsheth road: ₹2.50 crore Multi-level car parking: ₹24 crore Cleaning and beautification of Bhairoba nullah project: ₹84 crore Construction of multi-level parking and podium garden at JJ Garden: ₹10 crore Replacement of old water pipeline: ₹10 crore Fashion Street reconstruction: ₹20 crore Road repair works: ₹5 crore Drainage infrastructure works: ₹10 crore Water bill pendency ₹40 crore||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rs-80-lakh-fund-deficit-delays-pcb-s-shivaji-market-restoration-work-101632925882148.html
29-09-2021||Mumbai||Potholes in Kalyan make life difficult for motorists during monsoon||The stretches of Shahad Bridge and Mharal Junction that fall on the busy Kalyan-Murbad Road, are riddled with potholes, resulting in severe traffic jams during the peak hours. Motorists taking this stretch have also complained of incidents of bikes skidding due to the bad condition of the roads.The Kalyan-Murbad road connects further to Malshej Ghat and Ahmednagar.“The condition of the Shahad Bridge is the same every year. There are potholes all over the bridge as soon as it starts raining. Many a time, my bike has skidded on the bridge due to the potholes. The bridge is a vital one and still the authorities don’t come up with a permanent solution,” said Rakesh Jain, 27, a motorist who takes the bridge to connect to Murbad for work daily.Similarly, motorists have been complaining about the Mharal Junction, which has several potholes throughout the monsoon. Whenever it stops raining, there is a lot of dust on this stretch.A social activist from Mharal, Ashwin Bhoir, said, “The Public Works Department officials have claimed that they will be concretising the road after the monsoon. However, we have asked them to make the road safe at least with some temporary work now as it is very risky to ride on it.”Sanjay Utawar, deputy engineer of PWD, Thane, said, “For the Shahad Bridge, we have requested the traffic police to give us a block on one lane at night so that we can repair the stretch. Since the bridge is busy throughout the day, we can only do the work at night. Similarly, for the Mharal Junction, we have a project of cement concretisation of a 3.5km-stretch finalised. This work will begin after the monsoon. The project cost is ₹31Cr. Till then, what we have been doing is filling the potholes with metal blocks as during the rainy days, that is the only way to repair the potholes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/potholes-in-kalyan-make-life-difficult-for-motorists-during-monsoon-101632925826754.html
29-09-2021||Mumbai||Schools in Mumbai to reopen for classes 8 to 12 from October 4||The schools in Mumbai are set to reopen for physical learning for students of classes 8 to 12 from October 4, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said on Wednesday. The announcement comes amid speculations as Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar last week hinted on the reopening of schools in Mumbai after Diwali as the nation continues to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“We are reopening schools for classes 8 to 12 in Mumbai with effect from October 4. We will make a decision for the rest of the classes in November. All Covid-19 SOPs issued by the government will be implemented,” BMC Commissioner Iqbal Chahal said while speaking to news agency ANI.State education minister Varsha Gaikwad had earlier announced that schools in Maharashtra’s rural areas for students of classes 5 to 12 and in urban areas for classes 8 to 12, would resume from October 4 onwards. The minister mentioned that a detailed standard operating procedure will be sent to teachers and school administrators.She, however, clarified that any decision in this regard would be taken after considering the safety of children. “Though schools will reopen in the entire state, there is no compulsion for students to attend physical classes. Consent of parents will be necessary if they want to attend," the education minister was quoted as saying by PTI.The Maharashtra government had in July allowed reopening of schools for physical classes in the rural areas where the prevalence of coronavirus infection was negligible. However, schools in major cities like Mumbai and Pune remained shut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-schools-to-reopen-for-classes-8-to-12-from-october-4-101632923379189.html

They were rescued by officials from Kharghar and Kalamboli fire brigades using iron ladders.According to the police, the revellers who were from Dharavi and Chembur had entered the waterfalls by crossing a stream in the morning. However, due to incessant rains, the stream got swollen by afternoon, making it impossible for them to return to the city. Among the rescued people were seven minors.The forest department had banned entry to the Pandavkada waterfalls and Kharghar hills in June in view of the numerous accidents in the last few years.An officer from Kharghar fire station said, “Along with the officials from Kalamboli fire station, we reached the spot within a few minutes of receiving the call and rescued the people using iron ladders. The rescue operation continued for three hours and no one suffered injuries. The revellers belonged to the 16-27 years age group except for a woman who was 48.”Sandipan Shinde, senior inspector of Kharghar police station, said, “We allowed the revellers to go home in the evening, requesting them not to repeat the same mistake in the future. We have not registered any case against them yet.”In a similar incident, 116 people including 78 women and five children were stuck at Kharghar hills on July 18 this year. The local police and the fire brigade officials rescued them safely after a few hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fire-brigade-rescue-17-revellers-stuck-at-pandavkada-waterfalls-in-kharghar-101632923661723.html
29-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai citizens may experience severe health impacts of coal pollution: Study||Mumbai residents may be experiencing worse health and economic impacts from pollution caused by coal-fired power plants, as compared to other major metropolitan cities around the world, suggests new research by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. These findings, which were released on Wednesday in tandem with a report titled ‘Coal-free cities: the health and economic case for a clean energy revolution’, also show a significant impact of coal-fired power plants on Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru.Under the existing scenario, the C40 group’s analysis shows that Mumbai’s 13 million-odd population will experience 6,200 premature deaths, 3,200 preterm births and 4,400 emergency medical visits among patients suffering from asthma and related ailments by 2031. By extrapolation, residents in the city will take a combined 2.4 million days of sick leave over the next decade, which would directly impact economic productivity. The five metropolitan cities analysed by the C40 group will together suffer 52,700 premature deaths, 31,300 preterm births and 5,700 new cases of asthma in children within the next 10 years.Coal-fired power plants within a 500km radius of Mumbai generate a total 9% of the entire country’s coal-based power, and air pollution stemming from these plants often travels long distances, exposing and making vulnerable a much larger section of the population than residents in their immediate vicinity. Moreover, given the high domestic demand for power in the city, nearly 71% of Mumbai carbon footprint comes from electricity generation, according to a recent emissions inventory prepared as part of the BMC’s upcoming Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP).Commenting on these findings, Dr Rachel Huxley, head of knowledge and research at C40, highlighted the risk posed to citizens due to pollution from PM2.5 pollutants in the air, which stand at more than thrice the World Health Organisation’s recommended threshold. She also said that given India’s plans to expand its coal fleet to 64GW, the situation threatens to worsen in the near future.“Current national plans would expand the coal fleet by 28% between 2020 and 2030, and not by 20%, threatening the health and well-being of the urban residents in Mumbai while undermining India’s climate and air quality targets. Current national plans could increase the number of annual premature deaths from coal pollution in Mumbai by 35%,” Huxley said.Instead, the report advocates for “an energy transition that would supply Mumbai with renewable electricity would also generate 250,000 energy jobs in India between 2020 and 2030, and provide cheaper electricity.” The jobs would stem directly from demand in manufacturing, installation and operations of renewable energy sources.Suggesting tangible steps in the way forward, the C40 group, along with researchers at the University of Maryland in the United States and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, modelled a plant-by-plant retirement scenario keeping in mind the age, technology, profitability, operations and pollution (air and water) caused by each individual coal-fired power plant. Around Mumbai, 20 coal units (3 GW) have been identified for retirement in the next two years, since they are the oldest, and most inefficient, emitting high levels of pollution while being the least cost-effective. Another 22 (3.5 GW) coal units could be retired by 2030, en route to a complete shutdown of coal power by 2045, the model suggests.A rapid phase-out of coal power in the vicinity around Mumbai would “reduce India’s total annual GHG emissions by 11% (274 MtCO2 of emission savings) per year, which would be the equivalent of taking 60 million vehicles off the road for a year,” the C40 group said in a statement Wednesday.Responding to these findings, Saurabh Punamiya, research and public policy assistant to the state minister for environment and climate change, Aaditya Thackeray, said that 25% of Mumbai’s electricity demand will be met through renewables by 2025, and that use of coal in the state will be phased out in a “just transition”.“We intend to identify ways and means to provide more renewables to the grid. From not only the point of view of energy alone but also towards climate resilience on how we design our buildings. The aim is to identify how we can reduce energy consumption in a city which has a hot and humid climate throughout the year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-citizens-may-experience-worse-health-impacts-of-coal-pollution-study-101632923601962.html
29-09-2021||Mumbai||75% Covid patients overcharged by private hospitals in Maharashtra despite price cap: Survey||Nearly 75% of Covid-19 patients who were treated at private hospitals in the state were overcharged despite a price cap set up by the Maharashtra government, a new survey has found. Of the 2,579 patients and their families that were surveyed across 34 districts in the state, a majority of 95.4% of patients had taken treatment in the private sector while 4.6% were treated in the public sector.Health activists said that the findings of the survey were shocking and called for a detailed audit of the bills by the state authorities. “If a sample size of 2,500 odd patients shows such high level of overcharging by private hospitals, one can imagine the plight of lakhs of patients in the state,” said public health expert Dr Abhay Shukla, co-convenor of Jan Arogya Abhiyan that carried out the survey along with Maharashtra Corona Ekal Mahila Punarvasan Samiti.The survey was carried out this month and covered 317 patients and their families who were affected in the first wave of the pandemic and 2,262 patients and their families from the second wave.Of the surveyed patients, 1,294 had recovered while 1,295 had succumbed to the infection. Of the deceased, 1,059 were men who left behind their wives and children.In May 2020, the Maharashtra government had invoked five laws to cap the prices of private hospitals due to the pandemic. The state further extended the cap during the second wave as well. “The price cap for ventilator and intensive care unit (ICU) beds was ₹9,000 per day, ICU beds were capped at ₹7,500 per day and isolation beds were capped at ₹4,000,” said Shukla. “Our survey revealed that despite this capping, patients admitted in private hospitals were being charged an average of ₹21,215. Overall, our survey found that patients were overcharged by an average of ₹155,934,” he said.The survey also studied the cost of medicines that the families were asked to purchase from outside. In the public sector, families spent an average of ₹17,000 on medications from outside, while in the private sector, the average spending on medication was about ₹90,000.The costly treatment and the overcharging have left many families in debt. Patients were also given a cocktail of drugs, without any explanations or justifications to the family.“It felt like the doctors were conducting research by trying all the available medicines,” said Nashik resident Riddhi Kshirsagar who lost her husband due to Covid-19 in the second wave. She spent nearly ₹18 lakh for his treatment.Family members of the deceased said that an ex-gratia amount of ₹50,000 will hardly be of any help. “We should be given jobs,” said Seema Bhagwat, who lost her husband in the second wave after a 38-day long hospital stay and eventually contracting mucormycosis. She spent nearly ₹16 lakh on the treatment.Many family members have defaulted their loan instalments, sold off their gold jewellery and land plots to cover the treatment costs of their loved ones. “Introducing a price cap was a good step by the state, but its implementation has not been done,” said Shakuntala Bhalerao of Jan Arogya Abhiyan. “We are calling upon the state to conduct a detailed audit and get the hospitals to return the overcharged amount to patients in one month,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/75-covid-patients-overcharged-by-private-hospitals-in-maharashtra-despite-price-cap-survey-101632923241696.html
29-09-2021||Mumbai||Palghar bypolls: Not an alliance between BJP and MNS, but seat adjustment, say Union min||For the first time, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is all set to have “seat adjustment” for elections with Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) for the local body polls at Palghar. Both parties will fight the Palghar district council (zilla parishad) and panchayat samiti bypolls on 29 seats together.The BJP will contest 20 seats, while the MNS will contest the remaining nine seats. The BJP may even offer some seats to local outfits from its quota.Both asserted that it was just an adjustment and not an alliance per se. They said both parties will fight in those seats where they are strong and avoid fights against each other.Union minister and BJP member of Parliament (MP) Kapil Patil who is the architect of this tie-up said, “It is not an alliance between the BJP and MNS, but seat adjustment. We will fight on those seats where we are strong and they will not field their candidates and vice versa,” said Patil. He said the adjustment was being done for the sake of the development of Palghar.MNS leader Avinash Jadhav said the adjustments were based on local factors. “The local conditions are such that if we both (BJP and MNS) stay together, we will win power and hence we took this decision,” said Jadhav.After the Shiv Sena snapped ties with the BJP in October 2019 to form the government in Maharashtra with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, the saffron party is considering an alliance or a tacit tie-up with the MNS as a strategic move to counter three-party coalition, especially the Shiv Sena.BJP chief Chandrakant Patil called on Raj Thackeray at the latter’s residence in Dadar last month, fuelling speculations over a BJP tie-up. The MNS enjoys sizable pockets in cities like Mumbai, Nashik, Kalyan-Dombivli and could help the BJP in garnering votes of Marathi speaking population and denting the vote bank of friend-turned-foe Sena, which effectively plays the Marathi manoos card to get votes of Maharashtrians in metropolitan areas of the state. However, the BJP is wary of the anti-North Indian plank of the MNS which could hurt its North Indian vote bank.This month, the state Election Commission (SEC) announced bypolls for six zilla parishads (district councils) — Palghar, Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim, and Nagpur — and 33 other panchayat samitis on the seats vacated following the Supreme Court (SC) order against the political reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) community. The polls will be held on October 5 and the counting will be held the next day.Meanwhile, MNS chief Raj Thackeray is on a Pune tour to meet his party workers in preparation for the Pune civic polls. The Pune MNS unit has been strongly advocating a tie-up with the BJP. Thackeray, in his speech, asked his party leaders to prepare for solo fight now and not depend on an alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/palghar-bypolls-not-an-alliance-between-bjp-and-mns-but-seat-adjustment-say-union-min-101632923063183.html

The police are looking for two suspects in the case. The complainant met the accused at a tea shop in Wagholi and made the exchange in Yerawada. While the complainant handed him ₹3,35,000 in cash, in return he received washing soap wrapped in a fabric that looked like currency notes wrapped in handkerchief. “The accused visited a popular tea shop in Wagholi and asked a random man to look up at the cost of a dirham that he had brought with him. The complainant heard it and searched online for the dirham rate and found that he could earn money from it. So, he asked the accused to meet him later on that day in Yerawada,” said sub-inspector Kiran Varaal of Lonikand police station where the case was registered. The man to whom the accused showed the foreign currency at the tea shop is also suspected to be an accomplice in the case. A case under Section 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the two men. Another similar case was registered in Kondhwa where a 28-year-old man and his friend were duped of ₹2 lakh by a person who offered him the UAE currency at a cheaper rate. The theft happened in Sainagar area along Upper Kondhwa road in Pune on September 16 between 7:30pm and 8pm, according to the police. The complainant and his friend lost a total of ₹2,01,000 in the process. In the Kondhwa case, the accused had met with the victims through a driver who worked for the complainant’s friend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-dupe-man-of-rs-3-lakh-in-currency-exchange-deal-in-pune-101632923061687.html

Pednekar said she has instructed officials to attend to complaints on priority.Speaking with reporters, Pednekar on Wednesday said, “A review meeting was conducted with municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, in which it was decided that all potholes will be filled on priority.”Pednekar added, “The engineers have been directed that they have to fix the system in one month, and if they have any problem or issue, they should bring it up. This will ensure timely solving of the problems, considering having potholes free road is one of the basic requirements.”This comes a day after the BMC chief directed road engineers to fill all potholes in the next two-three weeks to ensure the road surface is made smooth. On Monday, Pednekar also had directed BMC officials to fill potholes in the eastern suburbs in 10 days, after visiting areas in Chembur and Kurla.According to BMC officials, it has filled 40,000 potholes on all roads in Mumbai since April 2021. However, continuous rains over the past few days and increased traffic on the roads have led to a resurgence of potholes.Meanwhile, in the city, around 1,000 potholes have been reported between June 2021 up to now on the BMC’s official mobile application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mayor-asks-engineers-for-a-fix-to-problem-of-potholes-by-octoberend-101632922641867.html
29-09-2021||Noida||Noida STF arrest two persons for extortion||Two persons were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly extorting a man for money in Greater Noida. The suspects were identified as Atul Kasana, 22, a resident of Ghaziabad, and Arun, 32, alias Master, a resident of Badalpur in Gautam Budh Nagar.The complainant Rajkumar (known by his first name only) is a resident of Duryai village in Badalpur.Rajkumar said that his nephew Omveer, 25, sold his property and shifted to some other area two years ago.“Arun told me that Omveer owed him ₹24 lakh, and since Omveer had left the place, I should clear the dues,” Rajkumar said.He added that soon he started getting suspicious calls from numbers that appeared to have originated in the United States. The person on the other end of the line threatened to kill him if he failed to pay Arun. Rajkumar said he feared for his safety and paid Arun ₹30,000 and he was unable to pay more.Raj Kumar Mishra, additional superintendent of police, Noida Special Task Force (STF), said a case was registered against unknown persons under Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at Badalpur police station on September 2.“We launched an investigation and found that Arun and his accomplice were involved in making these extortion calls.

29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Guaranteed MSP is real farm reform: The case of edible oil||To end the ‘forever war’ with farmers, the central government must announce a law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for the purchase of all 23 crops whose calculations are made by the Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). It is known that assured procurement of only cereal crops has resulted in an overflowing buffer stock, which is more than three times of the mandated norm. However, the nation owes a debt to the humble farmer whose hard work ensured that there were no starvation deaths in the worst pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918 and the famines in Bengal and Travancore in 1943. Records show that 92 million tonnes of grain were distributed for Covid relief, for migrant labour and the public distribution system (PDS) last year as against an average of 62 million tonnes for the past five years, starting 2014. In 2020-21, rice and wheat worth ₹70,000 crore ($9.36 billion) were exported. Aggressive cereal exports can raise a reserve fund (RF) for procuring all 23 crops. It is estimated that around ₹1.2 lakh crore can be raised by exports this year. How can this RF of 1.2 stabilise the farm economy? Shifting from wheat to oilseeds For a start, let us examine the case of oilseeds. India is the world’s largest importer of vegetable oils, buying two-thirds of its requirements overseas. In 2021, we imported crude and refined palm oil worth $5.8 billion. Edible oil is the third largest import after petroleum crude and gold. With an assured MSP, our farmers will produce enough oilseeds to make the nation self-sufficient. Isn’t this a golden opportunity to resolve the farm crisis, increase rural incomes, kickstart demand for industrial goods and save precious foreign exchange in the bargain? Using government agencies such as Nafed, FCI, STC, Punsup and Markfed, the MSP announced should be guaranteed at the time of purchase from the farmers. Physical procurement need not be necessarily made. Just like the Cotton Corporation of India gives price support for keeping cotton rates afloat, these government agencies, funded by the GoI, may buy, stock and trade in oilseeds only if the open market rates fall below the MSP. The CCI also does not purchase all cotton sold in the mandis. This month the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the hike in MSP of rapeseed and mustard by 8.6% and of safflower by 2.14%. If the government were to announce assured procurement, many farmers would shift from wheat to oilseeds in the coming rabi season itself as the MSP of wheat has been increased by only 2.03%. Palm oil plantation plan flawed For some inexplicable reasons, the GOI is planning to expand palm oil production in ecologically sensitive regions such as the Andaman Islands and in the North East. It is known that edible oil plantation tends to replace natural tropical forests, depleting biodiversity. Perhaps that is why Sri Lanka has banned fresh palm oil plantations, mandating older plantations to be phased out. This misplaced thrust on unsustainable agriculture is likely to meet rejection by the Supreme Court, which in 2002 ordered the phasing out of all exotic plantations to conserve the island ecology. The Supreme Court will keep in mind the warning issued by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that increasing deforestation and destruction of biodiversity is a major cause of climate aberrations. Additionally, the plan is flawed as the goal is to reach a production target of 2.8 million tonnes by 2030. The target can be achieved much earlier by encouraging oilseed cultivation in the irrigated lands of UP, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab for a start. The worst example of misspending scarce resources is that this flawed scheme provides free fertiliser, guaranteed price to the palm oil plantation owner and viability price funding to the oil refiner. This has prompted observers to ask why the farmers of other oilseed crops are being given stepmotherly treatment. Self-reliant in oil production India is equipped to become self-reliant in edible oil production. It has the suitable natural conditions to produce several nutritious oilseeds, including groundnut, mustard and cottonseed. Indian farmers have a special skill in growing oilseed crops, which go well with other crops using traditional mixed farming systems and crop rotation. The reservoir of skill at the village level has generated small-scale oil processing and extraction plants, which produce high quality oil and nutritious oil cakes (as a byproduct), which are then used in the local dairies. All that needs to be done is to make farmers aware through agricultural universities and the state agriculture departments of newer varieties and to supply them certified good quality seeds. Earlier, the National Oilseeds Technology Mission, launched in 1985 succeeded in making India more or less self-reliant in edible oil production and the nation was producing 97% of its requirement at home by 1994. This is certainly doable now, too. dhanbirbains@gmail.com The writer is a retired IAS officer and former chairman of the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission.

After a few hours of questioning in the morning, sleuths took him to Prayagraj airport from where they took a flight around 3.30pm.The prime focus of the investigation agency is now on Anand Giri’s laptop and mobile phone, which may contain the alleged morphed obscene videos and photos of the Mahant, about which he had mentioned in the purported suicide note found in the room where his body was found hanging from the ceiling fan recently, said officials.During questioning, Anand Giri denied having knowledge about any such videos or photographs.After taking Anand Giri to Haridwar, the CBI will also investigate about the person there with whom Mahant Narendra Giri was in contact and learned from him that Anand was planning to release an alleged morphed video of him with a woman. Though the Mahant, in his purported suicide note, stated that he came to know about Anand Giri’s plans from a person in Haridwar, he did not mention his name. It is believed that CBI officials may have scanned call details of Mahant Narendra Giri’s phone to identify that person in Haridwar.Meanwhile, CBI officials continued to grill the other accused in the case –former priest of Bade Hanuman Temple, Aadya Tiwari and his son Sandeep, at the Police Lines. The duo said they didn’t know why their name was mentioned in the suicide note. Aadya and Sandeep claimed they used to honour the Mahant even when the responsibility of aarti was taken away from Aadya Tiwari on the instructions of Mahant Narendra Giri few months back and his son’s flower shop was removed from outside the Bade Hanuman temple.The CBI officials also questioned the father-son duo about their multi crore properties in Naini and other areas. They informed the CBI that though they were close to Anand Giri, they had nothing to do with his enmity with his Narendra Giri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cbi-officials-take-anand-giri-to-haridwar-for-recovery-of-laptop-mobile-101632919161543.html
29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Terror and beauty, the morning of the shikra||Living at a place surrounded by a few trees and a bit of wilderness offers us ample opportunities to observe the wild around us. Mornings arrive wafted over birdsong to nudge us out of our beds. The morning cacophony of raucous jungle babblers, mynahs, crows, parrots, tailor birds, sun birds, grey hornbills and koel is actually an avian ensemble with each songster playing its part. However, things take a serious turn when the shikra (Accipiter badius), a small hawk, immortalised in Punjabi psyche by Shiv Batalvi’s poem by the same name comes visiting. Shikra, derived from the Urdu word shikari or hunter, is a small raptor from the family to which Punjab’s state bird, the northern goshawk or baaz, belongs. Shikra is a widespread resident in the open wooded country and urban spaces in India, except in the North-East. It feeds on small birds, lizards and mice, but is also known for its speed, stealth, opportunism and pluck to take on birds larger than itself. The morning of the shikra in April this year was quite eventful. Scattered rain had followed a dusty, windy night in the early hours of that memorable morning. The air was thick with petrichor. I was pulled out of bed, for a change, not by the birdsong but by the loud ululation of a babbler in its death throes. A female shikra with a jungle babbler in its deadly talons was sitting on the ground in our backyard. Unnerved by the babbler’s wailing, I ran impulsively towards the place of slaughter. The hunter loosened its grip and flew away. The babbler sprang up like a tennis ball and hustled into the nearest lime shrub. It was alive and kicking much to my relief. But the shikra came back within a minute, looking for the kill. Perched on a guava branch, it surveyed the area with its keen, angry, orange-yellow hawk eyes. It looked at me for a while, perhaps cursing me silently for depriving it of its breakfast. Not finding the quarry, it flew away, only to come back again. This time, it sat on a branch of the same lime where its prey, the babbler had galloped. It kept coming and going many more times before finally disappearing behind a distant peepal. In Batalvi’s poem, the shikra is an ambiguous metaphor for love, longing, betrayal and sheer animal will. There is ambiguity even about its gender; it has a plume on its head and anklets in its feet. The narrator-lover in the poem bemoans: “Choorie kuttan tan oh khaunda naahi/ ve assan dil da maas khawaya/ Ikk udari aisimari, oh muhr watni na aaya.” (I crush choorie for him, /But he doesn’t take! /So, I fed him the flesh of my heart!/He took such a flight, /Never to come back again.)” Our shikra was a similar embodiment of terror and beauty. Like the narrator of the poem, I also believe that our shikra, having been denied the animal flesh that rightfully belonged to it, will never come back again. There was some finality about its departing flight that saddened me. The entire episode left me in a state of dilemma: In saving a defenceless bird, had I not denied its hard-earned meal to a powerful raptor? Is human intervention in nature’s ways, even if motivated by sympathy and humanitarian concerns, justified? There are no easy answers. With the number of overlapping zones of human and animal habitation increasing every day, we will be facing many more such unresolvable dilemmas. swarajraj@yahoo.comThe writer is a Patiala-based professor of English||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/terror-and-beauty-the-morning-of-the-shikra-101632918441498.html

These vehicles would move around the rural areas and will be stationed at places depending on their requirement, a report by PTI said.Flagging off the initiative, Soren said the objective of the facility is to reach out to the people living in inaccessible areas and those who have been left out of the vaccination campaign. He also urged the people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour amid concerns over the possibility of an impending third wave of the virus.“The vehicles would be distributed among all 24 districts. I request the people to abide by Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Soren said in Ranchi.The 'Vaccine Express' vehicles are expected to run till December this year.Meanwhile, Jharkhand health secretary Arun Kumar Singh said that his department is trying to vaccinate as many people as possible even as he said the shortage of vaccine is a big constraint."We are trying to vaccinate maximum people with both doses but we don't have enough vaccines. As of now, we are vaccinating 1-1.25 lakh people every day. The number would be elevated to 3 lakh if vaccines were available, but sufficient vaccine availability is a big question for us," he said.As per the data from the ministry of health and family welfare, the total Covid-19 vaccine coverage in the state has surpassed 1,74,16,944.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-launches-vaccine-express-to-ramp-up-covid-19-vaccination-101632912303894.html

29-09-2021||Jaipur||New Rajasthan marriage registration Bill retrograde: Activists||Even as the state government has maintained that the Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages (Amendment) Bill passed this month does not legalise child marriages, rights groups continue to object to it calling the proposed law retrograde. The bill was passed last week in the state assembly.The government has said the Bill does not prevent courts from declaring child marriages void by seeking the registration of all marriages in the state since 2006 as per a Supreme Court order.Kriti Bhati, who works for NGO Saarthi Trust that campaigns against child marriages, said the provisions of the bill are unacceptable. “It seems that the government has wrongly interpreted the Supreme Court order, which nowhere seeks to register child marriages. If the government has doubts, it should approach the court for clarification.”Bhati, who said she has prevented 1,500 child marriages and has had 43 annulled, said the court mandated seeking public opinion and objections before amending the law, which was not done.Bhati claimed child marriages have not reduced in the state but were being underreported. “The number of such marriages would increase now with the amendment...”Also Read: Protest announced against ‘irregularities’ in REET-2021Kavita Srivastav of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties said allowing marriage registration for children directly approves child marriages. “The government should have undertaken pre-legislative consultation.” She said since the enactment of the Protection of Women from Child Marriage in 2006, there has been a decline in the number of child marriages. “The marriages annulled so far happened as the girls raised their voice but now this right would also end as the parents will not get the marriage registered fearing legal action.”Roopa Choudhary, 21, who was married off as a child, said child marriages should be prevented and hoped the amendment will ensure it.Four child marriages were registered in the state in 2016, 10 in 2017, and 17 in 2018.The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, provides for declaring a child marriage void. The government has said the amended bill does not in any way dilute provisions like these. It said it is committed to the eradication of social evils such as child marriage. “Sub-divisional officer and tehsildars have been appointed as child marriage prohibition officers...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/new-rajasthan-marriage-registration-bill-retrograde-activists-101632914781212.html
29-09-2021||Other||Sutradhara’s Tales: Unlocking history of 18 peths in 18th century Pune - part 1||PUNE The peth-dwelling Punekars, who have spent their childhoods in peths of Pune pride themselves of being the “quintessential Punekars” as compared to those living in suburban areas of Pune. Often one hears a person being called “pethi” or belonging to Pune 30, which originally encompassed the area of Sadashiv peth. An outsider would wonder what this “true blue” Punekar “swag” is all about!Peths formed and reformed around mid-18th century are not just separately demarcated areas in medieval town planning, but have contributed to the evolution of a special socio-cultural character for each peth. It grants a unique identity to each peth. When Pune served as a central market for nearby villages pre-17th century, the practice of weekly markets on a particular day was prevalent. As trading became an everyday affair, the trading areas were segregated according to the produce and were assigned a particular day of the week. Thus, the market areas were either bustling with the commercial activity or were closed on a particular day of the week and were named, accordingly. As Pune was divided into various peths, the peths assumed the name of the markets based on each day of the week and were referred to as Ravivar peth (Sunday), Shaniwar peth (Saturday) and so on. Kasba peth is the oldest of the lot and most organically developed. Initially, it was inhabited by minor revenue officials, merchants and artisans and existed outside the fortification of Killa-e-Hissar. Due to the residences of Shivaji Maharaj and Rajmata Jijabai, and later those of prominent nobles such as the Purandares, Mujumdars, Pethes and Shitoles, Kasba peth remained important. A number of Brahmin families engaged in Vedic learning also resided in the peth.Shaniwar peth lay along the river Mutha and began as Murtazabad established by Murtaza Nizamshah in the early 17th century. Peshwa Bajirao I built Shaniwar wada in 1730 at one corner of Shaniwar wada and the peth extended to the other corner, till the Omkareshwar temple by the river side. The fortifications of the fort were levelled to make way for the construction of mansions for various dignitaries serving Peshwas. In the census conducted to assess the damage after the Nizam’s raid in 1763, the houses of Brahmins were originally large in numbers. The peth was inhabited by good number of sonar (goldsmiths), tapkirwale (snuff makers), saraf (money changers) and other merchants, too. Ravivar peth was originally known as Malkapur and was settled by famous chief minister of Nizam Sultanate of Ahmendnagar, Malik Ambar sometime before 1626. It was redeveloped during Nanasaheb Peshwa’s period by Mahajan Vyavahare Joshi n 1740-41. It had homes of notable sardars such as Haripant Phadke and Ghorpade. In 1789, Durlabhsheth Govindji, a banker, built the Krishna Thakurdwar temple in the peth and appealed to shift the chambar (cobblers) elsewhere to avoid a “ritualistically undesirable” presence around the temple. The large presence of the Bohra community can be realised through records of the Jamatkhana (community hall) built in 1789. The census from the British period offers an eclectic mix of Bohras, Brahmins, Marwadi traders, bankers, merchants, artisans, workers, bahujans, “untouchables”, kalavantin (prostitutes) and hijras (eunuchs) belonging to different statuses, castes and religions. Ravivar peth, more than any other, offered an entire social spectrum through occupancy by a total of 63 castes.Somwar peth is almost as old as Kasba and initially functioned as a religious precinct along the sacred Nagzari stream. It was settled as Shahapura after Shahaji Raje in 1610. The peth was renovated when Aba Shalukar offered a generous donation to Nageshwar temple in late 18th century. The peth was occupied by professionals engaged in cloth, dressmaking and weaving occupations such as Koshti and Shimpi. The peth was home to many notable bankers and aristocrats and housed two main temple complexes and four chowkis (police stations). Brahmin, Kunbi-Maratha, Wani and Dalkari were the major castes and no dalit families were noted. The peth notes residence of Siddi (Abyssinians), which are not found elsewhere.Most populous of all, Budhwar peth was originally settled by Emperor Aurangzeb as Muhiyabad in 1703. This centrally located peth was rebuilt by Madhavrao Peshwa after the Nizam’s attack destroyed 60 per cent of the housing and Govind Sadashiv Khajagiwale was appointed as officer in-charge of renovation. It had residences of many eminent personalities such as Nana Phadnis and Morobadada Phadnis, including the three-storyed “Budhwar wada” of Bajirao II, built in 1803. It housed temples of Jogeshwari, Belbaug Vishnu, Tulshibaug Ram and was home to the Peshwa cavalry at “Huzurpaga”. Shukrawar peth, also known as Peth Visapur, was a settlement by Jivajipant Khajagiwale in 1748-50. He broadened the lanes, acquired the land and built many military, government establishments and mansions. Peshwa’s foundry, infantry lines, elephant stables, talimkhana (gym), gadikhana (stables), headquarters of artillery and Peshwa’s Shukrawar wada were located in this peth. This was a very mixed peth with houses of the richest citizens such as Pant Sachiv of Bhor. Later labourers, domestic servants, and foundry workers resided here. It is said that Tarabai wife of Shivaji Maharaj’s son, Rajaram , known for her courage and bravery lived here briefly. Jivajipant Khajagiwale built apartments called “Bawankhani” where prostitutes and courtesans could live in one place and stay under supervision. Pune settled in these 18 peths was prominently caste based with growing spatial divide in commercial and residential establishments. Thus, old city of Pune houses peths or wards named after all the days of the week. In addition to these exists various others peths which we shall review in next column.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sutradharas-tales-unlocking-history-of-18-peths-in-18th-century-pune-part-1-101632912321663.html

29-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Schools for junior classes may reopen, modalities to be decided after Dussehra||With the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) considering allowing junior schools to reopen for in-person learning in a phased manner, educational institutes in the Capital will begin planning how to hold staggered classes for their students. The modalities for the reopening of the remaining classes in schools will be decided at the first DDMA meeting after Dussehra, said a DDMA official.Educational institutes in the capital, including schools, colleges, and coaching centres for students of classes 8 onwards reopened last month following a DDMA order on August 30. Several schools said they have been receiving queries from parents on the reopening of junior classes as the closure of schools due to the pandemic led to severe learning and emotional deficits.The National Progressive Schools Conference, which comprises top schools in Delhi, said it plans to resume in-person learning for classes 6 to 8 in November.Malini Narayanan, the chairperson of the group, said, “We will implement the same blended learning model for these classes and students will not be called to the school on all days. Learning will continue with a combination of online and in-person classes. Schools can start with classes 6 to 8 first and then call the junior students based on the prevailing Covid-19 situation around mid-November.”Also Read: Ramleela, Dussehra, Durga Puja allowed in Delhi with restrictions Narayanan said that parents and children had been approaching her about the reopening and many were left disappointed when the August DDMA order focused on reopening educational institutes only for students of classes 9 onwards.“Parents have been eagerly waiting for schools to reopen because the social-emotional learning and connection with peers, which is important for holistic development of children, has been missing as schools have been closed for over a year. Once schools reopen for classes 6-8, we can also take a call on providing transport (school buses) based on student strength for the convenience of parents,” she said.The Action Committee for Unaided Private Schools, a group of over 450 private schools in the city, also welcomed the latest DDMA decision. Its general secretary Bharat Arora said, “We understand that the possible spread of Covid-19 during the festive season is a genuine concern, but the decision should be reconsidered after Dussehra. It is time when we all stakeholders need to realise academic gaps and take proactive decisions accordingly.”Some schools in the capital may have issues in reopening as many are serving as vaccination centres with multiple sites on the premises. Since teachers have also been engaged in Covid-19 duties, principals said it was important to relieve teachers of those duties so that they could focus solely on academic work.Government school principal Sukhbir Singh Yadav, who is also the president of Vice and Principals’ Association of Delhi, said, “If schools are reopening for all classes, teachers and staff engaged in Covid-19 duties such as at the airport or hospitals should also be allowed to return to schools because the student strength will increase substantially. Government schools, with the paucity of space, may face problems in holding classes in a staggered manner while maintaining physical distancing protocols as many have vaccination centres on their premises. If the Covid-19 situation remains under control, we would prefer calling students from classes 6 to 8 in November and then the junior classes in December after the festive season is over,” he said.Old Delhi resident Nazia Habib, whose children study in class 7 and kindergarten, said, “Since tuitions have begun, students have been able to catch up a little on studies even with online learning. But the Covid-19 fear is still there. Every day, we read reports from across the world of reinfection. Most parents I know would not be keen on sending their children to school without vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/schools-begin-preparations-for-welcoming-students-back-101632909260736.html

We have been told by the security guards to visit Punjab Bhawan to meet the ministers concerned,” said Vaisakha Singh, the group leader.Following Sidhu’s resignation, his protege and actor-turned-politician Gulzar Singh Chahal, who was made the PPCC treasurer, and Joginderpal Dhingra, the PPCC general secretary, also resigned.

29-09-2021||Delhi||Ramleela, Dussehra, Durga Puja allowed in Delhi with restrictions||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday decided to allow Ramleela, Dussehra and Durga Puja celebrations this year in public places but with a set of restrictions. However, the authority is yet to issue an order regarding the decisions taken in Wednesday’s meeting.Organisers will have to ensure number of people do not exceed total number of seats in a venue, no stalls and fairs are set up, there is 100% mask compliance, and separate entry and exit points are provided for, apart from a few other restrictions that the Authority will soon notify in a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document, said three officials aware of the matter. DDMA also decided to consider phased reopening of remaining classes in schools (nursery to class 8) after the festive season, said two of the three officials mentioned above. They added that in its first meeting after Dussehra, the authority will take a call on reopening schedule and regulations for resumption of remaining classes for in-person learning.“In wake of the upcoming festive season, Delhi Police and the District Administration will ensure Vividh (various) appropriate behaviour enforcement and take care that gatherings during the festive season are strictly in compliance with the laid down SOPs that include no standing crowds, separate entry and exit points, appropriate social distancing for seating, no activities (like fares, stalls and giant wheel etc) that attract crowds in violation of social distancing and onus on organisers for ensuring SOPs are followed,” said a senior official in Raj Niwas who was present in Wednesday’s meeting.Also Read: Furore over Delhi restaurant not allowing saree Last year, the DDMA prohibited Durga Puja committees to organise public celebrations.

We are happy that the government has trusted us. However, we will continue to live stream the Ramleela in social media and we have tied up with cable operators too.”Robin Bose, general secretary of the Durga Puja committee in Kashmere Gate, said: “We will ensure that all regulations are strictly adhered to. Safety of people comes first. We hope that the process of taking permission from the police and sub-divisional magistrate’s office is expedited too.”Another official in the executive council of DDMA, who was present in Wednesday’s meeting, said, “It was also decided today that phased re-opening of remaining classes in schools will begin after the festive season. Modalities regarding that, as in which set of classes will open when, what rules would apply, etc, will be chalked out in the first DDMA meeting after Dussehra on October 15.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “The government should focus on vaccinating all teaching and non-teaching staff and start schools at the earliest. Cities and states across the world are doing that now. Schools are necessary for well-being of children. Aa far as festivals are concerned, people should not let their guards down just because it is allowed. They should wear masks and avoid crowded places.”Currently, schools and coaching centres in the city are allowed to hold in-person physical classes for students in class 9 and above.Delhi’s lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal is the chairperson of DDMA.

29-09-2021||Dehradun||Tiger translocation to resume from Corbett to Rajaji in Uttarakhand||Uttarakhand’s tiger relocation project, which was suspended during the monsoon, will be resumed with the translocation of another tiger and tigress from the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) to Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR). On December 24 last year, a tigress, and on January 9, a tiger was relocated from CTR to RTR. The tiger ran away from its enclosure a few days after its relocation.JS Suhag, Uttarakhand’s chief wildlife warden, said the translocation project was briefly stopped as it was breeding season and they did not want to disturb the animals. He added it also becomes difficult to venture into these tiger reserves during the monsoon.“Now our team is in Corbett to select a tiger pair to be translocated to Rajaji Tiger Reserve soon. Under this project, five tigers will be translocated.”The translocation initiative is part of efforts to repopulate RTR’s western part, which is home to two tigresses that have not reported breeding in almost a decade.Also Read: Tiger kills man in Dudhwa buffer zone The Centre approved the translocation in 2016. In September 2019, a National Tiger Conservation Authority team visited RTR for reconnaissance for the exercise. The team suggested the release of tigers in a large, enclosed area for a few days to see whether they suffer from any diseases before completely releasing them in the wild.RTR had around 37 tigers with only two tigresses in its western part before the translocation began. The reserve has a capacity for 83 tigers. The eastern and the western parts of the reserve are divided by a busy traffic corridor making it difficult for the tigers to move between them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/tiger-translocated-to-resume-from-corbett-to-rajaji-101632904640499.html

29-09-2021||Delhi||Furore over Delhi restaurant not allowing saree||After a video went viral in which a woman is seen being denied entry to Aquila, Khel Gaon Marg, for wearing a saree, prejudiced dress codes at posh eateries have come under the scanner. In the 10-second clip, a staff member can be heard saying, “We only allow smart casuals. And saree doesn’t come under smart casuals.” The diner Anita Choudhary shared the clip on Twitter: “Saree is not allowed in Aquila restaurant as it’s now not a smart outfit. What’s the concrete definition of a smart outfit? Plz tell me.”However, according to the owners, who do not wish to be named, she barged in without reservations, misbehaved and slapped a staff member over delay in seating. To ask the guest to leave, one of the managers made the comment ‘as an excuse’, for which they later issued an apology. Here’s both sides of the story:THE DINERDelhi resident Anita Choudhary narrates she had arrived at the resto on September 19 for her daughter’s birthday with a prior confirmed reservation for 5.30-6pm. Clarifying the video of her slapping the manager she tells us, “We arrived a little late [6.30pm as per screenshots shared by daughter] but I did not slap any manager as the restaurant is claiming. If you look closely, I pulled down the mask because they were using abusive language. I said, ‘Jo bhi bolna hai zor se bolo taaki mujhe bhi sunai de’.” The matter escalated from there as the staff called bouncers and threatened to call cops. She adds, “The managers cornered my daughter and told her, ‘Your mother can’t enter as she’s wearing a saree’. I was made to feel like I’ve come from some other planet dressed in this attire. Hum khud bole humein yahan nahin rehna hai, tum maafi maanglo.” So, what next? “Unko apni sachaai aur transparency ke saath saamne aana chahiye. Saree maan hai, sammaan hai. Unko publicly maafi mangni padegi. Public shaming ka personal apology acceptable nahin,” she ends.RESTAURANT OWNER“It’s going viral for no reason. To follow Covid-19 protocols, we have made reservations mandatory. But ma’am came to Aquila without any reservations, apparently walked past the managers. They [manager] tried to stop her but she slapped him which is not acceptable. The comment made on saree not being a part of ‘dress code’ was in a heat of the moment. Unko [staff] bas ek bahana chahiye tha bolne ka to ask her to leave. We have apologised for the statement but we are not going to apologise to her because she slapped our manager. We have, in the past, served women diners in ethnicwear. We respect our country. But it’s very disrespectful that only one part of the video got highlighted. We have received more than 1,000 negative reviews, and threats.”PAST INCIDENTSEarlier this September, Delhi-based blogger Shilpa Arora also visited the same restaurant for a food review with a confirmation. On arrival she was denied entry as she was accompanied by her parents. It was communicated to her that, “Unfortunately due to Covid, our protocols don’t allow old people in the restaurant...We’d love to host you again without old people.” Arora feels that the reason could be her mother being dressed in ethnic wear. Last week, Jammu and Kashmir Workers Party President Mir Junaid was also allegedly refused an entry at a restaurant in South delhi on the basis of his India attire. In a tweet, he wrote, “It is a shame to see that after 75 years of independence, our obsession with western supremacy isn’t leaving us. Yesternight I went to a restaurant - We Qutub in South Delhi & was denied entry for wearing an Indian dress.” In March 2020, as per reports, Sangeeta K Nag, Principal of Pathways Senior School in Gurugram also tweeted an incident, “My shocking experience with discrimination at Kylin and Ivy, Ambience Vasant Kunj this evening. Denied entry as ethnic wear is not allowed! A restaurant in India allows ‘smart casuals’ but not Indian wear! Whatever happened to pride in being Indian? Take a stand!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/furore-over-delhi-restaurant-not-allowing-saree-101632903320308.html

Industries want 50% rebate on night tariff and electricity at ₹5 per unit as promised. The pending goods and services tax (GST) refunds is another issue that the state industry wants addressed early.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-in-2022-kejriwal-in-punjab-to-address-problems-of-industrialists-101632902000031.html

Not only she is a resident of this constituency, she had been elected twice from the seat in 2011 and 2016.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has pitted woman youth leader and advocate Priyanka Tibrewal from the seat against Banerjee. While the Congress has refrained from fielding any candidate, the Left Front has pitted Shrijeeb Biswas from the seat.In the 2021 assembly polls, nine candidates contested from Bhabanipur, out of which deposit of seven candidates were forfeited. The fight was primarily between the TMC and BJP. This time 12 candidates, including Banerjee and Tibrewal are contesting from the seat.The bypoll became necessary because TMC leader Sovandeb Chatterjee, who had won from Bhabanipur in the assembly polls earlier this year, resigned in May so that Banerjee could contest from the seat and retain her berth.Even though the Trinamool Congress swept the assembly polls, winning 213 seats out of the 292 where polls were held in April this year to return to power for the third consecutive time, Banerjee lost from Nandigram to BJP's Suvendu Adhikari, her protégé-turned-adversary. Banerjee needs to win from an assembly seat by November 5 to remain the state's chief minister.The constituency has 2,06,389 electors out of which 95,143 are female voters, which comes to around 46%. More than 20% of the people in Bhabanipur are Muslims, while Sikhs and non-Bengali speaking Hindus comprise around 34% of the local population.The BJP has been attacking Banerjee for being allegedly pro-minorities and corrupt and also highlighted the post-poll violence.Though Banerjee won the Bhabanipur assembly seat in 2011 and 2016, the BJP has been making strides in the area. The BJP candidate from Kolkata South Parliamentary constituency Tathagata Roy came second in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Interestingly, he had a lead of 185 votes in Bhabanipur assembly segment. The TMC trailed the BJP in two of the eight civic wards in the last held civic polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bhabanipur-assembly-bypoll-mamata-banerjee-seeks-to-capture-her-home-turf-101632899320030.html

29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress crisis: Border state deserves better, says MP Manish Tewari||Congress MP Manish Tewari on Wednesday expressed his disappointment and apprehensions over the latest political turmoil in his home states following Navjot Singh Sidhu’s resignation as state unit chief of the grand old party.He said in a border state like Punjab where there was already an intense social upheaval over the centrally passed farm laws, such political happenings can have a serious impact on stability and the only people to feel happy with the crisis is Pakistan.In a surprise move, Sidhu resigned from his post on Tuesday stating that he would not compromise on Punjab's future and the agenda for the state’s welfare. He, however, told Congress president Sonia Gandhi in his resignation letter that he would continue to serve the party. The state got its new chief minister in Charanjit Singh Channi only days ago after Amarinder Singh put in his papers citing months of disappointment.There's a higher ideal than power, than ministers holding org positions. That higher ideal is ensuring peace, tranquillity & stability of a border state like Punjab. Under those circumstances what has been playing itself out is extremely unfortunate: Manish Tewari, Congress pic.twitter.com/8nZs3a9hpQTewari, who was one of the senior Congress leaders to have written a note of dissent last year to party president Sonia Gandhi seeking sweeping organisational changes, said, “As a Punjab MP, I'm extremely distressed about happenings in Punjab. Peace in Punjab was extremely hard-won. (About) 25,000 people, most of them being Congress men, sacrificied themselves to bring peace back to Punjab after fighting extremism and terrorism between 1980-1995.”The Lok Sabha MP from Anandpur Sahib further said there was a higher ideal of ensuring peace and stability of a border state than power and ministers holding organisational positions, adding the latest turmoil in Punjab was extremely unfortunate.”Also read | Five possible reasons why Navjot Singh Sidhu may have quitHe, however, refused to speak about Sidhu's latest move and said the man himself was best suited to address the issue.  “The gentleman (Sidhu) can answer for himself.

Under those circumstances, if such shenanigans played themselves out in public space, it has serious implications on stability of a border state,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“I have just returned from a regional security conference and I can tell you that the only people who are very happy with what is going on in Punjab is the deep state of Pakistan. They feel that they will get an opportunity to fish in troubled waters,” Tewari added.“All I'm saying is, someone who cut his teeth on trench lines on fight against terrorism in Punjab, personally suffered because of depredations of militants, saw families of Congressmen wiped out in struggle between 1980-95, this kind of instability is extremely disturbing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-crisis-border-state-deserves-better-says-mp-manish-tewari-101632893480587.html
29-09-2021||Kolkata||Heavy rain lashes Kolkata, south Bengal districts||Heavy rain and thundershower along with gusty winds, triggered by a well-marked low pressure, lashed Kolkata and other districts in south Bengal beginning Tuesday night. The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional office at Alipore in south Kolkata registered around 87 mm rain till around 8:30 am since Tuesday morning. Even Kolkata received light to moderate rain, some districts such as West Midnapore, East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas received heavy to very heavy rain. Haldia in East Midnapore received 216.4 mm rain the last 24 hours. Diamond Harbour and Sagar Island in South 24 Parganas received 150 mm and 152 mm rain till 8:30 am in the last 24 hours, the weather office said. IMD on Tuesday issued a red alert for very heavy rains in some districts of south Bengal on Tuesday and Wednesday. In South 24 Parganas, one of the three coastal districts in West Bengal, more than 35,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas, even as the local administration in East Midnapore and North 24 Parganas were keeping the relief shelters ready while maintaining a close watch on the situation. “While red alert, the highest form of alert in the four graded rain alert system, was sounded for three districts of East Midnapore, West Midnapore and South 24 Parganas on Tuesday, for Wednesday it has been sounded for West Midnapore and Jhargram where there could be rainfall up to 200mm,” said an IMD official in Kolkata Similarly, orange alert, the next category of alert has also been sounded for multiple districts in south Bengal such as North 24 Pargaas, South 24 Parganas, Bankura and Purulia among others. “In Kolkata there has been water logging in some pockets such as New Alipore. The lock gates through which storm water is drained out of the city had to be closed for four hours in the morning as there was high tide in the river Hooghly. The gates would be again closed in the afternoon. If there is heavy rain during that time then there will be some water logging. The water level will recede once the gates are opened,” said Tarak Singh a member of KMC’s board of administrators overseeing the drainage and sewerage department. Also Read: Cyclone Gulab weakened into low-pressure to bring heavy rainfall in 5 states Between 6 am and 9 am various drainage pumping stations in the city received between 17mm to 35mm rain. Mominpur with 35mm received the heaviest rain. “The well-marked low pressure lay over central part of Gangetic West Bengal on Wednesday morning. It has been triggering rain and thundershower in more than a dozen districts including Kolkata, South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas. Murshudabad, Nadia, Birbhum, Bankura and the coastal areas,” said a senior official of IMD in Kolkata. Officials from the state’s disaster management department said that even though a low pressure system is common during the monsoon, the district administrations, particularly in the coastal areas and a few other districts, swung into action as large areas are still inundated because of last week’s heavy rain. More rains could aggravate matters after Kolkata last week received the heaviest rain in September in one day for 14 years. West Bengal didn’t have to bear the direct brunt of cyclone Gulab which hit Andhra Pradesh on September 26. The IMD, however, had forecasted that a cyclonic circulation would develop over the sea around September 27, which would trigger a low pressure. The low pressure system would bring heavy to very heavy rain in south Bengal, it had said. “There could be water logging in low lying areas, damage to standing crops and mud houses and lightning. People have been advised to stay indoors, and avoid waterlogged areas and dilapidated houses,” the IMD official said. The Bhabanipur by-election, from where Mamata Banerjee is contesting to retain her chief ministership, is scheduled on Septemnber 30. There is, however, no warning of heavy rain on that day in Kolkata. Officials said that special care is being taken for Bhabanipur in south Kolkata to avoid any water logging. “Heavy rains are expected. But even then I would request you to go to the booth with an umbrella and wearing a mask to cast your vote. Don’t waste a single vote,” Mamata Banerjee, chief minister had said last week. Over the past one week some districts received more than three times excess rain. More than a dozen people were killed due to electrocution in water-logged areas in various districts. At least 120,000 people had to be evacuated from two districts. The Kolkata Police have set up a unified command centre at its headquarters. Officials from the fire brigade, public works department, power supply corporation, city’s civic body and police will remain stationed at the centre. At least 22 teams have been formed for providing assistance and relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/heavy-rain-lashes-kolkata-south-bengal-districts-101632891259346.html

We are here before a division bench as the earlier bench asked us to move the division bench and we are ready to argue,” Deshmukh’s lawyer said, according to PTI.The ED had begun a probe against Deshmukh and his associates after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed an FIR against the NCP leader on April 21 this year on charges of corruption and misuse of official position.Deshmukh in his plea refuted the ED’s claims that while serving as home minister, he misused his official position and through police officer Sachin Waze collected ₹4.70 crore from various bars and restaurants in Mumbai. “The entire claim of Waze giving ₹4.70 crore to the applicant (Deshmukh) and the same amount being routed by the applicant’s family is factually incorrect, the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-to-hear-today-anil-deshmukh-s-plea-against-ed-summons-101632873078903.html

29-09-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Some Nizamuddin East dwellers||The daughter of the last nawab of Rampur resides in this neighbourhood. Author Vikram Seth has an apartment here. A neighbouring flat belongs to former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah. A stone’s throw away is filmmaker Mira Nair’s apartment. Celebrated social theorist Ashis Nandy lives nearby. So does hotelier Aman Nath. Hazrat Nizamuddin East is also home to Muhammed Mintullah. A rickshaw puller in his sixties, he has been a resident of this central Delhi locality for forty years.“I always sleep on this same spot,” says Mr Mintullah, sitting on a pavement in the neighbourhood’s market, which primarily comprises of a cafe, a boutique, two salons, and a handful of groceries, one of which stocks imported cheeses. Being midnight, the market is as dead as a graveyard. Mr Mintullah has parked his rickshaw in front of a shuttered dry-cleaning shop.He says he can easily rent a room cheaply in nearby Sarai Kale Khan, but tries to save money “because my family in the village depends on my earnings.” That’s why everyday he goes out of the upscale neighbourhood for his two meals of 40-rupees dal-chawal, in an eatery under a flyover.“I know all the madams and sahibs of the colony (sic),” Mr Mintullah remarks. A native of Saharsa in Bihar, he travels to his village once a year to meet wife and four daughters. His only son is an embroider in Ludhiana, Punjab. The young man’s career isn’t going well since the first lockdown, Mr Mintullah reports, refering to the ongoing aftereffects of the coronavirus pandemic. His own income has plummeted because of the same reasons. “Earlier I made 500 rupees daily, now not more than 200 rupees.”By now, the neighbourhood’s few other rickshaw pullers have gathered about Mr Mintullah. One of them observes that Mr Mintullah’s life mirror their lives. All the pullers sleep at night about this same space.Agreeing that Nizamuddin East is home to “very rich people,” Mr Mintuddin recognises the occasional generosity of the residents. They assisted him, and his fellow rickshaw pullers, with cash and food during the successive lockdowns. Shrugging his shoulders, he says that “the fact that some people sleep in AC houses and some don’t even have a hand-fan is all about naseeb (fate).” Other pullers concur. The men agree to pose for a portrait, while a grey-haired woman in her home above the dry-cleaning shop silently watches them from the balcony.

29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Masterstroke or a hit wicket? The jury is still out on Navjot Sidhu’s move to resign||In the run-up to elections, political parties strategise as much to build their momentum as they do to forge ahead of rivals in the battle of perception. But, the ruling Congress in Punjab has lately been busy in a different game: scoring self-goals. Barely over a week ago, the Congress high command upstaged its own regional satrap Capt Amarinder Singh as chief minister, installing a surprise successor Charanjit Singh Channi as Punjab’s first scheduled caste CM. That choreographed coup, in the reckoning of top leadership (read all-powerful Gandhi family) was aimed to put a full stop to the long-running factional feud and, more importantly, to shore up the stock of newly appointed Navjot Singh Sidhu ahead of the assembly elections slated to be held early next year. But, on Tuesday, it was Sidhu’s turn to spring a surprise on his benefactors in New Delhi. With his dramatic resignation, a direct fallout of power tussle with Channi, the party’s calculations on capping the festering feud has come a cropper. Truth be told, Congress in the poll-bound state today stands split among three poles: one led by the high command-backed chief minister, the second behind defiant Capt Amarinder Singh, and third, now, spearheaded by Sidhu. “The Congress is proving to be its own worst foe,” says an exasperated party MP. “We are on the verge of losing the plot ahead of elections.” Those in the know of Sidhu’s overweening temperament and Channi’s understated shrewdness are not surprised by turn of events in less than ten days the power equations changed in Chandigarh. Behind their public show of camaraderie was a cold-blooded jockeying for power. The cricketer-turned-politician pushed for his hand on levers of power – cabinet formation, portfolio allocation and key appointments. In fact, Sidhu’s overreach was so evident that Amarinder was quick to slam his nemesis for his attempts to play “ super chief minister”. Not surprisingly, Channi, with the high command’s hand holding, stood his ground, sending out a loud and clear message : That I am the boss. Implicit in Channi’s new-found assertion was his strategy to draw a clear line between the party and government and negate the impression that PCC chief was calling the shots in governance. The competing power play came to a head over return to Channi’s cabinet of resource-rich Kapurthala MLA Rana Gurjit Singh,who had to quit the Amarinder-led ministry following allegations over sand auction scam and appointment of DGP and AG. Sidhu was livid over both issues which he, according to people close to him, derided as “compromises” on sensitive issues of sand mafia and sacrilege. “Ethically, Sidhu is right” says one of PCC’s working presidents on the condition of anonymity. “ With such dubious decisions, how will the party face the people in elections” he added. Even after Sidhu dropped the bombshell, neither Channi nor the high command has shown an urgency to placate Sidhu whose next move will be guided by the support he commands in the party currently mired in confusion and shock. “The high command should not give in to this kind of politics or try to please him. If they do, it will undermine their authority and that of chief minister. There will be no end to it,” one of the senior-most party leaders said. The chaos also saw Capt Amarinder, ousted from the CM’s chair to leave the field open for Sidhu who had the backing of Gandhi siblings, was quick with I-told-you-so tweet before advising the central leadership to accept his resignation and immediately appoint some “competent man” in his place. Whether Sidhu has stumped the high command or done a hit-wicket, the jury is still out on this critical question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/masterstroke-or-a-hit-wicket-the-jury-is-still-out-on-navjot-sidhu-s-move-to-resign-101632864001449.html
29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu resignation as Punjab Congress chief: Hectic parleys on between ex-cricketer, his aides in Patiala||Hectic meetings were being held at Navjot Singh Sidhu’s Patiala residence on Tuesday soon after the cricketer-turned-politician announced his resignation as the Punjab Congress president. It was with his principal adviser Mohammad Mustafa, a former director general of police (DGP)-rank officer, that Sidhu had been holding discussions over political developments in Punjab for the last two days, it is learnt. Mustafa is the husband of Malerkotla MLA Razia Sultana who on Tuesday also tendered her resignation as a cabinet minister in “solidarity” with the ex-cricketer. The decision to put in papers by Sidhu was taken late Monday itself after a marathon meeting between him and Mustafa, said a source. Sidhu is miffed with the party high command over ignoring him in the selection of cabinet ministers and portfolio allocation besides with his handpicked chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi over selection of the advocate general and the DGP. “Some MLAs and newly inducted ministers, including Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, visited him last evening, but Sidhu didn’t reveal his plan to them. Actually, the final decision on resigning was taken around midnight. Earlier in day, Sukhpal Singh Khaira and others, who opposed the inclusion of Rana Gurjit Singh in the cabinet, also visited Sidhu airing their grouse over the development,” said an insider.Sidhu resigned soon after the allocation of portfolios to ministers, which were not as per his advice to the party high command. When other ministers were assuming charge of their departments in Chandigarh, Razia Sultana drove to Patiala. Around 4pm, actor-turned-politician Gulzarinder Singh Chahal, a protégé of Sidhu, whom the latter appointed as Punjab Congress treasurer, also resigned. Soon after, Punjab Congress working presidents Kuljit Singh Nagra and Sukhwinder Danny along with MLA Inderbir Singh Bolaria gathered at Sidhu’s house, holding deliberations. Nagra is learnt to have tried to pacify Sidhu. Later, newly appointed minister Pargat Singh along with his cabinet colleague Amrinder Singh Raja Warring visited the former cricketer and tried to pacify him. Sidhu didn’t speak to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-resignation-as-punjab-congress-chief-hectic-parleys-on-between-ex-cricketer-his-aides-in-patiala-101632863401262.html
29-09-2021||Chandigarh||How Punjab CM Channi’s assertion in power politics riled Navjot Sidhu||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s surprise resignation on Tuesday, barely nine weeks after he took over the reins of the faction-torn state unit, was a culmination of a series of behind-the-scenes events that left him peeved since his bête noire Capt Amarinder Singh’s nemesis on September 20. A photo-op bonhomie that Charanjit Singh Channi and Sidhu had publicly exuded soon after the former’s surprise elevation as Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister quickly evaporated, giving way to tussle over power politics. Here are five reasons why 58-year-old mercurial cricketer-turned-politician called it quits, abruptly ending his 68-day innings at the helm and plunging the ruling party into a deeper turmoil. Though the Congress high command endorsed newly-appointed PCC chief’s choice of Channi as CM after the cloak-and-dagger games that edged out Sidhu’s potential challengers in Sunil Jakhar and Sukhjinder Randhawa, it nixed his opposition to the appointment of Randhawa, a prominent Jat Sikh face, as deputy chief minister. Sidhu, also a Jat Sikh, viewed the Majha heavyweight’s elevation as a threat to his chief ministerial ambitions in the 2022 assembly poll sweepstakes. Sidhu was miffed at being overruled on Randhawa, who had made a common cause with him in the rebellion against Amarinder.Much to Sidhu’s consternation, he had a limited say in the formation of the 15-minister cabinet on Sunday. The cabinet had an unmistakable stamp of Rahul Gandhi who retained several of the Amarinder loyalists — a damage-limiting move to deny the sulking former chief minister a chance to emerge as a rallying figure of discontented party leaders. Sidhu had pressed for a new-look cabinet to jettison anti-incumbency of the Amarinder era. But, the high command didn’t buy into that.What added insult to Sidhu’s injury was the return of Rana Gurjit Singh, a sugar baron-MLA from Kapurthala, to the cabinet four years after he had to quit the Capt Amarinder Singh-led ministry over allegations of his collusion in the sand auction scam. Though Rana was absolved by a commission of inquiry, Sidhu doggedly opposed his comeback on “ethical grounds”, but the high command overlooked his objections and that of eight party MLAs from the Doaba region who, hours before the swearing-in, vainly raked up Rana’s tainted past. That raised Sidhu’s hackles as he saw this as “compromise” on party’s much-touted anti-corruption plank.Sidhu was also miffed over Channi’s assertion — undoubtedly, with the high command’s backing — in the allocation of ministerial portfolios. On Tuesday, Channi gave the powerful home department to Randhawa who will now directly supervise the 2015 sacrilege and police firing cases, and drug mafia investigations. An action on the electorally-sensitive issues, as the Channi government has avowedly promised, could potentially bolster Randhawa’s political standing which apparently doesn’t sit well in Sidhu’s scheme of things. What came as the last straw in their rapidly fraying ties was Channi assertively exercising the high command-mandated leeway and ignoring Sidhu’s push for the appointment of Siddhartha Chattopadhayaya as director general of police and DS Patwalia as advocate general. The chief minister, in a deft move to shake off the perception about PCC chief calling the shots in his government, played hardball on Sidhu’s intense lobbying, and went ahead with his own choices, appointing Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota and APS Deol for the top police and law office posts, respectively. That galled Sidhu and became the last catalyst in his doing what he has done many a time before: calling it quits on “high principles”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/how-punjab-cm-channi-s-assertion-in-power-politics-riled-navjot-sidhu-101632863220952.html

Even as the fresh estimates were submitted by the state agriculture department after it predicted a bumper crop, the Centre has only allowed the CCL against the old estimate of 170 lakh tonne. The issue was flagged in a meeting with Union food and public distribution secretary Sudhanshu Pandey, who was in Chandigarh to meet the state food and civil supplies department officials last week. The previous kharif paddy procurement had broken all arrival records with 203 lakh tonnes of paddy purchased. “We are asking the Centre to send CCL as per the revised estimated so that there is no problem at a later stage,” said a food and civil supplies department official. State food and civil supplies secretary Gurkirat Kirpal Singh will meet the officials of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in Mumbai on Wednesday for timely release of CCL. He is expected to raise the matter with the central bank management. On receiving the CCL, the state’s procurement agencies such as Pungrain, Punsup, Markfed and the State Warehousing Corporation will start purchase of grain on behalf of the Centre and then hand over the shelled rice to the Food Corporation of India (FCI), a central agency that drives public distribution system in the country. Officials said the Centre has agreed to release CCL to the tune of ₹42,000 crore to procure 170 lakh tonne paddy while ₹46,950 crore is needed as per the fresh estimates.The CCL includes minimum support price (MSP) of ₹1,940 per quintal besides 8.5% taxes that include 3% rural development fund and mandi fee each and 2.5% to arhtiyas. Grain starts reaching mandis Sporadic arrivals of paddy have started in the mandis of Punjab. According to reports, mandis in Khanna, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Patiala, Fatehgarh Sahib and Mohali have witnessed the crop arrival. The arrivals started since September 20, but slowed down due to rainfall last week. Due to the rain, the maturing of grain was delayed. “We are expecting arrivals to pick up pace by October 5,” said a mandi board official. Amid the pandemic, the board has extended operations (procurement facilities) at 3,000 sites. “There are 1,872 mandis in the state and we have extended operations to 1,200 more locations, designated rice mills and open spaces for procurement operations,” adds the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kharif-procurement-centre-rejects-punjab-s-revised-paddy-arrival-estimate-of-190-lakh-tonne-for-ccl-101632862500903.html

The NCRB data shows that the majority of the people arrested were youngsters, who instead of choosing a career path, had taken to crime to make a living. Drop in cases due to pandemic Last year, the police had arrested 9,678 people against 6,741 cases, a drop from the 7,369 cases registered in 2019 and 8,470 cases registered in 2018. Officials attribute the drop in cases to the imposition of the lockdown. Of those arrested, 59 were juveniles and 680, which is 7% of the total arrests were women. Of the cases registered in 2020, 4,808 were under sections of the Indian Penal Code, and 1,933 were under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, Excise Act, Gambling Act and other special laws.Consulting psychologist Dr Rajiv Sharma says the youth were increasingly resorting to crimes as they were influenced by the lavish life shown in music albums, tele-serials and films. “Instead of working hard, they want to become rich overnight. The 18 to 30 age bracket is crucial as most people find direction to their lives in these years, but those who resort to crime, end up spending their peak years in jail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ncrb-data-45-arrestees-18-to-30-years-old-in-ludhiana-101632860701404.html

29-09-2021||Pune||Activists, opposition leaders cry foul over PMC’s change in water tanker specs||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC’s) latest decision to decrease the quantity of water supplied per tanker will only end up helping the water tanker lobby, activists and opposition party leaders have alleged.Last week, the PMC water supply department invited bids to supply water through tankers in Ambegaon khurd, Gurjarwadi, Dhayari, Kothrud, Baner, Bavdhan, Undri and other areas based on demand from citizens. While the earlier system mandated that each tanker supply 10,000 litre of water, the civic body has now changed specifications and allowed each tanker to supply between 8,000 and 12,000 litre of water.There are seven tanker points in the city where contractors fill up tankers with water to supply it to various areas. So far, the PMC was paying each water tanker with 10,000 litre capacity Rs1,135 per trip. With the change in terms and conditions, the PMC will now pay each water tanker with 8,000 litre capacity the same rate. Ferrying and supplying a lesser quantity of water at the same rate will help the contractor as it may increase the number of trips made by each tanker to supply water to areas facing shortage.Civic activist Vivek Velanker said, “The change in terms and conditions mentioned in the tender will definitely help the water tanker lobby. The number of trips will automatically increase with the PMC having reduced the water-carrying capacity.”However, PMC officials said that the decision has been taken to streamline the water distribution process. Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the water supply department, said, “We supply tanker water to different parts of the city where people are facing shortage. It is free of cost. We float tenders and award contracts to contractors holding PMC licenses. Earlier, the PMC found that the contractor was showing an increased capacity (10,000 litre) on paper while actually carrying only 8,000 litre. So we decided to rectify it and avoid misuse by incorporating the condition of 8,000 litre, based upon which the PMC will pay money.”At present, the PMC supplies water to different parts of the city through more than 500 tankers. The fringe areas where water is supplied include: Baner, Bavdhan, Balewadi, Uruli-Devachi, Fursungi, Hadapsar, Warje-Malwadi, Wadgaon-Dhayari, Ambegaon khurd and Budruk, with a majority of the tankers supplying water to Uruli-Devachi and Fursungi. There are about 24,000 tanker trips per month to supply water to different parts of the city. With increase in demand during the summer season, the number of trips goes up to 27,000. The PMC has spent around Rs15 crore so far on this.Aba Bagul, Congress party leader and senior corporator, said, “In a smart city like Pune, the PMC should have implemented an online system to book and deliver tankers like the booking of domestic gas. There is no audit of the water tanker supply. All the work is being carried out manually. There is a chance of malpractice in the water tanker distribution system.”Further, Velanker raised doubts as to whether the meters placed on each tanker are working or not. “We had demanded that water meters be placed to measure the water and avoid misuse while filling up water tankers. The PMC placed water meters but I don’t know whether they are working or not,” he said.However, Prasanna Joshi, executive engineer of the water supply department, said, “Water meters are operating at water tanker points. We are also keeping a record of water tanker trips. We have data of daily, weekly, monthly and yearly water tanker trips. Besides that, we have made it compulsory to place GPS systems in all tankers to keep a record of and track the movement of tankers. All tankers have a GPS system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/activists-opposition-leaders-cry-foul-over-pmc-s-change-in-water-tanker-specs-101632859320795.html
29-09-2021||Jaipur||1,822 bodies found in Indira Gandhi canal in 10 years; Raj gets HC notice||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan government has been issued notice by the high court on a petition that wants the government to take steps to stop bodies from flowing into the state from Haryana. The public interest litigation filed by a government teacher in Jaisalmer cited data obtained via right to information requests to underline that 1,822 bodies had been found in Indira Gandhi canal in the state between 2010 and 2019.Babu Ram Chouhan’s petition said an overwhelming number of bodies were never identified. Out of 1,822 bodies found in canal in Rajasthan, only 260 bodies could be identified. Chouhan’s petition wanted the Rajasthan government to develop a system of nets in the canal along the Haryana-Rajasthan border to prevent the bodies from floating into the state.Chouhan’s petition, filed by lawyer Razzak Khan, said the canal has become a haven for criminals to dispose of dead bodies and get away with crimes such as murder. He also asked the court to order the government to set up a special police station to identify the bodies and investigate the deaths.Also, the disposal of unidentified dead bodies is not done properly according to the rituals, which is a violation of human rights, the petition said, pointing that Chouhan had also approached the National Human Rights Commission and Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission in this connection.A division bench of justices Sangita Lodha and Vinit Kumar Mathur has issued notice to the Rajasthan government.The petition said cases of unidentified dead bodies pile up at police stations and are eventually closed without any action.The PIL said petitioner tried to persuade the government to take steps and had sent a representations to the authorities concerned. But he was told that if nets are set up, the moss would get stuck in the net and affect the flow of water, and this may damage the canal itself. He said his request for setting up a special police station for the canal area was also denied on grounds that there was a bar on creation of new posts due to the financial burden on the exchequer due to the Covid pandemic. The 445km long IGNP, considered India’s longest canal, originates at Punjab’s Harike Barrage. The length of its feeder canal is 204 km out of which 170 km is in Punjab and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/1822-bodies-found-in-indira-gandhi-canal-in-10-years-raj-gets-hc-notice-101632859140571.html

Adding to their woes, most private cab services have increased their rates (see box). For instance, the earlier per seat rate in an air-conditioned (AC) cab was ₹475, which has now gone up to ₹675. There has also been a surge in the prices of cabs which provide an airport-to-airport drop between the two cities. Mukesh Sharma from Krushna cab service, Shivajinagar, said, “Diesel rates have risen steeply and we are left with no option but to increase rates. Still, private cab booking has not reached its peak like the pre-Covid days so continuing with the old rates will not be viable for us.”Trains remain the cheapest mode of travel between Mumbai and Pune with the cost of a Deccan Queen ticket being ₹105. However, other trains like the Sahyadri Express and Sinhagad Express which have more halts along the Mumbai-Pune-Mumbai route have not yet resumed services, causing huge problems for regular travellers.Pooja Rana, a resident of Wakad, said, “I hope more trains start soon. Since I am not comfortable travelling by bus, I have to opt for cab services but with the rates rising steeply, I am planning to shift again to Mumbai instead of this daily up and down.”Meanwhile, there is no hike in MSRTC bus rates. The driver of a Mumbai-Pune Shivneri bus on condition of anonymity said, “Many private cab owners try to draw passengers away by quoting cheaper fares but when the passengers begin the journey, the rates are hiked up depending on how many seats they are able to fill.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/now-hike-in-private-cab-rates-adds-to-pune-mumbai-commuter-woes-101632859081492.html

The minster, who held a meeting at the MC’s Zone D office on Tuesday, recommended that show-cause notices be served to officials concerned of the bridges and roads department. “The officials (engineers and superintending engineers) have been directed to repair the main roads of the city within a week, otherwise strict departmental action will be taken against them. If required, a chargesheet will be recommended against them,” said Ashu, while directing officials to carry out repair work during day and night too for expediting the process.“Roads can be repaired using ready-mix in the rainy season. However, whenever councillors asked officials to use the mix, they would claim that they did not have the material. Although, 1,300 ready-mix bags are available in the municipal corporation’ stores,” the minister said, adding that it was a matter of great shame that though road projects worth ₹250 crore were in the pipeline, the existing roads were in a pathetic condition.“Residents have been complaining about potholes for a long time. The craters can be seen at all the entry points of the city, including Sherpur Road, and Ferozepur Road. The MC officials seem to be in slumber. Surprisingly, they did not apprise senior officials of the need for ready mix, which is available in the MC stores, or put in an order for the same,” said Ashu.With the assembly elections approaching, Ashu slammed officials for delaying the process of allotting road construction projects to contractors. He directed MC Commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal to check the matter and issue show cause notices to concerned officials.Repair work initiated despite rainfall, waterlogging Soon after Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu threatened to recommend a chargesheet against officers if the major roads of the city were not repaired within a week, workmen could be seen repairing the roads despite the downpour on Tuesday. The roads had not been repaired throughout the monsoon as officials were claiming that waterlogging affects the quality of the hot-mix material. However MC staff was seen repairing roads in different parts of the city including Model Town, Focal Point, Jagraon bridge, and Dholewal. Surprisingly, the hot-mix plant on Hambran Road, which authorities said could not be made functional during the rain, was also operationalised.An MC official, requesting anonymity, said repairing waterlogged roads might affect the quality. However, senior officials had ordered that repairs be initiated, after the minister lambasted them. MC commissioner Sabharwal also inspected the ongoing work at a few sites. The superintending engineers (SE) of the bridges and roads department were also seen on the field after being criticised by the minister, mayor Balkar Sandhu, and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal.Guard of honour for AshuBefore the meeting, the district administration accorded a guard of honour to Bharat Bhushan Ashu during his first visit to the city after his appointment as Cabinet minister under newly appointed chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi.Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma, commissioner of police Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, additional deputy commissioner (ADC, urban development) Sandeep Kumar, ADC (development) Amit Kumar Panchal, ADC (general) Rahul Chaba, assistant commissioner Parleen Kaur Kaleka and others were also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/repair-roads-within-the-week-or-face-charges-ashu-tells-ludhiana-mcofficials-101632858904903.html

29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana includes bajra in ‘Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana’||The Haryana government on Tuesday announced to include bajra in the ‘Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana’ from this kharif season, a move that appears to be aimed at encouraging private players to buy the produce which the government procures at ₹2,250 per quintal minimum support price (MSP).In case the private players buy bajra below the MSP, the government will pay farmers the difference in price up to ₹600 per quintal on average of the yield.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday said considering the difference in price (average market price and MSP) of bajra as ‘Bhavantar’ price and after verification of crops of registered farmers on the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal, if the given details are found correct, farmers will be given ₹600 per quintal on the average yield.The CM said Haryana is the first state in country to implement the scheme. At least 21 horticultural crops have already been included under the scheme.Khattar said neighbouring Rajasthan and Punjab will not procure bajra under the MSP again. He said in such a situation, there is a possibility of bajra (millet) coming from these states to be sold in Haryana.“Thus, it has been decided to compensate only those farmers of Haryana who have registered on the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal for buying bajra,” he said.In kharif season 2021, 2.71 lakh farmers have registered on the ‘Meri fasal, Mera Byora’ portal for bajra.Procurement of bajra, moong, maize and paddy will start from October 1, and of groundnut from November. The state government will also procure toor, urad and sesame for the first time which will start from December 1.While 86 procurement centres have been set up for purchase of bajra, 38 for moong, 19 for maize, and seven for groundnut purchase in state, 199 procurement centres have also been set up for purchase of paddy.At least 72 additional procurement sites have also been identified as a contingency if there is huge arrival of paddy at the procurement centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-includes-bajra-in-bhavantar-bharpayee-yojana-101632858780547.html
29-09-2021||Pune||World Heart Day: Rise in heart attacks among under-50s, say doctors||PUNE: Doctors and experts have pointed to a worrisome trend on the occasion of World Heart Day celebrated on September 29. They have warned against an increasing number of young people (below 50 years of age) being diagnosed with heart issues. While developing blockages in arteries is natural above 50 years of age, people below 50 years of age developing blockages has become a cause for concern today.Food habits like eating packaged and baked foods containing palm oil, lack of exercise, stress, air pollution etc. are contributing to the early onset of heart-related diseases, doctors said.Dr Sujit Sawadatkar, interventional cardiologist from Noble hospital, said that almost 50% of the heart patients that visit him are youngsters. “When I say youngsters, I mean people who are less than 50 years old. This is a worrisome trend that we are seeing. Building up fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls is natural in the 50+ age group. But witnessing heart issues before 50 years of age is the contribution of certain factors,” he said.Dr Sawadatkar said that most of the packaged food industry uses palm oil. “You take bakery items, icing on cakes, chocolates, or any other packaged food, it has cheap alternatives to healthy oil options and that is not good for heart health. High content of saturated fatty acids and cheap alternatives to healthy oil is damaging to heart health. Also, the younger generation is following a sedentary lifestyle with no proper exercise routine. Factors like stress and air pollution are also contributing in a big way to the early onset of heart diseases. Rampant use of some supplements also has a negative impact on the heart.”Sharing greater insights, Dr Benny Jose, consultant and interventional cardiologist at Jupiter hospital said that heart attacks among youth are on the rise due to lifestyle issues. “A sedentary lifestyle is a major cause for the younger population getting more heart attacks. And this includes food habits. But a person should focus on having a culture of exercise in their daily routine. And with this, healthy food is also important. Risk factors like diabetes, hypertension should not be neglected as these conditions can cause irreversible damage to vascular health,” Dr Jose said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/world-heart-day-rise-in-heart-attacks-among-under-50s-say-doctors-101632858722257.html

29-09-2021||Pune||Incidence of falls among senior citizens can be reduced: SPPU study||PUNE: A recent study conducted by students of the department of health science from Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) has revealed that the increasing incidence of falls among senior citizens can be reined in by performing a few small exercises every day. The study was carried out under the guidance of the head of the department, Aarti Nagarkar and a paper based on it published in the research journal, “Gait and Posture”.Elaborating on the study, Nagarkar said that over the last two years, the health science department studied 800 senior citizens across various socio-economic groups from different parts of Pune. “It appears that many senior citizens have a higher fall rate. Increasing inactivity day by day affects their body and mind. In such cases, the confidence to walk is often lost. This increases the fall rate in and around the house.”Snehal Kulkarni, a student who is part of the study said that senior citizens were examined using sensor-equipped devices. “The device also measured their walking speed, ability to get up and sit down, and the possibility of their falling (in percentage) among other things. We also asked these senior citizens to perform some small activities every day. We asked them to make small changes in their homes. As a result, many senior citizens have increased their walking speed, decreased their dependence on others, and reduced their fall rate,” said Kulkarni.Nitin Karmalkar, vice chancellor, SPPU, said, “Many senior citizens will benefit from this research study. We will continue to conduct such socially useful research at the university.”What to do to avoid falling**Make small changes to some places in the house like fitting handles and installing radium on the steps.**Perform small daily exercises that will increase walking speed and confidence.**Try to increase morale to reduce the fear of falling while walking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/incidence-of-falls-among-senior-citizens-can-be-reduced-sppu-study-101632858420389.html

29-09-2021||Chandigarh||HC: Estranged wife can’t be made to run around to meet financial needs of child||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that an estranged wife can’t be made to run around to meet financial needs of her child.The high court dismissed the plea from the husband, who had challenged an order of a Panchkula family court, which ordered an increase of ₹2,000 to the monthly amount already being given by him.“It is beyond the dignity of a person, mother herein, to keep running for the reimbursement of such expenditure from time to time and therefore, being a parental duty, it is expected of the father to discharge his financial obligation towards the minor daughter, without seeking any account thereof,” the bench of justice Arun Monga said.The husband was giving ₹5,000 per month as ordered earlier by court. In August, acting on the plea from wife, the family court had directed him to pay ₹2, 000 more till the final decision on divorce petition.The increase was ordered after taking into consideration that ₹5,000 was going towards paying the school fee of the couple’s eight-year-old daughter, and more money was required for her upbringing.The husband had argued that he had to take care of his parents too. The court did not accept the argument stating that it was unable to accept that a person of such an educational background (the petitioner holds an MBA degree and works in private sector) cannot afford the expenses of school fee and parental obligations for his daughter. As regards his other responsibilities as a son towards his parents, the same is no ground to be exempted from his parental duties, the court said, dismissing the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hcestranged-wife-can-t-be-made-to-run-around-to-meet-financial-needs-of-child-101632858120963.html

Thus, the government should have started procurement from September 15,” said farm leader Ratan Mann.He said around 50% paddy is ready to harvest but the government seems reluctant to start procurement.As per government figures, this year over 40% area of paddy (5.84 lakh hectare of total 13.64 lakh hectare) is under Parmal varieties. Commission agents said delay in procurement and lifting will create a glut situation in the state mandis.The commission agents are also demanding the government to immediately start procurement to provide relief to farmers.As per reports, harvest of Parmal varieties has already started and farmers said they have no other option but to bring their produce to the mandis.“There is no procurement for the next three days yet most space in the mandis is already occupied and paddy arrival is picking pace with each passing day,” said commission agent Sohan Lal, of Kurukshetra’s Ladwa grain market.Additional chief secretary, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, Haryana Anurag Rastogi confirmed that the government agencies will start paddy procurement in state from October 1 and this year, the government has set a target to procure 60 lakh MT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/paddy-arrival-picks-pace-in-haryana-no-procurement-yet-101632858061509.html

29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Ellenabad assembly bypoll: Another test awaits ruling BJP-JJP alliance||The upcoming Ellenabad assembly bypoll, scheduled in October, will yet again test the standing of the ruling BJP-JJP combine in Haryana, particularly in the wake of the ongoing farmers protest against the three central agri-marketing laws.The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced October 30 as the polling day for Ellenabad assembly bypoll.The assembly seat situated in Sirsa district and bordering Rajasthan had fallen vacant in January after the lone Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) MLA Abhay Chautala had resigned in protest of the three central laws.The ruling alliance had tasted defeat by over 10,000 votes last November when they lost to the Congress in Baroda assembly bypoll, a predominantly rural seat like Ellenabad. The Baroda assembly seat, which had fallen vacant due to the demise of the Congress MLA, was retained by the Congress primarily due to the sway of former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and the resentment among the farming community due to enactment of three central agri-marketing laws.Political analysts said since the BJP-JJP leaders are facing stiff opposition from the farmers, it will be quite difficult for them to effectively canvass and reach out to the electorate.While the ruling alliance will put up a joint candidate, it remains to be seen whether the contestant will be from the BJP or the JJP stable. Analysts said that the ruling party or the alliance generally have an upper hand in the by elections. The BJP-JJP government which have three more years of rule would try to work this factor to their advantage.“Sirsa happens to be the home turf of Chautalas. But JJP leadership and deputy chief minister, Dushyant Chautala have consistently faced protests there. Things won’t be easy for the ruling alliance,” said an expert.Prof Ashutosh Kumar, who teaches political science at Panjab University, Chandigarh, says the assembly by election is much more important for the JJP.“Keeping in view the internecine war between the INLD and its offshoot, the JJP, this would be a litmus test for the JJP on their home ground,” Prof Kumar said.The BJP, which finished runners-up in Ellenabad 2019 assembly elections, getting 29.95% vote share too would be under pressure to perform well, experts said.Pawan Beniwal, a Jat leader who got BJP about 45,000 votes (of the 1.50 lakh votes polled) in 2019 assembly polls, has quit the saffron party earlier this year expressing solidarity with the protesting farmers. He recently joined the Congress.Following the imposition of model code of conduct, the EC ordered that no fresh release of funds under the MPLAD or MLA local area development will be made in the part of Sirsa where the Ellenabad assembly constituency is situated till the election process gets over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ellenabad-assembly-bypoll-another-test-awaits-ruling-bjp-jjp-alliance-101632857040387.html

A specialised investigation wing, it has got the necessary approvals, confirmed a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named. Chandigarh Police already have two investigation wings — the crime branch in Sector 11 and operation cell in Sector 26. The crime branch deals with heinous crimes reported in the city. “The district crime cell is being created for effective supervision. Its need was felt in the wake of increased crime and movement of gangsters in the city,” said the officer.The cell will be entrusted with investigation of crimes reported in the city and will be expected to not just ensure early detection but also keep a tab on activities of gangsters and their sympathisers. According to the plans, an inspector will head the cell, which will directly report to the senior superintendent of police. About 40 police personnel from different units and wings have been already shortlisted to work in the cell, said the officer. The cell will soon be allotted an office, for which three places have been shortlisted. The staff will be equipped with latest technology and will also work on developing human intelligence network. The one-member police reform commission headed by former IPS officer KB Singh, in a report submitted on August 29, had recommended separation of the investigation and law-and-order wings of Chandigarh Police for better efficiency. The report stated that when the same personnel are assigned investigations and law-and-order duties, it has a cascading effect on the probe and leads to delays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-police-to-carve-out-crime-cell-to-speed-up-probes-101632856680899.html

29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh gets ₹520-crore fund boost this fiscal||The Centre has lifted the 20% mandatory cut on the Chandigarh administration’s spending that was imposed as part of austerity measures amid the Covid-19 pandemic last year.The move will add at least ₹520 crore more in the UT’s kitty this fiscal, and boost development works being executed by both Chandigarh administration and municipal corporation. The administration has recently proposed to increase the grant-in-aid (GIA) for the municipal corporation by 40% this fiscal — from ₹502 crore to ₹700 crore. The revised estimates are to be submitted with the Union government for its approval. Confirming the development, UT adviser Dharam Pal said: “The municipal corporation has been requesting additional funds. We will consider enhanced support to them with the cut being revoked.” The news comes with less than two months to go for municipal elections, and could work in favour of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.Starting the current fiscal with a deficit budget of ₹670 crore, the MC received its full dues without the mandated 20% cut in the first two quarters. It has received around ₹250 crore so far. Meanwhile, its finances received a major setback when the administration decided to stay the hike in water tariff till March 2022. Its demand for ₹90 crore compensation for loss of revenue was also denied.‘Will have positive impact on all projects’Meanwhile, with enhanced spending power, the UT administration also looks forward to push its development projects.This fiscal, there was only a marginal increase of 0.93% ( ₹48 crore) in the budget estimates from ₹5138.10 crore in 2020-2021 to ₹5186.12 crore in 2021-2022. The increase in capital expenditure by 25% in the budget was nullified because of the cut. The 20% cut in the first two fiscals had forced the administration to focus on meeting revenue expenditure (on wages, salaries and committed liabilities), due to which most development works had come to a halt. “(Lifting of cut) will have positive impact on all projects. More funds will be available. Monthly expenditure has gone up by 20%. In the remaining financial year, we will be able to spend more on development schemes,” said the adviser. “We have received the circular today. In the coming week, we will examine which projects are to speeded up and which to be expanded as we have more funds with us,” he said. For instance, horticulture and engineering department works are likely to get additional support. The administration is also working on seeking the funds cut in the first two quarters. “We may reflect it in the revised estimates to be submitted with Union government,” said Pal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-gets-520-crore-fund-boost-this-fiscal-101632856443548.html

Sultana, who was among the ministers retained from the previous Capt Amarinder Singh government, gave her resignation after meeting Sidhu at his Patiala residence to “express solidarity” with him. “Sidhu Sahab is a man of principles. He is fighting for Punjab and Punjabiyat,” Sultana said in her resignation letter addressed to chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, adding that she would continue to work for the party as a worker. Her resignation came just hours after she was given the charge of water supply and sanitation, social security, women and child development and printing and stationery departments. Sultana and her husband, retired IPS officer Mohammad Mustafa, are considered close to Sidhu. Mustafa is a principal strategic adviser to Sidhu. Punjab Congress general secretary Yoginder Dhingra and treasurer Gulzar Inder Singh Chahal also tendered their resignations. Dhinga and Chahal were appointed by the All India Congress Committee on September 21 after Sidhu recommended their names. Earlier, Sidhu’s media adviser Surinder Dalla said that he (PPCC chief) was not interested in any post. “He has resigned to focus on his Punjab agenda and the 18-point to do list given by the high command. He is not power hungry,” he said.

29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu an ‘unstable’ man, preparing ground to join another party: Capt||Former Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said Navjot Sidhu’s resignation as the state Congress chief within two months of taking over the vital post had proved beyond doubt that the cricketer-turned-politician was an “unstable” man, who could not be relied upon to lead the ruling party, especially in a border state like Punjab. Terming Sidhu’s resignation a sheer drama, Capt Amarinder said the move suggested that his former cabinet colleague was preparing the ground to quit the Congress and join hands with someone other party in the run-up to the state assembly polls. “I had been saying all along that this man is unstable and dangerous, and cannot be entrusted with the task of running Punjab,” he claimed, adding that Sidhu had also proved to be absolutely incompetent during his stint as a minister in his government. Amarinder, who reached Delhi on a personal visit, told reporters at the airport that Punjab is a sensitive state, sharing over 600km of border with a hostile Pakistan, alleging that Sidhu’s close links with his cricketer friend Imran Khan and ISI chief Qamar Javed Bajwa are a serious threat to India’s national security. He said that by resigning within two months of taking over as the PPCC chief, Sidhu had once again exhibited his “shifty” character. “I’ve know this boy since his childhood and he has been a loner and can never be a team player,” said Amarinder, recalling how the cricketer had deserted the Indian team in 1996 in England. “That’s what his real character is,” said the former CM. Describing Sidhu as a “flamboyant” speaker, Amarinder said what he speaks in public meetings or rallies may make people laugh, but it is all froth with no substance. “People don’t vote for buffoonery,” he said, adding that no one take him (Sidhu) seriously. Replying to a question that Sidhu was apparently upset with the inclusion of certain ministers in Charanjit Singh Channi’s cabinet, Amarinder said that the PPCC chief apparently wanted to run the government by remote control. “What nonsense is this! Cabinet formation is the prerogative of the chief minister, so why should Sidhu interfere in it,” he quipped. On Sidhu’s claim that he was quitting as the party chief on matters of principle, Amarinder quipped: “What principles is he talking about? He’s only making grounds to quit the Congress. You wait and see, he will join hands with some other party very soon.” Replying to a question, the former CM said the Congress high command should immediately accept Sidhu’s resignation and appoint some competent man in his place. When asked if he would back former PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar for the job, Amarinder said: “He (Jakhar) is very competent and had performed exceeding well as the party chief.” The former CM also scotched speculation that he was in Delhi to meet senior BJP leaders. “I have come on a personal visit, with the main intent of vacating the Kapurthala House for the new CM,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-an-unstable-man-preparing-ground-to-join-another-party-capt-101632856023097.html

The Minister on his part has already refuted allegations against him and filed a Rs100 crore defamation suit against Somaiya in A local court. According to Mushrif’s lawyer, the suit has been filed in Kolhapur court in which BJP state president Chandrakant Patil has also been made a respondent. After arriving in Kolhapur district, Somaiya visited the Murgud police station and submitted a complaint application saying if the police do not take action on his application in the next seven days, he will approach the court. “I will wait for seven days to see what action police take. If there is no action, I will approach the court,” said Somaiya while speaking to reporters. Claiming to expose one more scam of Mushrif worth ₹1,500 crore, Somaiya said that Mushrif in the capacity of rural development minister had given a tender worth ₹1,500 crore to a company linked to his son-in-law. He said that the tender given to the firm was related to filing tax returns and TDS filings of gram panchayats in the state. “The tender was given to the firm, which did not have any prior experience of filing GST, TDS, and tax returns,” Somaiya claimed. Earlier on Monday, Kolhapur district Collector Rahul Rekhawar had withdrawn his previous order prohibiting BJP leader Kirit Somaiya from entering Kolhapur district. The fresh order allowed Somaiya to enter Kolhapur district on Tuesday. On September 20, Somaiya claimed he was stopped and detained by police at Karad in western Maharashtra while he was on way to Kolhapur, after the district authorities cited law and order as well as security concerns following his allegations of corruption against Mushrif. His detention preceded high drama in Mumbai where Somaiya was asked by police not to venture out of his residence citing the Kolhapur administration’s order. The Sena distanced itself from the action saying directions were issued by Home department which is under Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

29-09-2021||Lucknow||Balbeer Giri to be Mahant Narendra Giri’s successor||PRAYAGRAJ: Respecting the last wishes of president of Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) Mahant Narendra Giri in his last will dated June 4, 2020 as well as in the purported suicide note found next to his body, office-bearers of Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani have decided to appoint Narendra Giri’s disciple Balbeer Giri as his successor. The akhada would perform the ceremony to appoint Balbeer as the next Pithadishwar (head) of Baghambari Gaddi Math on October 5, informed Niranjani akhada office-bearers. General secretary of Niranjani Akhada, Mahant Ravindra Puri said on Tuesday, “As in the last will of Maharaj ji (Narendra Giri), Balbeer Giri has been named as his successor and the same wish has been mentioned in the suicide note as well in his last video recording found on his cell phone before committing suicide, it has been decided that his wishes would be honoured and Balbeer would be made the next head of Bagamabari Math.” The ceremony would be held at the Math on October 5, he added. Narendra Giri had made a will on January 7, 2010 wherein he had named Balbeer Giri as his successor, but he changed his will on August 29, 2011 and named Anand Giri as his successor. He again changed his will on June 4, 2020, which is his last will as per his lawyer Rishi Shankar Dwivedi, wherein Balbeer Giri has been named as his successor. Mahant Ravindra Puri said that senior seers of the 13 Akhadas along with respectable individuals of the society, officials of the district administration and others would be invited for the “pattaabhishek” (anointing) ceremony which is scheduled to take place on October 5. The ceremony would coincide with ‘Shodashi’ of Narendra Giri, rituals performed on the 16th day of the passing away of a saint. Interestingly, Balbeer Giri would not only head the Baghambari Math but also the Bade Hanuman temple near Sangam, as its new Acharya. Mahant Ravindra Puri also informed that a five-member ‘supervisory board’ would look after the working of the Math. For all the major decisions, like selling or purchase of land etc, the future head of the Math would have to get approval of this five-member administrative body. “This all-important body would include members from Nirnjani Akhada only. Besides me (Ravindra Puri), the other members would be Mahant Dinesh Giri, Mahant Omkar Giri, Keshav Puri and Mahant Har Govind Puri”, informed Ravindra Puri. “We are following the set practices and traditions of the Akhada and all the decision are in strict accordance with it,” he explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/balbeer-giri-to-be-mahant-narendra-s-giri-s-successor-101632855180093.html
29-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad family’s wait ends as body of Indian Army soldier brought home after 16 years||For 16 years, the family of missing Indian Army’s Lance Naik Amrish Tyagi did not perform his last rites and shraadh (ceremony performed in honour of a dead ancestor) in the hope that he will return home one day. Tyagi and three other soldiers went missing after an accident while they were returning from an expedition at a mountain peak above Joshimath on September 23, 2005.Coincidentally, his body was discovered by the army exactly 16 years later on September 23, 2021, in Harshil sector of Uttarakhand and handed over to his family.His family cremated the body on Tuesday at his village Hisali in Ghaziabad’s Muradnagar.Hisali village is located about nine kilometres from the district headquarters in Ghaziabad.“He was about 26 years old when he went missing during the expedition. The bodies of three of his colleagues were found soon after. A couple of days ago, some officials came home and told us that they recovered his body in the snow in the Harshil sector. He was identified with the help of documents found on the body,” said Vinesh Tyagi, Amrish Tyagi’s brother.Amrish Tyagi was the youngest of four brothers and a sister and got married about one-and-a-half years before he met with the accident. His wife was pregnant when he went missing.“All these years we did not lose hope and did not perform any last rites. We did not even perform his shraadh, hoping that he was alive. But now, having received his body, we are content that his soul will rest in peace. His wife gave birth to a daughter about five months after the incident. When he did not return, her parents got her remarried about a year later,” Vinesh Tyagi added.Amrish Tyagi served with the army ordnance corps.“He was an avid mountaineer and was returning from an expedition from a peak above Joshimath. While climbing down, all four personnel met with an accident and fell into a deep trench. Three bodies were recovered. On Tuesday, senior officers from the Babugarh cantonment arrived for his cremation while soldiers from the Bihar regiment brought his body from Uttarakhand,” said Colonel Devender Tyagi, a resident of Hisali.“His father is no more but he served the Indian Army as Naib Subedar and, like him, Amrish too joined the army to serve the country... Ours is a small village with a population of about 1200 but many people here have served and serving the defence forces,” Colonel Tyagi added.Hundreds of young men and locals from Hisali and neighbouring villages joined the procession as an army truck brought Amrish Tyagi’s body to his village.His cremation was performed later in the day by two of his nephews.“His daughter and his wife also arrived home on Tuesday and all were in tears. We are still on good terms with the family into which she remarried. Our mother passed away about four years ago in the hope that she will be able to see Amrish again. She used to be anxious in case someone arrived at the door and would think that her son had returned. She even started resisting the idea of any child from our family wanting to join the army. She was so upset that her son had not returned all these years,” Vinesh Tyagi said. “My brother was a lively man and popular among his friends. They all attended his cremation on Tuesday,” he added.Aditya Prajapati, sub-divisional magistrate of Modinagar, was also present during the cremation on Tuesday. “The cremation was performed with full military honours after the body arrived at Hisali village. His body was discovered exactly 16 years after he went missing following the accident,” Prajapati said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-family-s-wait-ends-as-body-of-indian-army-soldier-brought-home-after-16-years-101632855060215.html
29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Naraingarh Sugar Mills workers end strike||The workers of Naraingarh Sugar Mills ended their indefinite strike after about 16 days on Tuesday following the assurance of hike in salary and acceptance of their other demands, Naraingarh subdivisional magistrate Niraj said. Their protest ended weeks before the commencement of the sugarcane crushing season. The consensus was reached after the mill workers’ union and farmers from Ambala and Panchkula gathered near the mill under the leadership of senior Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Gurnam Singh Charuni. Additional cane commissioner to Haryana agriculture department, JS Brar, SDM Niraj and mill owner Rahul Anand also reached the spot later. Charuni said the farmers had earlier sought from the administration arrangement of a meeting with the state government to discuss the issue of pending dues worth ₹66 crore and crop loans worth ₹33 crore taken in the name of farmers, but they couldn’t. “We can’t rely on the mill owners for our pending dues. We want to meet the government to convince it to take over the mill or sell it. We are giving an ultimatum till October 4 to find a solution else the cane commissioner’s office will be surrounded the next day. We’ll repeat the Karnal scenario and won’t allow any movement in the office,” the leader said.Charuni also asked the owners to ensure that the mill starts functioning by November 25 after the workers’ demands are met. The farmers were scheduled to gherao the cane commissioner’s office in Panchkula on Tuesday, but postponed it after an assurance by the owner. SDM Niraj said the mill management has also agreed to providing funds for the maintenance and other needs, and the mill is expected to start on time. Naraingarh deputy commissioner Vikram said, “Government officials are here to oversee the mill functioning, but the dues have to be arranged by the owner. We’ll try to convene a meeting between the government and workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/naraingarh-sugar-mills-workers-end-strike-101632855000315.html
29-09-2021||Noida||Mihir Bhoj row: UP CM’s name on plaque smeared with black paint||Tension prevailed in the Dadri area of Greater Noida on Tuesday after the name of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath was allegedly smeared with black paint on a plaque installed below the statue of ninth-century king Mihir Bhoj at a local college. Adityanath unveiled the 15-foot statue of the king on September 22.According to a video that emerged on social media, besides the chief minister’s, the names of Rajya Sabha MP Surendra Singh Nagar and Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar, both leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, were also blackened on the plaque. HT has not independently verified the authenticity of the video.After the alleged incident, there is heavy police deployment at Mihir Bhoj PG College that houses the statue. Police said they are probing the incident. “We have filed an FIR against unknown persons for painting the plaque black. There was no police deployment when the incident happened, but now police have been deployed,” said Abhishek (known by his first name), deputy commissioner of police, Gautam Budh Nagar.Row over caste of Mihir BhojSince the inauguration of Mihir Bhoj’s statue, the Gurjar community has been protesting against the removal of their caste’s name from the plaque installed below the statue. The community leaders maintain that the king belonged to the Gurjar community. The Rajput community has also claimed that the ninth-century king belonged to their caste.The alleged blackening of the leaders’ names on the plaque took place after Rajya Sabha MP Surendra Nagar visited the statue and paid tribute to king Mihir Bhoj on Tuesday morning. Nagar, who belongs to the Gurjar community, also shared a picture of himself standing next to the statue on Twitter.“This is not an issue at all because the word ‘Gurjar’ was always there on the plaque, and our community is completely happy with the party. Some opposition parties are making it an issue to garner votes in the upcoming assembly polls but they will not succeed in their negative campaign,” said Nagar after paying tributes around 5am.However, Nagar’s efforts are seemingly not enough to convince agitated Gurjars to call off their campaign against the BJP. “Now, they (BJP leaders) have written ‘Gurjar’ before king Mihir Bhoj. But why was it omitted during the CM’s visit? We can stop our protest only if the state government issues a notification officially announcing that ‘Gurjar’ is added to king Mihir Bhoj’s name. We have also called a national level meeting at the Greater Noida’s institute on October 2 to decide on our future course of action,” said Navin Bhati, a member of Rashtriya Gurjar Swabhiman Samiti formed to fight for the cause, and national president of Akhil Bhartiya Gurjar Front.Meanwhile, the Rajput community also planned a panchayat on Sunday after they learnt that the word “Gurjar” was again added to the name of king Mihir Bhoj on the plaque.“They are distorting history without any basis. We cannot let it happen. We have called a panchayat on this issue to fight for justice,” said Prithivi Singh, national secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha.Meanwhile, Kunwar Arunoday Singh Parihar, prince of Madhya Pradesh’s Nagod estate who claims to be a descendant of king Mihir Bhoj, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to do justice to this issue on the basis of facts.“Only the government can stop the distortion of Rajput history. We believe that a great man belongs to everyone and Mihir Bhoj was made a Samrat in the ninth century by all castes, not one. But that cannot change his caste. My family feels humiliated by these events and when people say such a great warrior was not a Rajput. I request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stop this practice. People should understand that ‘Gurjar’ has been used in history to refer to a place, not caste,” said Parihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mihir-bhoj-row-up-cm-s-name-on-plaque-smeared-with-black-paint-101632854820357.html

Officials from the district health department said that they have asked the district hospital authorities to take immediate action.The district hospital at Sanjay Nagar has a special 10-bed dengue ward.Several teams from the Centre also found dengue larvae at two private hospitals in the district, the officials said, adding that they have doubled the strength of inspection teams to 50 from 25. “We conducted an inspection of the Sanjay Nagar hospital on Monday and found five breeding sites in air coolers. The hospital authorities have been found erring in this connection for the past four years in a row. We have asked them to take immediate corrective steps. If they fail to do so, we will serve them a notice and also impose a penalty of ₹5,000 per instance,” said GK Mishra, district malaria officer. According to the official figures, 23 new cases of dengue emerged on Tuesday, taking the tally to 275 in the district, while the total count for malaria and scrub typhus cases stood at 15 and 39, respectively. Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of the Sanjay Nagar district hospital, said, “We have given directions to immediately dry up all 25 air coolers in the hospital. Though we maintain the coolers regularly, it is because of frequent rain that water gets filled up. But the coolers have been cleaned now.” The district malaria officer said that apart from the local teams, several teams from the Centre are also carrying out inspections. “These teams found breeding of dengue mosquitoes inside the flower pots at two private hospitals, one at Mohan Nagar and the other at Vaishali. Corrective measures were taken up by them,” Mishra said. According to the officials, they have so far identified about 6,000 dengue larvae breeding sites across the city. “Of these 6,000 instances, we have issued notices in about 2,500, and all of them have complied. The major hotspots are at Govindpuram, Harsaon, Vijay Nagar and Sahibabad, among others. Starting Wednesday, we will start inspection of all police stations,” Mishra added. According to the officials, the first dengue case this year was detected on September 1. In the past 28 days, the tally reached 275. Of the 275 cases, 198 patients required admission in hospitals, they said, adding the hospitalisation rate is about 72%. According to the official figures, the number of dengue cases was 621 in 2016, 232 in 2017, 68 in 2018, 88 in 2019 and 15 in 2020. The number of cases spiked in September 2021, with Ghaziabad recording the first 100 cases on September 15, and the next 100 within nine days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/district-hospital-among-dengue-mosquito-breeding-sites-in-ghaziabad-101632854761062.html
29-09-2021||Noida||Monsoon census 2021: More sarus cranes spotted in Gautam Budh Nagar||In a positive indicator of urban wildlife in Gautam Budh Nagar, the wetlands and agricultural areas in the district now have more numbers of sarus cranes -- the world’s tallest flying bird and the state bird of Uttar Pradesh -- as compared to three months ago, revealed a day-long monsoon census conducted by the forest department on Monday.According to the census, the divisional forest department of Gautam Budh Nagar counted a total of 170 sarus cranes -- 129 adults and 41 juveniles -- in seven habitats, mostly rural and agricultural areas in the district, with a wetland nearby. The maximum number of sarus cranes -- 84 -- was counted in Dhanauri wetland, followed by Parsol (32), Rawani Bujurg (17), Eshepur (14), Khodna Khurd (12), Nagala Bhatona (9), and Aakilpur (2), all villages in Greater Noida.In June 2021, the district forest department conducted a summer census wherein the officials recorded a total of 142 sarus cranes -- 122 adults and 18 chicks -- across five forest ranges and wetlands in Gautam Budh Nagar. In June 2019, the foresters counted a total of 140 sarus cranes -- 114 adults and 26 chicks in the district.“A good thing is that the total number of sarus cranes in the district has increased, and sarus roost has also been recognised at some new places. This will help us assess their presence and distribution in a better and more efficient manner,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Experts said the rise in the number of sarus cranes is a good sign of habitat health, and that there must be “more sarus cranes in the district and September is not the best time to conduct such a census”. “Based on what we observed earlier, there must be more than 200 sarus cranes in the district. Also, this is perhaps not the right time for a sarus census and the forest department should conduct the exercise around March or April, to get an accurate picture. Around April, the flocks roost in a very large number at one place and are not scattered as most of the wetlands are drying up. Also, the chicks that hatch around September-end have almost become juvenile. The department must hold the census twice a year, including once in April too,” said Anand Arya, a Noida-based birder who was among the birders who found Dhanauri, and initiated a legal battle in 2014 for its recognition and conservation. Sarus cranes are listed ‘vulnerable’ under the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, with human activities, habitat loss, predation by feral dogs, mongoose and snakes, and hunting among the major threats. As of 2017, there is an estimated population of 8,000 sarus cranes in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/monsoon-census-2021-more-sarus-cranes-spotted-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101632854700187.html

The victim, Colonel SPS Yadav (Retd), is a resident of Arun Vihar in Noida’s Sector 29. In his complaint with the cyber police, Yadav said on June 2, his wife found a restaurant’s number on the internet and dialled the number to order food. “When the suspect on the phone line asked for mode of payment, my wife shared the debit card details. I got suspicious when the man started seeking more details and stopped my wife from giving away more information,” said Yadav, adding that no one came to deliver food that afternoon. In the evening, Yadav said, the suspect, identified as Rahul, again called his wife and pretended to be a bank official. “He asked if she had made a transaction of ₹44,000 from her bank account. He said the transaction had come to him for clearance and that he was withholding it. The suspect asked for the details of another bank account, assuring that he would transfer ₹44,000 in that account.”The woman believed the suspect and shared her husband’s bank details. The suspect fraudulently withdrew ₹3.5 lakh from Yadav’s account. Yadav then informed the bank and blocked his account and also lodged a complaint with the cyber cell, Noida, the same day. The cyber cell investigated the matter and directed the police to register an FIR in this case on September 26. Munish Chauhan, station house inspector, Sector 20 police station, said that a case has been registered against the suspect under IPC Section 420 (cheating) and Section 66D of the Information Technology Act on Monday, and a probe is underway.Asked about the delay in registering an FIR in the case, Baljeet Singh, inspector of cyber cell Noida, said, “We screen the complaints and investigate only cyber-related complaints. The screening and probe sometimes takes time... People should visit police stations and file complaints related to cyber fraud.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-retired-colonel-loses-3-5-lakh-to-online-fraud-101632854580057.html

He said people must continue to take preventive measures. “These days, we see dengue cases well into October and November, so people must be careful and check for mosquito breeding in their houses and neighbourhoods. We also need to remember that Covid-19 is not over; everyone should continue wearing masks and maintain social distance. Scientists have said that there could be a third wave in October and November,” he said.

I don’t know what happened on Sunday night that he killed his mother.”Amarjit Deb was produced to court on Monday and was sent to police remand for further investigations. Sumati Deb’s dead body was sent to Silchar Medical College and Hospital on Monday for post mortem.While Amarjit Deb was taken to court, local reporters tried to get his reaction. He said, “My mother was mentally imbalanced, when I reached home tired that day, she started talking nonsense. It angered me and I lost control.” He said he didn’t regret what he did.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-man-beats-ailing-mother-to-death-arrested-after-father-lodges-fir-101632854161802.html
29-09-2021||Bhopal||‘Met at a coffee shop?’ BJP MLA provokes protests over Akbar-Jodhabai message||Bhopal/Jaipur: Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker in Madhya Pradesh Rameshwar Sharma touched off a controversy with his remarks on the nature of relationship between Mughal emperor Akbar and Jodhabai, provoking loud protests from Rajput groups not just in the state but in neighbouring Rajasthan as well.Security arrangements at the BJP office in Bhopal were also beefed up after Rajput community members called for a protest outside the premisesIn a video of his speech at a function in Sagar district, Rameshwar Sharma, a lawmaker from Huzur in Bhopal district, is heard suggesting that the relationship between the Mughal emperor and daughter of a Rajput king was based on a political alliance.“There was no love between Jodha and Akbar” he said, and joking asked whether Akhbar and Jodha would have met in a gym, a college or coffee shop. “There was no love between them and some power-hungry people put life of their daughter at stake for power. We should be aware of such people as they are a threat to our religion,” he said, in the video. Jodhabai was daughter of Rajput king Bharmel of Ajmer in Rajasthan.Rajput organisations in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan promptly objected to his references to Jodhabai in the video. HT cannot verify the authenticity of the video.Sharma, who has often landed himself in controversies with his statements, apologized for his choice of words, asserting that he meant to criticize the Mughals for their policy of divide and rule and his intention was not to hurt sentiments of any community. The apology, however, hasn’t pacified the community who want senior BJP leaders to take action against him for hurting their sentiments and distorting history.“It is unfortunate that people are distorting history. I don’t understand why efforts are being made to distort history politically and socially,” said Rajput Karni Sena (RKS) chief, Lokendra Singh Kalvi in neighbouring Rajasthan.Kalvi said people who made history sacrificed a lot. “We can’t tolerate this insult,” he added. Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya Mahasabha national media in-charge Shyam Singh Tomar said, “Apology is not enough. BJP should take action against him so that nobody will ever dare to make such a loose comment.” Congress leaders also jumped in,“Rajputs always fought with invaders to secure our land. By calling them power-hungry people, BJP MLA not only insulted a king but the whole community. BJP should clear its stand,” tweeted MP Congress spokesperson Narendra Saluja.The BJP stood by Sharma’s intent, insisting that he was trying to highlight love-jehad issue. BJP media in-charge Lokendra Parashar said, “MLA Rameshwar Sharma’s intention was to say that Mughals used to divide Hindus but he might have used wrong words. They had made such condition that a Rajput king had to solemnize the marriage of his daughter with Akbar. Even Jodhabai was against it. We are very clear that Maharana Pratap was a great person, not Akbar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/met-at-a-coffee-shop-bjp-mla-provokes-protests-over-akbar-jodhabai-message-101632854160501.html

29-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police unveil plan to enhance security at courts||Security at Delhi’s seven district courts will be upgraded on par with that of the Delhi high court, Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana said on Tuesday, announcing a slew of measures such as deploying paramilitary personnel and regular security audits to enhance safety.The decision to upgrade the security at the seven courts -- Tis Hazari, Rouse Avenue, Karkardooma, Rohini, Saket, Patiala House and Dwarka -- comes following a sensational shootout inside a courtroom at Rohini district court on Friday in which notorious gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi was killed. The police gunned down the two shooters who came in a lawyer’s attire to gain entry into the court.Asthana said deployment of security personnel will be increased both inside and outside court. “The ratio of policemen deployed on the premises will be increased in proportion with the number of visitors. We will also deploy adequate paramilitary personnel, which we get for different purposes from the Centre, for security at the courts. Now, all the deployment of forces will be decided by the security cell of the police headquarters. Our officials are already on the job to determine what level of security will be needed for the district courts. The method of frisking and issuing entry passes will be made stringent like the high court,” he said.Asthana added a Protection Review Group (PRG) will be constituted to review the security arrangements for district and subordinate courts, as well as judges. “The security measures will be reviewed regularly by PRG members. We will also regularly audit security at these courts. During reviews, the requisition of manpower and equipment will be checked. This will help the police in modifying the security measures as per emerging needs,” Asthana said.Asthana, who visited the Rohini court on Sunday and talked to the security personnel there, said the Delhi Police has planned to install more CCTV cameras, both inside and outside the court premises. “So far, the Delhi Police could only install CCTV cameras outside the court premises, and the court management arranged cameras inside the premises. We have informally consulted judicial officers and different district bar associations in this connection, and hope that they will approve the police handling on-premises cameras too,” he said.The police commissioner added that additional measures and stricter monitoring will done during the court visits of “high target” prisoners. “We have requested the district courts to prefer hearings through video-conferencing for such prisoners,” he said.Following the shootout on Friday, many advocate groups met Delhi Police officers and demanded enhanced security at the court premises.Mrityunjai Singh, a lawyer who practices at Karkardooma court, said in the recent times, the district courts have become a ‘good’ place for the undertrials. “They mingle with their friends and families without any restrictions. Unlike the high court, district courts are not provided with the same level of security. It’s easy for them to give a slip to the authorities,” he said.In contrast, entry inside the high court is allowed only when a person produces a valid visiting card. To enter the courtrooms, the visitors (barring police, lawyers and court staff) must get a pass issued before entering the court room.Welcoming the move, Rakesh Sehrawat, chairman of Bar Council of Delhi, said it is important to tighten security at the district courts.“Friday’s incident was shocking for the whole Delhi. We’ve met the police chief in this connection and he has assured us about deployment of more police forces. He has also assured that the best quality of metal detectors will be installed in the court premises. It will definitely ensure security to the judges, magistrates, lawyers, visitors and prisoners,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rohini-shooting-delhi-police-unveils-plan-for-better-security-at-city-courts-101632853630828.html
29-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Social, civic responsibilities in focus in deshbhakti class||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday launched the Deshbhakti curriculum for students studying in over 1,030 Delhi government schools in the Capital with an aim to produce “staunch patriots” instead of “moneymaking machines”, to promote development in the country.Under the Deshbhakti curriculum, Delhi government school teachers will work from Wednesday on instilling a sense of patriotism among students by using classroom activities such as making and carrying flags and encouraging students to explore the idea of India and their love for the country.The larger objective was spelled out in the budget speech by finance minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, in March, when he said that the curriculum is aimed at making “responsible citizens who will contribute to nation-building”.The curriculum framework released in August stated that it builds on interdisciplinary themes of civic literacy, environmental literacy, and global awareness.“Deshbhakti curriculum actively seeks to build a sense of belongingness, ownership, and responsibility towards the nation among students, which would also inspire them to make necessary sacrifices for the country. These values are sought to be developed in students by facilitating critical and creative thinking skills rather than by coercion,” the curriculum framework stated.In the curriculum released on Tuesday, teachers have been asked to share worksheets through WhatsApp on social issues around children such as elderly abuse, harassment of women, discrimination against people on the basis of caste, religion, or gender, not paying taxes, selling adulterated goods, travelling in buses or trains without tickets, or seeing someone spit on the roads.Students will discuss these questions with their family members and acquaintances, record their observations in their diary, and share them in the class. According to the curriculum, the goal is for students to realise the misuse of resources in the country, and what can be done to improve the condition.“While we feel patriotic when listening to stories of our freedom fighters or hear the national anthem, or see the Tricolour, it does not happen quite often. The goal is to create an atmosphere in which a child can spend 24 hours of a day basking in the feeling of patriotism. No matter what we do, everyone, including adults, should remember that they do it for the country,” said Kejriwal.“Instead of training moneymaking machines who think about earning more money, we have to create kattar deshbhakts (staunch patriots) who work for the betterment of the country and its citizens.”Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said it “took two years to prepare the content due to Covid-19 pandemic”.“...the curriculum will create patriotic passion among students and not engage in moral preaching on what a patriot should or should not do. Children would be encouraged to look within themselves and be inspired through the stories of our freedom fighters such as Bhagat Singh who was hanged at 23 and understand their love for the country. We will bring this passion in the hearts of students studying in classes 6 to 7,” he said.The curriculum has been divided into three sections -- from nursery to Class 6; classes 6 to 8 and classes 9 to 12 — with the Delhi government releasing the latter two segments on Monday. The curriculum for the first group will be released when schools reopen for them. Currently, students in classes 9 to 12 are allowed to come to school for in-person classes. Delhi Disaster Management Authority officials are expected to discuss the reopening of schools for classes 6 to 8 on Wednesday.On September 23, HT reported that there will be one Deshbhakti period every day for students from nursery to Class 8; and two sessions per week for those in classes 9 to 12.Teachers have been asked to act as facilitators, and allow students time to ponder over questions and refrain from giving their views on the answers given by the children.Anju Rohilla, who is the Deshbhakti nodal teacher for SKV Uttam Nagar, said, “Learning will be through discussions and all views will be heard. While the teacher will not give their own views, their peers will be allowed to discuss every student’s idea of country, patriotism, and love for the country. So if a student’s idea of patriotism works against the spirit of diversity of the country, we plan to ask more probing questions which would lead to the student realising that any kind of discrimination or violence would not count as patriotism or love for the country...”Parents welcome moveMost parents that HT spoke to said that they weren’t aware of the details of the curriculum but welcomed it as a positive step to inculcate a love for the country among children.Siya Sharan, a parent of a Class 12 government school student, said, “We need the curriculum because children are getting detached from their culture and history. Planting trees or helping their fellow citizens is also a part of patriotism and only if we teach these things in schools from a young age, will students truly imbibe them. Casteism and religious divide have been a problem for too long in our country and if the curriculum addresses these issues in the school itself, it is a welcome step.”‘Inspiring stories’Sisodia said the idea of sharing these “inspiring stories” is to encourage students to think about the circumstances of the freedom fighters and how they strived for the country’s freedom despite adversities.For classes 9 to 12, teachers will facilitate group discussions on topics such as the contribution of freedom fighters and activities such as identifying the different feelings if one steps on a book, water bottle, cricket bat, or the Tricolour; the respect accorded to farmers and parents of those in the armed forces; and the workers who build our cities. The students will also be asked to reflect on the diversity of the country.The classroom learning will involve asking senior students to reflect on these questions and then note them down in their Deshbhakti diary.However, DU professor Apoorvanand was critical of the concept. He said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) should not bring “political battle to classrooms” and “trivialise the enterprise of education”.“I understand the political compulsion to introduce the curriculum as the party is competing with other parties to show who is more patriotic. But I feel it is unfair to bring this in classrooms,” he said.The curriculumThe teacher’s manual for classes 6 to 8 has seven chapters and that for classes 9 to 12 comprises five chapters.The chapters advise discussions on topics such as “difference between love for the country and respect for the country”, “who is a patriot and what constitutes patriotism”, and questions on why the country is lagging behind in terms of development even after 75 years of Independence, and what it would take to build the “country of our dreams”.Students will also maintain a Deshbhakti diary to record their reflections during these classes and to record their homework, including responses from elders around them.Among the different activities prescribed for classes 6 to 8 are writing a letter, story, poem, or article on India after a discussion on the reasons to be proud of the country.The students have also been asked to approach elder family members and acquaintances and ask them what they mean when they say they love the country.Some activities also ask students to reflect on the shortcomings of the country, such as rising poverty, unemployment, growing population, casteism, corruption, illiteracy, child marriage, child labour, and lack of clean water and electricity.The curriculum will also discuss India’s freedom struggle along with stories and contributions of 100 freedom fighters, including Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Uddham Singh, Ashfaqullah Khan, BR Ambedkar, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Savitri Bai Phule, Birsa Munda, Mangal Pandey, and even publications of revolutionary papers Swaraj and Amrit Bazar Patrika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cm-kejriwal-launches-deshbhakti-curriculum-in-delhi-govt-schools-101632853560188.html
29-09-2021||Delhi||DDMA meet on further reopening of schools, restrictions for festival||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) will meet on Wednesday to discuss further phased re-opening of schools in the city and the regulations to be put in place ahead of Dussehra and Durga Puja festivals in the coming weeks.“The meeting is scheduled at 10.30am (on Wednesday). Discussions will take place on schools and festivals in the coming weeks,” said a senior DDMA official on Wednesday.Currently, schools and coaching centres in Delhi are open for classes 9 to 12 though online learning facilities are also available for students whose parents do not wish to send them to schools due to Covid fears.Several parents’ groups have demanded restarting physical sessions for students of classes 6-8 in the Capital.Dussehra falls on October 15 and Durga Puja festivities will start from October 11, with the days preceding the festivals often marked by large crowds in market places as people step out for shopping, eating, and entertainment.Last year, the government allowed Durga Puja committees to conduct the rituals but did not allow visitors to the pandals. Dussehra too was allowed in a few locations with a cap on visitors, and enforcement teams were deployed at the venues.Since Durga Puja last year, Delhi has witnessed two Covid waves -- in November 2020, cases peaked at an average 8,000 cases per day, while April this year saw an average peak of around 24,000 cases per day, which left the city’s healthcare system overwhelmed and led to thousands of deaths.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “Even though cases are less now, people should not let their guards down. Gatherings and crowds should be avoided at all costs. Organisers should go for live video-streaming of events and should not encourage people to gather in any location. People themselves should be careful when they think of stepping out for shopping and entertainment.”Delhi on Tuesday recorded 34 new Covid-19 cases and two deaths. So far, 25,087 people have died of the viral disease in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ddma-to-take-call-on-further-reopening-of-schools-restrictions-for-festivals-101632853500409.html
29-09-2021||Delhi||Fountains at Delhi’s Red Fort are back to life, much to the delight of visitors||After a gap of nearly eight years, the fountains at the Red Fort are back to life, giving tourists and visitors a taste of the fort complex’s yesteryear glory.Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials said the fountains were not used regularly in the past and had fallen into disrepair. “There are two fountains, near Rang Mahal and Zafar Mahal. For a long time, the fountains were in disuse. We have now revived them,” said an ASI official, who did not wish to be named.The official said the process of reviving the fountains started two months ago and water lines and connection pipes were excavated to repair connections. “Due to construction and demolition activity over the past year, it took us some time to find the water lines and reconnect them. In the coming two to three weeks, the fountains will be fully functional. With the revival of the fountains, visitors will get yet another spot to sit back and enjoy the Old World charm of the Mughal-era monument,” said the official.In 2019, the ASI carried out extensive restoration work on the fort complex built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century. A number of new additions such as museums and other facilities were added to the premises as part of the restoration work.According to the written accounts of Maulvi Zafar Hasan, ASI archaeologist who prepared the first list of monuments worthy of conservation in 1916, the marble basin in the centre of the large tank in front of Rang Mahal dates back to the 17th century.“The tank is of one piece of marble, taken from the Makrana quarries by Shah Jahan,” mentioned the listing prepared by Hasan. “It was brought from the Queen’s Garden, whither it was removed, presumably after the Mutiny, and placed in its present position in 1911,” stated Hasan.While the water channels and fountain at Zafar Mahal have also been revived, some more work is being carried out before they become fully functional.Dildar Singh, a city-based tourist guide, who frequently visits the Red Fort, said he last saw the fountains in full flow many years ago. “I have been coming to the Red Fort since the 1980s. As far as I remember, they have not been in operation since 1991,” said Singh.Historian and author Swapna Liddle said the water basin where the fountains have been revived had not been at the Red Fort continuously. “It was moved around a lot. After the 1857 Revolt, it was placed in the Queen’s Garden, north of the Town Hall. It was later moved to the Red Fort,” said Liddle.She said while additional elements add to the tourist experience, it was crucial to make visitors aware of the heritage as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fountains-at-delhi-s-red-fort-are-back-to-life-much-to-the-delight-of-visitors-101632853440166.html
29-09-2021||Delhi||CCTV footage key evidence in Rohini court shootout: Police||The four men allegedly involved in gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi’s murder at Rohini district court complex left a flat in Haiderpur village around 9.30am in their car and took about half an hour to reach the court on Friday, an hour before the gangster was shot dead inside a courtroom, investigation in the sensational shootout case has shown.Based on the CCTV footage analysis, investigators said on Tuesday that on the three-kilometre route between the flat and the court, the suspects were spotted at four different locations. They added that the footage will be a key evidence in establishing the role of the suspects in the murder.“The first CCTV footage from gate number 4 of the court complex shows Jagdeep aka Jagga and Rahul alias Nitin -- the two shooters --walking inside the court premises dressed as lawyers, and their associate Umang Yadav, who was also in a lawyer’s dress, entering the court premises in his i-10 car around 10.30am. The fourth suspect, Vinay Yadav, stayed outside as he couldn’t manage to find a black trouser to enter the court,” said one of the officers, asking not to be named.Footage from the CCTVs after the shootout, in which Gogi and the two shooters were killed, showed Umang visiting a gym in Haiderpur after escaping from the court. HT reported on Monday that the assailants were staying at Umang’s flat in Haiderpur since September 20.Gogi was shot dead inside courtroom number 207 by Jagga and Rahul. Security personnel gunned the two shooters down when they were trying to escape through the judge’s door. Gogi’s arch rival, Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuriya who is currently lodged in Delhi’s Mandoli jail, has emerged as the prime conspirator in the sensational murder, which the police officers said, capped a decade-long violent rivalry between Delhi’s two most powerful criminal gangs.Investigation has revealed that 38 rounds were fired in the courtroom. Of them 15 were fired by the two alleged attackers – Rahul and Jagga, and the remaining 23 were fired by the police personnel escorting Gogi.After the autopsy on Sunday, Gogi’s body was handed over to his family members who performed the last rites at a crematorium close to his house in Alipur amid tight security arrangements.On Monday, images of Gogi’s body were circulated on social media along with some disturbing messages that spoke about revenge for his killing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cctv-footage-key-evidence-in-rohini-court-shootoutpolice-101632853320213.html

Of these, 11 accidents involved Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses and 22 concerned cluster buses.The DTC buses come directly under the Delhi government but the cluster buses are operated by private entities for the state transport department.In the corresponding period last year, public buses were involved in at least 30 accidents. Data shows that though the number of people who died in accidents involving DTC buses decreased this year to 12 from 15 last year, those who died due to alleged negligence by cluster bus drivers increased to 25 from 15 last year.

He directed that the accused be released on a personal bond of ₹75,000 and two sureties of like amount.“A perusal of the site map shows that the petitioner hit the victim and drove a considerable distance before stopping the vehicle as another car came in front of him from the other side. The site map shows that the petitioner was not driving on the straight road but took at least four turns before stopping the vehicle.” Prasad said.“Be that as it may, the investigation is more or less complete. Most of the witnesses are police witnesses and their statements have been recorded. The charge sheet will be filed on or before October 10, 2021,” he said in his order dated September 27.According to the FIR, the complainant, a head constable, along with two others, was carrying out routine checking in Hari Nagar area June 22 this year when the accused refused to stop his car, having tinted glasses, in spite of being signalled by the police to do so, following which the cop clung to the moving car’s bonnet.The accused surrendered in July 2021 and sought his release on the grounds that the investigation was over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiengg-graduate-who-drove-with-police-constable-on-car-s-bonnet-gets-bail-101632852960012.html

We are planning to plant all these trees by March 2022 and it was stated in the report which came up in the meeting.”Rai said that “when the fight against pollution was started by the Arvind Kejriwal government in 2015-16”, 1,651,000 trees were planted, followed by 2,475,000 trees in 2016-17; 1,600,000 trees in in 2017-18; 2,895,000 trees in 2018-19; and 2,870,000 trees in 2019-20.“The forest survey of India has mentioned two categories of terrain for the purpose of green cover -- hilly and plains. It says that hilly areas should have at least 60% of their land under green cover and the plains should have at least 20%. In 2019 itself, the report by the FSI stated that Delhi had 21.88% of its area under the green belt. In 2015, the total area of Delhi was 1,483 sqkm. Out of this, 325 sqkm green belt (amounting to 21.88% of the area) was developed in Delhi,” he said.“From October 2 to 8, we will hold a Van Jeev Samrakshan Abhiyan programme at the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. Activities will be carried out to sensitise people. We are committed to preserving the environment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/11-million-trees-to-be-planted-in-delhi-environment-minister-gopal-rai-101632852780044.html
29-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s power tariff order for 2021-22 to be out any day now, says DERC chief||Delhi’s revised power tariff order for the year 2021-22 will be out any day now, Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (DERC) new chairperson justice (retired) Shabihul Hasnain said on Tuesday, putting an end to months of suspense over the fate of the annual revision.“The tariff order will come very soon, in just a few days. It is likely to be issued this week itself as we are bound by an affidavit in the court for it to be released by this month,” said Hasnain.Electricity prices, surcharges and other costs are supposed to be revised every financial year based on the petitions submitted by the distribution companies (discoms). According to the rules, all state power regulators have to mandatorily issue the tariff orders before April every year. However, Delhi has seen repeated delays in this regard.Hasnain’s comment came at a time when several residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) has begun raising questions over the inordinate delays in rolling out the new tariff order for Delhi. The United Residents of Delhi (URD), which is a collective of around 1,800 RWAs in the city, stated that the tariff order might have to be redone because of a new chairperson assuming office.“The public hearing and all the other processes should be redone as per the electricity Act. Otherwise the tariff order for this year was ready, but couldn’t be released due to disagreements between the lone member AK Ambasht and former chairperson justice (retired) SS Chauhan,” said Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary of URD.However, Hasnain refuted the claims and said none of the processes have to be redone as the work of the commission cannot get affected simply by a vacancy, even if it is that of the chairperson. “It is not true that the order had to be redone. Some routine checks have to be run, and that’s it,” he said.This year, discoms BSES Rajdhani and BSES Yamuna have projected a revenue gap of ₹1,703 crore and ₹1,148 crore respectively for 2021-22, while Tata Power expected a gap of ₹1,108 crore. The companies have put the cumulative revenue gap (till 2019-20) at ₹28,623 crore (BRPL), ₹19,123 crore (BYPL) and ₹3,810 crore (TPDDL). Discoms have been demanding a power tariff hike over the last six years.However, the Delhi government is unlikely to increase tariffs in the national Capital as it is one of the key models of its governance which the Aam Aadmi Party plans to showcase in the upcoming MCD elections, and the assembly elections it intends to fight in six states such as Gujarat, Punjab, Goa and Uttar Pradesh in two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-power-tariff-order-for-2021-22-to-be-out-any-day-now-says-new-derc-chief-101632852600770.html
29-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 20% reduction in circle rate may be extended till Dec 31||The Delhi government’s current scheme of 20% reduced circle rates for all categories of properties, which was to be in effect till September 30, is likely to be extended till December 31, said a senior government official on Tuesday. Circle rates are the minimum price at which a property can be bought or sold.The proposal for extending the scheme is awaiting approval of the cabinet, the senior official said, adding that the move is aimed at boosting the real estate market, which has seen a slump as a result of Covid-19, and increasing government revenue.“The proposal for extending the policy till the end of the year will be placed before the next cabinet meeting, which is likely to take place on Thursday. The council of ministers is in favour of the decision; it will be approved by the cabinet,” said the senior official, asking not to be named.On February 5, the Delhi government reduced circle rates for all categories of properties for a period till September 30. Circle rates were reduced by 20% for residential, commercial and industrial properties across all categories of localities.Circle rates vary with each state and is revised from time to time depending on demand, supply and other development indicators pertaining to the area concerned.Delhi broadly has eight categories of localities – from A to H – with Category A being the most affluent and Category H being the most economically weak. For instance, in a Category A locality, the circle rate for a residential property so far was ₹7,74,000 per square metre and for one in Category H locality was ₹23,280 per square metre.Neighbourhoods such as Golf Links, Vasant Vihar and Jor Bagh come under Category A, while localities such as Greater Kailash, Defence Colony and Safdarjung Enclave come under Category B.Tagore Garden and Subhash Nagar come under Category C, while categories D and E mostly have localities that were notified as regularised in the past, some old areas where low-income and mid-income flats were developed and resettlement colonies.Categories F, G and H comprise mostly unauthorised colonies in which residents have recently got the opportunity – through a central government scheme – to get their properties registered.“A reduction of 20% in the circle rate essentially leads to reduction of around 1% in stamp duty, which is paid during the registration of a property. Real estate sector in Delhi witnessed huge slump due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Lakhs of construction workers lost their jobs. So, the decision was taken and it is evidently doing well. So, the government has decided to extend it by another three months,” said the senior official.For registration, there is a stamp fee on the transaction value – which is 6% for men and 4% for women – to be paid by the buyer(s).“In property transactions, people tend to show the transaction value as less on paper and essentially pay the registry fee, which more or less approximates the circle rate,” said a second senior official in the revenue department, asking not to be named.In 2018-19, the Delhi government earned around ₹4,459 crore through property registries.For 2019-20, the revised estimate was ₹4,897 crore and for 2020-21, the budget estimate was ₹5,297 crore, showed budget documents of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cabinet-likely-to-extend-20-reduced-circle-rates-till-yearend-101632852182628.html
29-09-2021||Delhi||Cracker ban to stay in place till January 1: DPCC||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Tuesday banned the sale, storage and use of firecrackers in Delhi till January 1, 2022.In an order, the DPCC said the ban on cracker sale, storage and use, which was first announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on September 15 this year, will be extended till January 1, 2022. “Several experts have indicated a possibility of another surge of Covid-19 and large-scale celebrations by bursting firecrackers will result not only in agglomeration of people, in violation of social distancing norms, but also in high level of air pollution leading to serious health issues,” the order said.It further said, “The DPCC directs that there will be a complete ban on bursting and sale of all kinds of firecrackers up to January 1, 2022, in the territory of NCT of Delhi.”In a series of tweets on September 15, Kejriwal said the decision to impose a complete ban on crackers in Delhi was taken to “save lives” of residents. The risk of high pollution levels in Delhi during winters, coupled with the risk of the Covid-19 pandemic could impact the health of citizens, Kejriwal said.The district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police shall implement the aforesaid directions. Daily action taken reports are required to be submitted to DPCC via email, the pollution control board said.Every year, during the winter months from mid-October, Delhi’s air quality plummets to emergency levels on several days owing to changes in weather, large-scale stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, and also due to local pollution sources and cracker bursting during Diwali.Despite a ban on crackers last year as well, Delhi’s pollution levels remained high on Diwali day (November 14) and continued to remain in the poor zone in the subsequent week. In a special report, the Central Pollution Conrol Board said almost all pollutants reported higher values on Diwali in 2020 as compared to 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-body-bans-sale-use-storage-of-firecrackers-till-january-1-2022-101632852060045.html

29-09-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks stand of Delhi Police, Bar Council on upgrading security at district courts||The Delhi high court on Tuesday observed that the safety and security of district courts in the city was an “urgent” matter, and sought to know the stand of the Delhi Police and the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) on a plea seeking to ensure adequate security in trial courts in the wake of the Rohini courtroom shooting last Friday.Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi was gunned down inside the Rohini courtroom on September 24 by two assailants posing as lawyers, who were shot and killed by the police in return fire.“This is something urgent. We don’t want to lose lives. You never know lawyers may become the victims of all this…We don’t want that. Mr Sangwan (counsel for BCD) can only request, but ultimately you (Delhi Police) have to gear up,” Justice Rekha Palli told advocate Santosh Kumar Tripathi, appearing for the Delhi Police.The court issued notice on the plea by advocate Deepa Joseph, seeking directions to Delhi Police and the BCD to instruct all police personnel at court gates to check the ID cards of every lawyer who enters the premises.The plea also sought that the level of security and frisking in trial courts be upgraded, to be on a par with that at the Supreme Court and Delhi high court.During Tuesday’s hearing, advocate Tripathi, appearing for the police, assured the court that the police have been taking steps to ensure adequate security at district courts. Terming the shoot-out “scary”, Tripathi said suggestions are being sought from the BCD for stepping up security. He said unilateral decisions cannot be taken because frisking has always been an issue with lawyers.Advocate Ajayinder Sangwan, representing the Bar Council of Delhi, informed the court that they had a detailed meeting with senior police officers and it was agreed that the security at district courts will be upgraded to be on a par with that at the Supreme Court.The court asked the authorities to file their reply within five days and posted the matter to October 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-seeks-stand-of-delhi-police-bar-council-on-upgrading-security-at-district-courts-101632851820058.html
29-09-2021||Gurugram||First butterfly survey: 60 species spotted in Aravallis||At least 60 species of butterflies were identified in the first butterfly survey conducted by the state wildlife department in the Aravallis on Tuesday.MS Malik, the chief conservator of forests (wildlife) for Gurugram circle, said that the presence of butterflies is a sign of a healthy ecosystem. “We received a very good response for the survey in a short span of time. With the species identified in this region, we will be able to plan our conservation strategies better, focussing on what plants should be planted to further improve the ecology.”The survey was conducted in the Khol block of Rewari district, covering an area of about 1,000 hectares across 10 villages, namely Palra, Ahhrod, Bassduda, Khol, Manethi, Bhalki, Majra, Nandha, Balwari and Khaleta.The striped tiger butterfly, yellow pansy butterfly, spotless grass yellow butterfly and common rose butterfly were among the popular species spotted, officials said.Ten teams with five to six members each, including experts, forest staff and volunteers, participated in the survey. Jagdish Chander, the principal chief conservator for forests and chief wildlife warden of the Haryana forest department, also took part in the survey, officials said.Along with him, senior officials MS Malik, chief conservator of forests for Gurugram circle (wildlife), Rajender Parsad, district wildlife officer Gurugram and Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector Gurugram also participated in the survey.Sunder Sambharya, the divisional forest officer of Rewari, said, “The survey was successful with both common and uncommon species of butterflies being identified. The fact that 60 species were identified in an area of 1,000 hectares within six hours shows that the trees and shrub composition of this area is very good.”Officials further said that maximum butterflies are visible during this season, which falls just after the larval breeding stage. Butterfly sightings are likely to continue till the first week of October.Sohail Madan of the Bombay Natural History Society, who participated in the survey, said, “Over 60 species of butterflies were spotted during the survey, which is a good response, but more such surveys are needed to understand what species are actually common for that area and which ones are rare. Common albatross, which was sighted on Tuesday, is an uncommon butterfly, but it might be common for that area; this can be known only with future surveys. But this is a good initiative as we are trying to understand more about the habitat and what more can be done.”The wildlife department will conduct a similar survey at the Kalesar National Park in Yamuna Nagar on Thursday. More such surveys are also likely to take place in other districts of southern Haryana in the first week of October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/first-butterfly-survey-60-species-spotted-in-aravallis-101632851099936.html

The locals present in the area later vandalised the bus.The woman’s husband, Chiranji Singh(45), who claimed to work with the MCD, said they were returning to their home in Najafgarh after an outing when the cluster bus hit their bike from behind.“I was riding the bike, my son was sitting in the middle and my wife, Sundari, was behind him. We were driving on the left side of the road when suddenly, a bus hit us from behind. The impact of the hit was such that we were all thrown on the road and Sundari was run over by the bus. All of this happened in the blink of an eye and before I could react, my wife was lying in a pool of blood,” he said.He said he quickly got up, picked up his son and rushed to his wife, by which time a lot of people gathered.“I quickly ran behind the bus and managed to stop it... Someone had called up the police by that time and had arrived at the spot. I handed over the man to them and immediately rushed my wife and son to a private hospital. My son was discharged after treatment but my wife was declared brought dead,” said Singh.Police identified the driver as Sandeep Dagar.“After he was caught by the woman’s husband, the locals present there vandalised the bus,” a police official said.Police said an FIR under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 304 (A) (causing death by negligence) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwoman-crushed-to-death-husband-and-son-injured-after-bus-hits-bike-101632850739909.html
29-09-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Civic body’s executive panel gives nod to increasing licence fee||The executive committee of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation, during its meeting on Tuesday, approved proposals related to increasing the licence fee of different business establishments under the municipal body’s jurisdiction from the next financial year.In December 1997, a government order stated that licences must be issued to business establishments and fixed the fees for the different kinds of licences. However, the municipal corporation never got around to enforcing the order.According to officials, the original proposal charged a ₹1,000 licence fee from establishments such as hotels, lodges, guest houses and marriage halls annually. Now, the executive committee has increased the amount to ₹3,000. Likewise, the licence fees for nursing homes with up to 20 beds have been hiked from ₹2,000 to ₹5,000 while those with more than 20 beds will have to shelve out ₹6,000 instead of ₹5,000 annually. “There was a proposal to increase the licence fee for private clinics from ₹3,000 to ₹4,000, but we have not increased the rates for this category. as there are many small clinics in the city. We are considering lowering their fees to ₹2,000 and will place this proposal before the board. Overall, the hiked rates will be applicable from the next financial year. There has been no hike since 1997,” said municipal commissioner MS Tanwar, adding that the establishments should start applying for licences. There was another proposal to levy a licence fee of ₹1,500 on small shops selling cold drinks, aerated water and snacks. “The executive committee decided not to approve it as levying this fee would mean an additional financial burden on the vendors. The increase in licence fee has been approved for certain categories, wherein people have the paying capacity while relief has been granted to others,” said Tanwar. The corporation also approved a proposal to levy an annual licence fee of ₹200 on establishments engaged in trading/selling of tobacco products. “The owners with permanent shops will have to pay ₹1,000 annually and wholesalers will have to shell out ₹5,000. For temporary shop owners, a licence will not mean that they have ownership of the land. Only a valid licence will give them the approval to sell,” said Sanjeev Kumar Sinha, the corporation’s chief tax assessment officer and licensing officer. He added that the increase in the licence fee will enable the corporation to earn about ₹5-6 crore annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-body-s-executive-panel-gives-nod-to-increasing-licence-fee-101632849902633.html

29-09-2021||Mumbai||‘53% Mumbaiites did not undergo any health check-ups during pandemic months’||Fifty-three per cent of 7,864 Mumbaiites who were surveyed ahead of World Heart Day (September 29), revealed they have not undergone any health check-up during the Covid pandemic, while 21% Mumbaiites relied solely on home use gadgets such as blood pressure, pulse, blood sugar and temperature to keep track of their health. The survey was conducted between June and August 2021, by Fortis Hospital Mulund and Kalyan, Hiranandani Hospital at Vashi, and SL Raheja Hospital at Mahim. Through the pandemic, doctors witnessed an alarming trend of surge in the number of cardiac incidences among young adults. This prompted the hospitals to undertake the survey to understand citizens’ awareness levels and preparedness for cardiac-related events. While 75% of the surveyed Mumbaiites were aware of the behaviours and conditions that increased the risk of heart disease, 82% knew about the lifestyle changes they had to make to have a healthy heart. Dr S. Narayani, zonal director, Fortis Hospitals, Mumbai, who spearheaded the survey, said, “We initiated this survey to understand if Mumbaiites were able to put their medical preparedness and knowhow to use, and if the pandemic had worsened Mumbai’s heart health.” A total of 53% of Mumbaiites who were surveyed believe that Covid-19 significantly increased the risk of heart ailments, 63% believed the pandemic made it unsafe for them to walk and exercise outdoors, especially with existing heart conditions [comorbidity] and 72% believed that their heart diseases may develop more severe symptoms and complications if they got infected by Covid-19. Significantly, 15% of the surveyed citizens were unsure of the symptoms and were not sure of the actions that had to be taken during cardiac emergency and 19% of the surveyed citizens believed their first response to a cardiac emergency would be to give the patient an asprin and call a doctor. In case a family member or a coworker experienced a cardiac emergency, 43% of the respondents said they would check symptoms, call an ambulance, and take the patient to a nearest hospital; only 23% people knew how to give a CPR. Dr Atul Limaye, senior interventional cardiologist, Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said, “The survey is an eye-opener. Over 60% of people are aware that sitting for long hours causes health ailments, yet nearly 40% do not find time to exercise and stay fit, is concerning. There is an urgent need to sensitise people that the lifestyle they adopted during the pandemic is even more detrimental and that urgent efforts need to be made to ensure better quality of life”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/53-mumbaiites-did-not-undergo-any-health-check-ups-during-pandemic-months-101632848639657.html
29-09-2021||Kolkata||Setback for Mamata Banerjee in high court over plea to disqualify Mukul Roy||Kolkata: West Bengal assembly speaker Biman Banerjee should have first decided the petition to disqualify Mukul Roy under the anti-defection law before appointing him as chairman of the assembly’s public accounts committee, the Calcutta high court said on Tuesday as it ordered the speaker to produce the record of the action taken on the disqualification petition filed in June.The verdict, which is seen as a huge setback to the ruling Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress and its leader Mukul Roy, set October 7 as the deadline for the speaker to place the action taken by him before the court. “In case of failure, this court will decide further course of action to be taken in the matter,” the court said.In a 69-page strongly-worded verdict, a bench led by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal rejected the argument that the court did not have jurisdiction over actions of the speaker, underlining that the court would have been debarred from entertaining the petition if it was a case of “procedural irregularities”. But “it is a case of blatant illegality,” the bench also comprising justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj, said. HT has reviewed a copy of the order.The speaker apparently “worked on dictates”, “was caught in the web knitted by him”, and failed to “discharge his constitutional duty coupled with established admitted constitutional conventions, the high court said on a petition by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Ambika Roy.Ambika Roy challenged Mukul Roy’s appointment as chairman of the assembly’s public accounts committee (PAC) on July 9. On Monday, leader of the opposition in the assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, also moved the court seeking Mukul Roy’s disqualification as a member of the assembly under the anti-defection law.Mukul Roy, who joined the BJP in 2017, returned to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on June 11. He, however, did not resign from the BJP. On June 18, Adhikari petitioned the speaker to seek Mukul Roy’s disqualification On July 9, the speaker appointed him as chairman of the PAC, a post which has, by convention, always gone to an opposition party legislator.The court faulted the speaker for appointing Mukul Roy to this position without taking a call on the petition for his disqualification, asserting that the two were connected.“In fact, the respondent No. 1 (the speaker) should have first decided the petition for disqualification of the respondent No. 2 (Mukul Roy) and thereafter, considering his eligibility, should have taken steps to appoint him as the chairman of the committee on public accounts,” the judges said.“Failure on the part of the speaker to adjudicate upon that petition despite the maximum period provided thereof having expired, is creating more trouble as a result of which the interference of this court has been called for”.The judges also cited the Supreme Court verdict in Keisham Meghachandra Singh vs. Speaker of the Manipur Legislative Assembly (2020), where the court held that disqualification petitions under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution should be decided either within a reasonable timeframe or within three months.The bench noted that the maximum three-month period prescribed by the Supreme Court for a decision on an anti-defection petition expired on September 16.“It is much more than that (mere irregularity) if seen coupled with the fact that despite judgments of Hon’ble the Supreme Court the speaker is sitting tight on the matter on decision of disqualification of the respondent No. 2 (Mukul Roy).“…rather it is the illegality committed by the Speaker in nominating a person, who had in fact defected from BJP to AITC. In case the petition for his disqualification is allowed, he cannot even be a Member of the House, hence, not eligible to be a Member of the Committee, what to talk of its Chairman,” the bench said.TMC leaders did not comment on the order, saying the matter is sub judice. Samik Bhattacharya, chief spokesperson of the Bengal BJP, said, “This is the first time in the history of parliamentary democracy that a speaker has been reminded by a court that he has acted autocratically. The speaker has clearly been shown his position.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/setback-for-mamata-banerjee-in-high-court-over-plea-to-disqualify-mukul-roy-101632845759493.html
29-09-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra may become largest sugar production state in India in ensuing season||With the largest area under cultivation because of the satisfactory rainfall in the past three years, Maharashtra is expected to produce the largest-ever sugar in 2021-22. The production is estimated to be 11.2 million tonnes, which is expected to be the highest in the country. Maharashtra’s closest competitor Uttar Pradesh (UP) is expected to produce 11.1 mn tonnes.“Maharashtra had always been the highest producer and ahead of UP, but since 2016-17 the northern state had surpassed Maharashtra for various reasons including varietal development. But this year again, Maharashtra is estimated to surpass UP,” said an official from the commissionerate.According to the estimates, which were presented in a recent meeting held by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, ahead of the crushing season beginning from October 15, the office of sugar commissioner has estimated the bumper production. The presentation has stated that the areas under cultivation have been the largest ever at 1.23 million hectares from 1.14 million hectares in 20-21. This would see the estimated crushing of 1,096 lakh tonnes producing 11.2 million tonnes. Maharashtra’s highest production registered so far is 10.72 million tonnes in 2018-19, when the area under cultivation was 1.16 millon hectares, the highest until now.Pandurang Shelke, joint commissioner, sugar commissionerate, said, “The area under cultivation and the production in Maharashtra in 2021-22 are estimated to be largest ever. We are expected to surpass the production in Uttar Pradesh as well. Uttar Pradesh was leading because of one new variety, over the past few years, but this year we will produce more sugar. They have the advantage of irrigation, almost a fifth less expenditure to water the crops, than in Maharashtra, and their under cultivation is almost double than us. Maharashtra however, has the advantage of high recovery rate over other states.”In 2021-22 more than 190 sugar factories are expected to go for crushing, which is expected to go up to 1,096 lakh tonnes from 1,014 lakh tonnes in the past season.Besides the highest production in its history, Maharashtra is expected to surpass its closest competition state Uttar Pradesh in sugar production. Sanjeev Babar, former managing director, Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, said that satisfactory rainfall in the past three years, diversion to sugar production from other crops because of availability of water, has resulted in the rise in the area under cultivation. “With assured irrigation because of rainfall, farmers do not think of any other crop as he is assured of payback through fair and remunerative price (FRP) and losses due to calamities are negligible. UP has, in the past few years, improved its production rate by improving transportation facilities and harvesting patterns. They ensure that the crushing is done at the earliest to earn a good recovery. The area under cultivation in UP is almost double, though their recovery rate is much less and hovers around 10% when ours range between 11.20-11.40%,” said Babar.The high production will help in keeping the retail prices of the sugar under check.Avinash Tiwari, director-general of ISMA said that the sugar industry is trying to reduce the unconsumed stock this year to ensure that the producers are not at the loss, but simultaneously the retail prices too will not go up. “We will increase the diversion of sugar for the production of ethanol in 2021-22 to 3.4 million from two million tonnes in 2020-21. Similarly, by exporting 7.1 million tonnes in 20-21 from just 5.8 million tonnes in 19-20, we have successfully reduced the domestic stock to 7 million tonnes from 14.5 million tons, two years ago. This would help up in keeping the retail as well as the ex-mill price of the sugar constant so that retailers or the producers do not feel any pinch. There would not be a rise in the retail prices because the huge stock remains in the domestic market,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-may-become-largest-sugar-production-state-in-india-in-ensuing-season-101632842219342.html

29-09-2021||World||Piyush Goyal moots $1 trillion target for India-US trade||Indian commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday proposed an ambitious target of $1 trillion for India-US bilateral trade over the next 10 years even as he expressed frustration over the failure of the two sides to conclude an agreement after multiple rounds of talks with the earlier Trump administration.India-US bilateral trade in goods and services stood at $146.1 billion in 2019, according to the latest update by the US Trade Representative’s office.“India and the US can be two countries which should be looking at a balanced future trade upwards of $1 trillion in the next 10 years,” minister Piyush Goyal said at the virtual annual leadership summit of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, an advocacy group, that started on Wednesday.“Unless we keep some very ambitious targets, we’ll never get there. I’m happy to look at a trillion-dollar target for the next 10 years between the US and India. I’m happy to engage with the US, and look for expanding our economic partnership.”India-US trade is up against another ambitious target, one that was fixed by President Joe Bidden when he was vice-president in the administration of President Barack Obama. In a speech at the Bombay Stock Exchange during his 2012 India visit, Biden had suggested a “five-fold” increase in the volume of the bilateral trade, which had then stood at $100 billion.Piyush Goyal on Wednesday also expressed frustration with the failure of the two countries to conclude a trade agreement after numerous rounds of discussions most of which happened on his watch, specially over 2019 and 2020. “We had actually concluded discussions maybe three or four times, but would always get stuck somewhere in the red tape and for a change,” the minister said, adding, “India was not responsible.”India and the United States were expected to sign an interim trade agreement - leaving a comprehensive trade agreement for a later date - during former President Donald Trump’s visit to India in February 2020. But the two sides failed to conclude talks in time for the visit and vowed to come up with something later in the year, which never happened as the US went into elections and Trump lost.Piyush Goyal had said at the time a deal was just a few “phone calls away” to reflect how close the two sides were to an agreement. Indians have blamed the US side for failure by the two sides to get a deal saying American negotiators kept changing the goalpost constantly, making fresh and additional demands.Trade talks have remained stalled since then. Goyal and his US counterpart Katherine Tai have spoken but there have been no discussions about a trade agreement.The two sides decided to start talking during the first bilateral summit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden here in Washington DC last week. “They looked forward to reconvening the India-US Trade Policy Forum before the end of 2021, to enhance the bilateral trade relationship by addressing trade concerns, identifying specific areas for increased engagement and developing an ambitious, shared vision for the future of the trade relationship,” said the joint statement issued by the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/piyush-goyal-moots-1-trillion-target-for-india-us-trade-101632939203121.html

Here we have everything detailed, even if the victim, who was unconscious during the rapes, doesn't remember anything," said police commissioner Jeremie Bosse Platiere."It's also unusual because of how long they were carried out (from 2010 to 2020) and the number of offenders," he said, adding that the husband had filmed all the rapes.The woman, who is also in her sixties, only discovered the assaults when alerted by police, he added.The videos were found on the husband's computer along with messages posted on casual sex meeting sites, inviting people to take advantage of his wife while she was knocked out by anti-anxiety drugs.Those accused of rape range in age from 24 to 71."He (the husband) would put her on the bed naked and warm up the room so she wouldn't wake up. The individuals would then tiptoe in and whisper, and if the victim moved at all they would leave," Bosse Platiere said.The husband and 32 other men are in custody and nine more are being questioned, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-man-jailed-for-drugging-wife-and-getting-her-raped-over-10-years-101632937276524.html
29-09-2021||World||What is there in Afghanistan's 1964's monarchy constitution that Taliban plan to adopt?||The Taliban on Tuesday announced that they will temporarily adopt the 1964 constitution to rule Afghanistan but will eliminate if there is anything that goes against Sharia law. The Taliban came to power for the second time in Afghanistan on August 15. They have announced a Cabinet but it was not yet clear what rights they will give to the women and the media until the Taliban started to spell out the terms and conditions of the news government that awaits international recognition.The Taliban's acting justice minister issued a statement on Tuesday saying they would adopt the 1964 constitution, which was drafted by Afghans who were educated abroad. This constitution is the most ambitious one among the four constitutions that the country had. Mohammad Zahir Shah, the last king of Afghanistan, commissioned for drafting the constitution.What 1964 constitution means for Afghanistan. All you need to know> The constitution created two houses of Afghanistan Parliament. The lower house members were to be elected.> The constitution maintained a gap between the Cabinet from Parliament. Cabinet was supposed to exercise the monarch's powers, while legislators were prohibited from holding ministerial posts.> Women had the right to vote in the 1964 constitution.> The constitution also gave freedom of religion as it said non-Muslim citizens were free to perform their religious rituals as determined by the laws.> The constitution said education is the right of every Afghan and shall be provided free of charge.> The constitution laid rules for a centralised administration, divided into a number of administrative units, headed by the ministers.> The king, which might be applicable for Taliban supremo, held the supreme command of everything, from declaring war to sign international treaties.The constitution was in force between 1964 and 1973, which is often referred to as Afghanistan's golden age. It was then annulled by a coup. After the US invasion in 2001, a new constitution was drafted, which the Taliban have rejected claiming that it has western influence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-there-in-1964-s-monarchy-constitution-that-taliban-plan-to-adopt-101632934277381.html

The Kremlin said that the decision by YouTube to suspend RT's German channel was a breach of Russian law, according to several news reports.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called YouTube's action as "censorship" and also said that the Russian laws were "grossly violated" by the suspension. "There are signs that the laws of the Russian Federation have been violated, and violated very grossly. This is associated with censorship and with obstruction to the dissemination of information in the media," news agency AFP quoted him as saying. "We should not rule out the possibility of taking measures to force this platform to comply with our laws. There must be zero tolerance for such violations," he added.Also read | YouTube expands policy to crack down on anti-vaccine contentThe Kremlin's comments came after YouTube on Tuesday suspended two channels of RT German, alleging that the channel uploaded content which violated the platform's guidelines on Covid-19 misinformation. It was suspended from uploading any new content, however, RT tried to circumvent this restriction by using another YouTube channel, an action because of which both channels were terminated, YouTube had said. "During this suspension, RT DE tried to circumvent this restriction by using another YouTube channel to upload its videos," the Associated Press quoted YouTube as saying.Following the termination, RT's chief editor Margarita Simonyan wrote on the Russian messaging platform Telegram, calling the move a "true media war by Germany on Russia. "I'm looking forward to my native state banning Deutsche Welle and other German media in Russia without delay, as well as close the offices of ARD and ZDF," the Associated Press quoted Simonyan as saying.Also, Russia's media watchdog Roskomnadzor said that it has written a letter to Google, which owns YouTube, demanding that the restrictions on the two channels be lifted, according to a news report by AFP. It has also said that YouTube could be provided a warning and the access to the platform could be partially or fully restricted if it ignored the warnings.Meanwhile, the German government has said that it was not involved in the actions taken by YouTube. "It is a decision by YouTube, based on rules created by YouTube, it is not a measure (taken by) the German government or other official organizations," Reuters quoted German government spokesperson Steffen Seibert as saying.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-warns-of-blocking-youtube-over-platform-s-suspension-of-rt-tv-s-german-channel-101632933236605.html

Faafoi said the majority of applications will be granted within a year of the category opening in December.The 2021 Resident Visa will be available to most work-related visa holders and their immediate family members.Immigration New Zealand estimates eligible visa holders will include over 5,000 health and aged care workers, around 9,000 primary industry workers, and more than 800 teachers. There are also around 15,000 construction and 12,000 manufacturing workers on relevant visa types, some of whom will be eligible for the one-off pathway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-offers-one-off-resident-visa-to-165-000-migrants-101632932522204.html
29-09-2021||World||YouTube expands policy to crack down on anti-vaccine content||YouTube on Wednesday announced its new policy on medical misinformation, saying it will remove videos that falsely claim approved vaccines are dangerous and cause chronic health effects. Google’s video-sharing company said that the false claims about vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) “spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general.”“Today, we're expanding our medical misinformation policies on YouTube with new guidelines on currently administered vaccines that are approved and confirmed to be safe and effective by local health authorities and the WHO,” YouTube said in a statement.In the initial days of the Covid vaccine development, YouTube was inundated with conspiracy theory videos, one of them even claiming that Microsoft’s Bill Gates was planning to track everyone through a substance mixed with vaccines. Gates had then called it a “bad combination of pandemic and social media.”YouTube said the new policy would target the content falsely claiming that approved vaccines cause autism, cancer or infertility, or that “substances in vaccines can track those who receive them.” It further stated that policies would not only cover specific routine immunizations but also apply to general statements about vaccines.“[O]ur new guidance on vaccine side effects maps to public vaccine resources provided by health authorities and backed by medical consensus. These policy changes will go into effect today, and as with any significant update, it will take time for our systems to fully ramp up enforcement,” the company said.YouTube will continue to allow content about “vaccine policies, new vaccine trials, and historical vaccine successes or failures" on the video-sharing platform.“Working closely with health authorities, we looked to balance our commitment to an open platform with the need to remove egregious harmful content,” the company added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtube-expands-policy-to-crack-down-on-anti-vaccine-content-101632930516938.html
29-09-2021||World||US senators introduced bill on Taliban. Stocks in Pakistan plummeted a day after||A bill introduced in US Senate seeking sanctions on the Afghan Taliban and the foreign governments that support the outfit appeared to have given investors in Pakistan cold feet as the stocks fell nearly 3% and the rupee dropped to a record low on Wednesday. More than 20 Senate Republicans introduced legislation titled ‘Afghanistan Counterterrorism, Oversight, and Accountability Act’ aimed at tackling the situation in the wake of chaotic US withdrawal from the war-torn country.The bill sets out provisions for establishing a state department task force, counterterrorism strategy for Afghanistan, review of foreign assistance to countries supporting the Taliban and imposition of sanctions on the Islamist fundamentalists and their supporters.If the bill gets support from both Houses and is signed into law, the US president will have the power to impose sanctions on individuals who provide military, training or logistical support to the Taliban or provide safe haven to their fighters.Under the legislation, the US secretary of state will have the power to suspend all forms of foreign assistance to the countries or organisations found providing any form of material support to the Taliban, except some activities to support humanitarian projects, democracy-building in Afghanistan, education among others."Our legislation would help hold the Administration accountable and prioritize the complete evacuation of Americans, SIVs, and refugees,” said Senator Susan Collins regarding the legislation introduced by Senator Jim Risch.“Additionally, it would impose sanctions on the Taliban and its supporters, sending a clear message that the United States denounces the Taliban's human rights abuses and terrorism," she added.Pakistan has long been accused of providing assistance to the Afghan Taliban in their attempt to topple the democratically elected government in Afghanistan, a charge Islamabad denies. Pakistan spy chief was in Kabul before the announcement of the interim Taliban government, which many experts suggested that Islamabad was trying to sideline Mullah Baradar and help the Haqqani Network get the major share of the power pie in Afghanistan.A day after the legislation was introduced in US Senate, the benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange index decline as much as 2.9% before making a recovery. Analysts have said that the historic low of the Pakistani rupee, 170.27 against the dollar, was also weighed down by high demand for the greenback and the situation in Afghanistan, reported Reuters."Dollar parity is consistently rising as demand for the dollar is high due to the current account deficit, and the Afghan situation is also adding pressure," Reuters quoted Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pakistan Kuwait Investment Company Pvt Ltd., as saying.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senators-introduced-bill-on-taliban-stocks-in-pakistan-plummeted-a-day-after-101632918151809.html

Now, urban neighborhoods are being blacked out, triggering pleas on social media for the government to solve the problem.China’s power consumption is growing at almost double its usual rate, while the ruling Communist Party is trying to reduce energy intensity, or the amount used per unit of economic output.The power cuts come as global leaders prepare to attend a UN environmental conference by video link on October 12-13 in the southwestern city of Kunming. That increases pressure on President Xi Jinping’s government, as the meeting’s host, to show it is sticking to emissions and energy efficiency targets.The cuts are “largely driven by energy consumption control measures, with power shortages affecting another few provinces,” Lara Dong of IHS Markit said in an email.“This is in line with China’s decarbonization ambitions,” she said.The Cabinet’s planning agency warned in August that 20 regions had exceeded energy use and pollution targets after manufacturing rebounded from the pandemic. The government has ambitious plans to make the economy cleaner and more energy-efficient, so failing to meet those targets can be a career-ending blunder.The power cuts “could be more disruptive than previous shortages,” Bank of America said in a report. Due to shortages in some areas, it said, "a relaxation of the government’s energy consumption goals may not immediately alleviate the power crunch.”China is one of the world’s biggest emitters of climate-changing industrial gases and consumes more energy per unit of economic output than developed countries. Given its huge population, on a per capita basis it ranks much lower.China also is preparing for the Winter Olympics in the capital, Beijing, and the nearby city of Shijiazhuang in February, a period when it will want clear blue skies.Officials in Jiangsu province, a manufacturing hub northwest of Shanghai, told state media some cities there have used up 90% of this year's quota for power use. The officials of the provincial planning agency were cited as saying individual city governments had to decide how to meet their targets.The government of Guangdong province, China's biggest manufacturing center, has cited both official energy use limits and low water levels in hydropower reservoirs that provide a big share of its electricity.In Liaoning province, where Shenyang is the capital, the government said in a statement Sunday that power demand hit a record high in the first eight months of the year. It said Liaoning has suffered shortages since then due to a decline in wind power and other sources.The government of neighboring Jilin province blamed a shortage of coal. It said in a statement Monday its governor would visit miners in nearby Inner Mongolia to line up additional supplies.Some advance warnings of power cuts to residents in Shenyang and other cities cited a need to ration power but didn't say why.Li, the noodle restaurant owner, showed a reporter a notice circulated on social media that said power would be out in his neighborhood from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.Shopkeeper Yang Chang had a generator running on the sidewalk to keep freezers full of meat cold.“As long as there is electricity we can sell things, unlike restaurants that need water,” said Yang. Yang didn’t know or care what the reason for the power outage was but said, “it’s understandable.”“I was born in the ’90s. When I was little, electricity wasn’t stable,” said Yang. “Although we are having difficulties, the government will find a solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flashlights-generators-how-chinese-are-coping-amid-power-cuts-in-country-101632916323670.html
29-09-2021||World||Analysing North Korean missile test: What it means for the region||North Korea test-fired a newly developed hypersonic missile earlier this week, state news media KCNA reported on Wednesday, joining a race headed by major military powers to deploy the advanced weapons system.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did not inspect the launch of Hwasong-8, according to a report from the hermit kingdom. The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried a picture of the weapon - with a set of guidance fins at the base of its nose cone - ascending into the morning sky."In the first test-launch, national defence scientists confirmed the navigational control and stability of the missile," the report said.What are hypersonic missiles?Hypersonic weapons are considered the next generation of arms that aim to rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.Unlike ballistic missiles that fly into outer space before returning on steep trajectories, hypersonic weapons fly towards targets at lower altitudes and can achieve more than five times the speed of sound - or about 6,200 km per hour.The development of the weapons system increases North Korea's defence capabilities, KCNA said, describing the hypersonic missile as "strategic weapon".How advanced is North Korea's missile?The North's hypersonic missile is at an early stage of development judged by detected velocity and other data, and would take a "considerable period of time" until it could be deployed in combat, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Wednesday.The official Korean Central News Agency said that the missile met key technical requirements, including launch stability and the maneuverability and flight characteristics of the "detached hypersonic gliding warhead".What does this missile launch mean for North Korea?The test could mean the North is entering an accelerating race to deploy the weapon now involving the United States, Russia and China.KCNA described the new missile as an important addition to the country's "strategic" weaponry, implying that the system is being developed to deliver nuclear weapons.However, experts say the missile test was likely a failure. "The North's HGV technology is not comparable to those of the US, Russia or China and for now seems to aim for short-range that can target South Korea or Japan," Chang Young-keun, a missile specialist at the Korea Aerospace University, told news agency Reuters.Regional ramificationsBoth Koreas are building up their weapons capabilities in what could become an arms race on the divided peninsula, with ramifications for neighbouring Japan, China and the wider region.The nuclear-armed North, which invaded the South in 1950, is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its banned nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programmes, and earlier this month said it had tested a long-range cruise missile.Developing the hypersonic missile was one of five "top priority" tasks in the five-year plan for strategic weapons, KCNA said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/analysing-north-korean-missile-test-what-it-means-for-the-region-101632900818202.html
29-09-2021||World||Wary of China, US and EU forge alliance on technology||The chip crisis turned dire when the coronavirus hit. As demand for electronics was skyrocketing in the spring of 2020, manufacturers warned they were running short of semiconductors — key components needed to make devices from smartphones to cars.They had good reasons: In the following months, the shortage forced factories to shut down assembly lines. Tech companies postponed product launches. Computers were delivered months too late.Worried about the fallout, politicians from Washington DC to Berlin called up chip-manufacturing countries and asked them to help prioritize orders from their countries.But there was only so much they could do: The chips, which are made by just a handful of firms, are notoriously hard to produce. And there just were not enough for everyone.'A US-EU partnership'A year and a half later, the shortage persists — curtailing, for example, the production of new cars.That is why manufacturing more chips in Europe and the US will be high up on the agenda when top US and EU officials gather on Wednesday in Pittsburgh for the first meeting of the "EU-US Trade and Technology Council" (TTC)."We commit to building a US-EU partnership ... to design and produce the most powerful and resource-efficient semiconductors," the White House said in a statement.Other discussions at the TTC will be about coming up with principles for artificial intelligence technology; how to boost cybersecurity in an increasingly unstable digital world; and how to push joint technology standards on the international stage.The meeting will be co-chaired by the EU's digital chief Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager and Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis, as well as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, and Trade Representative Katherine Tai.Far from seeing eye to eyeThe chip crisis was an eye-opening moment for policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic, illustrating how important access to technology has become for maintaining geopolitical dominance, according to conversations with US and EU officials involved in preparing the TTC meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential.But finding common ground during the two-day meeting will not be easy.Not only was the event overshadowed by news that the US had quietly negotiated a security agreement with Australia and the UK, wrecking a multi-billion-euro French submarine deal.The US and the EU have been at loggerheads over how to regulate new technology for years.While Brussels is pushing for tough rules, arguing they are needed to protect the fundamental rights of Europeans, Washington has mostly advocated a market-driven, hands-off approach, warning that too many rules could hamper innovation.Finding a middle ground would help both sides, said Marietje Schaake, the policy director at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center."If the US and the EU worked together better, that would actually be a pretty strong combination — it would bring the geopolitical strength from the US to the EU, and it would bring the rights-and-freedoms strength from the EU to the US," said Schaake, who served as a member of the European Parliament between 2009 and 2019."But it does require political agreement — and so far, there has not been a great meeting of the minds."A 'New Cold War'?The elephant in the negotiation room is how to deal with China.In recent years, China's tech companies have grown into some of the biggest in the world. This has raised concerns in the US that Beijing could soon dominate certain sensitive technologies and use that as a strategic advantage — and it has prompted some observers to speak of a "New Cold War."The Biden administration, encouraged by widespread support for a tough stance on Beijing back home, has painted the new TTC as a platform where the US and the EU can combine their economic and political might to counter China's ambitions.EU officials, meanwhile, have been eager to stress that the new alliance should primarily be about working together, rather than targeting one particular country. The bloc has so far taken a less confrontational course on Beijing, not least because some of its 27 member countries have close economic ties with China and remain divided over how to deal with the country.But Beijing's increasingly authoritarian leadership style has officials in Washington and Brussels alarmed, said Stormy-Annika Mildner, the executive director of think tank Aspen Institute Germany."Both sides feel a greater threat from China, and a greater need to work together," Mildner said, adding that this could set the TTC apart from previous trans-Atlantic efforts kicked off under George W. Bush or Barack Obama, which all started with similarly grand ambitions for trans-Atlantic cooperation — but eventually led nowhere."The world around us is just completely different from back then," Mildner said, "And China is one key reason for that."How much can governments really do?One of the areas where both sides hope to close ranks is that of producing semiconductors. Manufacturing the tiny chips is extremely complicated. It includes hundreds of steps, takes months to complete, and requires factories worth billions.China has declared it a top national priority to soon run that entire production process on its own territory — something no country can currently do.That is one of the reasons why US and European officials have been watching warily that Chinese-owned firms have been buying chip companies around the world.At the TTC, officials will speak about how to deal with foreign investment in the semiconductors industry. They will also discuss how to coordinate their own plans for how the EU and the US can become less dependent on global supply chains.And the US and EU should think about how to better collaborate in the research and development of new technology, said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, a semiconductor expert at think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung.Kleinhans cautioned that when it comes to tackling the global chip crisis, there is only so much governments can do."Yes, public money, if spent properly, can help with building new production capacities," he said.But Kleinhans added that more is needed to tackle the current shortage — such as making global supply chains more transparent or giving a halt to rising raw material prices that have exacerbated the crisis."That's something only companies can do," he said. "And that's why no one truly knows when we'll be out of this crisis."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wary-of-china-us-and-eu-forge-alliance-on-technology-101632900403191.html
29-09-2021||World||Elon Musk, world's richest man, wants to send ‘No 2’ statue to Jeff Bezos: Report||Elon Musk on Monday once again reclaimed the title of the world's richest man as he made new records for himself – becoming only the third person in history to amass a net worth of $200 billion, according to Forbes magazine. In the process, Musk crossed Amazon founder and fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos, who earlier enjoyed his stint as the richest man in the world. The celebratory rivalry between the two entrepreneurs is well-known, as in a seeming acknowledgment of this strife – Elon Musk took a fresh dig at Jeff Bezos.According to the Forbes report, Elon Musk sent a ‘short email’, joking that he was now going to deliver a giant statue of the digit ‘2’ to the Amazon founder, apparently mocking the fact that the latter had to settle for the number 2 position in the list of richest men.“I’m sending a giant statue of the digit ‘2’ to Jeffrey B., along with a silver medal,” Musk wrote in a short email, as per the magazine.Musk and Bezos have been engaged in a well-known feud over entrepreneurial ambitions for a long time now, but conflict recently peaked since both of them have their eyes on the race to outer space and innovations in the automobile sector – including self-driving cars.This would hardly be the first time that Musk has taken a crack at Bezos. He has already called his rival a “copycat” twice (both times using the emoji of a cat) – once when Bezos' Amazon announced plans to launch internet-beaming satellites in competition with Musk’s SpaceX, and then again when Amazon acquired self-driving car company Zoox to take on Musk's Tesla.Back in August last year, Jeff Bezos became the first person in history to amass a fortune worth $200 billion. But later in the year, stocks for Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla rallied by a humongous 720%, and both of the billionaires were soon trading barbs as equals. Elon Musk eventually crossed Jeff Bezos in the rankings, once briefly in January this year, and then again on Monday when his net worth was estimated to be around $200.7 billion. Bezos is currently second on the list, with a net worth of $192.5 billion, while French art collector and investor Bernard Arnault is third with a net worth of $174 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-world-s-richest-man-wants-to-send-no-2-statue-to-jeff-bezos-report-101632897030169.html
29-09-2021||World||Japan’s ruling party picks Fumio Kishida as leader, set to be next prime minister||Fumio Kishida is set to become Japan’s prime minister after the ex-foreign minister overcame popular reformer, Taro Kono, to win the leadership of the country’s ruling party. Kishida, 64, was expected to be appointed Monday to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, putting him in charge of the world’s third-largest economy as it seeks to rebound from a virus emergency. The self-effacing former banker from Hiroshima has promised tens of trillions of yen in spending and pledged to steer away from “neoliberal” economic policies in a bid to bolster the middle class.Kishida’s victory caps an unpredictable Liberal Democratic Party election, in which two of the four candidates were female and most of the party’s largest factions allowed their members a free vote. Although Kono and Kishida were nearly tied on the first ballot, Kishida’s stronger support among members of parliament pushed him over the top in the second round after Sanae Takaichi and Seiko Noda -- both former internal affairs ministers -- were eliminated.In the end, Kishida got 257 votes, compared with Kono’s 170. Japanese markets, which closed just before the final result was announced, pared some losses, with Topix Index and Nikkei 225 both down 2.1%The LDP, which has been in power for all but about four years since 1955, will use its majority in parliament to formally install him as premier in a special session. Still, Kishida, who acknowledged during his campaign that some see him as boring, will face an immediate test of his broader appeal in a general election that he must hold by November.Long seen as a dove on foreign policy for his opposition to nuclear weapons and efforts to resolve a painful decades-old dispute over Japan’s past militarism in the Korean Peninsula, Kishida showed a harder edge in his campaign for the leadership. He has expressed the need to deal “firmly” with the stability of the Taiwan Strait and said that Japan’s defense spending will probably continue to rise.The next prime minister must lead the LDP into a national election within weeks, and lay out policies for tackling long-running issues such as the dwindling population. The new cabinet will also be tasked with figuring out how to tackle sour relations with China, the country’s biggest trading partner, without distancing Japan from its only military ally, the US.Suga, who abandoned a plan to run for re-election after his support rates plummeted to record lows amid criticism of his handling of the pandemic, was seen as a liability for his party heading into the election expected next month.The country’s vaccination program got off to a slow start, and efforts to provide financial support to individuals were seen as inefficient. Nonetheless, the death toll in Japan is far lower than that seen in other wealthy nations, while restrictions on daily life have been relatively light.In one of his final acts as premier, Suga on Tuesday decided to lift a virus state of emergency at the end of September as new Covid-19 infections recede, easing restrictions that have dragged on the economy and limited operations at bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-ruling-party-picks-fumio-kishida-as-leader-set-to-be-next-prime-minister-101632895898793.html
29-09-2021||World||Who will be Japan's next prime minister?||Japan's minister for vaccines and reform, Taro Kono, is way ahead of his rivals for the job as head of the country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) when party members and its elected politicians vote on Wednesday, according to opinion polls.Despite that popularity, analysts believe that quietly agreed pacts and promises between the party's rival factions will ensure a different outcome.The election of the party leader was forced upon the LDP by the recent announcement by deeply unpopular Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga that he would not stand for reelection after just a year in the job.Whoever wins the party leadership vote will also assume the post of prime minister, at least until a general election is held later in the year, with early November the most likely date.Kono, who has previously served as defense and foreign minister and has established a reputation as a blunt-speaking politician who gets things done, had the support of about 45% of the general public in a poll conducted over the weekend and, more importantly, more than 47% of party members with a vote.Support of party membersIn contrast, former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida had 22% of rank-and-file party members on his side, while 16% were backing Sanae Takaichi — an ardent nationalist who revels in the reputation of Japan's "Iron Lady" — and a mere 3% were supporting Seiko Noda, the party's acting secretary-general.Political analysts say that an unprecedented two women running for the post of prime minister is a generally positive development for Japanese politics — which has never seen a woman in the top position — but the sense is that a party as deeply conservative as the LDP is not yet ready for a female leader.That will whittle the choices down to the two male candidates, Kono and Kishida. And even though Kono has, on paper, double the support of his rival, the party's two-stage voting system means that he is likely to miss out."I do not expect a clear winner to emerge from the first round of voting, so the candidates will be reduced to two and I see it as a duel between Kono and Kishida," said Koichi Nakano, a professor of politics at Tokyo's Sophia University."And even though Kono is clearly the most popular with party members and the general public, the second round of voting is only for politicians, and I expect the factions who previously supported Takaichi or Noda to switch to Kishida," he told DW. "At this stage, I would be very surprised if Fumio Kishida does not win."Different interests behind the scenesKishida's victory is being managed by the "old guard" — such as former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and present Finance Minister Taro Aso — who wield vast amounts of behind-the-scenes power, despite efforts by some to modernize the institution. And they see Kono as too middle-of-the-road — or even progressive — in many of his policies."The old guard wants to keep everything as it is, and Kono is seen as part of a younger generation of politicians who would like to change the party," Nakano said."They want Kishida to take over because he would be an easier puppet for them to control," he claimed.Kishida and Abe both entered politics at the same time, after the 1993 election, and have remained close throughout their careers, he said, pointing to Kishida's "unfailing loyalty" when Abe was prime minister.Kono, on the other hand, has a very different personality and "would be far more difficult to control," he added.Perception of politics as a 'man's job'Hiromi Murakami, a professor of political science at the Tokyo campus of Temple University, agreed that while a woman is unlikely to win the party election, the positive showing of Takaichi has been "surprising.""Many analysts did not expect her to remain this competitive so late in the race, but it looks as if she has managed to stand out with policies that have the support of the far right of the party," she said.Those policies include support for Japan developing nuclear submarines, expanded military spending, greater resources devoted to protecting outlying Japanese territory from foreign claims — notably from China — and reiterating "family values" policies that resonate with conservatives, such as opposing proposals for women to be permitted to retain their maiden name after marriage.Ultimately, however, the perception that politics is a "man's job" among the vast majority of party members and politicians means that Takaichi will not win the vote — although her candidacy may well serve to pave the way for more women to stand at all levels of politics across the country, Murakami said.And with the general election coming hard on the heels of the party leadership vote, the expert said the new leader will have little time to get their vision for the nation across to the public. Yet the new leader will have the huge advantage of not being outgoing Prime Minister Suga.Day-to-day concerns"For ordinary people, the biggest day-to-day concern is still the coronavirus pandemic and the employment and broader economic problems that it has caused over the last 18 months or so," she said.With Suga's popularity collapsing from more than 60% when he first took office in September last year to below 30% in the most recent polls, the incoming LDP leader can expect a substantial "new leader" bump at the ballot box in November."Whoever comes in is going to be a big change and the party should no longer have to worry about being badly damaged in the upcoming election," she said. "If the new leader can get across his hopes and expectations and have a bit more charisma in front of the public, then the LDP should easily be able to win the most seats."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-will-be-japan-s-next-prime-minister-101632893980858.html

29-09-2021||World||Jeans could get costly after cotton prices reach a decade high||Cotton futures raced past $1 a pound for the first time in nearly a decade as adverse weather and shipping snags threaten supplies, driving up costs for clothing around the world. Crops in several key-growing countries are seeing problems, from rain-drenched fields in the U.S. to bollworm-infested ones in India. At the same time, cotton buyers need more of the fiber. Mexico and China are buying record amounts. Also causing trouble for supplies are high freight rates and geopolitics, with international backlash about labor violations in Xinjiang, China’s biggest producing region. The U.S. banned imports earlier this year. All of this is coming together to drive up prices, which means the cost of making clothing will be on the rise. That will squeeze margins for apparel makers like Levi Strauss & Co., and result in inflation for everything from T-shirts to jeans if retailers try to pass on the expense to consumers.  In New York, the contract for December delivery climbed as much as 3.6% to $1.0155 a pound, the highest since November 2011. The price has surged 28% this year. Gains are being intensified by traders rushing to cover short positions.    With cotton projected to see a second year of global supply deficits, traders are focusing on an updated figure for the shortfall that is due this week from researcher Cotlook. While the spike to $1 is psychologicallly significant, the rally likely won’t surpass the $2 level reached in 2011, said Louis Rose, a director of research for Rose Commodity Group in Tennessee. “Ten years prior, China was virtually out of cotton -- not so this time,” said Rose, who previously worked for Cargill Inc.  The fundamentals aren’t in place for a doubling in cotton prices, said John Robinson, an economist at Texas A&M’s AgriLife Extension in College Station. While supply chain disruptions are hurting cotton, U.S. production fears are overhyped, he said. “Since Friday this run-up has been from speculator buying, and that can turn around as fast as it started,” he said.  (Updates with analyst comments.

Kennedy International Airport in New York City.Customs then changed the clearance to Dulles International Airport outside Washington before denying the plane landing rights anywhere in the United States, he said."I have a big, beautiful, giant, humongous Boeing 787 that I can see parked in front of us," he said. "I have crew. I have food."Stern said intermediaries in Kabul had obtained permission from the Taliban-run Afghan Civil Aviation Authority for the groups to send a charter flight to retrieve the passengers from Kabul airport.(Reporting by Jonathan Landay; Editing by Scott Malone and Stephen Coates)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bars-flight-from-landing-with-americans-from-kabul-report-101632889315577.html

Terming the US move a breach of national security, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid asked all the nations to act in accordance with mutual obligations.Mujahid also stated that acting on obligations would prevent negative consequences. "We call on all countries, especially the United States, to act in accordance with mutual obligations ... to prevent any negative consequences," he said in a tweet, according to Sputnik.The Pentagon had last month said that it will continue to conduct drone strikes against the Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K) and other terrorist groups operating within the South Asian nation. "We have the capability from an over the horizon perspective of ensuring our national security interests are protected and defended," said press secretary of Pentagon John Kirby, according to Fox News. "And what I would tell you, without getting into hypotheticals or speculating about future operations, we're going to continue to maintain those capabilities and use them if and when we need to," Kirby added.The Taliban took control of Afghanistan last month and announced its interim government earlier in September. The US troops left Afghanistan on August 31 under the previously agreed Doha deal with the Taliban last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-ask-us-not-to-operate-drones-over-afghan-airspace-report-101632884965495.html
29-09-2021||World||Japan's ruling party to pick new leader who is set to become next prime minister||Japan's ruling party picks its new leader on Wednesday, with a mild-mannered former foreign minister and the Twitter-savvy vaccine chief leading the race to become the country's next prime minister. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is going to the polls with prime minister Yoshihide Suga opting not to stand, ending his tenure as premier after just a year in the role.Whoever wins will be approved as prime minister by parliament within days, and will then contest general elections in which the LDP is expected to retain power.The race to become the next leader of the world's third-largest economy is unusually tight this time around, in part because most of the party's powerful factions are not backing a candidate and their members will vote freely.Four politicians are in the running, two men and two women, another unusual turn of events in a country that has never had a woman prime minister and has few prominent women political figures.The race is expected to come down to former foreign minister Fumio Kishida, who lost out to Suga last year, and vaccine rollout chief Taro Kono, one of Japan's most recognisable politicians.Their competitors, hawkish right-winger Sanae Takaichi and feminist former gender equality minister Seiko Noda, are not expected to advance beyond a first-round vote.The initial vote on Wednesday afternoon will involve 382 LDP lawmakers and an equal number of rank-and-file party members.But if no candidate secures a majority, the top two will advance to an immediate second round involving 382 lawmakers and one party representative from each of Japan's 47 regions.Kono vs KishidaAdministrative reform minister Kono is the favourite with the public, reflecting in part his strong name recognition.A former defence and foreign minister, he has been considered a likely candidate for the top job for years.He favours a direct communication style that breaks from the cautious approach often preferred by Japanese politicians and engages freely with the more than two million people who follow his Japanese Twitter account.But he has also been described as abrasive and criticised for blocking people on Twitter and over allegations in tabloid reports that he bullied bureaucrats.His main rival is Fumio Kishida, a former foreign minister and LDP policy chief who has pledged more pandemic stimulus if elected.Kishida has sought to capitalise on public discontent over Suga's response to the pandemic, which has seen his government's approval ratings slump to record lows.He has emphasised his skill as a listener and invited citizens to share their requests and proposals with him, even toting a suggestion box and notebook to scribble ideas at events.The son of a Hiroshima family of politicians, Kishida unsuccessfully ran for the leadership against Suga last year and said the experience had made him more forceful and determined.Whoever wins the race will face a plethora of challenges, from driving a post-pandemic economic recovery to confronting threats from North Korea and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-ruling-party-to-pick-new-leader-who-is-set-to-become-next-prime-minister-101632882745835.html

The report was based on a study of more than 22,000 people who signed up to a vaccine safety smartphone app and who received a booster shot between August 12 and September 19.During this time, third doses were authorised for people who are immunocompromised but not the wider population. "The frequency and type of side effects were similar to those seen after the second vaccine doses, and were mostly mild or moderate and short lived," CDC director Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing, reports AFP.Reported side effects include injection site pain (in 71 per cent of the participants), fatigue (56 per cent), and headache (43 per cent). Some 28 per cent reported being unable to perform normal daily activities, usually the next day. Medical care was sought by around two per cent of participants and 0.1 per cent were hospitalized.A subset of almost 21,700 who received the same mRNA vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer) for all three of their doses was further analyzed. Among those who received Moderna, reaction such as arm pain was reported to be slightly more common after the third dose compared to the second. Systemic reactions which occurred outside the injection site were slightly less frequent after the third dose compared to the second.The same pattern occurred for Pfizer and in both the cases the first shots resulted in significantly less frequent side effects, compared to shots two and three.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/side-effects-after-covid-19-booster-dose-similar-to-2nd-shot-says-us-study-101632879922498.html
29-09-2021||World||Top US military officials advised keeping troops in Afghanistan, warned Biden against withdrawal||Top military officials of the United States, while testifying before a high-level Senate committee on Tuesday, revealed that they had recommended US president Joe Biden to keep some 2,500 American troops standing by on the ground in Afghanistan and also expressed concerns over the fact that the Taliban had not completely severed its ties with the al Qaeda terror outfit. The development comes after White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden had received “split” advice from top-level leaders on what to do with the situation in Afghanistan, which the United States invaded 20 years ago after the al Qaeda conducted the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington.Also Read | Need to fully examine Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan: US General Mark MilleyGeneral Mark Milley, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Kenneth McKenzie, commander of the US Central Command; and defense secretary Lloyd Austin were grilled for nearly six hours by members of the Senate Armed Services Committee about the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the chaotic evacuation from Kabul airport.General Milley and General McKenzie testified before the Senate committee that they had personally recommended some 2,500 troops remain on the ground in Afghanistan.Milley also claimed that the United States' withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan amid the Taliban offensive had ‘damaged’ American credibility.“I think our credibility with allies and partners around the world and with adversaries is being intensely reviewed by them to see which way this is going to go and I think ‘damage’ is one word that could be used, yes,” he said, adding that the Taliban “was and remains a terrorist organisation and they still have not broken ties with the al Qaeda,” which plotted the September 11, 2001 attacks from Afghanistan.Also Read | Top US general in 'pain and anger' over Afghanistan situation after withdrawal“It remains to be seen whether or not the Taliban can consolidate power or if the country will fracture into further civil war,” he said. “But we must continue to protect the American people from terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan.”US president Joe Biden had in April ordered a complete pullout of US forces from the war-torn land of Afghanistan by August 31, making the decision to end a 20-year-war. Although he was following through with an agreement reached with the Taliban by former president Donald Trump, Biden was heavily criticised for the decision back home. A national poll conducted soon after the Taliban takeover of Kabul showed that Biden approval ratings as president, which fell to 43 per cent, were at an all-time low. The majority of Americans disapproved of the way Biden handled foreign policy, while a large section of the populace also termed the United States' role in Afghanistan a “failure”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-military-officials-advised-keeping-troops-in-afghanistan-warned-biden-against-withdrawal-101632875435774.html
29-09-2021||World||France moves against 'radical' Muslim groups, centres: Minister||France is moving to shut six mosques and break up several associations suspected of producing radical Islamic propaganda, Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin said on Tuesday.A third of the 89 places of worship "suspected of being radical" and flagged by the intelligence services had been checked since November 2020, he told Le Figaro newspaper.Of those, action to shut down six -- in five different departments across France -- had been launched, he said.The authorities would also request the dissolution of the Islamist publishers Nawa and the Black African Defence League (LDNA).Nawa, based in the southern French town of Ariege, "incites the extermination of the Jews and legitimises the stoning of homosexuals", Darmanin said.The LDNA, the organisers of a protest against police violence in front of the US embassy in Paris in June last year, "calls for hate and discrimination", he said."In the coming year, 10 other associations are going to be the object of a dissolution procedure, four them next month," he said.Last week, the Council of State, France's highest administrative court, approved the government's move to dissolve the Collective against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) and Baraka City.The government acted after the October 2020 murder of teacher Samuel Paty.Paty was targeted following an online campaign against him for having shown controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo during a civics class.Darmanin also said he had called on regional prefects to refuse any residence permits to imam's sent by a foreign country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-moves-against-radical-muslim-groups-centres-minister-101632875708544.html
29-09-2021||World||Maryland newspaper gunman gets more than 5 life prison terms||Selene San Felice said she often questioned how or why she survived the shooting that left five others dead at a Maryland newspaper. Montana Winters Geimer described the grievous loss she and the community suffered when her mother, longtime local journalist Wendi Winters, was killed in the attack.San Felice and Winters Geimer were among several survivors and relatives of victims of the June 2018 killings at the Capital Gazette newspaper who testified in court Tuesday before a judge sentenced the shooter to more than five life terms without the possibility of parole.“We lost the storyteller of our family, and as a community we lost the storyteller for everyone that is an Annapolitan,” Winters Geimer said.Judy Hiaasen spoke of how difficult it was to even talk about the loss of her younger brother, Rob Hiaasen, who was an editor and columnist at the paper. She described his ability to keep memories of their mother and father alive. Now, she said, “That story has been taken from me.”“My little brother was slaughtered, and the impact of that loss is indescribable,” she said. “It is unique, and it is never-ending.”Anne Arundel Circuit Court Judge Michael Wachs described shooter Jarrod Ramos' actions as a “cold-blooded, calculated attack on the innocent employees of a small-town newspaper.” Ramos used a shotgun to kill his victims.“The impact of this case is just simply immense,” Wachs said. “To say that the defendant exhibited a callous and complete disregard for the sanctity of human life is simply a huge understatement.”Wachs gave Ramos an additional 345 years to underscore the fact that he would never be released from prison. And he ordered another life sentence for the attempted murder of photographer Paul Gillespie, who had previously testified that Ramos barely missed him with a shotgun blast as he ran out of the newsroom.While Gillespie said he didn’t believe there could have been a better outcome at the sentencing hearing, he doubted a full sense of closure would ever be possible after losing his five colleagues.“I was almost killed myself,” Gillespie said outside the courthouse. “It’s something that haunts me every day.”In July, a jury took less than two hours to reject arguments from Ramos' lawyers during a 12-day trial that he was not criminally responsible due to mental illness for killing Winters, Hiaasen, John McNamara, Gerald Fischman and Rebecca Smith.Ramos had pleaded guilty but not criminally responsible to all 23 counts against him in 2019, using Maryland’s version of an insanity defense. The case was delayed several times before and during the coronavirus pandemic.“The judge was crystal clear that Jarrod Ramos should never be allowed to walk out of prison — ever," Anne Arundel County State's Attorney Anne Colt Leitess said of the sentence handed out Tuesday.San Felice, who watched one of her colleagues get shot and survived one of the deadliest attacks on a newsroom in US history by hiding under her desk, testified that she and other survivors were determined to “press on” and not let the traumatic attack stop them.“Remember this,” she said, as Ramos sat on the other side of the courtroom. “You cannot kill the truth.”Ramos declined to make a statement in court when asked by his attorney, Katy O’Donnell.Prosecutors said Ramos, 41, acted out of revenge against the newspaper after it published a story about his guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of harassing a former high school classmate in 2011. Prosecutors said his long, meticulous planning for the attack — which included preparations for his arrest and long incarceration — proved he understood the criminality of his actions.They also highlighted how Ramos called 911 from the newsroom after the shooting, identified himself as the gunman and said he surrendered — evidence, they said, that he clearly understood the criminality of his actions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maryland-newspaper-gunman-gets-more-than-5-life-prison-terms-101632873290098.html

29-09-2021||World||US general defends calls made to China||General Mark Milley, head of the US joint chiefs of staff, said the two calls that he had made to his Chinese counterparts in the final weeks of the Trump administration were a normal part of his job and were coordinated with the acting defence secretary and other senior officials.There were fears that former president Donald Trump could start a war with China. That was the context of the call in October 2020. Then a second call took place two days after the January 6, 2021 storming of the US Capitol by Trump’s supporters.“I know, I am certain, President Trump did not intend on attacking the Chinese, and it is my directed responsibility to convey presidential orders and intent,” Milley told the Senate armed services committee on Tuesday, referring to a call he had made on October 30, 2020.“My job at that time was to de-escalate,” Milley said, adding that “at secretary of defence [Mark] Esper’s direction, I made a call to General Li on October 30. Eight people sat in the call with me, and I read out the call within about 30 minutes of the call ending”.Milley also told lawmakers at the hearing that there’s a need to “fully examine” the role played by Pakistan in granting sanctuary to Afghan players, echoing US secretary of state Antony Blinken who recently said that ties with Islamabad, a major non-Nato ally (MNNA) of the US, were being reviewed because of its role in Afghanistan.“We need to fully examine the role of Pakistan sanctuary,” Milley said on the US decision to pull out of Afghanistan. The US general brought up Pakistan’s role in the context of factors that turned Afghanistan into America’s longest war.Milley said the Taliban “remains a terrorist organisation” that hasn’t broken ties with Al-Qaeda. He warned that a reconstituted Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan with aspirations to attack the United States was “a very real possibility” - perhaps in as little as a year.He called the 20-year war in Afghanistan a “strategic failure” and said he believes the US should have kept several thousand troops in the country to prevent the Taliban takeover that happened faster than predicted.Also testifying at Tuesday’s hearing was US defence secretary Lloyd Austin. He defended the Afghan evacuation process as “the largest airlift conducted in US history”, but conceded there were problems. “Was it perfect? Of course not.”Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan over the past 20 years, especially the sanctuary enjoyed on its territory by the Taliban and Haqqani Network operatives, has come under fresh scrutiny. Some lawmakers want Pakistan’s status as an MNNA to be rescinded.A new report by the Congressional Research Service says Pakistan continues to serve as the “base of operation and/or target” of 15 terror groups including the Taliban and the Haqqani Network that are ruling Afghanistan now, and five that have been focused on India.The report warns of “a resurgence of regional terrorism and militancy” in the wake of the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in Kabul, 20 years after they were toppled by a US-led offensive. The India-centred groups on the list are Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, which were behind most terror attacks in recent years. The three others are Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, Harakat-ul-Mujahideen and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/need-to-fully-examine-pakistan-s-role-in-afghanistan-us-general-mark-milley-101632853569411.html
29-09-2021||India||10 Congress MLAs land in Delhi from Raipur, say there is no crisis in state||RAIPUR: Ten Congress legislators from Chhattisgarh landed in national capital Delhi on Wednesday to meet the party’s state in-charge PL Punia with a message for Rahul Gandhi. The legislators, said Brihaspat Singh who is leading the group, want Gandhi to visit the state for at least four days and not just two.Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who is in the middle of a tussle with cabinet colleague TS Singhdeo over the chief minister’s chair, first spoke of Rahul Gandhi’s proposed visit on August 28 after a long meeting with the Congress high command on suggestions that Baghel should move aside. News of Rahul Gandhi’s proposed visit to see how the Chhattisgarh government had delivered on its promises, was seen to signal that Baghel has an edge over Singhdeo. Senior minister and Chhattisgarh government spokesperson Ravindra Chaubey told reporters on September 23 that Baghel was scheduled to travel to Delhi in the first week of October to discuss Rahul Gandhi itinerary for his Chhattisgarh trip.Brihaspat Singh, the MLA from north Chhattisgarh’s Ramanujganj seat, said they want Rahul Gandhi to spend more time in the state so that he can visit more places.“We will meet Punia ji (PL Punia) today or tomorrow... Actually, Rahul Gandhi will be visiting Chhattisgarh in next few days for two days and we are here to urge high command to extend the two-day visit so that Rahul ji (Rahul Gandhi) can give more time to our state and meet more people,” Singh told HT on phone soon after his plane landed in Delhi.Also Read: The inside story of the Bhupesh Baghel-TS Singh Deo battle in ChhattisgarhBrihaspat Singh, widely seen as a Baghel loyalist, triggered a political firestorm in Chhattisgarh Congress in July when he accused Singhdeo of engineering an attack on his convoy in Ambikapur. TS Singhdeo, the state’s health minister, had then walked out of the assembly and returned only when home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu issued an unequivocal statement that the allegation was false. Brihaspat Singh also had to issue an apology.Asked if he along with nine other MLAs are in Delhi to discuss political crisis of the state, Singh shot back: “There is no political crisis in Chhattisgarh now ...Around 60 MLAs have verbally told their position to high command via Punia ji last month.. Everything is clear now”.The tug of war between Baghel and Singhdeo is linked to the much speculated two-and-a-half-year power-sharing agreement that was reportedly arrived at between the two leaders.In December 2018, in the aftermath of a dominant Congress performance where the party won 68 of 90 seats, friction between Bhupesh Baghel and TS Singh Deo meant that Tamradhwaj Sahu, now home minister, initially emerged as the frontrunner for chief minister, but pushed by the idea that a third leader would take the top position, Baghel and Singh Deo, along with Punia and Gandhi, reportedly arrived at a power-sharing arrangement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-congress-mlas-land-in-delhi-from-raipur-say-there-is-no-crisis-in-state-101632938542881.html

29-09-2021||India||Heavy rain poses challenge for CM Mamata, BJP on eve of polls in 3 Bengal seats||As rainfall triggered by a low depression lashed Kolkata and parts of Bengal on the eve of Thursday’s bypoll at Bhawanipore in the state capital and elections at two seats in Murshidabad district, the fear of low voter turnout became a cause for concern among Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders. At Bhawanipore in south Kolkata, where chief minister Mamata Banerjee is pitted against BJP’s Priyanka Tibrewal in her old seat, TMC councillors of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), were found making all efforts to pump out water from the streets on Wednesday. “One cannot take chances because turnout is always low during repolls,” one of them said on condition of anonymity. Banerjee, who was defeated by BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari at Nandigram in the March-April polls and needs to win Thursday’s election to continue as chief minister, expressed fear of low turnout while addressing her first campaign meeting on September 22. By then, the weather office had predicted the arrival of Cyclone Gulab, which eventually moved towards southern India. “Cast your vote even if it rains. I will suffer if I don’t get even one vote. Don’t be complacent and assume that my victory is ensured. If I do not win, someone else (from the TMC) will become chief minister since we are in the majority,” Banerjee said at the meeting in Ekbalpore, an area with a sizeable Muslim population. BJP leaders, too, said high turnout in earlier elections had increased the saffron camp’s vote share. “In the polls held on April 26, the turnout was 61.79% and we got 35.16% votes,” said BJP leader Shishir Bajoria. TMC’s Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who won the seat, vacated it so that Banerjee could contest again. Bhawanipore has 2,06,389 voters. According to TMC and BJP leaders, more than 20% residents are Muslims while Sikhs and non-Bengali Hindus comprise around 34% of the local population. The Congress is not contesting the seat as its electoral ally, the CPI (M), has fielded Srijib Biswas, who is a Calcutta high court lawyer like Tibrewal. Incidentally, the chief minister, too, had studied law. “Rain or no rain, Mamata Banerjee’s victory is certain,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy. Extensive security arrangements have been made at Bhawanipore in view of the demonstration TMC workers held on September 27 around BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh, prompting his security personnel to draw their pistols in the middle of a campaign procession. Officials said 35 companies of Central Armed Police Force and a huge Kolkata Police contingent headed by around 30 Indian Police Service (IPS) officers will be deployed in Bhawanipore on Thursday. In Murshidabad, the Muslim population (66.28%) is the highest among all districts in Bengal. With 2,55,998 voters, Jangipur did not witness an election on April 26 as Pradip Kumar Nandi, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) candidate, died of Covid-19. Jakir Hossain, the state’s former deputy labour minister who bagged the seat in 2016, has been fielded by the TMC against the BJP’s Sujit Das and the RSP’s Jane Alam Mian. The Congress has left this assembly segment for the RSP as part of the alliance that Congress, the Left parties and Indian Secular Front, a new outfit, inked before the eight-phase polls. Samserganj could not go to the polls because Rezaul Haque, the Congress candidate, died of Covid-19 in early April. TMC’s Amirul Islam, who won the seat in 2016, is apparently in an advantageous position because the local Congress unit has ignored the alliance by fielding Jaidur Rahaman against the CPI (M)’s Md Modassar Hossain. Rahaman initially backed out from the race because he is the brother of Khalilur Rahaman, the TMC Lok Sabha member from Jangipur, but started campaigning 10 days ago. The BJP has fielded Milan Ghosh, a debutant. There are 2,37,750 voters in Samserganj. The Election Commission has deployed 19 companies of Central Armed Police Force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-poses-challenge-for-cm-mamata-bjp-on-eve-of-polls-in-3-bengal-seats-101632934882771.html
29-09-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: Sept 30, 1984 — Golden Temple handed over to high priests; Santa Singh leaves Akal Takht||Amritsar- The historic Golden Temple and other buildings in its premises were handed over to the five high priests and the representatives of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee today (September 29), after the Army was completely withdrawn from the complex almost four months after it entered there to flush out terrorists and anti-social elements hiding inside. The handing-over of the Temple complex became possible after an agreement had been reached at midnight yesterday following a meeting between the senior adviser of the Governor, Mr. R. V. Subramanian, and the priests. The meeting was also attended by the representatives of the SGPC and the Akali Dal. Before the handing-over, the chief of the Budha Dal, Baba Santa Singh, came to the Akal Takht with his Nihang followers and performed “ardas” on the successful completion of the “kar sewa”. To avoid any clash between the followers of the Nihang chief and the Akalis, the entry into the Temple premises for the public was banned upto 11 a.m. The Nihang chief, who came to the Temple at 7 a.m., stayed there for about three hours during which he performed “ardas”, gave “saropas” to those who had contributed in the “kar sewa” and addressed his followers. The agreement on allowing the Nihang chief to come to the Akal Takht for performing the “ardas” was a major concession given by the priests as they had earlier declared him a “tankhaiya”, thus barring his right to perform the ‘ardas’ or visit the Akal Takht. During his brief address, the Nibang chief attacked the SGPC and the Akall Dal for not maintaining the sanctity of the Golden Temple. He said that the Army action was against “sinners and criminals”. It was for this reason that “I had not visited the Temple for the last three years”. Baba Santa Singh said that the SGPC and the Akali Dal had created problems in undertaking “kar sewa”. During the period when the Nihang leader was distributing “saropas” the “ragis” from the Golden Temple were reciting “guru bani”. The Sikh priests also kept away from the Temple as long as the Nihang chief was there and came only when a message was flashed to them that Baba Santa Singh had left. Before leaving the Baba, however went to the Temple and made his offering. His followers had a ceremonial bath before they departed in small groups. With the Nihangs leaving, the head priests came with a group of followers, and were handed over the premises by the senior adviser to the Governor who gave them the keys of the ‘Toshakhana”. Major-General A. K. Diwan told newsmen that with today’s handing over, “all men in uniform will withdraw from the premises of the Golden Temple. The entry to the Temple will be made open without any restrictions except for normal patrolling in the city”. An important change introduced is the reopening of the road which divides the Temple from other buildings in the complex. The road will now be open for both traffic and patrolling. The first task undertaken by the priests after they had taken possession of the Akal Takht was to undertake a complete washing of the “Akal Takht” for which they got water from the “sarovar”. After the premises had been washed, an “akhand path” was started which will continue for 48 hours. The Sikh priests obviously heavy over the smooth handing over, said they felt that the remaining issues would also be amicably resolved They were tightlipped and refused to comment on what had transpired during the talks. They said as a part of the agreement they had undertaken not to say anything to the Press. The successful handing-over of the premises and withdrawal of the Army from the Golden Temple complex brought an obvious sense of relief of this strife-torn city which had been waiting anxiously for things to settle down. PTI, UNI add: The “Toshakhana, a storehouse of the precious relies of the Sikh religion, was handed over to the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee in the presence of the five Sikh head priests here today. The senior adviser to the Governor, Mr R. V. Subrawnaniam, handed over the keys and charge of the ‘Toshakhana” as soon as the Nihans chief, Baba Santa Singh, vacated the premises of the Akal Takht after performing “ardas”. The five Sikh high priests said that the charge of the Golden Temple complex had been handed over to the “Sikh Panth”. “Akhand path” at the Akal Takht had started and all the Sikh rituals and rights would be restored after the bhog ceremony on Oct. 1, they said in a Press release. The high priests appealed to the Sikh community “to act in conformity with history. tradition of unity, amity, peaceful co-existence well-being of the country and wellbeing of everyone.” The duty of the Government was that it should treat people of all religions with equal respect, the note added. The high priest said: “We appeal to the Sikh people that no anti-national slogan should be shouted hi Darbar Sabib, which is the centre of well-being for all. Also, nothing should be done against the dignity and sanctity of this pious place which might disturb its peace and sanctity. “We condemn any and all antinational activity anywhere”, the note said. Thousands of devotees thronged the Golden Temple complex after it was handed over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-sept-30-1984-golden-temple-handed-over-to-high-priests-santa-singh-leaves-akal-takht-101632934462750.html
29-09-2021||India||At meeting with Amit Shah, Amarinder Singh says he discussed farm laws||NEW DELHI: Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh called on Union home minister Amit Shah at his residence in national capital Delhi on Wednesday. The two met for a little less than an hour.The meeting stoked speculation that the former Punjab chief minister could join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or float a separate party that would seek support from the ruling party at the Centre. BJP leaders have refused to speak about the details of the hush-hush meeting.Captain Amarinder Singh’s aide Raveen Thukral, who on Tuesday rebutted reports that the former chief minister could meet BJP leaders on his Delhi visit and insisted that Singh was on a personal visit, tweeted on Wednesday evening that the two leaders discussed the three farm laws and other issues related to farmers.Singh tweeted soon after on his meeting.“Met Union Home Minister @AmitShah ji in Delhi. Discussed the prolonged farmers’ agitation against #FarmLaws & urged him to resolve the crisis urgently with repeal of the laws & guarantee MSP, besides supporting Punjab in crop diversification. #NoFarmersNoFood,” the former chief minister said on Twitter.The former chief minister’s meeting with Shah was being closely watched as it comes close on the heels of dramatic developments in the poll-bound state. After Singh stepped down as the chief minister last week, his bete noire and the Punjab unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu also stepped down from his position. The meeting also comes in the backdrop of the ongoing farmers’ stir demanding a rollback of the farm laws.“There is a section of BJP leaders both at the Centre and in the state who are keen on the former chief minister joining the party. As a Jat Sikh face, a long-standing CM, they feel he has clout with the electorate and can be useful in helping work out a truce between the government and the farmers who are unrelenting from their position of seeking a role back of the farm laws,” said a BJP functionary. On whether a role has been envisaged for the former chief minister to negotiate with the farmers on behalf of the government, the functionary said, “Nothing has been finalised.”The former CM’s public criticism of the Gandhi siblings — he described former president Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi as “inexperienced” — have given ammunition to the BJP to aim at the Gandhi family. “The party has humiliated a tall leader and the message is undoubtedly going to ring loud and clear on the ground,” the functionary quoted above said.However, other leaders who spoke to HT on the condition of anonymity said the “age factor” will be a key consideration. “In the past, a lot of people who were welcomed into the party fold were picked on criteria such as winnability, age and their popularity,” said a second functionary.The BJP follows an unwritten rule of not giving positions of responsibility to those above 75 years of age. It made an exception in the case of BS Yediyurappa but recently replaced the 78-year-old warhorse with BS Bommai, 61. Captain Amarinder Singh is 79.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-meeting-with-amit-shah-amarinder-singh-says-he-discussed-farm-laws-101632931162388.html
29-09-2021||India||Children most vulnerable to sexual crimes: Attorney General tells top court||Attorney General KK Venugopal told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the controversial decision of the Bombay High Court requiring skin-to-skin contact of the accused with the child victim to establish sexual assault under POCSO Act showed a lack of sensitivity to the fact that children are most vulnerable to sexual crimes as they are unable to defend themselves. Venugopal, while making submissions on his petition challenging the January 19 Bombay High Court decision, said, “The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act 2012 is a special law to protect children against sexual offences as they are more vulnerable. The judge lacked the sensitivity to appreciate that POCSO Act is meant to prevent sexual offences against children who are unable to defend themselves.” Stating that the judgment under challenge created an extraordinary situation leading to a wrong precedent, the top law officer said, “The judge has misinterpreted Section 7 of POCSO (dealing with sexual assault) by implying skin-to-skin contact as an essential ingredient to make out an offence. It will have a devastating effect on pending cases before subordinate courts.” Section 7 of POCSO Act says, “Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person or does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration is said to commit sexual assault.” This offence carries a minimum punishment of three years extending up to five years. The HC judgment had acquitted a man for groping a 12-year-old through her clothing. Since there was no actual physical contact, i.e. skin to skin, the man was let off under the stringent POCSO Act. Instead, he was sentenced to one year imprisonment for outraging modesty under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).AG further pointed out flaws in the judgment by saying, “The judge makes a reference to Section 354 which is an offence of assault to outrage modesty of a woman. Here, the victim is a child.” He added that “children are the most vulnerable to sexual assault” and it is for this purpose the Parliament enacted the 2012 Act. In March 2020, the Government had informed the Parliament that till December 2019, 2.44 lakh cases were pending before courts of rape and POCSO offences across the country. AG quoted this figure in Court and described it as a “sad state of affairs”. Besides AG, the National Commission for Women (NCW) and the Maharashtra government have also appealed against the January 19 HC order. Based on the same logic of physical contact being a must to prove offences punishable under Section 7 of POCSO, the same HC judge passed another order on January 15 acquitting a man who held the hand of a minor after unzipping his pant. This order too was challenged by the state government and is pending consideration before the Court. The bench of Justices UU Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi concluded hearing the arguments by AG and NCW represented by senior advocate Geeta Luthra. The Court said, “Whether skin to skin contact is a requirement under Section 7 is the limited question that we will deal with.” The bench has appointed senior advocate Sidharth Dave to assist in the matter as amicus curiae. Dave told the Court that for proving an offence under Section 7, sexual intent is a must. On an earlier occasion, the AG had submitted that if one was to go by the logic adopted in the HC judgment, then, if a person, using surgical glove feels the entire body of a woman, including her private parts, will escape punishment under this provision. Dave supported this argument and said that the HC reasoning will be open to misuse by accused facing trial under other provisions of POCSO Act. The Court decided to continue the hearing of the case on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/children-most-vulnerable-to-sexual-crimes-attorney-general-tells-top-court-101632930502003.html

29-09-2021||India||Not just flights, Taliban wants scholarships to resume too. India is in no hurry||NEW DELHI: The Taliban setup in Kabul has been reaching out to the Indian side to explore the continuation of contacts in different fields, ranging from the resumption of commercial flights to scholarships for Afghan students, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday.These contacts have come at a time when the Indian government has indicated it is in no hurry to recognise the interim cabinet created by the Taliban, which is dominated by hardliners and members of the UN-designated Haqqani Network. The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that there had been no formal response to any of the Taliban proposals.The Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority, which is now controlled by the so-called “Islamic Emirate” of the Taliban, sent a formal communication to India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 7 regarding the resumption of commercial flights between the two countries from Kabul airport. The letter, addressed to DGCA chief Arun Kumar and signed by “acting minister” Hameedullah Akhunzada, contended that the Kabul airport was “damaged and [made] dysfunctional” by American troops before their withdrawal last month. The airport has been made operational again with aid from Qatar and a NOTAM or “notice to airmen” in this regard had been issued on September 6, the letter added. “The intention of this letter is to keep the smooth passenger movement between two countries based on the signed MoU and our National Carriers (Ariana Afghan Airline & Kam Air) aimed to commence their scheduled flights. Therefore, Afghanistan Civil Aviation Authority requests you to facilitate their commercial flights,” the letter said.In recent days, Taliban officials such as acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi have reached out to the Indian side through intermediaries to take up issues such as travel by Afghan students who have secured scholarships offered by the Indian government, the people cited above said.Muttaqi was reportedly keen that Afghan students holding Indian scholarships, including those awarded for the 2021 academic session, should be allowed to travel to the country. The people said the Indian side is in no hurry to take a call on recognising the Taliban setup or to respond to the messages from the Taliban, especially at a time when no other country has established official relations with the dispensation in Kabul.Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently cautioned the world community not to rush on the issue of recognising the new setup in Kabul because the change of power in Afghanistan was “not inclusive” and was done “without negotiation”.State-run Air India stopped flights to Kabul on August 15, when the Taliban marched into the Afghan capital following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government. The Afghan airspace was declared “uncontrolled” on August 16.On Sunday, the Taliban-run foreign ministry called for the resumption of international flights, promising full cooperation with airlines and insisting that all problems at Kabul airport had been resolved. The appeal was part of the Taliban’s efforts to open up Afghanistan and gain international acceptance.“As the problems at Kabul international airport have been resolved and the airport is fully operational for domestic and international flights, the [Islamic Emirate] assures all airlines of its full cooperation,” foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said.A limited number of aid and passenger flights have been operating from Kabul, but normal commercial services are yet to resume. On September 13, state-run Pakistan International Airlines became the first airline to fly a passenger flight in and out of Kabul in about a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-just-flights-taliban-wants-scholarships-to-resume-too-india-is-in-no-hurry-101632928342359.html

Captain also urged the Union home minister to repeal the farm laws and guarantee the minimum support price, besides supporting Punjab in crop diversification. Both Captain and his media advisor Raveen Thukral tweeted in this regard after the meeting at Amit Shah's resident in Delhi ended. Amarinder Singh also hashtagged his tweet with #nofarmersnofood.The meeting amid the Punjab crisis triggered speculation about Captain's next political move. However, no word has come out on whether Amit Shah and Amarinder Singh discussed Punjab. Met Union Home Minister @AmitShah ji in Delhi. Discussed the prolonged farmers agitation against #FarmLaws & urged him to resolve the crisis urgently with repeal of the laws & guarantee MSP, besides supporting Punjab in crop diversification. #NoFarmersNoFoodThe meeting between Amarinder Singh and Amit Shah comes at a time when the Congress is grappling with the crisis in Punjab. While Amarinder Singh's resignation from the post of the chief minister was thought to bring the curtains of the Captain-Sidhu clash, Sidhu is not happy with new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi yet and has resigned from the post of the state party chief. At a time when the Punjab Congress is apparently split into three caps belong to Channi, Sidhu and Amarinder Singh, Singh's meeting with Amit Shah gained significance. Watch | Amarinder meets Amit Shah: Joining BJP or talking farm laws? Capt's aide tweets what happenedAmarinder Singh has not ever dismissed the possibilities of leaving the Congress. In fact, he earlier said he would field a strong candidate against Navjot Sidhu if Sidhu becomes the CM face of the party in the upcoming election.When Amarinder Singh arrived at Delhi on Tuesday, he said no political meeting was scheduled; he was in Delhi to vacate Kapurthala House, his New Delhi residence. Even after saying this, he met Amit Shah at his residence and some reports indicated that Amarinder Singh might have left Amit Shah's residence in Shah's car. Later, it was said that Amarinder Singh did not leave in Amit Shah's car and the speculations arose when Singh left Amit Shah's residence without addressing a press conference. The farm laws were cited as one of the reasons why Amarinder Singh may not extend support to the BJP. Amarinder Singh has been a staunch supporter of the farmers' cause and opposes the farm laws in line with the Congress's response. In addition, Amarinder Singh is one of the most vocal leaders in support of the farmers as the ongoing protest in Delhi border has a majority of Punjab farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-discussed-farm-law-with-amit-shah-tweets-captain-s-aide-101632927598659.html
29-09-2021||India||As Congress struggles with Punjab crisis, Ghulam Nabi Azad seeks CWC meeting||As the Congress grapples to stabilize its Punjab unit and prepare for the upcoming polls, the G23 leaders launched a fresh salvo on Wednesday. Party veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad wrote to interim president Sonia Gandhi seeking a Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting to discuss the Punjab and Goa situation as well as the “mass exodus” in the organization. Another old warhorse, Kapil Sibal, demanded “open dialogue” and introspection, questioning the lack of clarity in the decision-making process. Sibal, a key participant of the G23 or the group that wrote to Sonia in 2019 seeking sweeping changes, reminded the party, “we are G23 but not ‘ji huzoor 23’”. “We don’t have a president. So, who’s taking the decisions? We all know and yet we don’t know. We want a CWC meeting for a dialogue to take place,” he said. Another UPA minister Manish Tewari, publicly stated that the Punjab situation was “mishandled” and the state required “stability”. On Tuesday, Navjyot Singh Siddhu, who was backed by both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to the PCC chief’s post, resigned barely two months into the job. According to party functionaries, Ghulam Nabi Azad wrote to Sonia Gandhi on behalf of G23 asking for a CWC meeting as “Developments in Punjab and Goa” are “disappointing” in light of poll prospects. He suggested that the CWC, not an extended CWC be called to also look into the issue of mass exodus from the party. A senior Congress leader said the CWC will be called soon and all issues would be discussed threadbare. This group of 23 senior leaders grabbed limelight in 2019 after writing to Sonia Gandhi seeking sweeping changes in the organization, following the party’s dismal performance in elections. Sibal announced that they will not leave the party but took digs at Rahul saying, “People close to them have left them. But those who are not considered close, are with them,” in an indirect reference to the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sushmita Dev and Jitin Prasada—all were considered close to Rahul. Tewari also posted on a micro-blogging site to vent his frustration. “I would be dishonest if I say that the situation was not completely mishandled. Suffice to say, whatever Capt Amrinder had said has come true. What Punjab needed at this time needed stability &unfortunately those who were in charge of state did not have a clue.” Sibal pledged loyalty and said he “condemns” those who left Congress. “But we also need to ask ourselves, we might have faults. The former Union minister argued the uncertainty in Punjab would be an “advantage” to Pakistan and its spy agency ISI. “We know the history of Punjab. The Congress party should make sure that they remain united. If anyone has issues, a conversation must take place and organizational structure must be strengthened.” He even quoted Gandhi to say, “Democracy can’t work with 20 men sitting at the Centre” suggesting an inclusive approach and more participation for the seniors in the decision-making process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-congress-struggles-with-punjab-crisis-ghulam-nabi-azad-seeks-cwc-meeting-101632927261817.html

"We know but we don't know," Sibal said, reiterating that the election of a president was one of the demands of the G-23.The sharp criticism did not go down well with a section of party workers who agitated in front of Kapil Sibal's residence with placards that read 'Get well soon, Kapil Sibal'.

Why it may hurt Cong in Goa||PANAJI: The Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) move to induct former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro in the party at an event in West Bengal capital Kolkata marks the first step by the Mamata Banerjee-led party to make another attempt to gain a toehold in the tiny western Indian state known for its gorgeous beaches. “My main mission is to defeat the BJP,” Faleiro declared in Kolkata. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, will not have to face the first impact of the TMC’s entry. That will be the Congress, as Faleiro tries to carve out a space for the TMC among voters unhappy with the BJP regime in the state.Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already declared the party will make a bid for power in Goa in early 2022 and has been on a roll. On a visit to Goa earlier this month, Kejriwal went beyond the free power and water promises and pledged to ensure that 80 per cent of jobs, including those in the private sector, will be reserved for local residents if the AAP comes to power.In this context, political analysts are sceptical about what kind of an impact a new wrestler in Goa’s crowded political ring would have, especially when the effort has been made just about five months before the state votes for a new government in January or early February 2022.“The impact will depend on how many others Faleiro can attract to the TMC. At the moment, besides himself, no one of political significance has joined him,” Cleofato Almeida Coutinho, a political analyst said.Goa’s political space is largely divided along cultural lines. The Congress and the like-minded parties have traditionally wielded influence in parts of Goa referred to as the old conquests -- Bardez, Tiswadi, Mormugao and Salcete talukas -- territories that were first captured by the Portuguese. Since these are coastal areas and are comparatively more densely populated, these areas, which account for a larger share of Goa’s 40 constituencies, also have a greater share of minority Catholic voters.The Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which largely expanded in Goa at the expense of the MGP, have traditionally been strong in areas known as new conquests -- these were captured by the Portuguese only in the 1700s. According to historians, these areas, unlike the old Conquistas, remained predominantly Hindu because by then the Portuguese rulers had no appetite for conversions.To be sure, the BJP’s move to induct 13 Congressmen over the course of the last four and a half years has disturbed some of these patterns and people in constituencies traditionally represented by the Congress are split between the sitting MLA who has joined the BJP, the Congress who identified replacements of their MLAs who switched sides, and the Aam Aadmi Party which has so far been largely restricted to minority-dominated areas. The Trinamool Congress’ entry could add to this competition.For now, the Congress is downplaying the impact that Faleiro’s exit or a ‘new entrant’ such the TMC will have,“It is actually a blessing that he has left. Because now all those who were being blocked by Faleiro will now have the space to grow in the party,” Congress president Girish Chodankar said.It is also being pointed out that Faleiro had a combined tenure of just about nine months back in his two stints as chief minister in 1998 and 1999. Faleiro has represented the Catholic-dominated Navelim constituency, and his area of influence is largely restricted to Salcete, a largely minority-dominated taluka.“The Congress is present in every village of Goa. We did not emerge yesterday. Our ideology is the ideology of the people of Goa. Goa and the Congress cannot be separated. There are many who are coming to Goa. Today the TMC wants to re-enter the state. They will suffer the same fate (as of their previous attempt). Those who joined them will be dumped and they will go back. Trinamool means one that rises from the ground. Here the party is being imposed from the top,” said Chodankar said. “They (TMC) are saying that they are here to defeat the BJP. If they are here to defeat BJP, why are they coming just three months before without doing any work for Goans,” he asked.The Trinamool Congress first entered Goa in 2012. Then too, like they are now, they were heralded into Goa by a former chief minister who was in the twilight of his political career, Dr Wilfred de Souza. The party didn’t win a single seat.Besides the AAP and TMC, the Congress also has to contend with Goencho Avaz, a network of environmental activists, and the Revolutionary Goans, a group of young activists and mining-affected workers who have also decided to put up their own candidates.In Goa’s 40-member house, the BJP currently holds a commanding majority of 27 seats. The Congress is reduced to four, while the Goa Forward Party has three and the MGP, NCP have one each besides three independents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-is-the-target-says-faleiro-after-joining-tmc-why-it-may-hurt-cong-in-goa-101632924021655.html

CPI (M)’s Touab Ali, who won the Aurangabad seat thrice since 1987, retained Samserganj in 2011 despite a Trinamool Congress (TMC) onslaught. TMC’s Amirul Islam, who managed to defeat Ali in the 2016 polls by around 2000 votes, will face the contest again on Thursday. Samserganj could not go to polls on April 26 -- when the seventh of the eight-phase election in Bengal was held -- because Rezaul Haque, the Congress candidate died of Covid-19 in early April. In Murshidabad, the Muslim population (66.28%) is the highest among all districts in Bengal. There are 2,37,750 voters in Samserganj and the Election Commission has installed security cameras in half of the 329 polling booths. Nineteen companies of the Central Armed Police Forces have been deployed. At Samserganj, which comprises the Dhulian municipality and eight panchayat areas, the TMC is in an advantageous position because the Congress has fielded Jaidur Rahaman against the CPI(M)’s Md Modassar Hossain although the two parties contested the March-April polls as allies. This is in sharp contrast to the district’s Jangipur seat -- which also goes to polls on Thursday -- where the Congress has allowed the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) to contest. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has fielded Milan Ghosh, a debutant. Jaidur Rahaman initially backed out from the race because he is the brother of Khalilur Rahaman, the TMC Lok Sabha member from Jangipur which was earlier held by former President of India Pranab Mukherjee and his son, Abhijit, who joined the TMC in July. “My family does not want me to contest,” Jaidur Rahaman said in July. However, he started campaigning about 10 days ago. “We are confident of winning the seat,” said Sahidul Sheikh, the community block unit president of the Congress. TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee campaigned at Samserganj on September 23 and targeted the Congress. “Only Mamata Banerjee can combat the BJP,” he said. State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who represents the Berhampore Lok Sabha seat in Murshidabad, has also campaigned in this constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-eyes-samserganj-seat-in-murshidabad-amid-congress-left-differences-101632921861692.html

Here's why||Some of India's private hospitals have cancelled orders for Russia's Sputnik V vaccine as they struggle to sell COVID-19 shots amid surging supplies of free doses of other vaccines offered by the government.Industry officials said low demand and the extremely cold storage temperatures required have spurred at least three big hospitals to cancel orders for Sputnik V, sold only on the private market in the world's biggest vaccine-producing country."With storage and everything, we have cancelled our order for 2,500 doses," said Jitendra Oswal, a senior medical official at Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College and Hospital in the western city of Pune."Demand is also not great. There is a class of people, barely 1%, that wanted to go for Sputnik. For the rest, anything would do."From May until last week, private hospitals accounted for just about 6% of all vaccines administered in India, although the government had freed them to buy up to a quarter of domestic output, health ministry data show.India is set to become a major production centre of Sputnik V, with planned capacity of about 850 million shots a year, and low domestic uptake could mean higher exports instead, a step backers are already pushing for. Indian companies have already started making Sputnik doses.The health ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Since a June launch event by Indian distributor Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, only 943,000 doses of Sputnik V have been administered by hospitals, a fraction of the national total of more than 876 million.Dr. Reddy's, which has imported about 3 million doses of the vaccine from Russia and refunded hospitals for cancelled orders, declined to comment.Its partner the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which markets Sputnik V internationally, also declined to comment.The mainstay of India's inoculation drive is the AstraZeneca vaccine, which can be stored in regular refrigerators, unlike Sputnik V, which needs temperatures of -18 degrees Celsius (-0.4°F), impossible to guarantee in most of India.The vaccine is also as much as 47% more expensive than AstraZeneca on the private market.Avis Hospitals, which runs eight vaccination centres in the southern city of Hyderabad, has also cancelled an order for 10,000 Sputnik V doses, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter who sought anonymity in discussing business matters.Avis did not respond to an email seeking comment.Another Pune hospital, which declined to be identified, said it had also cancelled its Sputnik V orders.Sputnik V is just one of the vaccines suffering from a sharp fall in private sales.Pune's Bharati hospital will end its COVID-19 vaccination programme when it runs out of AstraZeneca doses, as daily inoculations have fallen about 90% to 100 from their June levels, Oswal said.Just 9,000 doses remain of stocks of 62,000 it ordered.Avis's COVID-19 vaccine sales have shrunk 40% with existing stocks expected to last until December, instead of October, said the source.India's monthly production of vaccine, mainly of the AstraZeneca shot known domestically as Covishield, has quadrupled to 300 million doses from April, when a dramatic surge in infections and deaths prompted a halt in exports.Overseas sales are to resume in October.Covishield accounts for 88% of India's inoculations, followed by Bharat Biotech's domestically developed Covaxin. Both are administered for free at government centres since mid-January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-hospitals-cancel-russia-s-sputnik-v-vaccine-orders-here-s-why-101632919372131.html
29-09-2021||India||Amarinder Singh meets Amit Shah at Delhi residence amid Punjab crisis: Reports||Former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh reached Union home minister Amit Shah's residence in Delhi on Wednesday, reports said. The reported meeting comes at a time when the Punjab crisis is at its peak with a few months left before the assembly election. Speculations were rife after Amarinder Singh arrived in the Capital on Tuesday evening but the Captain said he is in New Delhi to vacate Kapurthala House, his Delhi residence. He also said no political meeting was scheduled in Delhi.Reports said that the meeting went on for around 45 minutes and his car is believed to have left Amit Shah's residence empty with Amarinder Singh might be travelling with Amit Shah at Shah's car, though the destination is not yet known. Later, these reports were dismissed and termed as mere speculations in the wake of Amarinder Singh not addressing a press meet after the meeting. Amarinder Singh's exit from the post of Punjab chief minister was not amicable as the former CM made no attempt to put a lid on his emotions and said that he felt humiliated, insulted by the Congress leadership. At the same time, he did mention that it was not time to hang his boots and hence all eyes are on Captain's next political move.  #WATCH | Former Punjab CM and Congress leader Captain Amarinder Singh reaches the residence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi pic.twitter.com/787frIaou7Reports said the meeting between Amarinder Singh and Amit Shah began at 6pm and it is a departure from the earlier meetings between Amarinder and Amit Shah, which used to take place at the office. The first meeting between Amarinder Singh and Amit Shah after Amarinder stepped down, which may or may not be just a courtesy visit, is taking place at the residence of Amit Shah.G-23 is not Ji Huzoor 23: Sibal's dig at high command amid Punjab row, says Congress has no presidentAmarinder Singh's resignation put a stop to the Captain-Sidhu clash in Punjab Congress, though Sidhu's resignation from the post of the Punjab Congress on Tuesday against new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi's portfolio allocation proves that the Congress is not likely to solve the Punjab riddle anytime soon. Amarinder Singh earlier said he would oppose Navjot Sidhu's candidature as a chief minister by fielding a strong candidate against him. Whether this plan of 'fielding a strong candidate' against Sidhu involves Captain joining any other party or floating a new party may become clear after the meeting.Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Wednesday said he is looking to solve the situation in the state party unit by discussing the points of differences with Sidhu whom he has invited for a talk. Party is supreme and he has no ego or rigidity over those appointments, Channi said. The Punjab crisis has also got veteran Congress leader Kapil Sibal talking about the crisis in the party. Addressing a press meet on Wednesday, the G-23 leader said people who are supposedly close to the high command are leaving while others are standing by, without any specific reference to the ongoing Punjab crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-reaches-amit-shah-s-residence-amid-punjab-crisis-101632919495212.html

He will be kept in the jail hospital for a month. However, the judge allowed home food for the dismissed police officer.The surgery was performed on Vaze on September 13 and he was to be discharged on September 28, however, the court had deferred his discharge to Wednesday as it awaited a response to Vaze’s plea from Taloja Jail where the police inspector was lodged after arrest .Vaze had filed a plea for house arrest post bypass surgery, claiming that he had undergone a complex cardiac surgery with five grafts.In his petition, he claimed that post surgery there was a high likelihood of contracting infection in a non-sterile environment, like that of a jail . The plea stated that the jail had a higher rate of tuberculosis and skin infection due to unhygienic conditions and overcrowding.Also Read: MVA terms Sachin Vaze’s allegations against Anil Deshmukh ’politically motivated’ Vaze’s plea also cited the case of Telegu poet Varavara Rao, arrested in the Elgaar Parishad case but given temporary bail for six months on medical grounds by the Bombay high court.Vaze’s plea said there was no question of absconding while recuperating at his home as constables will be posted outside and he was ready to pay for them. He also sought permission to meet his wife, who’s a nurse, and daughter during his home stay. NIA opposed the application saying the case of Dr P V Varavara Rao was completely different from petitioner’s case and stressed that Vaze’s judicial custody couldn’t be converted into a house custody since the investigation against him had been completed and charge-sheet filed. It also argued that the hospitals attached to Taloja jail were modern and capable of handling Vaze’s condition.The prosecution also said it feared there was every possibility that the applicant accused will abscond, if house arrest was granted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-court-rejects-sachin-vaze-s-plea-for-house-arrest-post-cardiac-surgery-101632916342865.html

West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and state minister Subrata Mukherjee were among the senior leaders present at the induction ceremony.A former president of Goa Congress, Luizinho Faleiro arrived in Kolkata along with a group of loyalists on Tuesday, days after he resigned from Congress as well as Goa assembly. Although he was tight-lipped on his future political move, until Wednesday, Faleiro extended his support to the Trinamool Congress. Welcoming the senior Goan leader to the party fold, Mamata Banerjee said the Trinamool Congress would “fight divisive forces and work towards ushering in a new dawn" for Goa.It’s a matter of great pride for me to welcome Former Goa CM, 7-time MLA and stalwart Goan leader Shri @luizinhofaleiro to the Trinamool Congress family.Together we will stand up for every Goan, fight divisive forces and work towards ushering in a NEW DAWN for Goa.

29-09-2021||India||Three-cornered contest in Jangipur assembly by-poll in Bengal||Comprising the Jangipur municipality and the community blocks of Suti and Raghunathganj, which includes two gram panchayat areas, the Jangipur assembly seat in Bengal’s Murshidabad district is set to witness a triangular contest on Wednesday. The seat is part of the Jangipur Lok Sabha constituency. Late former President Pranab Mukherjee won the Lok Sabha seat in 2004 and 2009. His son, Abhijit Mukherjee, who joined the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in July, represented the seat in parliament twice. The TMC wrested the Jangipur Lok Sabha seat in 2019. TMC has fielded Jakir Hossain, a former state minister who bagged the Jangipur assembly seat in 2016, for the by-poll. Sujit Das is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate and Jane Alam Mian is that of RSP. Hossain could not be fielded for the March-April polls as he was critically injured on February 17 in a blast at a railway station along with 21 TMC workers. The National Investigation Agency, which probed the case and filed a charge sheet in August, said the attack was carried out to derail the local assembly poll.Jangipur has been traditionally known as a Congress bastion. Congress has held the seat 11 times since 1951. It left the assembly segment for the RSP as part of an alliance for the March-April polls.Also Read: West Bengal rains cause waterlogging in Kolkata, East Medinipur and other areas TMC lawmaker Abhishek Banerjee, who campaigned in Jangipur last week, said only chief minister Mamata Banerjee can combat the BJP and oust the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre in 2024. He said both Congress and TMC were confronting the BJP. “But only our party has proved that it can defeat the BJP.

The G-23 leader said the party has to listen to the point of view of the leaders and introspect. "Democracy can not be worked by 20 men sitting at the centre," he said at a time when the party is facing a crisis in Punjab."I believe that one of my senior colleagues has [perhaps written or is about to write to Congress president to immediately convene a CWC so that a dialogue can take place as to why we are in this state," Kapil Sibal said adding that party has no president at present and hence he doesn't know who takes these decisions. "We know and yet we don't know," Sibal said. Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has reportedly written a letter to Sonia Gandhi, asking her to convene an urgent meeting of CWC meeting. Sibal said that G-23 will raise issues that need to be addressed. “It is very clear. We are G-23 not Ji Huzoor 23. We will keep talking. We will continue to reiterate our demands,” Sibal said. 'Have no ego': Punjab CM Charanjit Channi says party is supreme, invites Navjot Sidhu for talksSibal's comments come at a time when the Punjab Congress is internally split in several factions with a new drama unfolding every day. Following Captain Amarinder Singh's resignation from the post of CM, which did not happen in an amicable way, Charanjit Singh Channi was chosen as the chief minister. His new Cabinet took oaths and as the new government is set to roll with only a few months left for the election, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu has resigned from his post expressing dissatisfaction with the portfolio allocation that Charanjit Singh Channi made. "I don't want to talk about Punjab but a border state where this is happening to Congress party means what? It is an advantage to ISI and Pakistan. We know the history of Punjab and the rise of extremism there... we know how forces across the border exploit the situation to create an atmosphere of uncertainty. It is these forces that are the biggest threat to the nation. Congress should make sure that they remain united. If somebody has an issue, it has to be discussed," Sibal said.In his press meet, he addressed the media as a G-23 leader, the group of disgruntled Congress leaders who wrote to the high command that the party needs to elect its president. "I'm speaking to you (media) on behalf of those Congressmen who wrote the letter in Aug last year and are waiting for the actions to be taken by our leadership in respect of the election of the office of the president, to CWC and central election committee," Sibal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-is-no-president-don-t-know-who-is-taking-decision-kapil-sibal-on-punjab-crisis-101632912518246.html

29-09-2021||India||Chasm between NDA allies widens as JD(U) rethinks on special status demand||The announcement by a JD(U) minister in Bihar that the state was dropping its long pending demand of special status has once again brought to fore the blow hot, blow cold relation between the main allies of the National Democratic Alliance, the BJP and the JD (U). The sudden announcement is seen as a realization by the top JD (U) leadership that it doesn’t fit into the criterion laid down for the special status, though it has been raising the demand since 2005. “The top JD (U) leadership realized that Bihar does not qualify for the status given the conventional criteria for it. Nobody knows this better than Nitish Kumar himself,” feels Nawal Kishore Chowdhary, retired head of department of Economics, Patna University. “The dropping of the demand is quite logical,” said Prabhat P Ghosh, director, ADRI. “One of the reasons for this is that Finance Commission earlier used to differentiate between special category and normal states. Now the Commission has dropped the distinction. Following the recommendations of 14th Finance Commission, the Special Category States cease to exist and thus, no special category status has been granted to any state. Ever since the Commission ceased to differentiate between the two, the JD(U) rightly decided to drop this demand,” he added. However, both Ghosh and Chowdhary justify the special package demand. “The special package was promised when Jharkhand was formed,” said Ghosh. “The special package demand is more pragmatic and beneficial in view of declining state revenues, which has been the main plank of JD(U),” said Chowdhary. However, the JD(U)’s backtracking is also seen as one more instance of the growing chasm between the two parties after the recent setback to Nitish Kumar’s party, which has been championing the issue of caste census. With Kumar maintaining that he will hold discussions with all parties on caste census, the sudden drop of special status is seen as a “possible move to charter a different track in future.” The BJP reacted belligerently after an announcement to this effect was made by senior JD(U) minister Vijendra Prasad Yadav. “We should stop this tendency of begging instead we should develop ourselves in such a manner that we are able to give others. We should be grateful to the PM for providing so much to the state,” advised BJP minister for road construction, Nitin Nabin. “Earlier, the state share of revenue was 32% now it has increased to 42% while the remaining 58% is spent through different Centrally sponsored schemes,” said BJP state president, Dr Sanjay Jaiswal. “What special package are they talking about? The PM gave ₹1.25 lakh crore to the state as special assistance and had also announced to stand by the state in its hour of need,” said BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel. According to BJP leaders, as per the proposed recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission, Bihar is likely to get ₹4,78,751 crore, which is the second highest in the country. “This included ₹4,24,926 crore as central taxes and ₹53,825 crore as grants,” claimed a BJP leader. For urban bodies it is likely to get ₹35,577 crore which would be 66% more than the last amount ( ₹21,413 crore), it got. So where has Bihar been overlooked,” he added. “One cannot deny that there may be an element of politics in the decision to back out,” feels Chowdhary. “The JD(U) might be trying to pressurize BJP and is keeping its option open in the wake of projection of Nitish Kumar as PM material,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chasm-between-nda-allies-widens-as-jd-u-rethinks-on-special-status-demand-101632911060999.html

The Joint Typhoon Warning Center suggested it could intensify into a land cyclone but later said that it is only an area of convection. Some European models are indicating intensification of the system. “We do not think it is going to intensify into a cyclone. It will remain well marked for some time. The system is intense which brought extremely heavy rain yesterday (Tuesday) and bring very heavy rains today (Wednesday) also,” said Sunitha Devi, the in-charge of cyclones at IMD.Also Read: Extremely heavy rain likely over Gujarat, other parts of west coastAnother well-marked low-pressure area, a remnant of Cyclone Gulab, is over north Madhya Maharashtra, adjoining Gujarat and southwest Madhya Pradesh. It is likely to move west-north-westwards, emerge into the northeast Arabian Sea and intensify into a depression by Thursday morning. The remnant is likely to move further west-north-westwards and intensify into the cyclonic storm Shaheen during the subsequent 24 hours.

He said India was being referred to as a territory, but the country was about its people, relationships and that of ties among religions.Addressing an event in Malappuram in Kerala, the Wayanad MP said, “They say India is a territory, we say India is people, relationships. It's the relationship between Hindu and Muslim, between Hindu, Muslim and Sikh, between Tamil, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali (-speaking people). My problem with the PM is that he's breaking these relationships.”Gandhi is on a two-day visit to Kerala to reportedly quell growing dissent in the party's state unit. His trip to the southern state came amid a fresh turmoil that has gripped the party in Punjab following the resignation of Navjot Singh Sidhu as Congress president.Every time he uses hatred to break a bridge b/w 2 Indians, my job is to use love to rebuild that bridge, & not just my job but our job. I can't build a bridge without understanding different traditions, ideas, different religions, different cultures in this country: Rahul Gandhi pic.twitter.com/WXoKupBo3HHe said every time the PM resorted to hatred to break a bridge, his job and commitment was towards rebuilding the same. “Not just my job but our job. I cannot build a bridge without understanding different traditions, ideas, different religions and different cultures of this country,” Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Congress leader said hurting relationships among Indians was akin to attacking the idea of India. “That is why I oppose him (Modi),” he added.“What happens if an Indian person gets on a plane and goes to America, does he not remain Indian? Of course, he remains an Indian. So for me, India is the people who live here,” he further said.He also hit out at Hindutva ideologue VD Savarkar for whom, Gandhi said, India was a geography. “They take a pen, draw a map and say this is India. Outside this line, it is not India and inside this line, it is India,” Gandhi said.“A question arises, what if there was this map but no people living on this territory. Would you still be here? Of course not, because if there would be no people in this territory, you would not say that it is India,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-says-india-is-about-its-people-pm-using-hatred-to-break-ties-101632905753452.html

The agency arrested her close aide Saeed Khan yesterday. Gawali is accused of conspiring in connivance with Khan to convert Mahila Utkarsha Pratishatan, a trust, into a company through fraud to take over its property.People aware of the matter said ED seeks to interrogate the two together. ED’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case against Gawali is based on a First Information Report (FIR) registered in Maharashtra’s Washim district in May 2020 in connection with alleged financial irregularities in the trust. Gawali, who was also the chairperson of the trust, is the complainant in the FIR. She had accused her personal secretary Ashok Gandule and other employees of conspiring to misappropriate ₹18.18 crore belonging to the Pratishatan.Also Read: Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali’s aide held in money laundering caseIn its remand application for Khan, the ED on Monday told a special PMLA court that Gawali, through Khan and his accomplices, criminally conspired to convert the Pratishthan into a company under the Company Act through forgery in January 2020. ₹69 crore in book value was transferred to the newly formed company.

The chief minister's comment comes a day after Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned from the post of the Punjab Congress president saying that he won't be able to compromise with ethics and moral authority. The resignation has not yet been accepted, Congress sources said. Calling Navjot Sidhu as the ‘head of the family’, Channi said, “I have spoken to him on phone and told him let's sit and talk it out.”A day after the dramatic resignation, Sidhu on Wednesday issued a video statement in which he opposed the allocation of some portfolios in the Charanjit Singh Channi's new cabinet. Apparently referring to senior IPS officer Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, who has been given the additional charge of the director-general of Punjab Police, Sidhu said, “When I see those who gave clean chit to Badals six years back…such persons have been given the responsibility for delivering justice.” The appointment of APS Deol as the state's new advocate general has also apparently irked Sidhu. However, Channi underplayed the crisis that the resignation letter might lead to at a time when he is setting up his new government and told reporters that he is not rigid about these appointments. Dismissing that Sidhu's move is to threaten the government, Channi said, “Party is supreme. The government takes note of the need of the party. Today I called him and told him we can sit and talk over the differences. If you feel there is anything wrong, you can point it out like you used to do before.” “This is not a move to threaten the government,” he said adding that he has no ego over appointments but one thing that he will ensure as long as he is the chief minister is that there will be no corruption.The unending crisis in Punjab Congress is a serious concern in front of the leadership especially as the state is going to the elections next year. Senior Congress leader Manish Tewari said Sidhu's resignation from the post of the party chief is distressing. "As a Punjab MP, I am extremely distressed about happenings in Punjab. Peace in Punjab was extremely hard-won. 25,000 people, bulk of them Congressmen, sacrificed themselves to bring peace back to Punjab after fighting extremism and terrorism between 1980-1995," Tewari told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-charanjit-channi-says-party-is-supreme-has-invited-sidhu-for-talks-101632904578875.html

Also, no eateries or fairs can be held as part of the festivals. Besides 100 per cent mask compliance, the DDMA has made it mandatory for separate entry and exit points.The DDMA also announced physical reopening of all remaining classes from November 1. Offline classes for students of nine to 12 began a while ago.Delhi on Tuesday reported 34 fresh cases of Covid-19 and two related deaths.The decisions on further easing of curbs were taken at a scheduled meeting of the DDMA amid fears of an impending third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The second wave had wreaked havoc across the national capital.Last year, the government had allowed Durga Puja committees to conduct the rituals but did not allow visitors to the pandals. Dussehra too was allowed in a few locations with a cap on visitors, and enforcement teams were deployed at the venues. This year, Dussehra falls on October 15, while Durga Puja festivities will begin from October 11, with the days preceding the festivals often marked by large crowds in market places as people step out for shopping, eating, and entertainment.Experts have been warning against loosening of too many restrictions that might lead to another rise in fresh infections that have been on a declining trend for a while now.(With inputs from bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-allows-muted-dussehra-durga-puja-celebrations-curbs-to-remain-in-place-101632903127059.html

This has also helped the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) receive greater revenue.“We are moving fast towards achieving the target of zero charge-sheets in power theft cases with the help of the anti-power theft police stations and this is a big achievement,” said Kamal Saksena, director-general (vigilance), UPPCL. “Our police convince power theft culprits to get their offences compounded or settle the matters on the spot and get acquitted instead of getting involved in court cases once the charge sheets are filed.”Also Read: Opposition faces credibility crisis, BJP will get 325-350 seats: Adityanath People aware of the matter said in 2020 charge sheets were filed in only 990 power theft cases.

Check details||The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which issues Aadhaar card in the country, has slashed the price for authentication by customers. The charges has been slashed to ₹3 from ₹20 per instance to enable entities leverage its infrastructure for providing ease of living to people through various services and benefits.UIDAI CEO Saurabh Garg said that the potential of leveraging Aadhaar in the financial technology sector is immense. "We have slashed the rate from ₹20 per authentication to ₹3 and the objective has been to ensure that different agencies, entities should be able to use the power of digital infrastructure which has been created by the state that needs to be used to provide people with ease of living with dignity," Garg said.Till date, more than 99 crore e-KYC have been done using Aadhaar system."I think it gives a cost effective and non-repudiable solution to fintech companies to onboard new customers," Garg added.Last week, the department of telecommunications (DoT) issued a series of orders to implement "contactless, customer-centric and secured KYC processes". The reforms have been brought in to digitise KYC processes and make subscriber acquisition completely online, the DoT said.“Online service delivery has become an acceptable norm in the recent past and most of the customer services are being offered through internet with OTP authentication. Contactless services in the Covid era needs to be promoted for subscriber convenience and also for ease of doing business,” the telecom department said in a statement.Earlier this month, UIDAI announced some changes under which cardholders who have not registered their mobile number can download their Aadhaar cards from the entity's website.UIDAI said the facility will also help cardholders, who do not have a mobile phone or computer, in downloading the document.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uidai-slashes-aadhaar-authentication-charges-check-details-101632898160686.html

This is the real picture of Kashmir that visiting dignitaries must be shown instead of GOIs sanitised & guided picnic tours," Mufti wrote on Twitter.Locked up in my house today yet again for attempting to visit the village in Tral allegedly ransacked by army.

The daughter of the family had suffered serious injuries in the attack and was undergoing treatment at a hospital, she said, adding she would meet her kin."Army from Yagwani camp in Tral ransacked homes and ruthlessly thrashed a family last night. The daughter owing to her serious injuries was admitted to hospital. Not the first time that civilians from this village have been beaten up by army in this area,” she wrote on the microblogging site.Earlier this month too, the PDP chief had said she had been placed under house arrest and that the administration had told her that situation was far from normal in Kashmir. On September 7, Mufti said her house arrest exposed "the fake claims of normalcy” in the valley by the central government.On November 27, last year, she was detained by the Jammu and Kashmir Police and not allowed to meet the family of senior PDP leader Waheed Parra in Pulwama following his arrest. Mufti had said that her daughter Iltija Mufti was also placed under house arrest.The former chief minister had been detained for more than a year after the Narendra Modi-led central government decided to abrogate Article 370 that granted a special to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. She was later charged under the Public Safety Act (PSA), an official said.At the time, almost all political leaders in the Vally, including National Conference's Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah and People’s Conference leader Sajjad Lone, were arrest as the Centre revoked the state's special status and bifurcated it into two Union territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locked-in-my-house-yet-again-says-pdp-chief-mehbooba-mufti-101632896276656.html

29-09-2021||India||Navjot Singh Sidhu releases video message, says 'can't compromise with ethics'||A day after resigning from the post of Punjab Congress chief, Navjot Singh Sidhu released a video message on his Twitter handle, in which he obliquely criticised the appointment of induction of tainted MLAs into the cabinet of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and other controversial appointments.Also Read: Punjab deserves better, says Manish TewariIn the video message, Sidhu said that his only religion is to make people's lives better.हक़-सच की लड़ाई आखिरी दम तक लड़ता रहूंगा … pic.twitter.com/LWnBF8JQxu"I can't compromise with my ethics, moral authority. What I witness is a compromise with issues, agenda in Punjab. I can't disguise high command nor can I let them be disguised," Sidhu said in the video message."I don't have any personal rivalry with anyone; 17 years of my political career has been for a purpose, to make difference, to take a stand and to make people's lives better. This is my only religion," he further said.In the accompanying tweet, Sidhu said that he will continue fighting for truth “till his last breath”.Sidhu's resignation came 72 days after he was appointed as Punjab Congress chief, and eight days after Punjab got a new chief minister. He was miffed at not having his way with some senior appointments.According to people familiar with the matter, Sidhu’s resignation was triggered by the inclusion of Rana Gurjit Singh in the state cabinet, the appointed of APS Deol as the state’s attorney general, and Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota as the state’s DGP; and the allocation of the home portfolio to Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. Sidhu was already miffed at not being named chief minister, they added, and saw these as signals from Channi that he (the CM) and not Sidhu was calling the shots.The sudden resignation embarrassed Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, who together orchestrated Sidhu’s appointment and Amarinder Singh’s exit as chief minister as part of an effort to end factionalism in Punjab Congress and improve the party’s chances in next year’s state elections. It is said that Sidhu did not inform the Gandhis before resigning.The Congress leadership has not accepted Sidhu's resignation and efforts are on to persuade him to take back his resignation. Punjab ministers Amarinder Singh Raja Warring and Pargat Singh met Sidhu at his residence in Patiala. Warring had said yesterday that "there are some minor issues" and that those will be resolved by today.Hours after Sidhu’s resignation on Tuesday, three prominent leaders close to him also quit their posts: cabinet minister Razia Sultana, general secretary Yoginder Dhingra and treasurer Gulzar Inder Singh Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-singh-sidhu-releases-video-message-says-can-t-compromise-with-ethics-101632894338032.html

According to those familiar with the development, Gandhi will be visiting his parliamentary constituency of Wayanad today, and his visit is likely aimed at attempting to douse the fire within the Kerala Pradesh Congress unit. Photos posted by the ANI news agency this morning showed the former Congress president arriving at the Calicut airport in Karipur, from where he is set to proceed to Kozhikode and Malappuram later in the day.Kerala | Congress leader Rahul Gandhi arrives at Calicut Airport, Karipur. He will be visiting Kozhikode and Malappuram, today. pic.twitter.com/jL3RBJNy9PAccording to reports, Rahul Gandhi has three programmes scheduled for Wednesday at his parliamentary constituency of Wayanad, from where he was elected to the Lok Sabha in the 2019 elections. After staying back at Kozhikode, the Congress leader will be flying back to Delhi on Thursday.Reports of infighting in state units of Congress have become too frequent in recent days. Firework started in the faction-ridden party with the appointment of new party president K Sudhakaran, a tough leader from Communist heartland Kannur and opposition leader VD Satheesan, sidelining two powerful blocs led by former CM Oommen Chandy and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala who ruled the party for more than one and a half-decade. Problems aggravated after the DCC presidents’ list was released last month.Also Read | Congress leader Sudheeran quits AICC, days after resigning from pac in KeralaTwo days after he quit the party’s political affairs committee (PAC), sulking Congress leader VM Sudheeran on Monday announced his resignation from the All India Congress Committee (AICC), the second-highest decision-making body of the party after the Congress Working Committee. While Sudheeran, former PCC chief and five-time MP, did not disclose reasons behind his sudden decision leaders close to him said he was not happy with the functioning of new PCC chief K Sudhakaran and opposition leader VD Satheesan.There are complaints that decisions are taken unanimously, and senior leaders are often ignored. It is yet to be seen if Rahul Gandhi's imminent visit to the state will quell the dissent within the party unit, but those in the know say that the former Congress chief may speak to both Sudhakaran and Satheesan in the hopes of settling things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-on-2-day-visit-to-kerala-amid-reports-of-infighting-in-state-congress-unit-101632887646365.html
29-09-2021||India||India’s strategic autonomy expansion needs foreign policy reorientation: Experts||A discussion document by an independent group of leading policymakers, analysts and thinkers have said that India must maintain an outward orientation of its economy and avoid being pushed to the margins of the regional and global economy in order to enhance its growth prospects and improve people’s welfare.They believe that there is an unmistakable trend towards multipolarity in Asia and the world, and it is in India’s interest to reinforce this trend. The document says that the expansion of India’s strategic autonomy demands a re-orientation of its foreign policy towards mobilising the larger constituency of developing countries and emerging economies with which it has convergent interests and advance them through reinforcing multilateral institutions and processes.The full-version of the document, written by leading policymakers like Yamini Aiyar, Sunil Khilnani, Prakash Menon, Shivshankar Menon, Nitin Pai, Srinath Raghavan, Ajit Ranade and Shyam Saran, is called ‘India’s Path to Power: Strategy in a World Adrift’ and is set to be released on October 2.“The authors of the document believe that the current period of rapid geopolitical change and economic transformation carries risks, but also creates spaces for emerging countries like India to expand its strategic autonomy. However, to leverage opportunities and mitigate risks, critical decisions must be taken now to ensure that the coming decade sets the stage for India’s emergence as a front-ranking power in Asia and beyond. The recommendations in this document are directed towards this objective. Strategic autonomy, openness and inclusive economic growth are the key guiding principles,” their statement read.Also Read: Public-private partnership can bring ‘defence production revolution’: Rajnath They recommended that India should further strengthen its partnership with the United States, Japan and Europe as they share India’s security concerns and are the key source of capital, trade and technology, which will enhance India’s development prospects.The authors said that India faces an existential threat from climate change. They suggest that while working towards a supportive global regime on climate change, India needs to reorient growth strategies to prioritise sustainability by leveraging advanced technologies.To overcome the challenges faced in cyberspace, they said India must draw on the talent within and outside the government to urgently develop offensive cyber capabilities.While acknowledging the China challenge, the authors believe that India is the only country with comparable area, population, history, manpower, and scientific and technological capabilities to not only match but to surpass China as a parallel state.On the increasing threat posed by collusion between China and Pakistan, they said, there was a need for a politically guided strategic approach that identifies, prioritises and develops pertinent forms of power, which are housed in structures that promote centralised planning and decentralised execution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-strategic-autonomy-expansion-needs-foreign-policy-reorientationexperts-101632892579219.html

29-09-2021||India||Surgical strike day: Here's how the 2016 operation was carried out||In September 2016, the Indian Army launched surgical strikes against terrorist camps in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. The strike on September 28, 2016, was in response to an attack by Pakistan-based terrorists on an army base in Kashmir’s Uri on September 18 in which 19 soldiers were killed.Since then, the government has been observing September 29 as "Surgical Strike Day".In an interview to news agency ANI, Prime Minister Narendra Modi revealed the details of the military action saying that the date of the attack was changed twice, keeping in mind the safety and security of the troops.The Prime Minister said the surgical strikes were planned as there was a “rage” building up within him as well as the Army after soldiers were killed in the terror attack in Uri.PM Modi also said that he ordered the troops to not think about the success or failure and be back "before sunrise".How the surgical strike was carried outIn September 2016, terrorists of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed entered the Army camp in Uri near the Line of Control and killed 20 soldiers in the attack.In retaliation, the Indian Army troops including the commandos from various units of the Para (Special Forces) units deployed in Jammu and Kashmir carried out raids across the border on multiple targets.All these targets were launch pads for terrorists for infiltrating into Jammu and Kashmir for carrying out attacks against military and civilian targets.PM Modi said that while talking to the Army, he realised that they wanted justice for their martyred soldiers and the government gave them the “free hand” to plan and execute the surgical strikes.The surgical strike was hailed by the people of the country as well as the armed forces, with defence minister Rajnath Singh saying that it gave a clear message to the world that "we can kill terrorists on this side as well as by crossing the border if the need arises".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surgical-strike-day-here-s-how-the-2016-operation-was-carried-out-101632882272993.html

Referring to Kumar's decision to leave the Communist Party of India (CPI) and join the Congress instead, Vijayvargiya said, “If someone comes out of the gutter and falls into the drain, then I can only sympathise with him.” Notably, ex-CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar joined the Congress on Tuesday in the presence of party leader Rahul Gandhi in Delhi. Addressing the media at Congress headquarters soon after the induction of the youth leader, the party's general secretary KC Venugopal had said, “Kanhaiya Kumar is a symbol of the fight for freedom of expression in this country. He fought against fundamentalism as a student leader. The joining of kind of dynamic personality will fill the entire cadre of Congress with enthusiasm.”Also Read | Will Kanhaiya Kumar’s entry to Congress herald new start for party in Bihar?Later on Tuesday, Vijayvargiya's remarks followed BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya's assertions that Congress is joining ranks with forces that intend to ‘break’ the political unity in India. Ahead of Kanhaiya's joining, Malviya had tweeted, "On the anniversary of the surgical strike, Congress to admit Kanhaiya Kumar and Jignesh Mewani of “Bharat tere tukde honge” fame. This can’t be a mere coincidence. Joining hands with “Breaking India” forces is now Congress’s raison d’être.”Vijayvargiya, who was speaking to reporters in Indore, was also quizzed on the recent political developments in West Bengal, including the upcoming by-poll for the Bhabanipur constituency. “It is not possible to have fair elections there, not even one per cent,” Vijayvargiya was quoted as saying by the ANI news agency. “… so what Dilip Ghosh [the former BJP Bengal chief] has said is right, the polling booths will be captured, voters will not be allowed to come out. Hence elections get captured in West Bengal.”Ghosh, who is currently the BJP national vice-president, had said on Monday that there is no point in holding elections if the state administration under the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-led government cannot conduct an ‘unbiased’ election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/out-of-gutter-into-the-drain-bjp-s-kailash-vijayvargiya-on-kanhaiya-kumar-joining-congress-101632878713891.html

The tally of active Covid cases further reduced to 36,794 as 3,029 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours. The current number of active cases have gone below the 37,516 cases reported on February 3 and are the lowest in the last 7 months. The state also saw 60 Covid-related casualties taking the total to 138,962. Ahmednagar reported the highest toll with 12 deaths. The continuing drop in active infections has helped the state government’s decision to lift all curbs from next month. It is reopening in-person classes in schools from October 4, all religious places from October 7 and cinema halls, theatres and multiplexes from October 22. On April 22, Maharashtra reported highest number of active cases 699,858. With 9,243, Pune is at the top among five districts that account for more than 75.29% of the total active cases recorded on September 27. Thane has 5,888 active cases, Ahmednagar 5,506, Mumbai 5,053 and Satara has 2,201.

29-09-2021||India||Exclusive: Opposition faces credibility crisis, BJP will get 325-350 seats, says Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has expressed confidence that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will win the next year's assembly polls in the state easily. In fact, the chief minister said that the party will surpass its 2017 seat tally of 312 and win between 325 and 350 seats.In an interview with Hindustan Times, Adityanath, 49, rattled off his government's record in terms of governance, economic development, and law-and-order to buttress his claim.Read the full interviewAdityanath is confident that he will overcome any anti-incumbency by focusing on his government’s record of governance and getting the caste equation right."I am totally confident about coming back. I understand the political dynamics of UP very well, as I have been in active state politics for the past 23 years. I am confident about the political understanding and maturity of UP electorate," he said.On September 26, he expanded his cabinet, making room for seven more ministers in a move that he then described as achieving “social balance” and giving “representation to all sections of society”. Adityanath is also clear that the ongoing farmers agitation led by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait will have no electoral impact in western UP, an area that has been the BJP’s bastion in the past.“It is quite clear that our rivals are funding the farmers’ agitation, which has an impact in only states where middlemen, or araathiyas, operate. In UP, the farmer is directly in touch with the government for procurement and compensation. Since the opposition has no other issue to flag, they are trying to fan this so-called farmer agitation.”Still, analysts say that the BJP could suffer some damage in this area which is dominated by the Jat community, a dominant agrarian grouping that has been protesting against the three farm reform laws passed by the Union government last year.The CM, who is the head of the Gorakhnath temple at Gorakhpur, also spoke of strides made in infrastructure (especially expressways and airports) and law-and-order.Answering a question on the ability of a head priest to run a state as large as Uttar Pradesh, Adityanath said: “How can you cage or limit a bhagwa (saffron) wearing yogi to only religion? How I worship is my right. But for my country, for my society, what I have to do and how I have to do, is my prime responsibility. I have been working on this before I became the CM; only now my area of work has got enlarged. But I have never made an attempt to project myself as I believe in teamwork. I am working in the direction of rapidly developing my state and my country.”While the BJP’s election campaign in the state is up and running, the opposition, which is fragmented, has been slow to get theirs going.The opposition has a crisis of credibility, said Adityanath, but given the complexity of the state and the ever-changing caste equations, he is taking no chances - something evident in the recent cabinet expansion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-faces-credibility-crisis-bjp-will-get-325-350-seats-adityanath-101632880783227.html
29-09-2021||India||Arvind Kejriwal's Punjab visit begins today; 'big announcements' expected||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal will begin his two-day visit to Punjab from Ludhiana on Wednesday. The party said on Tuesday that Kejriwal will make "big" announcements" during the visit, which comes just few months ahead of the assembly elections in the states.Kejriwal will hold a meeting with traders in Ludhiana on the first day of his visit, according to AAP. He will hold a press conference on September 30, where AAP national convener will make big announcements, the party said on Twitter on Tuesday.Assembly elections in Punjab are due early next year.Kejriwal's visit comes at a time of turmoil within the ruling Congress party in Punjab. Political observers say the party is sniffing an opportunity as Congress tries to douse the fire within the state unit and present a united face for the state polls.Reacting to Navjot Sidhu's resignation as chief of the state unit, AAP's Punjab president Bhagwant Mann accused the Congress of “insulting” the state and its people in their “fight for the chair”.AAP too has faced internal conflicts for the last two years in its Punjab unit, but is now expecting to see some discontented leaders jump the ship to join its ranks. The party's leaders and their campaign speeches have been highlighting the shortcomings in the rule of both Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and are asking the people of the state to give them a chance.Some AAP leaders, like Kotkapura MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan, says that the party has been receiving good response from the people in Punjab who have visited the farmers' protest sites at Delhi border and seen the work done by AAP government there.AAP won 20 seats to become the principal opposition party in Punjab in 2017, but is now banking on its 'Delhi model' of governance and promise of freebies to emerge on top. Like other states, AAP aims to make high electricity rates in Punjab as one of the focus areas of its Punjab campaign.Kejriwal has already made a populist pitch by "guaranteeing" 300 units of free power for residential consumers, waiver of pending bills and round-the-clock supply if his party comes to power in the state.A "second guarantee" is expected to be made by Kejriwal during his latest visit to the state; however, the poll promise has been not been disclosed as yet.AAP also faces a big question about a chief ministerial face. Pressure is building on the leadership from within the party, including several MLAs and workers, to declare state chief Bhagwant Mann’s name. Kejriwal had, on June 21, announced in Amritsar that the CM candidate will be from the Sikh community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-s-punjab-visit-begins-today-big-announcements-expected-101632878643299.html
29-09-2021||India||Congress reaches out to Sidhu, hectic parleys on | 10 developments||The top Congress leadership has not accepted Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation, and asked the local party leadership to resolve the matter. Sidhu's resignation as state party chief on Tuesday has intensified the crisis in the Punjab Congress, and triggered discussions and deliberations in the party.He had been holding discussions over political developments in Punjab for the last two days with his principal adviser Mohammad Mustafa. Though his resignation came as a surprise, Sidhu took the decision late on Monday after a marathon meeting with Mustafa, a former director general of police (DGP)-rank officer.Sidhu was appointed as the President of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) on July 23.Here are the latest developments in Punjab after Sidhu's resignation:• Congress general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal termed Sidhu's resignation letter as an "emotional reaction".

They are being discussed in the party forum. Party high command will resolve them," Henry told reporters on Tuesday.• Punjab ministers Pargat Singh and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring met Sidhu at his residence in Patiala yesterday. "There are some minor issues that arose out of some misunderstandings and will be resolved tomorrow (Wednesday)," Warring told reporters while leaving Sidhu's residence.• A series of resignations poured in after Sidhu put in his papers. A minister and three Congress leaders, considered close to Sidhu, stepped down from their posts. Among those were Malerkotla MLA Razia Sultana, the wife of Mohammad Mustafa.• This came as a blow to the Congress leadership, which thought the crisis in Punjab - triggered by the feud between Sidhu and former chief minister Amarinder Singh - was over when Sidhu was appointed the chief of the party's Punjab unit apparently against the latter's wishes.• Congress leader Sunil Jakhar hit out at Navjot Singh Sidhu over his resignation as Punjab unit chief and said "what stands compromised was the faith reposed in him by the Congress leadership". The remarks were in response to the comments made by Sidhu in his resignation letter sent to Sonia Gandhi in which he said he can "never compromise" on Punjab's future. Sidhu had replaced Jhakhar as PCC chief.• After Sidhu's resignation, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said the he is a "misguided missile" that does not know its destination. "He is an egoistic man," Badal said.• Bharatiya Janata Party leader Tarun Chugh on Tuesday targeted Navjot Singh Sidhu over his resignation as Punjab Congress chief and alleged that he is unable to bear that a person from Scheduled Caste community has become the chief minister of Punjab. Chugh alleged that Sidhu is "hungry" for the post of chief minister.• The chief of Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) Punjab unit Bhagwant Mann accused the Congress of “insulting” the state and its people in their “fight for the chair”.• Sidhu's resignation came just before former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh's visit to Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-reaches-out-to-navjot-singh-sidhu-hectic-parleys-on-10-developments-101632875673600.html

29-09-2021||India||Luizinho Faleiro heads to Kolkata to join TMC; Cong finds his replacement in Goa||PANAJI: Former Goa chief minister and former state Congress president Luizinho Faleiro on Tuesday left for Kolkata a day after he resigned as a primary member of the Congress party and as a member of the Goa Legislative assembly. Faleiro is expected to join the Trinamool Congress on Wednesday.While Faleiro announced his resignation on Monday, he was tight-lipped on his future plans only saying he would “definitely support Mamata Congress.” “Definitely, I will support Mamata Congress because she has fought, she has succeeded... She symbolises women empowerment which can bring this country back on the rails of development and progress,” Faleiro said, declining to elaborate on his next steps.On Tuesday, Faleiro left for Kolkata along with some of his loyalists who also resigned from the Congress along with Faleiro. Among those who accompanied him on his Kolkata visit are former Goa Congress general secretaries Yatish Naik, Vijai Pai, secretary Mariano Pinto, former MGP MLA Lavoo Mamledar, civil rights activists Shivdas Naik and Rajendra Kakodkar and Antonio Clovis da Costa, the president of the South Goa Advocates Association and others.His induction into the Trinamool Congress is expected to happen on Wednesday in the presence of Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee in what his supporters here are describing as a ‘grand induction’ ceremony. The Congress, which was initially taken aback at Faleiro’s move, has started holding meetings with known Faleiro loyalists. Goa in charge Dinesh Gundu Rao called on former Panaji mayor Surendra Furtado and former MLA Agnelo Fernandes, who have been asked to meet the Congress leadership in Delhi to prevent more desertions.The Congress also inducted former MLA Avertano Furtado into the Congress. Furtado, who was elected as an independent MLA with the BJP’s support in 2012, said he was “always a Congressman” from the days when his father began working with Faleiro a few decades earlier, but was forced to part ways with the Congress because his pathway was blocked. Now that the path has reopened, the former lawmaker said, he was back.According to people familiar with the matter, Faleiro is learnt to have been upset with the Congress leadership for ignoring his protests over letting Girish Chodankar continue as state party president. Faleiro expects to lead the state unit of the Trinamool Congress in the upcoming state elections, a leader close to him said.The ruling BJP, which is likely to benefit due to this high-profile switch, has welcomed what it described the start of ‘political tourism in Goa.’ “We are promoting medical tourism, spiritual tourism, we are promoting hinterland tourism and (now) political tourism. I feel it has started in Goa. Elections are close. I welcome all kinds of tourism, so that all my Goan brothers and sisters have access to a new business in Goa. Tourist business should increase in Goa,” Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said on the sidelines of a function held on Monday. Avertano Furtado, the Congress’ replacement for Faleiro, lost to Faleiro in the 2017 assembly elections.The Congress has brushed aside the damage that Luizinho Faleiro’s departure will have on the party, saying that Faleiro opted for a ‘retirement package’ given what it described as his waning political clout back home. The Congress said his departure will be a “blessing in disguise” for the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/luizinho-faleiro-heads-to-kolkata-to-join-tmc-cong-finds-his-replacement-in-goa-101632860822245.html
29-09-2021||India||Supreme Court sets deadline for quota for differently abled in promotions||The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Union government four months to issue the necessary instructions to give reservation benefits in promotion to persons with disabilities, telling the Centre that there was no ambiguity in its January 2020 verdict and the Centre should start implementing the provision under the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016.The Supreme Court, on January 14, 2020, ruled that the reservation for persons with disabilities was applicable to promotions as well, and not just recruitment. The provision, however, was not implemented by the Centre, which filed an application in September 2020 to seek certain clarifications on how to go about implementing the reservation.“There is no ambiguity in the (Siddaraju v State of Karnataka) judgment of this court…. We direct the Union of India to issue instructions as per the 2016 Act at the earliest and not later than four months from today,” a bench of justices L Nageswara Rao, Sanjeev Khanna and BR Gavai said on Tuesday.The apex court said the instructions have to be issued under Section 34 of the 2016 Act, which prescribes not less than four per cent reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Madhavi Divan, appearing for the Centre, earlier sought clarifications on issues such as how to compute vacancies in identified and non-identified posts, whether reservations would have to be extended at the time of induction from state civil services (SCS) or non-SCS to Indian Administrative Service as this was considered as promotion, and the extent of reservation within the Group A posts.The Centre also asked whether the implementation of the judgment must follow the 2016 Act or the Act that existed prior to it, namely Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-sets-deadline-for-quota-for-differently-abled-in-promotions-101632857420814.html
29-09-2021||India||Second building collapses in Bengaluru in two days||A day after a building collapsed in south Bengaluru’s Lakkasandra, another three-storied building collapsed in the same locality on Tuesday. Though no injuries were reported, however, according to eye witness accounts some occupants of the building escaped in the nick of time. Three people sustained minor injuries in the incident.According to the department of fire and emergency services, the building was located on the premises of the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) at dairy circle and it was occupied by the staffers of Bangalore Milk Union Limited (Bamul). Residents noticed cracks in the building on Tuesday morning and the department was alerted. Even before the arrival of the department, occupants of the building, around 18 families, started evacuating the place. Properties worth several lakh including jewellery, furniture, and appliances in the apartments have been damaged, according to officials of the fire and department services. “There were wide cracks had developed in the building and people have started noticing it last evening itself, we have been able to rescue two dogs from the building as well. Three people sustained minor injuries,” said a senior official. MD Satish, managing director of KMF said the building was examined and assessed by the KMF civil engineers and structural experts in 2016. “They had certified that the building is fit for occupation for another 10-years and hence the staff was allowed to stay in the building. However, we will extend all possible support to the families in shifting to a better place,” he said.According to BBMP officials, the building is 60-years-old. BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta on Tuesday said that a survey of the old buildings in the city will be conducted. “We have conducted a similar survey two years and instructions were given to evacuate those buildings that were old. In view of the new developments, we will conduct fresh surveys. We have asked this survey to be finished within 30 days,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-building-collapses-in-bengaluru-in-two-days-101632856986471.html
29-09-2021||India||Seriously considering law against forced religious conversions: Karnataka CM Bommai||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday said that it was seriously considering a law to ban forced religious conversions in the state. “Such things (conversions) are happening here and there. A couple of days ago, I gave appropriate directions to district administrations not to allow any religious conversion through inducement or by force, as it is illegal,” Bommai said on Tuesday. The statement comes days after the issue was raised in the monsoon session of the state legislature held between September 13 to 24. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)ruled states like Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have already put in place laws to prevent forcible conversion. In the monsoon session, the matter was raised by Goolihatti D Shekar, the BJP legislator from Hosadurga, during the Zero hour on September 20. The legislator said that there has been heightened activity around conversions and that his own mother has been converted after she was “brainwashed”. “In Chitradurga (district) and my constituency (Hosadurga) around 15,000-20,000 people have already been converted,” he said. “Dalits, backward classes and even Muslims are being converted,” he had said. Several other legislators rose to support the proposal, which they said was disturbing the peace of the society. Araga Jnanendra, Karnataka’s home minister said that the government is aware of these developments and deliberating on if it should introduce a law or other measures at the earliest. He also sought details of any such organisations who were slapping false charges which would be investigated and action would be taken against such people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seriously-considering-law-against-forced-religious-conversions-karnataka-cmbommai-101632856984657.html
29-09-2021||India||Appoint Hindu priest in Datta Peeta shrine: Karnataka high court directs govt||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lauded the Karnataka high court order on Tuesday wherein it directed the state government to appoint a Hindu priest at Datta Peeta, a cave shrine in Chikmagalur’s Baba Budangiri mountains. BJPs national general secretary and legislator from Chikmagalur, CT Ravi took to Twitter to express his happiness over the verdict and chide the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government for the injustice it had meted during its rule in the state. “Huge victory for Hindus. Karnataka high court orders the government to appoint hindu priests in Datta Peeta. I welcome the decision of the high court in rejecting the biased report of Justice Nagmohan Das committee,” the BJP leader said in a post on Twitter. Ravi said that it was Siddaramaiah who had weaved a web of lies to instate a Muslim maulvi as the priest of the shrine that dates back several centuries with conflicting accounts of its history. The court quashed the state government order dated March 19, 2018, in which it permitted only a Mujawar (Muslim priest) appointed by Shah Khadri to enter the sanctum of the “Sri Guru Dattathreya Swamy Peeta” otherwise known as “Sree Gurudattathreya Bababudnaswamy Dargha” cave and to distribute ‘teertha’ or holy water to both Hindus and Muslims.The shrine is on the Chandra Drona Range, some of the highest ranges between the Himalayas and the Nilgiris, and history has it that it was a sufi Saint Baba Budan who first brought coffee seeds from Yemen that were introduced in these mountain ranges for the first time. The controversy is around the Peetha which, according to court documents, was a major Muzarai temple under the Mysore Religious and Charitable Institutions Act, 1927, but was taken over by the state Wakf board on April 6, 1973, just before Emergency was declared in the country. This was contested in 1978. The shrine is known as “Sri Guru Dattathreya Swamy Peeta” and “Sree Gurudattathreya Bababudnaswamy Dargha”, depending on who you ask, that has been a bone of contention between the right wing and the Congress, who both accuse each other of twisting history to appease their respective vote banks. The HC order also stated that as per the annual report of the Mysuru Archeological Department, 1932, Shri Guru Dattatreya Swami Peetha is a small cave in Baba Budangiri, which is sacred to both Hindus and Mohammadans. The order stated that the Endowment commissioner’s report had rightly recorded that Shri Dattatreya is well known as son of Sage Athri by his virtuous wife Anasuya and embodiment of Hindu trinity, the gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The commissioner had recorded that 1,861 acres of land was granted to Shri Dattatreya Devaru and 111.25 acres to Shri Baba Budan Dharga separately by the then Maharaja of Mysore. The Endowment commissioners report was submitted on March 10, 2010, before the Supreme Court, suggesting that a Hindu archak or priest be appointed by the management committee of the shrine. The issue had gained traction in the run up to the 2018 assembly elections in Karnataka with the BJP accusing Siddaramaiah of pandering to the minorities vote bank. The Karnataka HC said that the order by the state government was unsustainable in law because it was contrary to the Supreme Court’s order that the state cabinet would take a decision in this regard considering the pros and cons of the matter but instead delegated it to a high level committee. The HC also listed five other reasons which included that the high level committee was not free from bias. In its sixth reason, the HC said that the 2018 order “infringes the right of both communities guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution by preventing Hindus from performing puja as per their faith and compelling the Mujawar to offer puja contrary to his faith.”“We have already issued orders to form a committee, take its recommendations and appoint a Hindu archak,” V Sunil Kumar, Karnataka’s minister for power, Kannada and Culture said. At least two senior Congress leaders could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/appoint-hindu-priest-in-datta-peeta-shrine-karnataka-high-court-directs-govt-101632856921384.html
29-09-2021||India||Bypolls to two assembly seats in Karnataka on October 30: ECI||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced that the bypolls in Karnataka’s two assembly constituencies, Hanagal and Sindgi, will be held on October 30. The two assembly constituencies fell vacant after CM Udasi, the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader died on June 8 while MC Managuli, another senior Janata Dal (Secular) leader died earlier in January. Informing that the BJP core committee has discussed the matter, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday said, “We are getting a report from the ground and will start the candidate selection process.” The bypolls come at a time when all three major political parties in Karnataka have seen problems and challenges emerging from within their respective outfits. The BJP is trying hard to contain growing dissent from within the party from those who have missed out on Cabinet berths and the former chief minister, BS Yediyurappa, who wants to tour the state ahead of the yet-to-be announced zilla and taluk panchayat elections as well before the 2023 assembly elections. The Congress continues its infighting as its two top leaders--Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar—continues to maintain distance on who the chief minister would be if the party does win the 2023 assembly elections. A large faction within the Congress are trying to back Siddaramaiah for the top post again while Shivakumar has made no secret of his aspirations of becoming the chief minister. The JD(S) has seen rebellion within its ranks with at least three legislators openly have spoken out against the top leadership of former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy-led outfit. “Our AICC (All India Congress Committee) has already announced a candidate for one seat and we have to discuss potential candidates and then send a proposal (to high command),” Shivakumar said in Delhi on Tuesday. Shivakumar on Tuesday said that the party had already decided the candidate for one seat and there will be discussions held internally on the second constituency. Ashok Managuli, the son of MC Managuli, had joined the Congress earlier this year and is expected to contest from Sindgi.“Already for Hanagal we have announced a candidate (Nayaz). We have already started working for 2023 assembly elections and this (bypolls) are like a preparatory exams,”HD Kumaraswamy said. The party is currently holding a workshop to strategize for the assembly elections. The JD(S) does not have a very large presence in northern Karnataka. The BJP, however, remains tight lipped on whether Yediyurappa’s son, BY Vijayendra, will contest from Hanagal, considered a safe seat for the party. B Sriramulu, Karnataka’s minister for transport and scheduled tribe welfare on Tuesday said that the party will take a call and that he was not aware of the state BJP’s decision. The Congress and BJP had lost one seat each in the April 17 assembly bypolls as the former took Maski and the latter won in Basavakalyan. The Congress did give a tough fight in the Lok Sabha bypolls in Belagavi where the wife, Mangala Angadi, of late union minister Suresh Angadi managed to win by a slender margin against Satish Jarkiholi of the Congress. The BJP had recently won in Belagavi and Hubbali-Dharwad urban local body polls and is trying to pip the Congress in Kalaburagi where a hung verdict has put the JD(S) in a position to bargain for the best offer. The BJP is eyeing to further strengthen its numbers in the assembly with the victories in the upcoming bypolls and continue its momentum towards the assembly elections in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bypolls-to-two-assembly-seats-in-karnataka-on-october-30-eci-101632856861937.html
29-09-2021||India||Bengaluru: Five held in fresh case of moral policing, later granted bail||Five members of a Hindu right-wing organisation were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly heckling and harassing a group of medical students at Suratkal in Dakshina Kannada district on Sunday, Mangaluru police said, adding they were later released on bail. According to the police, the incident took place on Sunday evening when six MBBS students from KS Hegde Medical College were driving back from Malpe beach, located around 60 km from Mangaluru city. As they were returning, some members of a Hindu right-wing organisation waylaid their vehicle, hurled abuses, and even tried to assault them, police said, adding that a purported video of the incident went viral on social media. In the 1-min video, they could be purportedly heard asking the woman students why they were travelling with Muslim men. Among the group of students were three male students, including two Christians and one Muslim, and three Muslim female students. One of the students was injured after someone tried to drag him out of the vehicle, said police. HT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video. Mangaluru city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar identified the accused as Preetham Shetty, Arshith, Srinivas, Rakesh, and Abhishek. All of them are members of the Bajrang Dal, Kumar added. They were booked under sections 341(Punishment for wrongful restraint), 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the Indian Penal Code. They were later released on bail from the police station, an official said. In their statement to the police, the suspects said they stopped the car as they got information that the group of boys “misbehaved” with girls. “When we investigated the matter, no such thing was found. All belonged to the same class and studied in the second year in their professional courses,” said Kumar. Police said they suspect the students were followed by the group, who saw them go to the beach earlier. After following them for a distance, the fringe elements attacked them, police said. Traffic inspector, Sharif, who reached the spot first, intervened and stopped the attackers from harming the students, said police. In a similar incident on September 17, two youngsters stopped a Muslim biker, who was dropping his female colleague from another religion. The duo assaulted the biker while abusing the woman near Dairy Circle on Hosur Road in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengalurufive-held-in-fresh-case-of-moral-policing-later-granted-bail-101632856802725.html
29-09-2021||India||India likely to update climate NDC ahead of COP26||New Delhi: India may update its voluntary emissions-control commitments ahead of or at the United Nations climate summit to be held in Glasgow in November. “There are talks of announcing a slightly updated target taking into account our commitments on renewable energy,” said an official at the environment ministry . “This may happen at COP26.” A joint statement issued last week by Quad countries — Australia, India, Japan, and the United States — stated that all member states intend to update or communicate ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement before the climate meet, also known as the 26th Conference of Parties, or COP26. It could mean India will announce an updated NDC ahead of or at COP 26. “The statement states what quad countries intend to do,” another environment ministry official said. “We cannot confirm or deny it because the decision on NDC is taken at the highest level because it involves many sectors.” Both officials declined to be named. India will install 450 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reiterated on September 25 at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly . “India has established a better balance in both economy and ecology. You will definitely be proud to see India’s efforts on climate action as compared to big and developed countries,” Modi had said. “Today, India is moving very fast towards the target of 450 GW of renewable energy. We are also in the campaign to make India the world’s largest Green Hydrogen Hub.” Quad countries last week said they will pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels, the ambitious target agreed upon in the 2015 Paris climate pact. To this end, Quad countries intend to update or communicate ambitious NDCs by COP26 and welcome those who have already done so. Quad countries will also coordinate their diplomacy to raise global ambition, including reaching out to key stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific region,” the Quad statement had said. “Our work is organized across three thematic areas: climate ambition, clean-energy innovation and deployment, and climate adaptation, resilience and preparedness, with the intent to pursue enhanced actions during the 2020s, contributing to the aim of achieving global net-zero emissions preferably by 2050, and taking into account national circumstances.”Quad countries are focusing on nationally appropriate decarbonisation efforts, which includes decarbonising shipping and port operations and deploying clean-hydrogen technology. It will work for successful outcomes at the COP26 and G20 (meeting of G20 group of nations on October 30 and 31) that uphold the level of climate ambition and innovation, the statement added. India’s present NDC submitted in 2015 consists of three main elements — an economy-wide emissions intensity target of 33% to 35% below 2005 levels, electric power capacity target of 40% installed capacity from non-fossil-based energy resources by 2030 (conditional to international support), and creating a carbon sink expansion target of creating an additional (cumulative) carbon sink of 2.5–3 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. India’s non-fossil fuel installed power capacity at 153.88 GW is already 39.64% of the total installed capacity, which indicates the country is likely to exceed one of the elements of its NDCs, the environment ministry had said in a statement earlier in September. India has already achieved a drop of 24% in the emissions intensity of its GDP compared to 2005 levels. Experts, however, clarified that the Quad statement doesn’t imply that all four countries will announce net zero emissions by 2050. Net zero is a global goal that has to be achieved collaboratively, factoring in national and economic circumstances of each country, they said. For India, a net zero emissions target could be deeply flawed, warned Chandrashekhar Dasgupta, former ambassador to the European Union and China, and a climate negotiator. “The Quad joint communique refers to the global goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and pledges that the four partners will ‘contribute’ to this aim. In the case of India, this should not be seen as commitment to a national 2050 net- zero goal,” Dasgupta said. “Each country should contribute to the global goal in accordance with the principles of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ and its national circumstances, as required by the UN climate change convention and the Paris Agreement.” “India’s current and historical per capita emissions are very low and these will increase for the next few decades as we pursue our sustainable development goals. A national 2050 ‘net-zero’ commitment would undermine these goals, especially poverty eradication and human resource development,” Dasgupta said. “Given our national circumstances, a national net-zero target for 2050 would be a deeply flawed response to the climate change challenge, in addition to negating the aim of poverty eradication.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-update-climate-ndc-ahead-of-cop26-101632856440281.html
29-09-2021||India||Total state of anarchy in Punjab Congress: AAP||Taking note of the latest political turmoil in Punjab Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday slammed the ruling party for “complete and absolute anarchy” in its state unit.Stating that “selfish leaders” are incompetent in running “stable, progressive, inclusive” administration, AAP Punjab co-in-charge Raghav Chadha tweeted: “Complete and absolute state of anarchy in Punjab Congress. How can the people of Punjab expect these selfish leaders to give a stable, progressive and inclusive administration? How can these people be trusted with a state which has 550 km border with Pakistan?”The political crisis within the ruling party deepened after Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned from his post just months ahead of the elections. He had taken over as the state party chief in July amid a bitter leadership tussle with Amarinder Singh, who stepped down as chief minister 10 days ago while accusing the party’s high command of humiliating him.Hours later, Malerkotla MLA Razia Sultana also resigned “in solidarity with Navjot Singh Sidhu”.The AAP is the main opposition party in the state.In a video message to voters, Chadha claimed that the Congress in Punjab had made governance a matter of joke.Seeking support for AAP in the state elections next year, Chadha said: “Only the AAP can ensure you a beautiful future and a stable government in Punjab. Only the AAP can save Punjab.”Besides AAP, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attacked Sidhu over his resignation.“I had already said that Navjot Singh Sidhu is a misguided missile; no one knows who he would hit... I suggest to him that in case he wants any good for Punjab, he should leave the state and go to Mumbai,” SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said. BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh said: “Punjab is paying a heavy price for the chaos that has gripped the Punjab Congress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/total-state-of-anarchy-in-punjab-congress-selfish-leaders-cannot-run-stable-govt-aap-101632856380462.html

29-09-2021||India||Bill against organised crime ready: Tamil Nadu govt tells Madras high court||A Bill to effectively control organised crimes in Tamil Nadu has been drafted and the same will be placed before the state assembly when it meets next, the Madras high court was informed recently.On the orders of the court in August 2020, a committee was formed and according to its recommendation, a Draft Bill of the Tamil Nadu Control of Organised Crime Act has been prepared and would be placed before the House during the next session, the government counsel told a division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran (since retired) and P Velmurugan.While hearing a habeas corpus petition from E Velu (29), a gangster accused of murdering another in 2018, challenging his detention under the Goondas Act earlier, a division bench headed by Justice Kirubakaran had raised a set of 25 queries including the necessity to come out with a new Act, like the “Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, 1999” (MCOCA) or similar ones passed by Karnataka and Gujarat which would enable the police to be more powerful and deal with the criminals effectively.When the matter came up recently, the government counsel informed the bench about this.The bench expressed happiness and appreciated the State government for having made ready the draft bill to be presented before the Assembly. “If such an Act is passed, the police will be able to deal with the criminals effectively,” the bench said and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-against-organised-crime-ready-tamil-nadu-govt-tells-madras-high-court-101632856083646.html
29-09-2021||India||Kerala high court rejects plea against K’taka govt’s move to limit inter-state travel||The Kerala high court on Tuesday dismissed two pleas challenging Karnataka government’s decision to restrict entry from here at borders of Kasaragod and Mangaluru only to those having a negative RT-PCR report, saying the neighbouring state was well within its powers to issue such directions.The high court said it was an admitted fact there was no blockade of the roads from Kerala to Karnataka and the restrictions, like a negative RT-PCR certificate, were imposed within that state in view of the unprecedented surge of Covid-19 pandemic prevalent in Kerala.“Therefore, going by the guidelines issued by the central government, it is clear that under any such circumstances, the states are given the power and responsibility to impose reasonable restrictions, so as to combat the disease.“Therefore, state of Karnataka was well within its powers to issue circulars, orders or guidelines under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, in consonance with various guidelines issued by the central government,” a bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly said and dismissed the two PILs, one by A K M Ashraf, the IUML MLA from Manjeshwar and the other by Jayananda K R, the Secretary of Rastrakavi Manjeshwara Govinda Pai Smaraka Samithi.The bench further said that the Karnataka government has the necessary leverage to issue circulars, taking into account the situations prevailing in the neighbouring states of Kerala and Maharashtra.“Viewed from that angle, it can never be said that a part of cause of action for the writ petitions has arisen within the state of Kerala. This is more so when there is no absolute prohibition for the citizens of Kerala to travel to Karnataka by any means, but we can only view it as restrictions imposed by the state of Karnataka.“Whether the restrictions imposed within the State of Karnataka are reasonable or not, is a matter to be considered and decided by the jurisdictional High Court,” the bench said in its 100-page judgement.It further said that a “wholesome appreciation of the facts and circumstances” would show that no part of the cause of action, as regards the circulars issued by Karnataka government or its officials, would arise in Kerala.“Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that the petitioners have failed to establish territorial jurisdiction of this court in interfering with the circulars issued by the state of Karnataka dated July 31 and accordingly, we decline the reliefs sought for by the petitioners in the background of the circulars so issued. In the result, the writ petitions are dismissed for want of territorial jurisdiction,” the bench said. The petitioners had contended that the travel restrictions had resulted in people from Kerala being unable to enter Karnataka for any emergent situations and therefore, it was totally illegal and violative of the fundamental rights of citizens.The blockade was also causing disruption in trade, supply of food and other essential items and interfering with the rights of the citizens to move freely throughout the territory of India, the two PILs -- one of them filed by advocate P V Anoop -- had claimed.The pleas had also claimed that people of Manjeshwar rely entirely upon the medical facilities at Dakshin Kannada district/Mangalore city and its adjacent areas, since it is the nearest medical hub available.The Karnataka government had opposed the two pleas on the ground that the entire cause of action arises within that state, and the petitioners should challenge the circulars before the High Court of Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-rejects-plea-against-k-taka-govt-s-move-to-limit-inter-state-travel-101632856080325.html
29-09-2021||India||Draw up laws on illegal immigrants: Madras high court to govt||The Madras high court has directed the Union home ministry to consider framing necessary laws in three months to prevent illegal immigrants from committing petty crimes to stay back in India. The order was passed on Monday while disposing of a batch of bail petitions filed by nationals of Sri Lanka, Nigeria, China, Iran and Bangladesh booked for various criminal cases. The court noted that in addition to their illegal status, some of them had obtained Aadhar cards using fake documents. Around 13,289 foreigners have overstayed their visa period in Tamil Nadu’s districts of Chennai, Trichy, Coimbatore and Madurai. Justice M Dhandapani said that their bail plea was not accepted as it would be detrimental to the safety and security of the country. He added that “due to the lacunae on the part of the Governmental machinery and the Law Enforcing Agency”, certain petitioners, who are illegal immigrants, have been in India for decades without being deported back to their country of birth. “...and in course of time, the Indian sub-continent would be grazing grounds for the predators of illegal migrants with a devious mind to take over the country, which would lead to a pre-independence scenario,” the justice said in his orders. The court said that it has come to its attention that the illegal migrants, “to circumvent the deportation procedures” and to continue living in the Indian territory “resort to certain subterfuge, like, committing petty crimes and serving simple sentences and come out and do the same once over.” However, no mechanism or law is available as of yet to identify such individuals and to curb such acts.Given this scenario, the court pointed out that there was a lack of coordination between Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) and International Check Post (ICP) and the state law enforcing agency, and stated that it is the state set up which is the fulcrum in the setup to identify the illegal immigrants and foreign nationals without valid permission staying in the country. The court insisted that the existing guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs should be followed. The court then went on to issue more directions. It includes the state law agency to send illegal migrants to detention camps as per the union home ministry’s guidelines. The state to take steps to identify the foreign nationals, who are in various prisons and take appropriate steps to have the person deported to his/her country of birth immediately on completion of the sentence. Authorities of the FRRO and ICP have been directed to share the data of the foreign nationals with the state who, in turn, will have to coordinate with hotels, houses under their jurisdiction to monitor their departure from their place of stay. After directing the Union ministry of home affairs to frame laws within three months to deport such illegal immigrants after their sentence is completed, the court posted the matter to January 4, 2022, for agencies of the state and union to file a compliance report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draw-up-laws-on-illegal-immigrants-madras-high-court-to-govt-101632856020192.html
29-09-2021||India||New complaints against Mavunkal filed, Kerala police role comes under lens||The Kerala police on Tuesday registered fresh complaints against self-proclaimed antique collector and YouTuber Monson Mavunkal, who was arrested on Sunday on charges of fraud, among others. Unverified reports of police’s alleged involvement with Mavunkal also surfaced on social media Tuesday. He is currently in police custody for three days on an Ernakulam court order. A day after alleged videos and photos linking him to Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K Sudhakaran and deputy inspector general of police S Surendran ‘leaked’ on social media, two more businessmen have filed complaints against him. A rape survivor also alleged that Mavunkal had threatened to release her “inappropriate pictures and video” if she failed to withdraw the case against his close aide. Police expect more complaints against him in the coming days. “When I filed the rape case in Ernakulam, the police started investigation in right earnest. But Mavunkal used his clout to transfer officers probing the case. Later, he started threatening me to withdraw the case against his friend and told me that he would implicate me in honey-trap cases,” she said, adding that Mavunkal told her that he has thousands of social media followers, and once he releases her photos, it will be difficult for her to step out of her house. She said despite stating her case before a magistrate under Section 164 (recording of confidential or confessional statement) last year, it was hushed up. Two more businessmen have filed cheating cases, one in Ernakulam and another in Kozhikode, against Mavunkal. Police are yet to release details of these two complaints. One of the earlier complainants M T Shameer alleged that actor Bala had called him once requesting the former to withdraw the case against Mavunkal. Bala later denied it. Some records on how some earlier complaints against Mavunkal were hushed up have surfaced on social media, exposing the involvement of senior police officials. While DIG S Surendran admitted that Mavunkal was his family friend, he never knew about the latter’s dealings.Reports of cover-up and laxity came to light with Mavunkal’s arrest. Many police officers were regular at his house and museum, and there was a police beatbox outside his house, where the patrol party had to sign frequently, to show they visited the site in particular intervals, officials familiar with the incidents said. Police officials are yet to react to allegations.A two-year-old order of former police chief Loknath Behra giving directions to open a police booth outside his house also surfaced. In the order, Behra mentioned that Mavunkal’s house, also a museum, carries many priceless antiques, and it was worth giving security. In one of the photos, Behra was seen sitting on a throne, which Mavunkal said he obtained from descendants of Mysore king Tipu Sultan. All complaints against Mavunkal, including intelligence reports, were hushed up with the help of officers close to him, officials in the knowing of the matter said. One inspector general of police, a DIG, two SPs and two station house officers are under scanner now. “We were scared to complain against him after his photos with top police officers circulated in social media,” said one of the complainants. Many senior officers do admit that the latest scandal has dented the image of one of the best police forces in the country. A motivational speaker, doctor, cosmetologist, art promoter, peacenik and human rights activist, Mavunkal, only a matriculate, donned several roles for more than five years, and hoodwinked many. In 2019, the state intelligence stated that Mavunkal was a fraudster, and a high-level probed was needed against him, but thanks to his high, connections nothing happened. In his YouTube videos, Mavunkal, 52, claimed that he owns many antique pieces like Mysore emperor Tipu Sultan’s throne, silver coins Judas received for betraying Jesus Christ, Soloman-era gold coins and rare books on Maratha warrior Shivaji and Mughal emperor Aurangazeb. He also claimed that he is a German-trained cosmetologist and treated many VIPs. There are also reports that many cine personalities frequented him quite often. Later, the police found that most of these antiques were made in Kerala and Tamil Nadu by local craftsmen. State Congress chief K Sudhakaran Monday admitted that he knew him personally and sought treatment from him. “I went to him in connection with a skin ailment. I was recommended by one of my old friends in Kochi. I was not aware of his past or his degree,” he said. Party MP Benny Behnan on Tuesday said public workers should be very careful while dealing with such people, and it should be a lesson for all. Bharatiya Janata Party state president K Sudhakaran on Tuesday sought a central agency probe against Mavunkal. “Photos and videos doing rounds in social media show many leaders and senior officers were close to him. We need a central agency probe against him,” he said in the state capital. The ruling CPI(M) has asked Congress to drop its president in the light of fresh allegations. But Sudhakaran said the chief minister office is behind the move to discredit him. “Photos of two present ministers and senior officers also surfaced. My photos were leaked out deliberately,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-complaints-against-mavunkal-filed-kerala-police-role-comes-under-lens-101632855960137.html
29-09-2021||India||TRS-Rajender gear up for Huzurabad bypolls as EC announces date||Battles lines are drawn for the bypolls in Huzurabad assembly constituency in Telangana’s Karimnagar after the Election Commission announced the schedule for three Lok Sabha and 30 assembly seat elections across India on Tuesday. The by-election, scheduled for October 30, is necessitated due to the resignation of sitting MLA and former state health minister Eatala Rajender, who quit the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in June this year.Rajender was sacked from the state cabinet by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on May 2 following allegations of land grabbing. For the TRS, it is a matter of prestige to win the by-elections to the Huzurabad assembly seat. Huzurabad has been a TRS stronghold ever since its formation as part of the delimitation of assembly constituencies in 2009. Rajender, who had earlier represented the erstwhile Kamalapur assembly constituency, was the TRS MLA from Huzurabad for the last three terms till he resigned from the assembly membership in June this year.Now that Rajender joined the BJP, the ruling party is pulling out all stops to retain its hold on Huzurabad by winning the by-poll. Ever since the seat has fallen vacant, TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao laid special focus on the Huzurabad constituency by pumping in huge money in the name of welfare and developmental activities.“More than for Rajender, it is important for KCR to ensure the victory of the TRS in the by-elections. He forced Rajender to quit the TRS by sacking him from the cabinet on allegations of corruption. A victory for Rajender is a moral loss for KCR. Hence, he is splurging money in an unprecedented manner in Huzurabad to win the by-poll,” said political analyst Ramakrishna Sangem.KCR entrusted the responsibility of leading the party to victory in Huzurabad to his trouble-shooter nephew and state finance minister T Harish Rao. For the last couple of months, Harish has been camping in the constituency, holding meetings with various caste groups, local youth and women organisations and seeking their support.He, along with another minister from Karimnagar Gangula Kamalakar, took up several developmental programmes in the constituency, including laying roads in the interior areas, laying foundations for community halls and irrigation schemes. The TRS government also released funds liberally for the distribution of pensions and issuance of new ration cards to the beneficiaries to garner their votes.The biggest weapon KCR has taken out to attract Dalit voters in Huzurabad is the Telangana Dalit Bandhu scheme, under which, each eligible Dalit family will get a direct benefit transfer of ₹10 lakh into their account for taking up a self-employment programme.Soon after Rajender left the TRS, the chief minister announced the implementation of the Dalit Bandhu scheme as a pilot project in Huzurabad and launched it on August 16 at a public meeting at Shalapalli in the constituency.The officials have identified as many as 23,000 Dalit families as eligible for the scheme and in two weeks, the government released ₹2,000 crores in four instalments exclusively for Huzurabad under the scheme. The chief minister said more money would be released soon to cover all the beneficiaries.“It is nothing but bribing the voters to win the seat at any cost. If KCR has so much love for Dalits, he should implement the scheme for all the Dalits all over the state, instead of just Huzurabad,” Rajender had said.The former minister is also leaving no stone unturned to win the Huzurabad seat once again. “The TRS leadership has lured most of my followers and leaders who were backing me till recently by offering them posts and money. But I am confident of winning the by-poll with the support of the people of Huzurabad, who have been blessing me for the last three terms,” Rajender said.While Rajender is fighting the by-poll on behalf of BJP this time, the TRS has announced the candidature of its student wing leader Gellu Srinivasa Yadav. Both Rajender and Yadav are from other backward classes (OBC) communities.The Congress party, which stood second in the last assembly elections held in December 2018, has hardly any stakes in the Huzurabad by-poll this time, as it has turned out to be a battle between the TRS and the BJP. Congress is yet to identify its candidate.The newly-formed YSR Telangana Party floated by YS Sharmila, sister of Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, has already announced that it won’t contest the Huzurabad by-poll. But Sharmila said she was contemplating fielding a group of unemployed youth in the contest to highlight the issue of the rampant unemployment in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trsrajender-gear-up-for-huzurabad-bypolls-as-ec-announces-date-101632855901600.html
29-09-2021||India||Tussle between Tamil Nadu police, IAF over rape case investigation||A tussle had begun between the police and the Indian Air Force over who is entitled to investigate a rape case filed by a woman officer against her colleague . The alleged crime took place at the Air Force Administrative College campus in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore district on September 10. While the police have arrested the accused, the additional Mahila court in Coimbatore on Monday extended his judicial custody until September 30. During the hearing, the counsel of the accused N Sundaravadivelu argued that since the two officers belong to the armed forces and in this case the Indian Air Force, so they are subject to the Air Force Act. “It’s a special Act which is beyond the purview of the criminal procedure code and other punishable sections,” said the advocate and former public prosecutor for the CBI. “As far as the Indian Penal Code is concerned, it will be applied by the court martial authorities. There is a transgression by the civil police of Coimbatore- they have no right to investigate this matter. So the judiciary in subordinate courts also has no jurisdiction. This has to be investigated only by the air force authorities by court of enquiry and court martial. Though I’m appearing for the accused, I’m arguing that the trial should happen before the IAF authorities because that is the right forum. I cannot be defending my client in a wrong forum,” Sundaravadivelu added. Independently, officials from the Indian Air Force have also filed a petition in the court seeking the case to be transferred from the police for them to conduct the probe and a court martial. “We have cited all rules and procedures for the accused to be handed over to us,” said a spokesperson for the IAF on Tuesday.The police contended that the victim was unhappy with the enquiry being conducted by the institute which is why she had approached the Coimbatore city commissioner Deepak M Damor on September 20. Based on the complaint the All-Women’s Police Station in Gandhipuram carried out preliminary enquiries, registered a case against the accused officer and arrested him on Saturday. “Police have jurisdiction all over,” said a senior police officer in Coimbatore. “She was assaulted in the accommodation, and they (institute) had started taking action, but she was not happy with the enquiry, so she approached the police,” the officer added. The court will now decide on whether to hand over the accused to the IAF or allow the local police to continue investigating in the next hearing scheduled for September 30. Around 30 personnel from across India are undergoing training in the institute since August 15. The woman officer (27) had a leg injury around the first week of September while undergoing sports training on campus. She had taken medication for the injury before going to sleep and has reported that on the night of September 10, the accused allegedly came into her hostel room and committed the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tussle-between-tamil-nadu-police-iaf-over-rape-case-investigation-101632855840276.html
29-09-2021||India||Congress asks state leaders to hold negotiations with Sidhu||The Congress party has not accepted its Punjab unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu’s resignation and asked its state leaders to start negotiations with him while moving into a firefighting mode, said senior party leaders on Tuesday.But a section feels that the party leadership might not yield to several demands made by Sidhu, whose abrupt resignation on Tuesday afternoon appeared to take the party by surprise.The leaders pointed out that the appointment of Charanjit Singh Channi as the Punjab chief minister made it very difficult for Sidhu to bag the CM’s post in a post-election scenario. Punjab is scheduled to hold assembly elections early next year.“Sidhu was high command’s choice as the Punjab unit president. While his resignation letter two months after he took charge, is an embarrassment, the party has decided to continue negotiations,” said a senior leader on condition of anonymity.“At an appropriate time, the central leadership will intervene if and when it would be required,” added the leader. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was instrumental in Sidhu’s elevation as the party chief in Punjab on July 23, after months of tense struggle for control of the party with former chief minister Amarinder Singh.The immediate provocation, according to the Congress functionaries, is the appointment of APS Deol as the advocate general of the state.The decision created a political controversy last week with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) questioning the move as Deol was the counsel for a former Punjab director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini, who is embroiled in a 2015 police firing case on people protesting against the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book.Sidhu had made the sacrilege cases a central plank of his attack on former CM Singh.“But clearly, his larger goals and ambitions for unbridled power in Punjab has been cut short,” said a second senior leader involved in the Punjab developments. “Sidhu has been named as the Punjab unit chief and his arch rival Captain Amarinder Singh has been removed as the CM. But it doesn’t guarantee that he will be the CM in the next elections,” said the leader.“It is clear that the party will face election with Channi as its face. Also the deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa getting the important home department portfolio didn’t go down well with Sidhu’s camp. If there is any need to elevate a Sikh face, Randhawa will also be in the reckoning,” said a third leader, requesting anonymity.Sidhu’s resignation came roughly three hours after Channi announced the portfolio allocation on Tuesday.Congress functionaries also added that party president Sonia Gandhi conveyed to the leaders that while Amarinder Singh resigned from the CM’s post, it is not necessary to remove all his loyalists from key posts in the government. Sonia prefers to maintain a balance between two sides ahead of the elections, according to the functionaries.But a section of the party is irked at the way Sidhu resigned. “He shouldn’t have resigned in such a manner and that too, hours before the Congress planned to induct Kanhaiya Kumar and Jignesh Mevani. I think it’s clear case of acting first and thinking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-asks-punjab-unit-leaders-to-hold-negotiations-with-sidhu-101632855660252.html

Any attempt to disturb this fabric of unity and harmony will hurt the soul of India,” he said.At a time when the political opponents of the BJP frequently accuse the government of fostering anti-minority sentiments in the country, Naqvi said followers of almost all the religions of the world live in India, and constitutional and social guarantee and safety of their religious, social, economic, educational rights.“It is our collective national responsibility to ensure that India’s culture of tolerance and commitment of co-existence is not allowed to get weaken under any circumstances,” he said.Minister of state for minority affairs John Barla; National Commission for Minorities chairman Sardar Iqbal Singh Lalpura; Archbishop Anil Joseph; Bishop Subodh C.

In an interview to HT, RS Sharma, chief executive of the National Health Authority, elaborated on the mission, the steps needed for its effective implementation, and concerns on privacy and data security. Edited excerpts:Since enrolling for the mission is voluntary, how will you ensure its effective implementation?Of course, it is voluntary; and convincing people is definitely a challenge in such projects. What we, however, believe is that once you have an open intra-operable system, people do come forward because it becomes easy; it provides ease of living...I agree that initially technology usage is difficult, but once people realise the benefits of technology, they use it. Aadhaar is a good example... So, if we can demonstrate to people that using the digital mission for delivery of health services is going to be much more affordable, easy, will cost less in transport, and other facilities, it will work.Tell us more about the unique digital health ID.The unique ID is basically just a number which will be a reference to get all the records collated, and which a person can share at some point in time. The larger purpose of unique IDs is to ensure that you are able to have access to your documents, and you are able to share them with whomsoever you want to share, including doctors. It will be just a random number devoid of any intelligence, like Aadhaar.How will you ensure data safety?We have made the system very secure. First of all, it is federated data architecture; it is not that this platform is collecting any data. It is only providing linkages; it is just a transaction platform. For example, if you have visited a particular hospital, and that hospital has your digital records, the records will remain with that hospital. The data does not come to this platform; the mission doesn’t have any data. And with regards to data related to doctors, nurses, health care workers, hospitals, etc., that is absolutely secured with us.How do you plan to implement the mission in areas where there’s poor connectivity? ...Any programme which we will launch is going to be inclusive, including this programme, which is not going to exclude the digital have-nots...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayushman-bharat-digital-mission-will-be-affordable-secure-rssharma-101632855300230.html
29-09-2021||India||India fought Covid in best way despite limited resources: Amit Shah at NDMA event||New Delhi: Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday lauded India’s response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic while highlighting the country’s low fatality rate, at an event to mark the 17th Foundation Day celebrations of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). “If any unbiased agency assesses, then it will say that if the fight against COVID-19 has been fought in any country in the best way in the world, then it has been fought in India. With a population of 130 crores (1.3 billion), limited resources, limited infrastructure, we had the lowest mortality rate in the world, and our number of COVID-19 cases per million people was also very low,” Shah said at the event where he was the chief guest. The Union minister also praised the NDMA for doing “a very good job” in the fight against the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.He also spoke about the trajectory of disaster management in India and highlighted the need to introduce scientific systems for avoiding disasters and preventing loss of lives.Shah said the NDMA, the national disaster response force (NDRF), and state disaster response force (SDRF) have, over the last 17 years, “changed the history of disaster management in the country”. He added that in a country of over 1.3 billion people, where every state has different geographical features, there is a higher need to adopt scientific systems for avoiding disasters to prevent loss of life and infrastructure. Shah also talked about Aapda Mitra and Common Alert Protocol, the two new initiatives launched by the NDMA, while releasing the training manual and plan documents of the initiatives. Shah said Aapda Mitra has been implemented on an experimental basis in 30 flood-prone districts across 25 states. “Work has been done to prepare 5,500 Aapda Mitras and Aapda Sakhis for flood protection. Those who can swim were selected for this and wherever there was a flood, they did a great job,” he said, adding 28 states and Union territories have signed MoUs with NDMA for this scheme. “When we look back at the last 17 years, we have come a long way, but there is still a long way to go and we have not yet reached the stage of being content,” Shah said, adding, “Our goal should be to create such a disaster management system that no matter how severe the disaster may be, not even one person should die…” He said the mechanisms put in place by the states have been successful at reducing the death toll to a great extent. In addition, he pointed out the potential impact of climate change and controlling the intensity and frequency of disasters through disaster management as two major challenges facing the nation. The Union minister acknowledged that while earlier, the government’s approach towards disasters was relief-centric, it has now shifted to prevention and early preparedness. “We should continue this approach and strive for reaching zero loss of life,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-fought-covid-in-best-way-despite-limited-resources-amit-shah-at-ndma-event-101632855241279.html

We have to strike a balance between the right to employment and right to life of citizens. But our prime focus is to protect the right to life of innocent citizens who suffer due to the use of firecrackers,” the court said.The court noted that despite an express ban on the manufacture and sale of joined firecrackers or laaris, they are still used in all festivals, religious processions and election victory marches. “...time has come that we must fix responsibility and liability,” the court said.The bench asked Nadkarni why these laaris are still available when their production was banned in 2018. In response, the senior counsel said that the production of big rolls of laaris has stopped.“People are buying small crackers and joining them. They should know this cannot be done,” Nadkarni said.“The problem is implementation,” the bench rued, adding, “We want that our orders must be implemented in true spirit...”Three contempt petitions were also filed by senior advocate Gopal Shankarnaraynan in which he pointed out that the manufacturers have been resorting to novel ways to override the court’s directions. “Initially they delivered goods online even when the October 2018 order specifically banned e-commerce websites from accepting or effecting online sale of firecrackers,” he said, adding that some traditional crackers with prohibited chemical compositions were being sold under the label of green crackers.The 2018 judgment had directed the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), a government establishment, to review the chemical composition of fireworks.Shankarnaraynan told the court that the government has ignored PESO and come out with proposals by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute for alternative crackers that still contain most of the salts banned by the court order.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre and PESO, contested the petitioner’s claim and said the Centre had filed its response in October 2020 when some of the violations were shown to court by Shankarnaraynan in March that year and the top court had ordered a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the use of toxic chemicals in green crackers.The CBI filed its report in a sealed cover which the court is yet to open. When Nadkarni sought a copy of the report but the court refused.The court will continue hearing the case on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/right-to-life-above-right-to-employment-says-sc-over-firecracker-ban-101632855186778.html
29-09-2021||India||Balbeer Giri named math chief after seer's suicide||Days after the death of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad president Narendra Giri, Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani, a collective of Hindu ascetics, has decided to appoint his disciple, Balbeer Giri, as his successor, people familiar with the developments said.Balbeer Giri will be appointed as next Pithadishwar (Math head) of Baghambari Gaddi Math in Prayagraj in a ceremony on October 5.“As per the last will (June 4, 2020) of Maharaj ji (Narendra Giri), Balbeer Giri has been named as his successor. The same wish has been mentioned in the suicide note as well as in his last video found on his cell phone,” said Ravindra Puri , general secretary of Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani. “It has been decided that his wishes would be honoured and Balbeer Giri would be made the next head of Baghambari Math.” Puri was referring to a purported suicide note recovered after Narendra Giri was found hanging from a ceiling fan in the Math in Prayagraj on September 20.A video was recovered from his cell phone, which showed him saying things similar to that mentioned in the note.Whoever heads the Baghambari Gaddi Math gains control over property of the Math worth crores.Ravindra Puri said a five-member supervisory board would look after the overall working of the Math. For all major decisions, like sale or purchase of land, the head of the Math would have to seek approval of this body, he said.“This all-important body would include members from the Niranjani Akhada only. Besides myself, other members would be Mahant Dinesh Giri, Mahant Omkar Giri, Keshav Puri and Mahant Har Govind Puri,” he said. “We are following the set practices and traditions of the Akhada and all the decisions are in strict accordance with it.”Many senior seers, including Kailashanand Giri, Acharya Mahamandaleshwar of Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani, had dubbed the purported suicide note as fake and had maintained that the collective of renunciates would be taking the final call on Narendra Giri’s successorPuri said senior seers of 13 Akhadas (collectives) and officials of the district administration would be invited for the “pattaabhishek (annointing)” ceremony next week.The ceremony would coincide with the 16-day death ritual of Narendra Giri.In his new role, Balbeer Giri would not only head the Math but also the Bade Hanuman temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/balbeer-giri-named-successor-to-mahant-narendra-giri-101632855061376.html

In the past, students seeking to study abroad faced problems because Covaxin is recognised as a Covid-19 vaccine only in a few countries.The company earlier said it had submitted all documents to the WHO for the grant of EUL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/working-with-world-health-organization-to-get-emergency-use-listing-for-covaxin-bharat-biotech-101632855001498.html

These include gatherings in fairs, festivals and religious events.He also asked the states to closely monitor Covid-19 case positivity, hospital and ICU bed occupancy in each district as well as take proactive containment measures in districts with a high positivity rate. “It is important to identify warning signs of potential surges early on and to take appropriate measures to curb the spread,” Bhalla said. “This would require a localised approach.” The letter also said vaccinations should continue in an accelerated manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-measures-to-prevent-covid-surge-during-upcoming-festivals-home-ministry-to-states-101632854765029.html
29-09-2021||India||Centre dissolves ordnance factory board, transfers assets to seven DPSUs||The Union government has ordered the dissolution of the four-decade-old Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and amalgamated 41 factories under seven new state-owned companies to manufacture defence hardware ranging from munitions to heavy weapons and vehicles.The move, first unveiled as part of the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) package in June, is aimed at enhancing efficiency, autonomy and accountability, and introducing a corporate structure for the network of ordnance factories against a backdrop of calls for reforms in the state-run defence industry.According to an official order issued by the department of defence production under the defence ministry on September 24, OFB will be dissolved from October 1 and the assets, employees and operations of the 41 factories will be transferred to the seven defence public sector units (DPSUs).Twelve factories making a wide range of munitions will be brought under Pune-based Munitions India Limited, which will manufacture ammunition and explosives, while five factories making heavy vehicles will be amalgamated under the Avadi-based Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited. Eight factories that make weapons ranging from small arms to rifles and field guns will be brought under the Kanpur-based Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited, which will manufacture weapons and equipment. Four factories will be part of Troop Comforts Limited, which will oversee the manufacture of clothing and other items. Nagpur-based Yantra India Limited will oversee the functioning of eight factories that will manufacture military grade components and ancillary products, while Dehradun-based India Optel Limited will bring together three factories that will make optoelectronic items. The Kanpur-based Ordnance Parachute Factory will be brought under Gliders India Limited, which will be engaged in manufacturing parachutes. Ten non-production units, such as the National Academy of Defence Production and several institutes of learning, will be merged with the seven new companies, while 11 more non-production units, including regional marketing centres, will be handed over to the companies and their employees transferred to different factories, according to the order.A total of 3,152.11 acres of surplus land at 16 ordnance factories will be transferred to the directorate of ordnance (coordination and services).The seven new companies are “required to frame rules and regulations related to service conditions of the absorbed employees and seek an option for permanent absorption from the employees on deemed deputation to that respective DPSU, within a period of two years”, the order stated.In June, after the Union cabinet cleared the corporatisation of the OFB, Singh described the decision as a “historic one.” “It is also a big decision from the point of view of national security,” Singh had said. The move has been opposed by three workers’ unions, which have said the units employ a total of around 80,000 people. The unions, in November 2020, also presented a proposal for restructuring the factories and improving their functioning to achieve production targets.The Kolkata-based OFB was established in April 1979, but the history of some ordnance factories dates back hundreds of years. Some of the oldest factories located in West Bengal were set up in the 18th century. In recent decades, there have been growing demands from the armed forces and experts for reforms in the units to bring in new technologies and production methods and to ensure the production of sophisticated weaponry. The government’s order marks the first major overhaul of the factories in decades and the introduction of a corporate structure will enable the companies to raise capital by going public if the government decides to do so.India has set aside ₹70,221 crore – 63% of the military’s capital budget – for buying locally produced weapons and systems to boost defence indigenisation. The defence ministry recently cleared domestic military purchases worth ₹13,700 crore, including proposals to buy 118 Arjun Mk-1A tanks and equipping armoured fighting vehicles with modern protection systems. The new tanks alone will cost ₹8,380 crore, with the order to be fulfilled by state-run factories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-orders-dissolution-of-ofb-transfers-assets-to-seven-dpsus-101632854349241.html

However, one of Gupta’s friends, Hardeep Singh Chauhan, who was staying with him in the hotel, alleged police brutally thrashed Gupta.Talking to reporters, Gupta’s wife Meenakshi and his father Nand Kishore, accused police of beating him.Six policemen, including a station house officer, a chowki in-charge and four constables, were suspended in connection with the death of the Kanpur realtor, Vipin Tada, senior superintendent of police of Gorakhpur, said on Tuesday.“During a routine checking drive, police found that these three men were the only group who were from different places, but were staying together at the hotel... So, they were checked on the basis of suspicion. In the chaos caused by police checking, one of the men slipped and suffered injuries. He was rushed to Baba Raghav Das Medical College, where he died. It was an accident...,” Tada said.Hardeep told reporters that he along with his brother Pardeep Singh Chauhan, 32, and Gupta came to Gorakhpur to meet their friend Chandan Saini.Hardeep said the three of them were sleeping when five to six policemen led by SHO of Ramgarh Tal police station, Jai Narayan Singh, and chowki in-charge of Phal Mandi, Akshay Mishra, knocked at their door and asked for their identity cards around midnight on Monday.“I woke Manish up and asked him to give his card, but he and objected to questioning at the odd hour. At this, the cops became aggressive and started searching our bags and belongings. I asked them why we were being treated like terrorists. At this, Jai Narayan Singh and chowki in-charge Akshay Mishra, who I believe were drunk, threatened to send us to jail and started slapping us. They pushed me out after beating me. Then I saw them dragging Manish, who was in an unconscious state, with blood flowing from his head and face.,” Hardeep told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-man-dies-after-police-raid-at-gorakhpur-hotel-6-cops-suspended-101632854285630.html
29-09-2021||India||Pakistani terrorist captured, 1 killed in anti-infiltration operations in Uri||A Pakistani terrorist belonging to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was captured alive while another was killed during an anti-infiltration operation in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian Army said on Tuesday.The terrorists, who appeared to be planning a strike, made the infiltration attempt along the Salamabad Nala, which was the same route used for the 2016 suicide attack on the Uri garrison, the army added.Major General Virendra Vats, General Officer Commanding (GOC), 19 infantry division, said the incident took place on September 25 when a brief encounter erupted between the terrorists and security forces near the Nala. “The operation was initially launched on the intervening night of September 18 and 19 when an infiltration bid by six Pakistani terrorists was made along the Line of Control (LoC) in Uri sector. As an encounter broke out, taking advantage of the dark and dense foliage, four terrorists retreated back to Pakistan while the remaining two sneaked into Uri. The combing operation continued for nine days in the area,” he said.“However, on September 25, contact was established again with the two terrorists by one such patrolling party near the LoC, following which one terrorist one killed and the other was taken into custody, after due precautions, as he pleaded for his life,” he added.The deceased was identified as Atiq ur Rehman alias Qari Anas, a resident of Attock in Pakistan’s Punjab province. The second terrorist, who was taken into custody, was identified as Ali Babar Patra from Okara district in the same province.During the interrogation, the officer said, it was learnt that the terrorists infiltrated from Sawai Nala Camp to Hallan Shumali Launch pad to Jabri in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, which led to the Salamabad Nala.“Using the same Nala, terrorists had infiltrated in 2016 with the help of Pakistan Army to carry out a suicide attack on the Uri Garrison,” the GOC said.The officer added that the terrorist was directed by his handlers to drop supplies at Pattan. “But when we went through the recoveries and modus operandi, it suggested that they had come here for some kind of a strike which went beyond the drop of supplies,” he added.The captured terrorist also told interrogators that he was lured into joining the LeT due to poverty. Patra said he underwent three weeks of preliminary training at Garhi Habibullah Camp (KPK) in 2019 and then fresh training this year, the officer said.Patra added that Rehman had given him ₹20,000 for his mother’s treatment and had promised him an additional amount of ₹30,000 on his safe return from Pattan near Baramulla, where the group was to deliver the war-like stores (arms and ammunition).Seven AK-47 weapons, nine pistols and revolvers, more than 80 grenades and Indian and Pakistani currencies were recovered during the latest Uri operation and the one that took place on September 18 in the surrounding area, Vats said.The official said the movement of such a large number of people cannot take place without the active complicity of the Pakistan Army deployed on the other side.“This shows the desperation of Pakistan that when they see peace in Kashmir, they send in terrorists to disturb peace by sensational strike. Seven terrorists have been neutralised in as many days while one has been nabbed alive,” he added.Last week, the army claimed that three terrorists were killed in Hatlanga village in Uri, close to the LoC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistani-let-terrorist-captured-1-killed-in-anti-infiltration-operations-in-uri-101632853983199.html
29-09-2021||India||Kanhaiya Kumar joins Congress, Jignesh Mevani lends support||Announcing that today’s India needs Bhagat Singh’s courage, Mahatma Gandhi’s unity, and BR Ambedkar’s quest for equality, Kanhaiya Kumar, one of India’s prominent young politicians, joined the Congress from the Communist Party of India on Tuesday. His entry marked a new chapter in the Congress’s efforts to unite forces from different spectrums of politics to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2024 elections.Independent MLA in Gujarat, Jignesh Mevani, sitting next to Kumar at an event, also pledged support for the Congress. He, however, didn’t officially join the party as it would result in him losing his assembly membership.Kumar’s inaugural speech, with a dash of new lingo invoking a host of freedom fighters and a call for greater unity, repeatedly mentioned “this is time for urgency” and hailed the Congress as the only force that “can lead in this Ideological war to save the idea of India.” He also said: “I alone can’t do anything.” He echoed many pet talking points of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and pointed out that “out of 545 Lok Sabha seats, 200 seats are where the Congress is in direct fight with the BJP.”The entry of the two popular young leaders is seen by experts as a relief for the Congress, which has lost at least three key young leaders -- Jyotiraditya Scindia, Himanta Biswa Sharma and Jitin Prasada-- in the recent years to the BJP. Both Kumar and Mevani earlier joined Rahul Gandhi in garlanding the statue of Bhagat Singh at the Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh Park .While the Gujarat MLA said he hoped to create the “charm and ambiance of the freedom struggle”, Kumar said “when the entire shopping mall is on fire, you can’t save your shop”, indicating a larger fight against the BJP.Kumar hit out at the Sangh Parivar and even compared Prime Minister Narendra Modi with an actor for frequently changing his attire. He invoked Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Azad, Sarojini Naidu, Jagjivan Ram Bhagat Singh, Ashfaqulla Khan, Buddha, Kabir and Nanak, and said: “Many people felt if the Congress doesn’t survive, the country won’t survive.” Mevani said that “the story that started in Gujarat” has now led to devastation in the country. “It’s a war against democracy, Constitution and idea of India,” the MLA said.“If we have to save all these, we have to be a part of the party that fought the freedom struggle.”He also announced that he will fight the next assembly election, due next year, on the Congress’s ticket.Kumar acknowledged that he was “born” in the CPI, but left it as “we need to speed up our struggle and open up our ideological barrier”. He said he doesn’t take the BJP seriously and quipped: “Those who sought clemency, have now become Veer. Those who vowed to create Godse’s India, are now chanting Gandhi’s name.”He announced that he will be taking on some responsibility in the organisation. Both Mevani and Kumar repeatedly referred to Rahul Gandhi and echoed his lines, especially on how the BJP has become a threat to the idea of India.Congress general secretary (organization) KC Venugopal described Kumar as “a symbol of fighting for freedom of expression” and said “the way he fought against fundamentalism throughout his student period, his joining will enthuse cadre of Congress party”.“Jignesh is also fighting for the same cause. Jignesh believed in Congress ideology to carry everybody along. It will give a very strong message that young people fighting for needy, poor people, fighting for freedom, non-violence are joining the Congress,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kanhaiya-kumar-joins-congress-jignesh-mevani-lends-support-101632852901819.html
29-09-2021||India||Another milestone nears: 1 in 4 Indians fully vaccinated||India’s mass inoculation programme closed in on a yet another major milestone on Tuesday, with almost one in every four eligible Indians (24.8%) having been fully vaccinated by the end of the day. Another 43.5% have been partly vaccinated.The milestone in coverage comes at a time when the number of active cases of Covid-19 in the country has dropped below the 300,000 mark for the first time in at least six months, data shows.As of Tuesday evening, India has administered 876.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to 642.5 million people – making the country second only to China (1.1 billion people inoculated) in terms of the number of people who have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine.Of these, 233.6 million people have received both doses of the vaccine, while another 408.9 million people have been partially vaccinated. When these numbers are seen alongside the country’s projected adult population of 940 million (according to the Census of India’s National Commission on Population), this means that 68.3% of people above the age of 18 years have received vaccine shots – 24.8% are fully vaccinated and another 43.5% partially vaccinated. The proportion of people fully vaccinated is set to cross the 25% mark as early as Wednesday.The headline number on population coverage, however, glosses over the wide variations across different states. Himachal Pradesh leads the country in not only overall coverage, but also the proportion of people fully vaccinated – with the state’s entire adult population vaccinated with at least one dose and nearly half (48.3%) fully vaccinated. Kerala is on the second spot with 92.1% adults having received at least one dose and 40.3% having received both jabs. Uttarakhand (91.1% at least one dose and 38.2% both doses), Gujarat (85.3% and 38.1%, respectively) and Delhi (79.1% and 37.4%) make up the top five states in the country.At the other end of the spectrum, seven large states are currently behind the national average. Uttar Pradesh with the lowest coverage by both doses (13.6%), Bihar (14.5% adults fully vaccinated) and Jharkhand (16.2% fully vaccinated). In terms of coverage of adults with at least one dose, Jharkhand comes at the bottom with 54.3%, followed by West Bengal (55.5%) and Uttar Pradesh (57.7%).With over 225 million doses already administered across the country in the month of September, India has also bettered the monthly jab record set in August. A total of 183.5 million doses were administered across the country in August, translating to a daily average of 5.92 million doses in the month. Since the figures for September are only for 28 days, it translates to an average of nearly 8 million shots a day throughout the month, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.For context to how much the numbers have increased in September (as well as in August to a good degree), the average daily dose administration through July was 4.35 million, while it was 3.98 million in June and only 1.97 million in May.The jump in numbers through September was achieved through a consistent push in daily vaccination numbers through the month. On September 17, to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, several states increased daily numbers as the country administered a record 25 million doses through the day. Furthermore, daily jabs crossed the 10 million mark on three more days in the month – September 9, September 20 and September 27, according to government data.Meanwhile, as the daily infections continued to drop across the country, the number of active cases in India on Tuesday dropped to 289,077. This is the lowest number of active cases seen in the country in more than half a year – the last time active cases were this low was on March 19, when the second wave was just kicking off. The number of active cases right now is a drop of more than 92% from what was during the peak of the country’s brutal second wave of infections when it touched 3.75 million on May 9. Active cases – those Covid-19 patients still carrying the virus, and thus under treatment – is a crucial metric representing the country’s battle against the disease because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in a region. While the pace of the drive has seen progress, data shows that there is still a long way to go if India wants to achieve its stated target of vaccinating its entire adult population of 940 million by the end of 2021. To achieve this, India needs to administer another billion doses in the remaining 94 days of the year, translating to a daily rate of 10.7 million doses a day. While India has done this on several occasions, it has not been able to do so consistently. At its best, the seven-day average of daily doses has touched 9.8 million (for the week ended September 23), while this number has dropped to an average of 7.2 million in the past week. To be sure, it is unlikely that entire adult population will want to be jabbed.Experts stressed that the need for communication drives to tackle vaccine hesitancy is still needed despite improved coverage proportions. “Various studies had shown that around 40% of India’s population was resistant to vaccines in varying degrees, of which around 25% were on the fence, while 15% were properly against receiving jabs. Surveys have shown that after the second wave, a large proportion of the fence-sitters appear to have shifted to acceptance.The government must still focus its communication outreach, because hesitancy can still remain a major challenge to achieve full coverage in a country the size of India,” said epidemiologist and public health expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. “With 68% of India’s population having received at least one dose, and a quarter both doses, with the pace of vaccination maintaining a steady rate, we can say that we have reached a phase where India’s programme has achieved an equilibrium between supply and demand,” he said.“Sero-surveys conducted in India in June-July revealed that over 67% of the country’s population carried antibodies against the disease. And the country saw another two-three month period of high transmission of the disease following the survey period... These figures, along with India’s vaccination coverage, mean that on a broad level, it could be assumed that 85% of the country may have some protection against severe disease for the time being,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-milestone-nears-1-in-4-indians-fully-vaccinated-101632852541094.html
29-09-2021||India||Number Theory: Understanding the business of farming in India’s ‘input markets’||What are the issues facing farmers in input markets? Answering this question adequately and accurately will help us understand the cost side of farm finances.On the revenue side, in the first part of this two-part series, HT reported that over a third of India’s farmers do not get expected prices when they sell their crop and the presumed monopsony of APMCs (agriculture produce market committees), something which the new farm laws seek to end, has a very small role in farmers being dissatisfied with prices for their output.The second part of this series will use unit-level data from the latest Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India (SAS) to look at the conditions facing farmers in input markets. The challenges facing Indian farmers in input markets are quite different from what they face in output markets. Poor quality of material inputs are hardly a concern for farmers, but what is really a problem is their lack of awareness in using inputs which can help them hedge risks and ensure sustainability.The category SAS uses for this analysis is agricultural households rather than farmers. Agricultural households are defined as households that have at least one member self-employed in agriculture and an output from specified agricultural activities of at least ₹4,000 in the previous 365 days.1. Fertilisers and manure are the most expensive material inputSAS seeks responses on the cost of 17 inputs used in farming. Of these, nine can be described as material inputs, which exclude cost of human and animal labour, interest and rent for land and equipment. On average, human labour has the biggest share in input costs for an agricultural household engaged in cultivation, while fertilisers and manure have the biggest share in material inputs. Share of different inputs varies the most due to lease rent for land, which increases significantly for cultivators with more land. The share of seeds, fertilisers and irrigation in total input costs goes down as the size of the landholding increases. 2. Only 22% of farmers use own seeds for cultivationOne of the biggest changes that commercialisation of agriculture has brought about is the market for seeds. Unlike in the past, when a farmer would use his own seeds for growing crops, the market for seeds is heavily commercialised now. Only 22% of India’s farmers reported using their own seeds for farming. Because data on source of seeds is collected for individual crops, households growing more than one crop were counted as many times as the number of crops they grew. As many as 71.5% of them brought seeds from private sources, including local markets, dealers, private processors, and contract farming sponsors and companies. A small proportion bought them from cooperatives, government agencies or APMCs. Whether or not farmers buy seeds from private players also depends on the crop they are growing. Forty one percent of farmers reported having used their own seeds to grow fruits compared to 31% of pulse farmers, 20% of cereal farmers, and 18% of vegetable farmers. SAS records data on purchase of seeds for four main crops a farmer reports having grown.3. Satisfaction levels for inputs are higher than prices received for cropsOver one-third farmers are dissatisfied with the sale of their crop. That is not the case with the inputs that go into producing the crop. SAS asks an agricultural household the source and quality or adequacy of seeds for each of the four main crops for which output data is collected. For other inputs for which this data are collected, such as fertilisers or diesel, the information is agnostic of the crop for which it was used.Only 0.3% farmers reported quality of their inputs as being poor. This does not vary significantly across states or source of input. Almost three in four farmers reported the quality as good and the rest as satisfactory. To be sure, there are significant differences in perception about thequality of inputs as good or satisfactory by states.4. Risk-hedging is the real input market challengeWhile the Indian farmer does not face a lot of problems in getting quality material inputs for cultivation, it is in risk-hedging – be it through insurance or deploying technological knowledge efficiently – that they face their biggest challenge. More than 90% of India’s farmers – agricultural households growing more than one crop being counted as many times as the crops being produced – do not insure their crops. Of those who do buy insurance, 6.2% insure their crop automatically as part of taking a crop loan. Only 2.4% insure their crop irrespective of whether they are taking a loan or not. Lack of insurance is more prevalent among smaller farmers. Only 62.8% of the large farmers (with more than 10 hectares of land) are not insured, compared to 95.8% of landless or marginal farmers (who own up to one hectare of land). About 97% of farmers growing fruits and 98% of those growing vegetables were not insured in 2018-19. This figure was 89% of pulses and 92% for cereals. Awareness is the major reason for not availing crop insurance, with 55% households reporting this as a reason for not taking insurance. Awareness as a problem decreases as size of land increases.If a household grew two crops (say both 'wheat' and 'paddy'), it was counted twice for insurance figures; Insurace figures weighted avg. of both seasons; Land size from first visit (July-December season)

He was speaking via videoconference on Monday at an event to launch 35 new crop varieties designed to withstand extreme weather. He also virtually inaugurated a top farm-research institute in Chhattisgarh’s capital Raipur.PM Modi said Indian scientists have developed several technologies to mitigate the impact of the climate crisis on agriculture, including 1,300 seed varieties that could adapt to various situations. He also called for a campaign to shield agriculture from the climate crisis.“Climate change can bring new challenges such as newer pests, new diseases and new epidemics. These can imperil humans, health of livestock and also impact crops,” Modi said.He said the threats posed by the climate crisis could be overcome if “science and society collaborate closely”.The National Institute of Biotic Stress Management, Raipur, which the PM virtually launched, will be a frontline lab to develop solutions for various pest attacks and other sources of biotic stress on crops.According to climate experts, global warming can give rise to newer pests. “Our focus is very high on more nutritious seeds, adapted to new conditions, especially in changing climates. Let this be the start of a new campaign,” the Prime Minister said, referring to the Raipur institute.The 35 crop varieties with “special traits” have been developed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to address the “twin challenges of climate change and malnutrition”, according to an official statement.Scientists have developed two varieties of non-genetically modified basmati rice that can withstand the herbicides, technically called Pusa Basmati 1979 and Pusa Basmati 1985.These varieties also don’t need to be grown in nurseries first before being transplanted on to fields, which is how most paddy is grown. Therefore, they can be directly grown in fields, which can help save water. The ICAR has also developed biofortified varieties of wheat, pearl millet, maize and chickpea, quinoa, buckwheat, winged bean and faba bean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-calls-for-campaign-to-mitigate-climate-change-s-impact-on-farms-101632824458756.html
29-09-2021||India||EC announces bypoll schedule for 3 Lok Sabha, 30 assembly seats||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced bypolls to three Lok Sabha and 30 assembly seats on October 30, saying the schedule was finalised after reviewing the situations related to the pandemic, floods, festivals, cold conditions in certain regions and feedback from local authorities.The Lok Sabha bypolls will be held to one seat each in the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Madhya Pradesh (Khandwa) and Himachal Pradesh (Mandi). Assembly by-elections will be held at one constituency each in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Mizoram, Maharashtra, Nagaland, and Telangana; two each in Karnataka, Bihar, and Rajasthan; three each in Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Madhya Pradesh; four in West Bengal; and five in Assam.The counting of votes will take place on November 2.The bypolls were earlier deferred in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The poll watchdog’s guidelines for holding elections during the pandemic will apply to the by-elections on October 30 and mandate limited participation in the campaign and the use of masks, sanitisers, and gloves.“The commission has reviewed the situation related to pandemic, flood, festivals, cold conditions in certain regions, feedback from concerned States/UT and taken into consideration all facts and circumstances and it has decided to hold by-elections to fill vacancies in three parliamentary constituencies of UT of Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh and 30 vacancies in assembly constituencies of various states,” the poll panel said in a statement.Earlier this month, ECI announced bypolls to four assembly seats on September 30 (Thursday).They include West Bengal’s Bhabanipur, where Mamata Banerjee is contesting as she needs to get elected to the state assembly by November to continue as the chief minister of the state.The fresh bypoll schedule was announced on the day the Calcutta high court rejected a public interest litigation against prioritising the Bhabanipur bypoll.Apart from Bhabanipur, by-polls are also being held to Jangipur, Samerganj (West Bengal), and Pipli (Odisha) seats on Thursday.Welcoming the announcement on bypolls to three assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat in Madhya Pradesh, state Congress chief Kamal Nath tweeted: “Congress is fully prepared for these elections. We will announce our candidates in due course. We have full faith in the people here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-announces-by-poll-schedule-for-3-lok-sabha-30-assembly-seats-101632810896627.html
29-09-2021||India||Number Theory: Understanding the business of farming in India||That Indian agriculture has been distress-ridden is an accepted fact in post-reform India. However, this is often discussed more in terms of farmers’ suicides, especially during the last decade, or abysmally low farm incomes. Both underline the crisis in farming, but neither is helpful in framing a forward-looking approach.If farm incomes have to improve in India, it is important to understand the business of farming. This entails a holistic look at the entire process, from the farmer buying inputs for cultivation to selling his produce. Any such analysis requires information on farm balance sheets.The latest Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India (SAS) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) gives this information from July 2018 to June 2019. SAS is the most comprehensive document on farm incomes in India.This two-part series by Hindustan Times will look at the business of farming using an analysis of unit-level data from SAS. The first part looks at conditions in output markets for farmers. The second part looks at what farmers feel about input markets.One-third of Indian farmers are not happy with the prices they receiveAlmost 40% of India’s retail inflation basket comprises of food items. In the past, food price inflation has been associated with political turmoil in the country and even led to governments losing power. HT’s analysis of SAS data shows that things might have changed dramatically on this front. Every third farmer in India is unhappy with the prices he receives on selling his crop.To be sure, the category SAS uses for this analysis is agricultural households rather than farmers. Agricultural households are defined as households that have at least one member self-employed in agriculture and produced output from specified agricultural activities worth at least ₹4,000 in the previous 365 days. Because data on sale satisfaction is collected for individual crops, households growing more than one crop were counted as many times as the number of crops they grew.Widespread disappointment with prices received by farmers, when read with the constant state of policy paranoia about higher food prices, underlines the basic fault line in Indian agriculture. Dissatisfaction with prices is greater when it comes to horticultural (fruits and vegetables) crops, which are now a bigger part of India’s agricultural production basket than cereals. Inflation data clearly shows fruit and vegetable prices are far more volatile than cereal prices.Will the recent farm reforms help farmers receive better prices?Of the three farm laws the union government brought in 2020, one was targeted at eradicating the purported monopsony – a situation when there is one buyer in the market – of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) vis-à-vis farmers. Supporters of these laws have been arguing that the new regime will help farmers receive better prices by selling their products in the open market rather than the APMCs, which it is claimed are dominated by vested interests. SAS data does not support such a claim.APMCs have nothing close to a monopsony as far as the market for agricultural output is concerned. SAS data shows that only 5.4% of farmers sold their output to APMCs and an overwhelming 77.5% sold their produce in local private markets.While dissatisfaction levels vis-à-vis prices are slightly higher in APMCs compared to what they are local private markets, the latter account for a significantly larger share of farmers who were not satisfied with the prices they received.The SAS numbers also underline the promise of promoting cooperatives in farming. The avenue which gives farmers the highest satisfaction is farmer producer organizations (FPOs). It is noteworthy that selling to contract farming sponsors or companies directly – this is often offered as a panacea for low farm incomes in the country – does not offer significant improvements in satisfaction of sale. Here, however, the main cause of dissatisfaction is delayed payments.The limits and strength of ongoing farm protestsThe ongoing farmers’ protests against the three farm laws have displayed a unique characteristic. While they have proved to be remarkably resilient in the green revolution belt of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, they have, at least until now, failed to have similar impact elsewhere. What explains this dichotomy?The region where farmers’ protests have had the biggest traction, such as Punjab and Haryana, is also where APMCs have a larger share in sale of farm output. Also, farmers with larger landholdings sell a bigger share of their output in APMCs. Average landholding size is much bigger in states such as Punjab and Haryana than the rest of country.While the absence of procurement via APMCs could explain low support for farmers’ agitation in large parts of the country, what has helped the cause of protesting farmers are their arguments around the reforms tilting the scales in favour of large capital vis-à-vis farmers. The SAS data shows that large farmers were hardly better-off when it came to satisfaction over prices received in the markets.Perhaps the political reception towards farm laws would have been very different had the government focused reforms around forming FPOs – they provide maximum satisfaction to farmers – which was part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s 2019 election manifesto, rather than selling the corporate sector as the harbinger of prosperity in Indian agriculture.(This is the first of a two-part series on the business of farming in India. The second part looks at input markets facing farmers.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/understanding-the-business-of-farming-in-india-101632761567190.html

Delhi has traditionally limited its engagements in the maritime domain, with little political interest in maritime security and collaborations. The UNSC debate on maritime security underscores the way maritime security has gone from the periphery to the center of Delhi’s foreign policy priorities.
29-09-2021||Today's||Bringing the states back in||The recently released Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India, 2019 (SAS) serves as an important reminder of the diverse and regionally specific nature of agriculture in India. Agricultural incomes and the interlinkages between farm and non-farm activity vary significantly by state. Thus, pathways for “doubling farmers income” or enhancing productivity through market competition have to be determined in consonance with state-specific realities. This is the primary reason why agriculture is a state subject and why the Centre’s farm laws are fundamentally flawed.The average total monthly income of an agricultural household in 2018-19 (June-July) was ₹10,829 (including pensions and remittances). Of this, farm income (crop production and farming of animals) contributed less than 50% to an average household’s total income. But hidden in this pan-India statistic, as a Centre For Policy Research analysis reveals, are significant state-level variations. Farm income dependence is about a third of total incomes in states such as Kerala (22%), West Bengal (28%), and Odisha (35%) and as high as over 60% in Punjab (61%) and Madhya Pradesh (66%). A closer look at sources of income presents a puzzle. Average monthly farm income in Bihar was ₹4,478 compared with ₹1,929 in Jharkhand. However, average earnings from wages were about the same. Farm incomes account for 57% of total income in Bihar while their contribution to total income is a mere 37% in Jharkhand. Total income of an average agricultural household in Jharkhand is far lower than Bihar. There are bigger surprises — the average monthly income from agriculture in Kerala is ₹4,688 (not significantly more than Bihar). Farmers in Karnataka earn nearly 26% more than farmers in Maharashtra.The degree of dependency on farm income is, of course, linked to the size of operational landholdings. At an all-India level, it is only when land size exceeds one hectare that farm income to total agricultural income reaches the threshold of 50%. But again, there are state-specific variations. In Kerala, nearly 87% of agricultural households were in possession of between .01 and 1 hectare of land. Agriculture accounted for a mere 19% of total monthly income. Interestingly, even households with larger landholdings in Kerala (2-4 hectares) only drew 36% of their household income from farming; that figure is 47% for Tamil Nadu, 78%for Bihar, and 80% for MP. In Bihar, 86% households possessed between .01 and 1 hectare of land. Agriculture accounted for 45% of total income. In Madhya Pradesh, a far lower 52% of households have less than 1 hectare of land and agriculture accounted for 32% of their income, but for the average agricultural household in MP, income from farming constitutes a high 66% of all income. Finally, on the vexed question of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and markets, SAS data confirms a reality that both previous surveys and field research have established. At an all-India level, far from being a monopoly, APMC mandis are relatively marginal sites of sales and that the vast majority of farmers sell their agricultural produce in local market sites outside state-regulated mandis. But, here again, there are important regional and crop-specific variations in marketing conditions, including in the presence of government procurement systems across states.Just this cursory glance at headline figures highlights the complexity of the policy challenge. Agricultural productivity, market access, non-farm linkages, other employment opportunities and social protection all need attention, but the policy priorities and strategies for increasing both farm and non-farm rural incomes will all have to be state-specific.Writing in these pages days after Parliament passed the farm laws, we argued that the laws are flawed because they adopted a reform approach that seeks to centralise policy in what is an extremely diverse and context/region-specific sector. The relationship between agricultural practices, markets and State institutions is so varied across states that the average farm income in Bihar is nearly as high as that of Kerala but for very different reasons.In order to respond, we need to make two crucial shifts in our national debates. First, recognise that there is no getting around states; we have to shed the disenchantment with State failure and yet place accountability firmly on state governments. Second, we need to mobilise to invest in State capacity at the state government level. This means building up planning capacities, mechanisms for cross-state learning (a role that NITI Aayog can play very effectively), and investing in local governments. Both better coordination and decentralisation are critical to building region-specific farm and non-farm linkages and growing local economies. No amount of central legislation can resolve these critical issues. We now need to shift the terms of the policy debate and ask what will it take for states to invest in serious reforms and address the critical challenge of agriculture.Yamini Aiyar is president and chief executive, CPRMekhala Krishnamurthy is a senior fellow and director of the State Capacity initiative, CPR and associate professor, Ashoka UniversityThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/bringing-the-states-back-in-101632912863028.html
29-09-2021||Today's||Recognising the role of health in India’s social and economic growth||As India begins marking its 75th year of Independence, it is an appropriate time to take stock of the priority we have accorded to our biggest resource — human capital. Today, India has the largest population of young people; an enviable resource that can move India on to a stronger economic path. Research has highlighted the links between building human capital (through nutrition, health, and education) and growth. And yet, data on nutrition, health, and education suggests that the value of this resource has not been recognised. When we focus on health, there has been progress, but India remains well below peer countries — and where it needs to be — in terms of the well being of citizens. This stems from multiple reasons.One, it is not clear if national and political incentives to improve health have been clear to leaders. There are two aspects to this. The first is linked to the limited attention to the links between health and human capital, and growth promotion — a case that positions health not merely as a welfare issue, but as an influencer of India’s growth. The second is the limited attention to the impact of health care on poverty. Health-related expenditures are estimated to push 3.5% of the population below the poverty line; with those already below the poverty line pushed only deeper. Anirudh Krishna’s research across four continents found health-related expenses to be the prime reason for households descending into poverty and that millions of households live “one illness away” from poverty. Political incentives could also be a factor of “credit”, and in India’s federal system, a lack of clarity in “credit” from the improved health care services may further diffuse political incentives. Reforming the health care system may also be viewed as too long-term an agenda, and, therefore, not conducive to immediate political gains. Additionally, the pathways at different governance and administrative levels are often not evident, constraining political interest from relevant leaders. Two, the absence of health as an electoral demand dilutes its political salience. Data from multiple CSDS Lokniti polls has highlighted that health figures low among voter priorities. The middle-class has exited from the use of public services, and increasingly, the poor are moving in the same direction.It is, therefore, not surprising that the health sector has one of the lowest public investments at 1.3% of the Gross Domestic Product, with a disproportionate use of private services, and 64% of health care expenditure being out of pocket at the point of service. However, leaders have sought political legitimacy through attention to targeted sectors and the initiation of reforms. Regime shifts in several countries such as Turkey, Indonesia, and Brazil saw leaders prioritising health to establish credibility with the voter base and reaping electoral benefits. Well implemented reforms fuelled citizen expectations, leading to demand, and creating the space for further reform. India has not witnessed too many examples of this.State capacity is a central variable in the cycle of well-implemented reforms, tangible benefits, a social compact between the government and its citizens, and electoral gains. The absence of this confidence in capacity will likely lead to a clientelist model of delivering services, rather than a systems approach.What is the path that India should take? One, focus on a system that responds to the capacity of the State and other stakeholders in the immediate-term, while building on such capacity in the longer-term. Better responsiveness to the needs of citizens can drive trust between citizens and the State. And do this while highlighting the role of health in a nation’s journey, and building citizens’ understanding of the primacy of health and its impact on their economic status. A lot more needs to be done to identify paths to reform, through a combination of public and private provisions, with the State as a regulator. This can offer a coherent response to constraints and political benefits at the national, state and sub-state levels.Sandhya Venkateswaran is member, Lancet Citizens Commission on Reimagining India’s Health System and Centre for Social and Economic Progress.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/recognising-the-role-of-health-in-india-s-social-and-economic-growth-101632910160811.html
29-09-2021||Editorials||Rethink fuel prices — it is a negative stimulus||Petrol prices were increased by ₹0.20 per litre in Delhi on September 28. This rise in prices comes after a more than two months of stable or falling prices. Diesel prices have risen four times, by an aggregate of ₹0.95 per litre since September 24. This rise has come in the backdrop of Brent – the international benchmark of crude petroleum prices – reaching $80 per barrel after three years. Private analysts such as ones at Goldman Sachs expect petroleum prices to remain elevated. This is not good news for the Indian economy. Fuel prices are already at a record high in India. If crude prices were to rise further, oil companies are likely to raise fuel prices, and headline inflation will start rising once again. This is bound to hurt purchasing power and mass demand. It will also generate headwinds for the ongoing economic recovery. India’s fuel inflation story is not entirely a result of external factors. Fuel prices would be much lower if the tax component were to come down to pre-pandemic levels. Higher taxes on essentials such as petrol-diesel are a negative fiscal stimulus to the economy. Recently, there have been discussions on the Centre’s fiscal situation being better than expected, with higher direct tax collections. Such claims need to be seen in the context of the fiscal buffer from what are inflation-enhancing taxes on petrol-diesel. To be sure, both the Centre and the states are gaining a fiscal windfall from taxes on fuel. In the interest of a sustainable economic revival and preventing inflation and, more importantly, keeping inflation expectations from increasing further, both the Union government and the states must agree to reduce taxes. This is exactly what the Monetary Policy Committee of Reserve Bank of India had asked them to do in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/rethink-fuel-prices-it-is-a-negative-stimulus-101632912201077.html
29-09-2021||Editorials||The ideological battles||Ideological categories are hard to define in Indian politics. The traditional Left-Right binary doesn’t work. Given the inequities in Indian society, no party in India can afford to be against welfare. But broadly speaking, it is in the realm of culture, religion and nationalism that a Left-Right distinction can be made. With the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Indian politics has moved rightwards, as defined on these parameters. There is more than a streak of ultra-nationalism, which manifests itself in hostility against Pakistan; there is a streak of majoritarianism, which manifests itself in terms of exclusion of Muslims; and there is a streak of cultural assertion, with a sense of pride about what proponents of this view see as India’s essentially Hindu civilisational legacy. This is distinct from what was broadly termed Nehruvianism — nationalism was defined largely in terms of opposition to the colonial power in pre-Independence times and had a stronger internal dimension, with a focus on nation-building, post-Independence; there was a conscious attempt to create an inclusive polity, with a degree of power-sharing between Hindus and Muslims; and there was an attempt to retrieve the pluralist past, with a focus on a composite culture, rather than identify civilisational legacy with a religion.
